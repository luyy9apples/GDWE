in a better america , mitt romney would be running for president on the strength of his major achievement as governor of massachusetts a health reform that was identical in all important respects to the health reform enacted by president obama by the way , the massachusetts reform is working pretty well and has overwhelming popular support in reality , however , mr romney is doing no such thing , bitterly denouncing the supreme court for upholding the constitutionality of his own health care plan his case for becoming president relies , instead , on his claim that , having been a successful businessman , he knows how to create jobs this , in turn , means that however much the romney campaign may wish otherwise , the nature of that business career is fair game how did mr romney make all that money \? was it in ways suggesting that what was good for bain capital , the private equity firm that made him rich , would also be good for america \? and the answer is no the truth is that even if mr romney had been a classic captain of industry , a presentday andrew carnegie , his career would n't have prepared him to manage the economy a country is not a company \( despite globalization , america still sells 86 percent of what it makes to itself \) , and the tools of macroeconomic policy interest rates , tax rates , spending programs have no counterparts on a corporate organization chart did i mention that herbert hoover actually was a great businessman in the classic mold \? in any case , however , mr romney was n't that kind of businessman bain did n't build businesses it bought and sold them sometimes its takeovers led to new hiring often they led to layoffs , wage cuts and lost benefits on some occasions , bain made a profit even as its takeover target was driven out of business none of this sounds like the kind of record that should reassure american workers looking for an economic savior and then there s the business about outsourcing two weeks ago , the washington post reported that bain had invested in companies whose specialty was helping other companies move jobs overseas the romney campaign went ballistic , demanding unsuccessfully that the post retract the report on the basis of an unconvincing fact sheet consisting largely of executive testimonials what was more interesting was the campaign s insistence that the post had misled readers by failing to distinguish between offshoring moving jobs abroad and outsourcing , which simply means having an external contractor perform services that could have been performed inhouse now , if the romney campaign really believed in its own alleged freemarket principles , it would have defended the right of corporations to do whatever maximizes their profits , even if that means shipping jobs overseas instead , however , the campaign effectively conceded that offshoring is bad but insisted that outsourcing is ok as long as the contractor is another american firm that is , however , a very dubious assertion consider one of mr romney s most famous remarks corporations are people , my friend when the audience jeered , he elaborated everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people where do you think it goes \? whose pockets \? whose pockets \? people s pockets this is undoubtedly true , once you take into account the pockets of , say , partners at bain capital \( who , i hasten to add , are , indeed , people \) but one of the main points of outsourcing is to ensure that as little as possible of what corporations earn goes into the pockets of the people who actually work for those corporations why , for example , do many large companies now outsource cleaning and security to outside contractors \? surely the answer is , in large part , that outside contractors can hire cheap labor that is n't represented by the union and ca n't participate in the company health and retirement plans and , sure enough , recent academic research finds that outsourced janitors and guards receive substantially lower wages and worse benefits than their inhouse counterparts just to be clear , outsourcing is only one source of the huge disconnect between a tiny elite and ordinary american workers , a disconnect that has been growing for more than 30 years and bain , in turn , was only one player in the growth of outsourcing so mitt romney did n't personally , singlehandedly , destroy the middleclass society we used to have he was , however , an enthusiastic and very well remunerated participant in the process of destruction if bain got involved with your company , one way or another , the odds were pretty good that even if your job survived you ended up with lower pay and diminished benefits in short , what was good for bain capital definitely was n't good for america and , as i said at the beginning , the obama campaign has every right to point that out
a federal jury on tuesday cleared a citigroup executive of wrongdoing in connection with the bank s sale of risky mortgagerelated investments at the peak of the housing boom , dealing a blow to the government s effort to hold wall street executives accountable for their conduct during the financial crisis the securities and exchange commission had accused brian stoker , a former midlevel citigroup executive , with negligence related to his role in creating exotic mortgage securities known as collateralized debt obligations , or cdo s in a lawsuit filed last october , the government said that mr stoker , who prepared sales materials for cdo s , knew or should have known that he was misleading investors by not disclosing that citigroup helped select the underlying mortgage securities in the cdo and then placed a large bet against it the jury rejected the sec s case , concluding that mr stoker was not liable under the securities laws in addition to handing up its verdict , the jury also issued an unusual statement this verdict should not deter the sec from investigating the financial industry , to review current regulations and modify existing regulations as necessary , said the jury s statement , which was read aloud in the courtroom by judgejed s rakoff , who presided over the twoweek trial in federal district court in manhattan the statement appeared to echo frustration felt by many americans that wall street executives had not been held responsible for its questionable actions leading up to the financial crisis , and that financial industry reform had thus far been inadequate in his own statement , robert khuzami , the sec s director of enforcement , appeared to take the jury s message to heart we respect the jury s verdict and will continue to aggressively pursue misconduct arising out of the financial crisis , he said the sec had filed separate civil fraud charges against citigroup in connection with the cdo deal , but none of the bank s senior managers were named in the lawsuit mr stoker was the only individual citigroup executive charged in the case mr stoker s lawyer , john w keker , had depicted his client as a scapegoat for wall street wrongdoing while decrying the highstakes , high level gambling that banks had engaged in during the housing boom , mr keker urged the jury to set aside any distaste that it had for the financial industry s dubious behavior and the complex mortgage securities that it concocted he also emphasized that mr stoker was a relatively junior executive whose actions were ordered by his bosses it s not the bank or the transaction that s on trial here , mr keker said in his closing argument it s brian stoker as mr stoker prepared for trial , his former employer agreed to pay 285 million to settle a civil complaint brought by the sec related to the same deal but judge rakoff rejected that settlement calling the amount of money citigroup had agreed to pay pocket change for the bank , he said the settlement deprived the public of ever knowing the truth in a matter of obvious public importance both the sec and citigroup appealed judge rakoff s rejection of the settlement in march , a federal appeals court ruled that judge rakoff might have overstepped his authority in scuttling the deal danielle romeroapsilos , a citigroup spokeswoman , said the bank agreed with the jury s verdict and hoped to secure final judicial approval of our settlement with the sec and put this matter behind us the trial of mr stoker served as a referendum on a questionable practice that became common in the runup to the housing market s collapse selling clients complex securities tied to mortgages while simultaneously betting against those same securities as real estate prices peaked in the middle of the last decade , citigroup and other banks dived headlong into cdo s , which were bundles of mortgage securities pooled together and sold to investors who wanted to benefit from the housing boom at the same time , another group of investors had a negative view of the housing market and wanted to bet against these cdo s citigroup decided to play both sides of the trade mr stoker helped create a 1 billion cdo structure which was called class v funding iii that it sold to a group of sophisticated investors , including the bond insurer ambac financial group and koch global capital , an investment vehicle controlled by the billionaire koch brothers the sec contended that citigroup also used the deal to make a 500 million bet against the housing market citigroup secretly stuffed the cdo with toxic mortgages that the bank thought would lose value and then took the opposite view of its clients and mr stoker negligently failed to include this information in the cdo s marketing materials , the government said citigroup stacked the deck and brian stoker dealt the cards , said jeffrey infelise , a lawyer for the sec , during his closing statement lawyers for mr stoker presented evidence that citigroup s marketing materials for the cdo contained warnings that the investment was especially risky and disclosed that citigroup might bet against the security mr stoker s lawyers also argued that credit suisse , the bank that citigroup brought in to serve as a manager of the cdo , did its own homework on the underlying securities mr stoker , who in 2007 was paid about 24 million by citigroup , left the bank in 2008 a graduate of the university of virginia and harvard business school , mr stoker worked at merrill lynch and the hedge fund carlson capital before joining citigroup he lives with his wife and children in pound ridge , ny a broad smile came across mr stoker s cleancut face as the verdict was read when mr keker threw his arm around him , mr stoker appeared overcome with emotion as the jurors left the courtroom , mr stoker tried to connect with them , silently signaling his thanks with a grin and a nod of his head we 're grateful that justice was done and brian stoker can get back to his life , mr keker said this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo robert khuzami , the sec s director of enforcement , said the department would continue to pursue misconduct \( photograph by cliff owen associated press \) \( b7 \)
jerusalem on monday , in their final debate , mitt romney denounced president obama for creating tension and turmoil with israel and chided him for having skipped israel during his travels in the middle east throughout the campaign , mr romney has mr obama of having thrown allies like israel under the bus but history tells a different story indeed , whenever the united states has put serious , sustained pressure on israel s leaders from the 1950s on it has come from republican presidents , not democratic ones this was particularly true under mr obama s predecessor , george w bush just one week before the iraq war began in march 2003 , mr bush was still struggling to form a broad international coalition to oust saddam hussein unlike in the 1991 persian gulf war , russia , a permanent member of the united nations security council , decided to opt out , meaning that the united nations could not provide formal legitimacy for a war against mr hussein britain was almost alone in aligning itself with america , and prime minister tony blair s support was deemed crucial in washington just as the british parliament was about to approve the joint venture , a group of mr blair s labour party colleagues threatened to revolt , demanding israeli concessions to the palestinians in exchange for their support for the iraq invasion this demand could have scuttled the war effort , and there was only one way that british support could be maintained mr bush would have to declare that the road map for middle east peace , a proposal drafted early in his administration , was the formal policy of the united states israel s prime minister at the time , ariel sharon , had been vehemently opposed to the road map , which contained several red lines that he refused to accept , including that the future status of jerusalem would be determined by a negotiated resolution taking into account the political and religious concerns of both sides this wording implied a possible end to israel s sovereignty over all of jerusalem , which has been under israeli control since 1967 on march 13 , 2003 , senior israeli officials were summarily informed that the united states would publicly adopt the draft road map as its policy washington made it clear to us that on the eve of a war , israel was expected to refrain from criticizing the american policy and also to ensure that its sympathizers got the message the united states insisted that the road map be approved without any changes , saying israel s concerns would be at a long and tense cabinet debate i attended in may 2003 , mr sharon reluctantly asked his ministers to accept washington s demand benjamin netanyahu , then the finance minister , disagreed , and he abstained during the vote on the cabinet resolution , which eventually passed from that point on , the road map , including the language on jerusalem , became the policy bible for america , russia , the european union and the united nations not only was israel strongarmed by a republican president , but it was also compelled to simply acquiesce and swallow the bitterest of pills three years later , the bush administration again pressured israel into supporting a policy that ran counter to its interests in early 2006 , the terrorist group hamas ran candidates in the palestinian legislative elections israel had been adamant that no leader could campaign with a gun in his belt the palestinian party fatah opposed hamas s participation , too but the white house would have none of this it pushed fatah to allow hamas candidates to run , and pressured israel into allowing voting for hamas even in parts of east jerusalem after hamas won a clear majority , washington sought to train fatah forces to crush it militarily in the gaza strip but hamas preempted this scheme by taking control of gaza in 2007 , and the palestinians have been ideologically and territorially divided ever since despite the republican party s shrill campaign rhetoric on israel , no democratic president has ever strongarmed israel on any key national security issue in the 1956 suez crisis , it was a republican , dwight d eisenhower , who joined the soviet union in forcing israel s founding father , david bengurion , to withdraw from the sinai peninsula after a joint israelibritishfrench attack on egypt in 1991 , when iraqi scud missiles rained down on tel aviv , the administration of the first president bush urged israel not to strike back so as to preserve the coalition of arab states fighting iraq prime minister yitzhak shamir resisted his security chiefs' recommendation to retaliate and bowed to american demands as his citizens reached for their gas masks after the war , mr shamir agreed to go to madrid for a middle east peace conference set up by secretary of state james a baker iii fearful that mr shamir would be intransigent at the negotiating table , the white house pressured him by in loan guarantees to israel , causing us serious economic problems the eventual result was mr shamir s political downfall the man who had saved mr bush s grand coalition against saddam hussein in 1991 was thrown under the bus in all of these instances , a republican white house acted in a cold and determined manner , with no regard for israel s national pride , strategic interests or sensitivities that s food for thought in

aboard the fishing vessel al mulahi , in the gulf of oman senior iranian military officials this week bluntly warned an american aircraft carrier that it would confront the full force of the iranian military if it tried to reenter the persian gulf on friday , fazel ur rehman , a 28yearold iranian fisherman , had a warmer greeting for the carrier task force it is like you were sent by god , said mr rehman , huddled under a blanket in this vessel s stern every night we prayed for god to rescue us and now you are here in a naval action that mixed diplomacy , drama and middle eastern politics , the aircraft carrier john c stennis broke up a highseas pirate attack on a cargo ship in the gulf of oman , then sailors from an american destroyer boarded the ' mother ship and freed 13 iranian hostages who had been held captive there for more than a month the rapidly unfolding events began thursday morning when the pirates attacked a bahamianflagged ship , the motor vessel sunshine , unaware that the stennis was steaming less than eight miles away it ended friday with the tables fully turned the captured somali pirates , 15 in all , were brought aboard the uss kidd , an american destroyer traveling with the stennis they were then shuttled by helicopter to the aircraft carrier and locked up in its brig this fishing vessel and its crew , provided fuel and food by the navy , then set sail for its home port of chah bahar ,  the rescue , 210 miles off the coast of iran , occurred against a tense political backdrop on tuesday the iranian defense minister and a brigadier general threatened the stennis with attack if it sought to return to the persian gulf , which it had left roughly a week before the warning set up fears of a confrontation over the vital shipping lanes of the strait of hormuz none of that tension was evident at sea the sunshine , a 583foot cargo ship carrying bulk cargo from calais , france , to bandar abbas , iran , continued its journey the freed hostages , iranian citizens , greeted the american sailors with wideeyed relief mahmed younes , 28 , the fishing vessel s captain , said he and his crew had been captured roughly 45 days ago by pirates in a skiff , who boarded their 82foot dhow and forced it to an anchorage in the northern somali port of xaafuun there , the pirates took on provisions and more gunmen in late december the pirates , using their hostages to run the dhow , set back out to sea , hunting for a tanker or large cargo ship to capture and hold for ransom for several days , al mulahi roamed the gulf of oman , unmolested under its iranian flag , the pirates and former hostages said they saw several ships but the pirates' leader , bashir bhotan , 32 , did not think any of them would command a high ransom they let them pass the pirates told us , if you get us a good ship , we will let you go free , ' captain younes said we told them , how can we get you a ship \? we are fishermen , not hunters' on thursday morning , six of the pirates set out in a fiberglass skiff and found their quarry the sunshine , 100 miles from the shore of oman one of the pirates , mohammed mahmoud , 33 , later said this was the type of vessel they would hope might fetch a ransom of several million dollars brandishing a rocketpropelled grenade and several kalashnikov rifles , they rushed alongside , threw a grappling hook and tried to lash a ladder to the sunshine s side they hoped to scale the gunwales and seize the bridge their plans unraveled immediately as the sunshine radioed for help , and tried to deter the boarding by spraying the pirates with fire hoses , the pirates were unable to board our ladder broke , mr mahmoud said then an american helicopter appeared neither the pirates nor the crew of the sunshine had known it , but three navy ships the stennis the usns rainier , a supply ship and the uss mobile bay , a guidedmissile cruiser were steaming in formation a few miles away the carrier was taking on provisions from the rainier and had several helicopters in the air when the sunshine radioed its distress call aboard the carrier , rear adm craig s faller , who commands the carrier strike group , looked at the chart and radar images of the sunshine s location with something like disbelief the sunshine and the stennis were only a few miles apart these might be the dumbest pirates ever , he said he ordered a helicopter and the cruiser toward the sunshine and other helicopters to investigate the radar images of other ships in the area , to search for the skiff s possible mother ship seeing the approaching aircraft , the pirates let the sunshine pull away and tossed their weapons over the side , they said aboard the carrier , the officers watched a video feed from the helicopter , showing the six men in tshirts and tank tops in a small white boat , bobbing on the waves for a few minutes the somalis seemed unsure what to do then they put their hands atop their heads they are surrendering , they are surrendering , said capt todd w malloy , the carrier strike group s chief of staff a boarding team from the mobile bay soon approached in an inflatable boat the pirates told them they were at sea for fun , the sailors said there were no weapons on board and the sunshine had steamed away the mobile bay s sailors began to take the pirates' fingerprints and photographs for a biometric database meanwhile , two other navy helicopters had made four passes by al mulahi the fishing vessel was about 30 miles away and carried a skiff identical to the pirate s skiff on the dhow s deck but al mulahi was flying an iranian flag , which made boarding the vessel politically delicate there were no pirates visible on board the navy quickly made a plan the sailors on the boarding team gave the pirates oranges and water and set them free but a helicopter from the mobile bay lingered outside of eyesight and followed the skiff s movements with longrange optics the skiff headed toward the iranian dhow the kidd , a guidedmissile destroyer serving as the command ship for combined task force 151 , an international counterpiracy team off the coast of africa , steamed toward the dhow from 120 miles away several hours later , after the pirates boarded the dhow , the kidd approached and called al mulahi on a bridgetobridge radio the ship asked if the dhow had any foreigners aboard the dhow answered that it did not while doing surveillance aerially , we had seen that there were middle easterners aboard and somalis , and that socially they were not intermingling , said cmdr jennifer ellinger , the top officer on the kidd we could also see that some of the clothing hanging on board was somali a brief standoff ensued , as the ship and dhow bobbed alongside each other at sea the somalis were hiding and forcing the iranian captain , a hostage , to speak to the american ship the ship had brought many of its crew who spoke different languages onto the bridge one of the sailors , chief petty officer jagdeep sidhu , speaks english , punjabi , urdu and hindi al mulahi is from eastern iran , near pakistan , where many residents speak urdu he heard captain younes use an urdu phrase , and was given the radio to hail him at first he was hesitant to answer because he was afraid , chief sidhu said but the somalis could not understand urdu , and he was able finally to muster enough courage and say we need help please help' with the dhow s request , the political uncertainties of boarding an iranianflagged vessel were lifted , because the ship s master had asked for help rear adm kaleem shaukat , the pakistani commanding combined task force 151 , gave permission , and late in the afternoon two inflatable boats from the kidd ferried armed sailors to al mulahi they climbed aboard and discovered six somalis hiding near the bow and nine more inside a cargo space the somalis did not resist , and were searched and moved to the bow , where they were held overnight a search of the dhow found four assault rifles and ammunition several of the somalis , slumped with resignation , discussed their lives as pirates with a reporter and photographer traveling with the boarding team they said they knew the risks of being caught , but had been willing to try nonetheless mr mahmoud said he had three wives and seven children to feed in we have no jobs , he said that s the reason to go to sea our country has a civil war , and i do n't have skills he said this had been his maiden voyage , a claim that could not be independently verified he said they had set sail with a rifle for every man and a single rocketpropelled grenade with 10 rockets , but , when the navy approached from multiple directions , we put them in the sea as he sat smoking a cigarette a large liquid natural gas tanker steamed by on the horizon ahhh , he said lng he looked at it longingly before we would have liked to catch that ship , he said then he looked at the armed sailors standing about five yards away he exhaled smoke and shook his head not now , he said on friday morning , mr bhotan , the leader of the pirate crew , looked dejectedly as his former charges were ferried away on inflatable boats to the kidd , where they were showered , dressed in white suits and flexcuffed before being flown to the carrier al mulahi , soon to be given fresh fuel from the kidd for the journey home , was about to sail back to iran mr bhotan said he did not know what would happen to him i am a prisoner , he said
cincinnati the enjoyed this city so much that they decided to stay an extra night when the last of the champagne had been sprayed after their 64 win thursday their third consecutive victory here , which capped a memorable comeback from a twogamestonone deficit the team did not immediately fly back to the west coast the giants spent the night and most of the next day here they were not conquerors or occupiers their presence was simply a matter of logistics when jayson werth hit a gameending home run in the ninth inning several hours after the giants' win , it forced a game 5 between the nationals and the st louis cardinals on friday night in washington it also kept san francisco s national league championship series opponent , as well as the location of sunday s scheduled game 1 , a mystery until the early hours of saturday morning the nationals were the nl s top seed , and they would have hosted game 1 of the nlcs on sunday night in washington if they had won but the wildcard cardinals pulled out a wild victory in the ni nth inning , allowing the giants to open the series at home at att park since teams are also obligated to participate in a workout day before each playoff series , scheduled for saturday in the nlcs , a win by the nationals would have forced the giants into two crosscountry flights if they had returned to san francisco rather than risk thousands of miles in excessive air travel , the giants chose to spend another night in cincinnati , a strange twist given the fact they had just ousted the 99win reds from the playoffs in such heartbreaking fashion for the home team while sports radio talk shows dissected the reds' collapse friday morning , the giants were still in town a team spokesman said many players went out to dinner thursday night and planned to watch the beginning of game 5 between washington and st louis at the team s downtown hotel the giants headed to the airport during the final stages of the game when they found out who the winner was , they knew they were flying back home they left cincinnati with fond memories it was here that they became the first major league team to take a bestoffive series by winning the final three games on the road
to win this award , a manager typically must do one of the following win a lot more games than people expected \( like the padres bud black in 2010 \) , overcome an unforeseen obstacle \( like the angels mike scioscia in 2009 , after the death of pitcher nick adenhart \) or win in historic fashion \( like the mariners lou piniella in 2001 , when his team won 116 games \) the national league winner will not easily fit into any of those models none of the division leaders washington , cincinnati and san francisco are terribly surprising all three firstplace managers the nationals davey johnson , the reds dusty baker and the giants bruce bochy overcame the absence of significant players and no team has won a historic number of games the honor , this time , should go to atlanta s fredi gonzalez , who fumbled away a playoff spot last september but seems to have learned from his mistakes gonzalez has managed his bullpen much better this season , and he never allowed last september s collapse to bleed into this season other teams that blew big september leads like the 1964 phillies , the 1978 red sox , the 1995 angels , the 2007 mets and the 2011 red sox could not recover the next year the braves have , and gonzalez deserves recognition strong candidates abound in the american league , but baltimore s buck showalter gets the edge over oakland s bob melvin and the chicago white sox robin ventura showalter has been masterly in weaving together a continually changing roster and has revitalized the culture of a team that was coming off 14 consecutive losing seasons , which was the longest streak in the al

there s a squabble in the presidential campaign over whether mitt romney said the country needs fewer police officers , firefighters and teachers here s the he said , he said last week , during a campaign speech , mr romney said the president wants another stimulus , he wants to hire more government workers he says we need more firemen , more policemen , more teachers did he not get the message of wisconsin \? the american people did it s time for us to cut back on government and help the american people naturally the obama campaign jumped all over this , releasing the following statement mitt romney shockingly promised to cut jobs for firefighters , police , and teachers if elected as president obama urges congress to pass his plan to put cops , firefighters , teachers , and construction workers back to work after they left as many as 1 million jobs from his plan on the table mitt romney has decided we need less jobs for middle class americans , not more that s the message he received this week then , earlier today , mr romney went on fox and tried to etch a sketch his gaffe away brian kilmeade the president says you want to cut firefighters and teachers , that you don t understand what s going on in these communities what do you say to that , governor \? mitt romney that s a very strange accusation of course , teachers and firemen and policemen are hired at the local level and also by states the federal government doesn t pay for teachers , firefighters or policemen so obviously , that s completely absurd he s got a new idea , though , and that is to have another stimulus and to have the federal government send money to try and bail out cities and states it didn t work the first time it certainly wouldn t work the second time confused \? i think that s probably the intended effect but let me try to cut through the clutter a bit , because the backandforth actually turns on something important obviously , mr obama can t hire firefighters personally \( even if he wants to \) , and mr romney can t fire them \( even though he likes firing people \) but cuts in government aid to states and cities , which mr romney advocates at every chance he gets , mean less money for , you got it , teachers , firefighters and police officers conversely , federal stimulus programs can help local governments hire more people the rightwing has , of late , been amplifying its attacks on publicsector employees as overpaid , or slothful , or somehow responsible for the economic crisis that s what mr romney meant , i suppose , by the message of wisconsin  that s just propaganda arguably public sector union pensions are unsustainable in many places , but government employees are hardly living it up at the taxpayers expense as ben polak and peter schott wrote on the economix blog yesterday , the recovery in privatesector employment , once it finally started , has not been particularly slow by recent historical standards whereas since the latest recession began , local government employment has fallen by 3 percent , and is still falling underlying mr romney s comments is the assumption that government employment is not really employment at all , and also that publicsector workers are somehow in a different category from all other taxpayers how else to explain his statement that spending cuts , which result in teacher layoffs , will help the american people \? but really none of this is terribly surprising let s keep in mind that this is the same candidate who once said he was not concerned about the very poor
denver and confronted what one feared and the other hoped was an altered campaign on thursday , pounding new urgency into what was shaping up as a wideopen final sprint to election day a day after the first debate , in which mr obama was almost universally judged to have underperformed and mr romney to have seized his opportunity , the president resolved to do what he did not do the night before he went straight at the challenger , arguing forcefully that mr romney s moderate words masked extreme conservative policies the man onstage last night , he does not want to be held accountable for the real mitt romney s decisions and what he s been saying for the last year , the president said at a rally , looking more energetic than he was at his lectern wednesday night mr romney s senior aides warned staff members and donors that the race was hardly won but they said the debate reversed the sagging morale of volunteers and contributors and dispelled what had been a growing notion that the race was slipping away from mr romney they said it prompted undecided voters to give mr romney a second look , as his pollster neil newhouse put it and they said it showed that mr romney could win a headtohead argument with mr obama on the economy , his campaign s underlying strategy all along with roughly a month left , both sides were looking intently ahead to friday morning , when the government releases unemployment and job creation numbers for september , the next opportunity for one of the candidates to try to seize momentum for the final month reflecting the new intensity of the postdebate landscape , both sides recalibrated their strategies , escalated their advertising campaigns in swing states , and drew huge crowds for rallies greeted by an estimated 10 , 000 people in fishersville , va , mr romney said , what you did n't hear last night from the president is why it is the next four years are possibly going to be better than the last four years after leaving denver , mr obama went to madison , wis , where he was met by an estimated crowd of 30 , 000 , the biggest of the campaign so far in a display of strength intended to offset democratic nervousness , mr obama s campaign signaled it had raised well over 114 million in september , its biggest onemonth haul this year and a sum that all but ensures its ability to match or exceed advertising and getoutthevote spending by mr romney and his allies but that did not overcome the rain of questions about how it came to be that the president delivered such a listless showing mr obama s aides said he knew he had had a bad night as soon as he came off the stage at the university of denver i'm sure he drew some lessons from it , said david axelrod , the president s senior adviser advisers , many of whom viewed him as distracted and nervous from the beginning , said the president had approached the debate practice sessions without enough urgency and focus he has told friends that he respected mr romney s intellect , but had come to view his rival as a less formidable adversary as he learned more about him from reading research books and watching his campaign hours before the debate , advisers said they were worried that during his preparation sessions in a financially distressed resort in nevada he was frequently interrupted by his presidential duties , and they indicated that they were nervous that he was underprepared what seemed like an exercise in lowering expectations appeared to be reality at the end of the debate night mr axelrod said the president was prepared to talk about what was viewed as mr obama s biggest omission on wednesday , mr romney s secretly recorded comments at a closeddoor fundraising event about the 47 percent of americans he described as too reliant on government while mr axelrod said mr obama simply never found an opportunity , another aide offered another suggestion to have done so would have given mr romney an opening to undo the political damage of the remarks with a certain , planned answer before a huge television audience of 672 million in an interview with sean hannity of fox news late thursday , mr romney said he would have said , i said something that s just completely wrong he had previously stood by the substance of the remarks , which he said were stated inelegantly in general , advisers suggested that mr obama had prepared for a different mitt romney , one who had promoted a conservative message to the republican base this year and chosen a running mate with a plan to cut deeply into government spending instead , he was confronted by a candidate using a softer tone , promising that he would provide plenty of money for education and saying that his tax plan would not reduce the share of taxes paid by the wealthy some of the weaknesses in the president s performance , advisers said , were the result of a strategy of not turning off the narrow slice of swing voters , who are often repelled by personal confrontations but none of it explained mr obama s failure at times to defend himself against mr romney s attacks , or why mr obama said , on , we 've got a somewhat similar position a statement that sent up a cheer at mr romney s campaign headquarters in boston and bewildered mr obama s advisers mr romney s aides said they believed that the issue of social security which mr romney s running mate , representative paul d ryan of wisconsin , has called for overhauling to include private investment accounts had been taken off the table for democratic candidates in the final month of the debate and could not be effectively used as a weapon against republicans both sides agreed that the evening was likely to rejuvenate mr romney s fundraising and send wealthy donors back to the that have been supporting mr romney all year before wednesday the campaigns were watching carefully for signs that the big money would move into house and senate races as some lost confidence in mr romney s chances to win aides said they were mostly relieved that mr romney could get back on a solid , offensive footing as he makes a case against mr obama and , perhaps more vitally , for himself romney advisers acknowledged that he was , as one said , refocusing the debate on certain components of his record for a broader fall audience his conservative supporters indicated they were willing to abide by that approach , for now there was nothing there to give us great concern , chris chocola , president of the club for growth , the influential conservative group , said of mr romney s debate rhetoric but we 'll be watching what he does if he becomes the president mr obama s aides said if there was one silver lining in the night it was that they could seize on what they called inconsistencies between mr romney s stances during the primaries and those of this late campaign period mr obama s campaign made an early decision , however , to campaign against mr romney as a conservative , wary that attacking him as equivocal would create an impression with more centrist independent voters that he did not truly hold the rightleaning positions he espoused during the primaries so several officials suggested they would approach his new tone by suggesting he was not being honest about his plans he may win the oscar for his performance last night , but he s not going to win the presidency , mr axelrod said but , he conceded , what mr obama really needs to do is deliver a better debate effort when the two meet next , on oct 16 , at hofstra university in new york it s like a playoff in sports , he said you evaluate after every contest and make adjustments

location since 2004 , have been lame ducks and losers in largely indifferent new jersey , waiting through lawsuits , construction delays and the worst real estate crash in decades for the opportunity to finally unpack in new york city their intended home at birth in 1967 few took them seriously , and many had good reason to believe that their characteristic bad karma would follow them to brooklyn , if they ever made it lo and behold , their dream of laying roots in the masstransitrich is happening , and the odds that the nets will finally find requited love have improved the arena is all but built the star point guard is staying and the nets the first major professional sports team to call brooklyn home since the dodgers , and the first to hit the city in 50 years might actually be capable of taking the borough , if not yet the city , by storm they 've got a squad now they 've got a squad , said james robinson , 25 , who works in a sneaker store not far from the arena , his tone suggesting amazement a week ago they had no team now they 've got a team and an address at last perhaps worthy of a good nets team in jersey , they were outsiders looking in , the brooklynbornandbred chris mullin said of the nets when you 're in the city , you 're a destination throughout their troubled history in the national basketball association the team did win two championships in the old american basketball association the nets have been known more for losing stars than for cultivating or keeping them to afford the payments required to join the nba in 1976 and compete in knicks territory , they sold julius erving , a future hall of famer , to the philadelphia 76ers jason kidd led the nets to successive nba finals in 2002 and 2003 and later was traded to dallas but when on tuesday implied that he would to lead them into brooklyn for the 201213 season on the heels of it was as if the franchise had washed itself clean of its troubled past while crossing the hudson upon buying the team in 2010 from the real estate developer bruce c ratner and partnering with him in building barclays center , , a russian billionaire , promised to make the nets a champion within five years they are not at that level yet , though hopes remain of trading for orlando s disgruntled center , dwight howard , who has asked for a trade to brooklyn still , the union of williams and johnson gives the nets a formidable backcourt in an increasingly guarddriven league the nets have also fortified their roster by and and herzegovina , one of the top scorers in europe they will match any offer for center brook lopez , a restricted free agent , who is the primary chip in their longshot bid for howard but it was williams s decision to stay after the nets banked their foreseeable future on him that instantly established elusive franchise legitimacy it was also a vindicating outcome for the team s general manager , billy king , who has at least made the nets a strong playoff contender for their debut in kings county today he s a genius , but last week a lot of us were calling him something else , said robert liff , a longtime nets seasonticket holder , referring to the national narrative that williams would stay only if the nets could acquire howard liff , 53 , is that rarest of new jersey nets fans \( a relative rarity in itself \) in that he has renewed his two tickets for next season in brooklyn with a business that he operates from home in manalapan , nj , he is planning to drive to a commuter train station in new jersey and take the subway from new york s pennsylvania station into brooklyn for nets home games he is far from bitter about the nets' move , having grown up in brooklyn , and he believes the borough and surrounding areas will embrace the team far more than any other home it has had they never drew in jersey , liff said i actually was waiting for the move because i knew they would finally spend the money to get the athletes while liff s commute to watch the revitalized nets became longer and more expensive , herb turetzky s will be the most heartening of his startlingly long tenure as the nets' official scorer dating to their debut in 1967 in teaneck as the new jersey americans at the time , turetzky lived in the brownsville section of brooklyn and helped max zaslofsky , the nets' first coach and general manager , on an amateur team with the americans aiming to play at the 69th regiment armory in manhattan , turetzky accepted zaslofsky s offer to be their official scorer and figured he would travel to games by subway but the knicks , fearing competition from the new league , blocked the site the team played one season in teaneck and moved to commack on long island it was on the way to a game on nov 3 , 1968 , that turetzky s life changed inalterably in the rain , he lost control of his car and slammed into another he spent six weeks in a coma , with neuromuscular damage to both legs disability notwithstanding , he has for 45 years driven to places like piscataway , nj , and most recently newark , hoping since 2004 to hang on for brooklyn turetzky , who lives in bayside , queens , is going home with the team and is planning to wear a tuxedo on opening night for me , it 'll be like a bar mitzvah or coronation , he said i think with this team we 'll pack the place while seasonticket sales have reportedly been moving fast since the roster moves , strict nets fans were not out in abundance wednesday at the fulton mall in downtown brooklyn jasper ferguson , 28 , who lives in brooklyn and works in a factory in queens , remains a stalwart knicks fan but he seemed open to persuasion they look like they could do something , he said of the nets i 've been waiting for it i 've been hearing about it for the longest time but they 've got to win something mullin , who was inducted into the basketball hall of fame last year , is not surprised by ferguson s high bar but he said the climate is different than when we were kids when we grew up rooting for the knicks , walt frazier and willis reed were on the team for 10 years now it s different a lot more turnover , guys come and go especially with young fans , one or two new players can change everything though the borough has long been a knicks stronghold , mullin said that he thought many would switch sides once they saw brooklyn across the chests of players like williams and johnson and that the young working professionals filling the gentrified neighborhoods around barclays center would soon be nets fans in some ways , loyalty is even greater to brooklyn than it is to new york , mullin said but it s going to be a great rivalry you 've got two teams with a lot of money that wo n't back down to that end , in response to the williams deal , the knicks were said to be working hard wednesday to acquire steve nash \( although it was later reported that he was headed to the los angeles lakers \) in other words , the presence of the brooklyn nets has been felt , and the battle for new york has begun
the political maps are out , finally , and this is as good as it gets for texas republicans unless they can figure out how to win votes from black and hispanic voters for the democrats , this is probably the bottom they have to find more voters or be forced to continue relying on the ethnicity of their voters and the protections that come with that ethnicity to protect the seats they still have the republicans have snapped up everything not nailed down by the federal  redistricting nods to fairness but is actually about power it allows a republican legislature , for instance , to put a dog collar and a short leash on democratic voters in austin travis county is one of just a few texas counties that voted for barack obama for president in the new congressional maps , five districts reach into the county \( none is based there \) , and only one is likely to produce a democratic representative as it stands , the county would be represented by two people from austin , one from san antonio , one from georgetown \( a suburb \) and one from bryan one of the austin residents , lloyd doggett , an incumbent democrat , will face tough opposition from san antonio the other , michael mccaul , an incumbent republican , has a district that runs east to houston it s safe to say lawmakers were n't trying to empower the locals it makes you wonder why the city of austin rewards them with free airport parking lawmakers do n't have to be fair if they did , the court would have repaired the damage it s just that the law does n't protect geography as carefully as it protects minorities in travis county , the minority populations are too scattered to draw a congressional district protected by the voting rights act the seat most likely to elect a democrat stretches into central san antonio , and it is uncertain whether mr doggett can prevail over someone from san antonio his district was n't protected the remaining democratic seats in the state result from legal protections for minority groups that happen to vote for democrats the republicans do n't have the legal ability to take more ground the democrats do n't have the political juice to win anything not legally protected maps are n't everything using the current maps , the republicans got 101 seats in the texas house using the same maps two years earlier , they got only 76 but maps mean a lot the partisan compositions of the texas senate and of the state s congressional delegation have changed only marginally between redistricting episodes over the last 20 years if you want change in those places , the most effective strategy is to change the maps the redistricting fights have been about the clout of minority voters virtually every legal skirmish was over a district that either is , or arguably should be , one in which minority voters have the power to decide the winners with few exceptions , the decision to create or protect a minority district was also a decision about whether it would elect a republican or a democrat talk about walking on eggshells every conversation or argument about the maps teeters between politics and race this year s elections will clear up the remaining questions mr doggett is the last anglo democrat in the congressional delegation who was n't elected in a minority opportunity district if he wins reelection , it will be in a latino district \( representative gene green , democrat of houston , also an anglo , has represented a latino district for years \) the only genuine swing district on the congressional map is district 23 , where representative francisco canseco , republican of san antonio , will face the winner of a democratic primary that could include former united states representative ciro rodriguez , whom mr canseco beat in 2010 that s a test of whether republicans can hold a minority district united states representative blake farenthold , republican of corpus christi , got a district with a republican voting history but where a majority of the voters are either black or latino that s another political test tube republicans ca n't increase their already stout majorities without winning minority votes or getting rid of the law that protects minority voters and democrats have to figure out a way to win in districts drawn by the opposition
last friday , the new yorker s culture desk blog announced a contest asking readers to nominate the word that most urgently needs to be eliminated from the english language and now , the results are in for the next week , no one who speaks english or at least writes it on the magazine s web site will be allowed to describe someone else as wearing slacks while the word will not be formally banned from the print magazine , ben greenman , the contest s organizer , wrote on monday , there will also be a deadtree version of the prize a member of the magazine s esteemed copy department will write the word on a piece of paper , crumple it up and toss it in the garbage the word purge , the first installment of a weekly twitterbased contest called questioningly , prompted thousands of responses some contestants nominated politically charged or conceptual entries like war , hate , obama , and tebow others tried to take down warhorses like awesome , epic , fecund , irregardless , literally and actually a word mr greenman defended on rhythmic grounds , declaring it actually useful as a useless dactyl still others took aim at the new yorker s own famously \( a word marked for death by some editors at this publication \) quirky stylebook at atlanticwire , jen doll suggested getting rid of fussy new yorkerisms like focussing , spectre , vender , or perhaps even the contest s name , questioningly \( though surely none are as bad as the selfconscious unselfconscious \? \) the popular favorite , mr greenman wrote , was moist , which had previously attracted the murderous attentions of a 3 , 000member facebook group called i hate the word moist ! as well as of ben zimmer of the visualthesauruscom \( a man recently seen defending the honor of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious , which has still not been welcomed into the merriamwebster dictionary \) moist showed up in just under a tenth of the ballots , mr greenman said in an email impacted was also big , as was literally , and words surged at different times and then fell back into the pack moist was the mitt romney of this contest but in the end , backroom dealing led to the victory for slacks , which also , as it turns out , carries a political charge the word s last appearance in the new yorker , as far as this writer could ascertain , came in ariel levy s profile of callista gingrich , in which the aspiring first lady s mother , bernita bisek , was described by one neighbor as probably the last woman to wear slacks in public in our town mr greenman , in his email message , cited the creepycrawly feeling evoked by the word full disclosure it has appeared 87 times in the new york times in the past year , according to a database search \) but said that if it was entirely up to him he d get rid of deliciate , a mostly obsolete word meaning to revel or delight it s way too close to delicate , and there are plenty of words that do what it does , he said if person uses that word , he or she is only looking for trouble
east rutherford , nj the notion that coaches in the nfl have job security has always been something of a misconception positions are few expectations are high careers are short and , generally , one can expect the current prevailing sentiment about a coach s performance whatever that sentiment might be to have all the staying power of rent money is only the latest example over the last month , he has been and , his r sum laid bare for examination by fans and talkshow hosts and the news media the scrutiny , at times , has bordered on hysterical , which makes it not all that different from any other moment during coughlin s tenure such is life in new york show business , though , a fact that coughlin , 65 , has learned well over the past eight years he knows that trying to keep up with the varying temperature changes of a coach s hot seat is an exercise in futility that was why , late sunday after the giants beat the dallas cowboys , he demurred when asked if he took any personal satisfaction in the giants' latest nfc east title it is not a time for reflection , he said when pressed a second time by a reporter , who then laid out all the reasons why coughlin might be pleased , he almost scoffed thank you for recapping , he said it was a telling exchange , a sliver of window into the vault surrounding coughlin s psyche for although coughlin may refuse to acknowledge the personal significance of the coda to the giants' regular season , that does not mean that none exists it must and it does the giants' secondhalf swoons under coughlin have been well chronicled , and after the giants lost their fourth game in a row on dec 4 , there was little reason to think this season would be any different all the ingredients were there the giants had injuries they had inconsistency as the final month played out , there was even a hint of lockerroom unrest \( though , to be fair , it was always more a passing head cold than the fullon flu that appears to have leveled the jets \) still , coughlin weathered it one of the most common criticisms leveled at him is that as the oldest coach in the nfl , he has lost the ability to relate to players that he cannot connect , on a visceral level , with the young behemoths who might see him as less an authority figure and more as a disconnected grandpa struggling to figure out when these dang dvds replaced good oldfashioned 8millimeter game film but it has not happened the giants players still respond to coughlin s techniques and often find a more personal connection with him despite the knowledge that he is , in fact , a grandfather \( 10 times over \) even who a year ago essentially made the argument in a radio interview that coughlin was living in the past acknowledged as much , praising coughlin for steadying the giants before their season toppled over rolle added that hearing speculation about coughlin s job status inspired the players because of their devotion to him he s the boss man and we are his soldiers , rolle told reporters monday i have many different reasons why i play the game as hard as i do , and i 'll be honest to say , one of them is coach coughlin he added , i know i'm not the only one feeling this way given that coughlin and rolle who called himself stubborn and not an easy cookie have butted heads more than once , rolle s words had gravity coughlin s fanatical attention to detail \( the clocks at the giants' training center are set five minutes fast \) and unyielding discipline \( players who miss curfew are benched \) have become famous around the league , but starting in 2007 , coughlin made a conscious effort to soften himself a bit around the edges this year , he somewhat grudgingly modified his rigorous training camp schedule to allow for rust caused by the lockout he did not shout down his more outspoken charges , like rolle and brandon jacobs , when they vented in the news media he smiled more he also showed a selfdeprecating side after being knocked down by a pile of players on the sideline during the victory over the jets , coughlin limped into the locker room and told the players he would be in for treatment right along with them the next afternoon no toughness , no championship , several players said , repeating a wellworn piece of coughlin hickory , and the coach laughed along with them ultimately , it is impossible to know the exact amount of credit coughlin deserves for the fact that giants are playing some of their best football of the season at the most important time all that can be known for sure is that they are the offense , which averaged 246 points per game all season , scored 60 over the last two games the defense , which allowed 24 points a game , yielded only 28 combined to the jets and the cowboys coughlin is the leader , which means in this city and this league he must wear an everchanging label two weeks ago , he was in trouble , seen by many as a coaching geriatric by tuesday , he was a genius again , his job security such as it is seemingly assured for another year , no matter the result of sunday s wildcardround game against the atlanta falcons if that seems maddening and circular , it is because it is but it is also reality that was why coughlin shrugged off the feelgood questions sunday night and why he did it again monday , quickly pivoting the attention back to his players and to what they have accomplished it is his way and always will be , even now , when the glow from sunday s win is still warm coughlin will not linger , not even for a moment he has been around he knows better
east rutherford , nj as the giants flew home from green bay last sunday night , defensive end dave tollefson turned to a teammate and asked a simple but stumping question when s the last time we won a challenge \? that would be , well a long time ago before the season , had one of the more successful records \( 476 percent \) on replay challenges among nfl coaches not this season his success rate fell to 30 percent we must be , what , 0 for 100 by now \? coughlin said earlier this week not quite , but it might feel like that the giants have lost their last eight challenges , including a particularly notable call in their victory over the packers , which vaulted them into sunday s nfc championship game against the 49ers in san francisco so when was the last time coughlin and the giants won a challenge \? week 2 , in the third quarter of their victory over the st louis rams what s the law of averages \? said tollefson , who likened challenges to a game of roulette maybe one of these days he 'll win 13 or 14 in a row there is perhaps no real rhyme or reason why coughlin has recently had such little success many factors contribute to why and when he will pull that red challenge flag from inside his sock coughlin said the giants have a coordinated sequence for making such determinations although he would not disclose details of the process , he communicates with assistant coaches in the press box and gazes at the large video scoreboards to determine whether to challenge a play historically , the giants have done well by coughlin s method only once in coughlin s seven seasons before this one had his challenge success rate been lower than 40 percent in 2008 , he was successful 75 percent of the time this season has been different coughlin was only 3 of 10 and was 01 in the playoffs after a by packers receiver greg jennings with the giants leading the packers , 103 , in the first quarter , safety deon grant appeared to knock the ball loose from jennings before jennings \( and , specifically , his left calf \) made contact with the grass one official ruled it a fumble , but was overruled by another after coughlin challenged the call , the referee bill levy took a look at the replay and announced there was no indisputable visual evidence to overturn the call of no fumble the packers scored a touchdown four plays later i felt the video was conclusive , said mike pereira , the former vice president of nfl officiating who now works as an analyst for fox sports i thought it should have been reversed to a fumble and the giants should 've gotten the ball at the spot of recovery while working for the league , pereira used to interact with coughlin at owners' meetings and during a yearly visit to the team s facility to discuss rules and rule changes coughlin s famous attention to detail carried over into inquiries about challenges tom is a student in everything he does , pereira said probably some coaches study replay and put a lot more effort into it than others i 've always felt that about tom but there is still the hardtoaccountfor element of luck \( or lack thereof \) that can come into play with challenges it is also sometimes easier for coaches to correctly call for challenges while playing games at their home stadiums , where video operators might be more likely to show \( or to not show \) replays based on whether they could serve to help their team home or away day or night offense or defense none of it has mattered for the giants this season coughlin has simply not been able to get the calls to go his way the season started promisingly enough , with coughlin winning his first three challenges the giants have since watched officials uphold rulings against a giants touchdown catch \( week 6 win over the buffalo bills \) and for an interception by an opponent that might have first hit the turf \( week 15 loss to the washington redskins \) we 're kind of used to it now , said linebacker michael boley , who added that stopping the game for a giants challenge might not be worth it at this point , we actually think they 're not going to give us the call , anyway , so we might as well just keep on playing' extra points eli manning returned to practice as a full participant on thursday after leaving practice wednesday with a stomach illness he sent text messages to members of the staff wednesday night to notify them that he felt better on thursday , manning said he felt 100 percent

we 're currently having a big debate about the senate filibuster it is possible you had n't heard , what with the onset of the holiday season , the fiscal cliff and several unexpected plot turns on homeland to worry about there s just so much a person can handle in washington , it s all people talk about ok , not but there s a lot of rancor john cornyn , the new senate minority whip , predicted to politico that if democrats went forward with their plans to change the filibuster rules , it will shut down the senate if the senate did shut down , the country would not necessarily notice much difference this week , there was a herculean attempt to pass the sportsmen s act , a large , bipartisan mix of hunting and conservation provisions that has been waiting around for ages the bill seemed to be sailing toward success when it got entangled in a fight over the price of duck stamps a kind of hunting license and collector item the federal government sells to raise money for conservation it gives the department of interior , unelected bureaucrats , power to decide how much to charge for a duck stamp , announced jeff sessions of alabama this was certainly a powerful argument first , the duck stamps next , the death panels but supporters suspected that the real issue was partisan ire over the filibuster fight the bill took a swan dive on a parliamentary motion life went on a deep dysfunction has set in , said senator jeff merkley , an oregon democrat who s a leader of the fixthefilibuster movement we had an average of 60plus filibusters each of the four years i 've been here that s more than an average of one a week way more than one a week given the senate s vacation schedule filibusters are defined in the national psyche by mr smith goes to washington , a 1939 james stewart movie about a na ve hometown hero who gets appointed to the seat of a deceased senator corrupt special interests want to put a dam on a piece of land that mr smith wants for a boys' camp complications ensue \( at one point , our hero compliments his secretary , jean arthur , by saying , i mean , for a woman , you 've done awfully well \) then comes the filibuster , in which mr smith stands alone on the senate floor , taking advantage of a rule that allows a senator to stop everything for as long as he can keep talking envoys from faraway dictatorships pack the gallery to see what they ca n't see at home democracy in action mr smith talks for nearly 24 hours ! nobody mentions the miracle of the lack of bathroom breaks that was the filibuster then when almost nobody actually used it these days , it s just a rule that makes it impossible to do almost anything without the concurrence of 60 members senator harry \( my life is a bed of thorns \) reid , the majority leader , wants to tweak it , using a parliamentary device that would allow him to change things with just a normal 51vote majority republicans are outraged ! senator tom coburn of oklahoma , who once made news by trying to hold up a budget bill with an amendment outlawing federally financed viagra for sex offenders , said reid was going to destroy the place to be fair , the republicans are afraid that if they do n't have the power to routinely bring things to a grinding halt , the democratic majority will totally ignore them they point to a parliamentary procedure reid uses to keep them from offering amendments on important bills this is known as filling the tree it should not be confused with trimming the tree , which is much more enjoyable democrats , in turn , point to the time senator rand paul tried to hold up a flood insurance bill with a fetal personhood amendment but the important question is , how do feel about changing the filibuster \? if this issue comes up over a family dinner during the holiday , what are you going to say \? this presumes , of course , that none of your relatives are under the age of 40 , because otherwise the filibuster conversation is probably not going anywhere here s the basic deal there are , at minimum , six points in the life of any fledgling bill when the minority party can file filibuster paperwork that will stop all progress unless the majority can round up 60 votes the democrats want to eliminate a few also , they 'd like to replicate the mr smith rules no more procedural shortcuts as senator richard durbin put it , you want to stop the business of the senate , by goodness' sake , park your fanny on the floor of the senate and speak this would be very hard on the minority although everybody in the senate likes to talk , very few actually like to hang around the senate itself the talking filibuster it s the way people think it works already , said oregon s senator merkley the old system certainly worked for mr smith at the end of the movie , a corrupt senior senator was overwhelmed with guilt and raced out of the chamber yelling every word of it is true ! i'm not fit for office if only that happened in the real world , i believe we would protect the filibuster with our last breath
batavia , ohio the tumor grew like a thick vine up the back of eric richter s leg , reminding him every time he sat down that he was a man without insurance in april , when it was close to bursting through his skin , he went to the emergency room doctors told him it was malignant and urged surgery his wife called every major insurance company she found on the internet , but none would cover him his cancer was a preexisting condition in desperation , the richters agreed to pay half their hospital bill , knowing they could never afford it on their combined salaries of 36 , 000 a year no other group of americans faces higher stakes in the impending supreme court ruling on the affordable care act than those with preexisting conditions the law , once its major provisions take effect , would prohibit insurance companies from turning people away or charging them more because they are sick in exchange , most americans would be required to have insurance , broadening the base of paying customers with an infusion of healthy people those who did not buy insurance would be subject to financial penalties the government accountability office estimates that 36 million to 122 million adults under 65 have a preexisting condition as many as 17 million do not have insurance many try to buy coverage on the individual market , but in most states that is either impossible or too costly experts are divided on what the ruling will bring for this group of americans if the mandate that everyone buy coverage is struck down , the obama administration and the insurance industry say that the protections for people with preexisting conditions should be , too if the ailing pile in without the larger pool of healthy people , premiums would skyrocket , insurers say when you have insurance reforms without requiring everyone to participate , it becomes a sickness fund , not an insurance system , said karen ignagni , president of america s health insurance plans , the national trade association representing the health insurance industry mitt romney , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , favors repeal of the law he said last week that he would preserve coverage for people with preexisting conditions , but only if they had been insured before and lost coverage when they were laid off or changed jobs , a more limited protection than the current law provides he did not explain how he would get insurers to cover such people some experts argue that even if the mandate is struck down , along with protections for people with preexisting conditions , there are still options that could lift them to a more secure place states would still have regulatory powers , said sara rosenbaum , a professor of health law and policy at george washington university , and the law contains tools to encourage voluntary participation the penalty for people who do not participate is so weak , she added , that even with the mandate , enrollment was expected to be low at first anyway it is people like eric richter and his wife , dani uninsured and living in the unstable space between poverty and the middle class that the law was intended to help they earned too much to qualify for governmentsponsored health care , but worked in jobs that did not come with health benefits under the law , about half the newly insured would be covered by medicaid , which would extend to individuals earning less than 15 , 400 the other half , the working poor , individuals with incomes up to 44 , 600 , would receive subsidies according to a subsidy calculator provided by the kaiser family foundation , the richters' insurance premium would be 165 a month under the new law , a sum they said they would eagerly pay the small stone drilling firm where mr richter works offers no health coverage , and the family could not afford the more than 600 a month it would have cost to buy it on their own it s hard to pay for the unknown , when you 're struggling to cover the known , said mr richter , who is 39 i know it sounds irresponsible , but that s just the way it was it s a game of roulette you hope you 're going to win after he got the tumor on his leg , the couple said , mr richter tried to better his odds he cut out sugar and ate beets he grew in his garden because he heard that might help but the bump kept growing his wife sewed him special pants to accommodate its size , as big as a melon he started standing in church driving was excruciating when they found he had cancer , the family struggled with how they would pay for his care once he was turned away from a scan because he did not have insurance eventually a doctor took him under his wing , and insisted he be treated in late may , mr richter had surgery he is waiting for the bill he has not been able to work as he recuperates but a piece of bad luck may solve the family s insurance problem , at least for now mrs richter lost her job at an electronic records firm a hospital financial adviser told them that with their income effectively zero and the medical bills mounting , they might qualify for medicaid they are waiting to hear we 're back to crossing our fingers , mrs richter said
predicting the outcome of the iowa caucuses is challenging enough six different republican candidates michele bachmann , herman cain , newt gingrich , ron paul , rick perry and mitt romney have led at least one poll of the state at some point in this cycle a seventh , rick santorum , is closing fast in the polls and has a realistic chance to win on tuesday night what may be even more challenging is predicting how the results of the caucuses will reverberate throughout new hampshire and the other states as the political scientist jonathan bernstein notes , and as my research has found , performance relative to expectations can matter almost as much as the order of finish the iowa caucuses are a twostep process first comes the voting , then comes the spinning critics of the iowa caucuses sometimes take the argument one step too far , arguing that they are entirely a mediadriven obsession with little practical importance it is true that no delegates will be chosen on tuesday night , and it is true that the iowa caucuses have far from a perfect predictive track record , especially on the republican side the caucuses provide important evidence , however , as to how voters behave in the flesh and blood after exposure to the campaigns rather than in the abstraction of a poll it is not coincidental , for instance , that newt gingrich is expected to perform much worse in iowa than implied by his national polling numbers iowans have seen the commercials that target mr gingrich for his ties to freddie mac and for his various deviations from the conservative orthodoxy voters in the rest of the country \( unless they are political junkies \) have not but they will see those ads once the campaign comes around to their states , and if they have proved to be effective in iowa , they might be expected to have similar effects still , the postcaucus spin plays a crucial function in mediating the relationship between a political party and its voters the equation for determining spin is complex comefrombehind victories , like john kerry s in 2004 , can produce more momentum than those that had seemed preordained all along secondplace finishes , like gary hart s in 1984 , can sometimes produce a bigger impact than finishing first if the candidate performed better than his polling had projected the critical thing to keep in mind is that a wide range of outcomes remain possible in iowa even at this late hour our forecasts , which are derived from the polling but account for its historical accuracy or lack thereof , project for example that mr romney is most likely to receive about 22 percent of the vote however , the margin of error on mr romney s forecast \( enough to cover 90 percent of all possible outcomes \) is about plus or minus 10 points , meaning that mr romney could plausibly finish with as much as 32 percent of the vote or as little as 12 percent the campaigns and the news media may be used to looking at general election polling , which is much more reliable , and will usually be taken by surprise at these outcomes , even though they occur with some frequency iowa \( and other earlyvoting states like new hampshire \) can therefore be much more consequential when things don t go to plan than when they do the following , therefore , represents an attempt to consider how each candidate s range of possible outcomes might play out in terms of the postcaucus narrative and then in the subsequent earlyvoting states the figures associated with each candidate represent the 90 percent confidence intervals from the fivethirtyeight forecast model  mitt romney 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 22 percent high end of forecast range 32 percent low end of forecast range 12 percent by far the most consequential outcome in iowa would be if mr romney performed much worse than expectations in practice , this would probably mean if mr romney finished with about 15 percent of the vote or worse , which would most likely leave him no better than a distant third place , and would risk his finishing behind supposedly flailing candidates like mr gingrich mr romney s campaign had once done a very good job of managing expectations in iowa but that has been less true in recent days , following various boastful statements that his campaign has made on and off the record meanwhile , the most highprofile poll in the state , that conducted by the des moines register , had mr romney ahead that candidates like mr paul have led in other recent polls of the state is of consequence for our forecasts , but may not matter as far as expectations go , since the des moines register poll has received much more news media attention  none of that will matter if mr romney lives up to expectations but if he unambiguously fails to achieve them and candidates with his profile sometimes have it may be taken as a sign that voters have vetoed the conclusion of the invisible primary , the phase of the campaign when the candidates seek to position themselves for institutional and financial support that could turn the race into a freeforall at the other end of the scale , if mr romney romps to an easy victory say he receives almost 30 percent of the vote the conclusion may be that he has all but locked up the nomination , particularly given his strength in new hampshire true , the voters in the other 49 states will still have something to say about that but if mr romney has performed impressively in iowa , which has among the most conservative republican electorates , it would augur well for how he should finish elsewhere in the country then there are the inbetween cases , where the top two or three candidates finish close to one another as is currently projected by the polling i am not quite ready to say that a close secondplace finish for mr romney would be exactly the same as a close firstplace finish it will affect the tenor of the coverage but either would leave mr romney in a position where he was poised to win new hampshire it might become more important how the rest of the candidates performed , particularly insofar as it positioned them for south carolina finally , there is the case in which mr romney performs slightly below expectations but not disastrously so say , he finishes in third place but with a reasonably healthy total like 18 percent of the vote in this case , it would be harder to dismiss the importance of new hampshire but it might not be enough to make mr romney truly vulnerable there this is the perversity of the expectations game by failing to achieve expectations in one state , a candidate may lower them in another ron paul 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 21 percent high end of forecast range 31 percent low end of forecast range 11 percent the actual voting total achieved by mr paul may be less important than that of most other candidates for purposes of narrative and spin it is not clear that many of mr paul s voters are open to persuasion \( especially from the mainstream media \) nor are very many voters who are not currently supporting mr paul likely to come around to him  still , the caucuses will be an important test of mr paul s organizational strength and his ability to expand the electorate to groups like young voters and independents who are more inclined to support him a truly impressive finish say , if mr paul finished with close to 30 percent of the vote might create some momentum for him to the extent that it mobilized new voters that might give him some chance of winning new hampshire , an idiosyncratic state where there are a large number of independents but his campaign would survive a poor finish as well and could continue to play a spoiler role  rick santorum 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 19 percent high end of forecast range 29 percent low end of forecast range 10 percent expectations are formed not just in the days immediately before the caucuses but also in the weeks and months that precede them since mr santorum has already made a tremendous amount of progress relative to early expectations , even something like a thirdplace finish in which he got 15 percent of the vote might yield its share of favorable headlines more important is that mr santorum finishes ahead of other conservative candidates like mr gingrich and mr perry still , the stronger mr santorum s performance , the more credible his claim to being the one and only antiromney candidate moreover , mr santorum could use the earned media from a strong finish more than most of his opponents , since his campaign has little financial or organizational strength beyond iowa positive momentum from the caucuses , particularly in the event of a clear firstplace finish , would bide mr santorum time , giving him the chance to build a more robust campaign operation before south carolina and florida his nearterm objective would be finishing second or a strong third in new hampshire , which might require as little as 15 percent of the vote there newt gingrich 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 15 percent high end of forecast range 24 percent low end of forecast range 7 percent it is perhaps hardest to anticipate how the news media will react to mr gingrich s performance given that mr gingrich led the iowa and national polls mere weeks ago , the postmortems for his campaign have literally already been written , with the news media depicting him as an icaruslike figure who fell back to earth on the basis of a flimsy foundation would , say , a fourthplace finish in iowa be regarded as the denouement to the story \? or are expectations for mr gingrich already so low that it might be regarded as redeemable \? one factor that might help mr gingrich is that he can claim to be viable in south carolina and florida , where his polling was once extremely strong this claim may be dubious since few polls of these states have been conducted recently but if mr santorum s finish is underwhelming , there may be doubts as to which candidate can challenge mr romney in the south , which could help mr gingrich to continue along what is clearer is that if mr gingrich unambiguously beats expectations by finishing in the top three , he might have some real upside if the deluge of advertising against him in iowa was not enough to stop him , he might earn a reputation for resilience such a finish might also call into question the power of the party establishment , which has gone to great lengths to stop him mr gingrich will be done absolutely no favors by either the party establishment or the news media , however , with a fifthplace or worse finish rick perry 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 10 percent high end of forecast range 18 percent low end of forecast range 4 percent mr perry would have fewer excuses than mr gingrich for a poor finish in iowa his campaign has spent a great deal of money there , and republican caucusgoers have historically been kind to southerners if mr perry s position were stronger in the other states , he might be able to excuse a poor finish in iowa because of his late start , arguing that he was among the only nationally viable alternatives to mr romney however , that claim will now appear questionable given that mr perry s polling is weak even in south carolina , and that \( like mr gingrich \) he was sufficiently disorganized that he failed to qualify for the virginia ballot at an absolute minimum , mr perry will need to beat his polling average and finish ahead of mr gingrich to get any favorable spin out of iowa a finish in the midtohigh teens , meanwhile , which remains mathematically possible although not likely , could revitalize his campaign but if he finishes at or below his polling average , mr perry is perhaps the most likely candidate to drop out after iowa this is particularly so given his opportunity cost mr perry has a very good job down in austin michele bachmann 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 8 percent high end of forecast range 15 percent low end of forecast range 2 percent although mrs bachmann s polling has sometimes been decent in south carolina , iowa has long been perceived as her strongest state , particularly given that she won the ames straw poll and that she once led the polling there i don t know whether or not she will decide to continue in the race , but unless she finishes toward the highest end of her forecast range , she is unlikely to exert much influence upon it jon m huntsman jr 538 forecast \( most likely outcome \) 4 percent high end of forecast range 8 percent low end of forecast range 0 percent mr huntsman abandoned iowa long ago and has had little presence in the state there is an outside possibility that he could finish ahead of a candidate like mrs bachmann , which could garner him a favorable headline or two but mostly mr huntsman has a rooting interest in seeing how the other candidates perform in particular , mr huntsman might be hoping for a highly ambiguous finish , especially an effective threeway tie as is projected by the current polling , and which would leave no candidate with demonstrable momentum that would free up news bandwidth for him in new hampshire , where his polling is stronger but where he will have to compete with several other candidates for attention the less news coming out of iowa , the more time the news media will have to speculate about whether it is finally mr huntsman s turn to surge
maun , botswana victor nkape s 12yearold daughter was running around the family s cattle post here , amid the brambles , cows , goats and an occasional donkey , when he was struck by something that made the girl different nkape and his brother had spent much of their childhoods racing each other over the vast expanses of northern botswana , on the doorstep of one of the continent s most prominent but his daughter was sprinting short distances , back and forth , over and over even more unusual , nkape said , was the strength and intensity with which she ran your girl runs like a boy , nkape s grandfather , standing nearby , remarked i did n't take it seriously at the time , nkape said that was 16 years ago most girls here did not have access to track programs or tracks , for that matter of about 50 , 000 people , had only one gymnasium nkape , who earned about 112 a month as a storekeeper , did not know what to make of the kernel of athletic talent he saw in his daughter so nkape made an unconventional choice for the time i just let her run , he said today that girl , , 28 , is one of the fastest women in the world the reigning world champion in the 400 meters , she is the favorite to win gold at the summer games in london , despite being one of the most unlikely olympians botswana , a country born 46 years ago out of british colonial rule , has never won an olympic medal in any sport should montsho earn a place on the podium , her already pioneering role in this country of 2 million would be cemented yet little is known of montsho s journey from this remote village to the biggest stage in sports we used to chase the ostrich , said kabelo monnawalebala , 26 , one of montsho s stepsisters we 'd play all day and race each other back and forth to school i used to tell her she ran like a grownup we were happy amantle montsho \( pronounced ahmahntlay montsho \) is the only child of victor nkape and janet montsho , who separated two years after her birth montsho said she spent most of her childhood with her father but saw her mother regularly montsho s father and mother would each go on to have children through other unions , giving her seven halfsiblings and stepsiblings on her father s side and three halfsisters on her mother s it was a struggle that the kids would have things to eat , said janet montsho , who never went to the equivalent of high school and worked as a housekeeper at a nearby safari lodge montsho s father , who advanced through senior secondary school , finishing when he was 20 , built their home , a modest construction of bricks with a tin roof and electricity nearby , nkape grows a few tidy rows of corn a yard , about 40by40 yards , stretches before three cinder block buildings and a corrugated tin outhouse that now sit on the property two dogs roamed the yard , playing with the children for 57 pula a month , or about 8 , the family has a running water faucet a satellite dish for television is provided by the government , and that is how nkape watches montsho s races from his living room nkape moved slowly across the yard , his limbs engaged in a controlled sway he looked to the sky when he recalled the ages of his eight children he measured their age by holding his hand parallel to the ground , as if placing his palm atop their heads i noticed amantle running when she was he paused , then raised his hand slightly above his waist this old , this size today , nkape has a much better job , he said , working as a storekeeper at maun technical college , which has tripled his income to about 340 a month his wife , keitireng nkape , gave birth to a daughter in december nkape strode into the home , his plastic sandals brushing the floor as he gestured into the corner of a bedroom where a baby slept on a mattress on the ground she s my newest , nkape said botho outside , he could hear the muffled voices of his older daughters , bonnete , 10 , and nametso , 13 , laughing as they played in the front yard looking down at the newborn , he smiled maybe she 'll run , too , he said nkape s family , like many in botswana , relied on cattle for wealth through inheritance , nkape once had 300 cows , dozens of goats and a few donkeys the cows , kept at a post about 20 kilometers out of town , could be sold for 1 , 400 to 2 , 200 apiece around the time montsho started running in school , at age 12 , at the bonatla primary school in maun , a wave of cattle lung disease swept through northern botswana the government seized and removed cattle in the region , including nkape s although he received compensation , nkape said it was only about 180 a cow , a fraction of what he would have been able to sell them for the money was split with a relative and some was reinvested in new cattle today , nkape owns 10 cows we lost everything , he said botswana , after years as a british protectorate , has been a relative bright light for the region a landlocked country roughly the size of texas , it is among the most sparsely populated in the world nicknamed the switzerland of subsaharan africa , it has largely avoided the bloody internal conflicts that have ravaged many of its neighbors its people , including montsho , take pride in its tranquillity we do n't speak a lot , montsho said we 're calm we like people from the outside beneath the gentle sheen is a special brand of nationalism , said alexander mccall smith , the author of the no 1 ladies' detective agency , a bestselling series of mysteries set in botswana the important thing to understand is that they made this country themselves they 've been making it from nothing , brick by brick , since 1966 there s a sense of ownership there still , botswana fights wars against disease and financial disparity while botswana counts itself as one of the wealthiest countries in africa , nearly a third of its people live in poverty , according to in 1986 , just three years after montsho was born , the population living below the poverty line  sports have been a low priority for a country that has critical public health concerns botswana has the secondhighest hiv prevalence in the world , with a quarter of those age 15 to 49 living with hiv , according to un aids as a result , the average life expectancy in botswana is 53 , and many household breadwinners have died , leaving their families financially and emotionally destitute there was a lateness in making people conscious , sheila tlou , the country s health minister from 2004 to 2008 , said about awareness of aids it got to the point where once people realized we had a problem , it was too late eventually , botswana became a leader in providing services to curb mothertochild transmission education programs , tlou said , became mandatory in public schools and a vast advertising campaign took place if there s a silver lining , we were finally able to talk about gender equality , tlou said amantle is one of those people who has been emancipated montsho still had the limitations of a meager national sports infrastructure in 1979 , the was formed and entered its first games in 1980 the country s first olympic team was led by military and police officers , according to mooketsi thari , the president of the botswana athletics association and a member of the botswana national olympic committee no women , none at all , thari said regarding athlete representation at the olympic level even montsho s father , who thought of himself as a talented distance runner , did not consider pursuing track beyond a hobby it was the 1970s , he said it was different then we did n't really know where to run the idea was n't there the , a separate government group tasked with sport development , was formed shortly after independence as a small organization since then , the government has increased its budget , providing the bulk of the council s financing from 5 million in 2005 to 96 million today , including money allocated to the botswana national olympic committee \( the , in contrast , counted 2506 million in revenue in 2010 \) it s been a struggle , said bobby gaseitsiwe , sports development officer with the council sport in botswana is not given that much money , he added it s not like the us where the parents or the relatives get so involved those people who do athletics in botswana , their parents are underprivileged so they cannot afford anything olympic officials created programs in the 1960s to address the extreme inequality on the international sports scene today , the olympic solidarity commission , run by the international olympic committee , attempts to take athletes like montsho from countries that may lack sports infrastructure and give them better resources with a quadrennial budget of 331 million , money is distributed to pay for coaches and facilities and to house athletes as they train the , the world governing body for track , also offers financial assistance besides a lack of money and resources , montsho had no role models in botswana the country had never produced elite female athletes of any acclaim finished seventh in the 800 meters at the 2000 sydney games competed internationally in the 100 , 200 and 400 meters , and in the 800 all are men runners from east africa primarily kenya and ethiopia have long been revered for their distancerunning prowess but the continent has produced only a handful of sprinters montsho s event , the 400 meters , is considered the long sprint , and has long been the domain of the united states , jamaica and some europeans , with christine ohuruogu of britain winning olympic gold in 2008 runners in the 400 require the strength , endurance and cardiovascular abilities of distance runners , but also the rapidfire reflexes and explosive speed of sprinters the race is usually over in less than 60 seconds montsho s personal best is 4956 making every stride , every arm chop , every bend around the track critical an african woman has never won olympic gold in the 400 the last african man to win it did so in 1920 if amantle wins in london , her coach , anthony koffi , said , it s not just a win for botswana , it s a win for africa at 13 , montsho moved on to a local school that was equivalent to the lower levels of high school in the united states she kept running by 1999 , physical education pilot programs made their way into schools in botswana competitions among schools took place , but montsho occasionally missed meets , unable to afford the costs associated with them and with nowhere to turn for scholarships i did n't like when she missed meets , janet montsho said but we tried to get her to what we could in her adolescent years , as she continued to run , montsho grew increasingly lean and muscular , eliciting barbed jokes from classmates women in botswana do n't like sports , amantle montsho said they like modeling they do n't like the look of muscles pako seribe , a friend of montsho s and an olympic contender for botswana in the men s 400 relay , said women in botswana are too scared to run they like beauty too much they do n't want to be muscular you have to go through pain to get where amantle is they hear of this pain and they stop the aids epidemic that swept through subsaharan africa had indirect consequences for sports in botswana the national budget was shifted to public health concerns , and cultural perceptions inside the country changed , too to be thin , even in an athletic sense , would have been seen problematically , in terms of being underfed or sick , said roger s levine , an african history professor at the university of the south in sewanee , tenn this was no doubt reinforced by the wasting effects of aids and especially for women , physical fitness was not , nor remains , an aspirational trait montsho , undeterred , continued to participate in local competitions , mostly running sprints like the 100 meters she began attracting the attention of members of the botswana national sports council , who were eagerly trying to cultivate new talent when she was not at practice , montsho would run in any open space she could find , her mother said gaseitsiwe , of the sports council , said he remembers the first time he saw her running in a school competition as a teenager in maun you could tell that she had this thing , this fire that she wanted to do , he said at age 16 , montsho completed her education , not continuing on to senior secondary school she remained in maun and worked as a shop clerk and ran in her spare time gaseitsiwe and colleagues in gaborone , the capital , struggled to find an outlet for montsho and other promising runners a program known informally as an outofschool camp was created in gaborone the idea was to pool the amantle montshos from around the country into a program there for two weeks a month she began to travel from maun to gaborone , an 8to10hour drive , as often as possible it was indeed a stressful and long journey , gaseitsiwe said the short sprints were not the best fit for montsho s strength , said raj rathedi , one of her coaches who worked with her when she visited gaborone he helped guide her transition to the 400 meters she began to really show improvement , he said she got access to our coaches we were able to motivate her she was very shy , but strong in 2004 , botswana allowed her to compete in the athens games , the country s first female olympian she did not advance beyond the first round calling the experience exciting , montsho also said she could n't believe the runners i was seeing for more than three years , montsho shuttled between gaborone and maun her times continued to improve she broke the national 400meter record several times and huge gaps opened between her and her teammates in training and local competitions , rathedi said it soon became clear to her coaches and botswana sports officials that montsho was outgrowing the gaborone facilities gaseitsiwe submitted an application for montsho to receive an olympic solidarity scholarship , which would finance her training at a more advanced facility in dakar , senegal maun was rural , christian , quiet , spacious dakar was urban , muslim , loud , dense montsho did not speak french or wolof , the common languages of senegal i knew it would be hard , she said but i knew i had to train i wanted to get better montsho packed her bags and headed north in 2006 since then , nkape s communication with his daughter has been limited to phone calls , visits home once or twice a year , and the occasional flash of her face in newspapers or on television he still heads out to his cattle post every weekend not the one where he first recognized her talent years earlier this is a smaller one he shares with his brother since the bulk of the herd died montsho now has a sponsorship with nike and earns prize money through races worldwide , including 60 , 000 for last summer nearly four times the annual per capita income in botswana she finished eighth in the 400 at the 2008 olympics in beijing a relative unknown outside africa , montsho has become an icon in her home country a billboard showing her wielding the powder blue , black and white of her nation s flag stands above an industrial area of steampipe fitters and woodworkers editors at mmegi , a newspaper based in gaborone , said they had lost count of the number of times she had appeared on their front page gaborone s track at university of botswana stadium now attracts young athletes from villages afar practices are held in the late afternoon so runners can attend after class or work such programs were in their infancy and conducted on a volunteer basis when montsho was a teenager now , several are held throughout the country , cultivating a new generation of female runners when montsho , often wearing brightly colored headbands and matching nail polish , passes through gaborone , she occasionally takes a lap on the track known for her shyness and modesty , she continues to make her way through the country as if she is not famous , locals say amantle ! she s our girl , tshepang olerato tlhako , a 19yearold in gaborone , said she puts botswana on the map and motivates us most of the girls think that sports are a man thing i do n't know why amantle has helped sethunya sejoe , a 20yearold runner , was stretching under an unforgiving sun at the university track amantle showed that if you have the passion , you can do it , she said i want to be like her the next amantle montsho may rise from a similar setting nkape stood at his cattle post one recent saturday morning with his daughter bonnete one of bonnete s chores is to run and get milk at the shop on the main road , about 500 meters away when amantle was young , she had the same task nkape said he never timed either of them , but bonnete is faster than amantle bonnete beamed , looking down at her silver slippers nkape used to run the road to the cattle post with his brother , when it was gravel now the road is paved , peppered with advertisements for safari lodges that have popped up over the years , and nkape can take a taxi the cattle still rest in the middle of the road bonnete darted away from her father and through the trees , running on the grass and dirt paths , her silver flats making tiny footprints amid the cows , the goats and the occasional jackal the white of her ruffled blouse soon became a tiny dot in the distance the hope , nkape said , is that montsho will be able to help her sister and the family financially , should bonnete choose to pursue running seriously it will be easier for her , nkape said of bonnete our generation is different we read more and saw more i know that certain girls can achieve things he looked toward bonnete in the distance , and the bleating goats giving chase some people were not allowing girls to participate in certain games , nkape said i let amantle run so she could show people that even girls who want to do it can
oklahoma city spun away in disgust and angrily pulled on his jersey , the famed purple and gold no 24 that has symbolized a career of clutch shooting and one the will someday retire to hang in the rafters bryant , though , was not lamenting his failure to deliver the gamewinner wednesday night against the thunder unable to break free on a play that called for him to be the first option , bryant never got the ball and could only watch as metta world peace threw an inbounds pass to steve blake , whose 3point attempt from the right corner clanked off the rim bryant s lofty reputation as a stonecold gunslinger under pressure was questioned in the process , lumped with lebron james as a statistically scrutinized and scoured superstar , amid the rubble of the lakers' meltdown that led to oklahoma city s 7775 victory the thunder lead the western conference semifinals , two games to none , having blown out the lakers by 29 points in game 1 and broken their spirit with a 90 finishing rally in game 2 the series shifts to los angeles for backtoback games friday and saturday , a further test of endurance for the aging and weary lakers against the younger thunder they got themselves a gritty win , bryant said now it s up to us to go back home and defend our court bryant left the floor shaking his head and smirking amid a celebration of streamers at chesapeake energy arena indeed , his absence at crucial junctures was equally puzzling and frustrating as the thunder chipped away at his aura with spectacular efficiency with the lakers leading by 7568 with 2 minutes 8 seconds to play , the scene was set for them to steal a road playoff game and bryant to stamp his signature on the victory instead , he ignited the flameout in a horrendous scoreless sequence by the lakers to end the game bryant seriously misjudged an inbounds pass that kevin durant picked off and took down for a dunk less than a minute later , bryant somehow had his shot blocked by the 6foot5 guard james harden , who converted the play into a fastbreak layup then , with russell westbrook furiously contesting a pass to bryant , the ball was deflected out of bounds and possession was awarded to the lakers , only to be reversed and given to the thunder after a review by officials bryant also missed a jump shot and 3point try during the thunder s run after hitting his first two shots in the fourth quarter , he missed his last five attempts and , of course , he was a spectator as blake fired the potential gamewinner it was a good look we were lucky he missed that shot , oklahoma city coach scott brooks said he added we got some breaks but we earned those breaks by playing good defense brooks made a key move by switching the 69 durant to guard bryant for the final four minutes , which seemed to raise the thunder s intensity i just tried to use my length a little bit and play hard , durant said he makes those tough shots , and he missed some tonight but he is so good in the fourth quarter that no matter who is guarding him , he is going to try and take a shot it s all about playing hard bryant , though , disputed the idea that durant was responsible for his miscues those last few minutes , they just made gambles , bryant said they jumped into the passing lane that s not something we 're accustomed to seeing it was just flatout risk defensively , jumping in the passing lane to get the ball durant did it and got a steal westbrook did it and caused a turnover it was unconventional , but we 'll make our adjustments for game 3 bryant finished 9 of 25 wednesday night and missed all six of his 3point attempts he has scored 20 points in each of the two games here , but he is shooting 37 percent \( 16 of 43 \) for the series he is a combined 1 of 9 from 3point range , having hit his lone shot midway through the second quarter of game 1 , a futility that has fueled the thunder s confidence in guarding him the lakers have acknowledged that they ca n't keep pace with the thunder , who have pummeled them , 315 , in fastbreak points you ca n't you ca n't you just accept that it s not a big deal , bryant said with a laugh when asked before game 2 how the lakers might match oklahoma city s energy they have youthful exuberance you do n't worry about matching their energy you just think about slowing them down and playing our style the lakers rolled back the thunder for all but two minutes , and bryant was n't there to bail them out , the image of him angrily tugging on his jersey a frustrating symbol heading into games 3 and 4
on oct 11 , this blog posed the question of whether president obama s firewall in battleground states was all that it was cracked up to be at that point , mr obama still technically held the lead in the fivethirtyeight forecast in enough states to give him 270 electoral votes but colorado , florida and virginia had turned red in our map , meaning that our forecast suggested that mitt romney had betterthaneven odds of winning them iowa was just on the verge of doing so and mr obama s lead was down to just a percentage point or so in ohio , which would have collapsed his firewall at its foundation theories that the decline in mr obama s polls that followed the first presidential debate in denver would somehow skip the swing states were not looking good as dubious as the idea that tornadoes skip houses instead , at that point , mr obama s position in the fivethirtyeight forecast had declined for seven consecutive days if he stopped the bleeding there , he might still be the electoral college favorite , albeit a narrow one but it wasn t clear where the bottom was it turned out , however , that the worst was almost over for him mr obama had one more terrible day in the polls , on friday , oct 12 , when mr romney s chances of winning the electoral college rose to almost 40 percent in the forecast but that was when mr romney s momentum stopped  since then , mr obama s standing has rebounded slightly his position in the national polls has stabilized although the national polls continue to tell a different story about the race than the state polls do it can no longer be said that they have mr obama behind \( more about that in a moment \) meanwhile , mr obama continues to hold the lead in the vast majority of polls in iowa , nevada , ohio and wisconsin , the states that represent his path of least resistance toward winning the electoral college this was particularly apparent on wednesday , a day when there were a remarkable number of polls , 27 , released in the battleground states there were 12 polls published on wednesday among iowa , nevada , ohio and wisconsin mr obama held the lead in 11 of the 12 surveys the exception was a survey by the university of iowa , which had mr obama down by about one point there , but also had a very small sample size \( about 300 likely voters \) on average , mr obama led in the polls of these states by 39 percentage points none of this ought to have been surprising , exactly , if you have been attentive to the polls rather than the pundits it was a pretty good day of surveys for mr obama but not a great one for the most part , the polls were coming in close to fivethirtyeight forecasts in each state , give or take a modest outlier here and there rather , the polls in these states confirmed what we already knew that mr obama remains the favorite in the electoral college mr obama is not a sure thing , by any means it is a close race his chances of holding onto his electoral college lead and converting it into another term are equivalent to the chances of an nfl team winning when it leads by a field goal with three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter there are plenty of things that could go wrong , and sometimes they will but it turns out that an nfl team that leads by a field goal with three minutes left to go winds up winning the game 79 percent of the time those were mr obama s chances in the fivethirtyeight forecast as of wednesday 79 percent not coincidentally , these are also about mr obama s chances of winning ohio , according to the forecast regular readers will have seen the chart below once or twice before it sorts the competitive states in order of mr obama s current projected margin of victory or defeat in each one , keeping a running tally of the number of electoral votes that mr obama is accumulating ohio remains the tippingpoint state in the forecast , the one that puts him over the top to 270 electoral votes there , mr obama leads by 26 percentage points , which should convert to a victory about 80 percent of the time given the historical accuracy of polls at this late stage of the race mr romney s chances of winning the electoral college without ohio a prospect we had defended as being plausible before are looking more tenuous based on the most recent polling if mr obama wins ohio , and all the states above it on the chart , he d have 281 electoral votes , meaning that he has 11 to spare that means he could shed new hampshire from his list , along with either iowa or nevada \( although not both \) of these two states , nevada appears to be the slightly safer one for mr obama there , mr obama leads by 35 percentage points in the forecast , as opposed to 29 percentage points in iowa the polling has also been somewhat more consistent in nevada than in iowa , another factor that the forecast considers in evaluating the probability of an upset one fortunate aspect of these two particular states , from mr obama s view , is that they are not very similar to one another demographically iowa is quite rural nevada occupies a huge geographical territory , but its population is very urban , mostly living in las vegas and its suburbs iowa is overwhelmingly white , and has a lot of moderate and middleincome , but highly educated , voters nevada certainly has an independent streak , but winning there usually depends more upon building a 50 percent coalition among diverse groups and then turning it out to vote iowa has a pretty good economy , all things considered nevada s is still terrible since mr obama only needs to carry one of these states , it helps him that they form a diverse portfolio if mr obama s turnout operation is strong , then nevada should be one of the states where he benefits the most if , instead , mr obama has little ground game advantage , but he holds his own among independent and undecided voters , perhaps persuading them that the economy has improved enough to merit his reelection , iowa may fall for him mr romney could also circumvent his need to win ohio by carrying wisconsin , but that is looking tough for him in ohio , mr romney is behind by two or three percentage points , on average , in the polls in wisconsin , mr romney s better polls have him down by two or three points , while his worst ones have him six to eight points instead there s still enough upside to winning wisconsin that mr romney should not give up on it , in my view , but his chances are down to 12 percent in the forecast , and most of those cases involve outcomes where he has already won ohio anyway the more debatable cases are pennsylvania , michigan and minnesota mr romney is the clear underdog in each one but his campaign has so much money that it probably doesn t hurt mr romney much to spend a little bit of it there to maximize whatever residual chances he might have in case the polls are wrong \( arguably , it was a poor strategic decision for mr romney to make a halfhearted effort to compete in these states \) still , for mr romney to win michigan , minnesota , or pennsylvania , the polls would have to be much further off than they are in ohio it doesn t help mr romney , either , that all of these states are in the same part of the country as iowa , ohio , and wisconsin , meaning that they are unlikely to leapfrog them and become the tippingpoint state on tuesday if , hypothetically , mr romney s polling were a bit better in culturally and geographically disparate states , like oregon , new jersey or new mexico , they might represent better targets if mr obama were to lose ohio \( but hold the other states \) , the tippingpoint would then become colorado there , mr obama holds a much more tenuous lead , about one percentage point in our forecast , which converts to about a 60 percent chance of winning but at least it s a lead rather than a deficit , whereas mr romney s nonohio paths would require him to win states where he is now three or four percentage points behind mr obama also remains about a 60 percent favorite in virginia another option would be florida , although it is a resourceintensive state and we give him about a 40 percent chance of winning there while state polls dominated the news on wednesday , there were also a handful of national polls out , even as others have been suspended in the wake of hurricane sandy on average , mr obama led by just over one percentage point in these national polls , although it is an odd distribution , with two polls showing him up by four or five points , several showing a tied race , and one \( the rasmussen reports tracking poll \) putting him two points down the fivethirtyeight model calculates a national poll average , using a more sophisticated method than the simple average i ve taken in the chart \( the model doesn t forget about the gallup poll , for example , just because it has been suspended for a couple of days \) we don t usually print this number , because it would sow confusion our estimate of the national popular vote , which we do publish , instead represents a combination of national polls and the implied standing of the candidates based on state polls but , for what it s worth , our national poll average shows mr obama up by about half a percentage point right now this is within the range of other web sites real clear politics has an exactly tied race in its national poll average huffpost pollster has mr obama down by threetenths of a point talking points memo has mr obama ahead by about one percentage point again we don t take the average of the national polls to be tantamount to a forecast of the national popular vote , since state polls , if considered carefully , can provide considerable information about the national race as well suppose , however , that mr obama were to tie mr romney in the popular vote on tuesday the way that the forecast model works , this would require subtracting some from mr obama in each state in order for the arithmetic to add up even under these conditions , mr obama would still be a favorite in the forecast in fact , he d be about a 70 percent favorite to win the electoral college conditional upon the national popular vote being tied , according to our simulations a tie in the national popular vote is a tolerable condition for mr obama , in other words his position is robust enough in states like ohio that he has some slack with a lead of about 25 percentage points in the tippingpoint states , mr obama could underperform his state polls by a point or two and still win conversely , mr romney has few chances to win unless the state polls are systematically wrong i don t mean for this to sound dismissive the polling error could quite easily be correlated across the different states , and the national polls are one reason to be suspicious of the state polls but we re at the point now where mr obama may be a modest favorite even if the national polls are right two weeks ago , when mr obama appeared to trail mr romney by a point or so in the national polls , that would not have been the case is it possible that mr obama has benefited , politically , from his handling of hurricane sandy \? he has gotten high marks for it so far , according to the tracking poll run by the washington post and abc news our database contains roughly a dozen polls that conducted the bulk of their interviews on tuesday or wednesday , after hurricane sandy became the dominant news story most of these are state polls , and most were conducted in states that were isolated from the major effects of the storm our analysis of the trend lines in the polls suggest that they have been a somewhat aboveaverage group for mr obama , perhaps suggesting a percentage point or so of improvement for him the model is not yet pricing in very much of this into its forecast , as trends like that can occur fairly easily because of statistical noise but if the storm has a discernible effect in the polls , it seems more likely to help mr obama than to hurt him based on what we ve seen so far this is something to monitor as more national polls come back online i think describing the race as a tossup reflects an uninformed interpretation of the evidence , but there is surely room to debate how much of a favorite mr obama is however , mr romney is not in a position to tolerate any movement in mr obama s favor given how close we are to the finish line
d j vu , anyone \? a sixth performer from the broadway musical spiderman turn off the dark is said to have been injured during the show s run last winter and he has become the first to take legal action against the spiderman producers the stuntman , richard kobak , who played spiderman in some of the musical s flying sequences , says that he sustained two herniated discs , a concussion , whiplash and holes in both knees as a result of errors by crew members in charge of programming the aerial rigging computer in legal papers filed in state supreme court in new york on tuesday , a lawyer for mr kobak asked the spiderman producers for documents , email and other material dealing with the computer system and the concerns of mr kobak , who said in an affidavit that he had warned the show s aerial designer , scott rogers , at that time that the stunts weren t working properly according to the legal papers , mr kobak had replaced another stuntman , christopher tierney , who was injured after a 30foot fall from a platform at the dec 20 , 2010 , performance \( mr tierney s injury was caused by human error he recovered and rejoined the show \) mr kobak asserts that because of the weight difference between himself and mr tierney the computer system needed to be recalibrated to slow down and soften mr kobak s landings on stage after flight sequences he asked mr rogers about this , according to the court papers , and was told that the computer was being reprogrammed mr kobak asserts that the computer correction was not made until he had completed 16 performances of spiderman , during which he landed very hard on stage \( he also said he had sustained dozens of hard landings during rehearsals \) he said in his affidavit that his right knee has a hole of 14 cm and his left knee has a hole of 9 cm he also said he sustained another flyingrelated injury last april when , he said , at the behest of mr rogers he changed his timing and body positioning during a stunt to align with the computerized rigging as a result , he said in the affidavit , i was pulled straight into the wall striking my head and face into the wall , from which he had the concussions , herniated discs and other injuries rick miramontez , a spokesman for the spiderman producers , said in an email statement , the producers have no comment on the matter except to wish mr kobak , who is currently in the american idiot tour , well five other spiderman performers , including mr tierney , were injured during rehearsals in the fall of 2010 and after performances began that november among them were two lead actresses at the time , natalie mendoza \( who ultimately left the show \) and t v carpio , who both sustained head injuries while playing the spiderwoman arachne none of those five is known to have sued , though ms mendoza received a confidential financial settlement on the condition that she leave the show without criticizing it mr kobak is the latest legal thorn in the side of the producers , who are already contending with a lawsuit from the show s former director , julie taymor they have countersued her spiderman is the most expensive musical in broadway history , at a cost of 75 million , and is also the new york theatrical debut of its famous composers , bono and the edge of u2 the show opened last june to mostly negative reviews after a long , troubled period of preview performances when the various injuries occurred the show never had an outoftown tryout production , which is when most musicals work out their technical difficulties spiderman is regularly among the topselling shows on broadway , grossing roughly 15 million a week , but because the musical s weekly running costs exceed 1 million , spiderman has been making only a modest profit most weeks the producers have recently begun exploring options for going overseas with spiderman productions and arena concerts spun off from the show to help earn back the 75 million capitalization

lecompton , kan cloaked in a top hat , frock coat , pleated shirt and cravat , paul bahnmaier is on to thrust his 625person hometown into the spotlight by heralding its seismic yet littleknown place in antebellum history the first step toward s election as president took place here over the past couple of weeks , mr bahnmaier , the earnest president of the lecompton historical society , has contacted every local newspaper and television station in this eastern kansas market , urging them to publicize this bluecollar bedroom community s story he is reaching out to about 10 national media outlets and enlisting his sister in wisconsin to contact the media there although his passion for his hometown s history started before he was old enough to drive , mr bahnmaier , 70 , deemed this a timely opening for a fullcourt publicity blitz because of the recent release of the steven spielberg movie lincoln he has sunk his heart and soul into this town to keep the history alive , said robin kofford , 44 , working at the family business , kroeger s country meats , lecompton s only market and restaurant normally , mr bahnmaier dines there on a turkey sandwich , but on a recent afternoon , he was so excited about the possibility of national coverage of the town s history that he allowed himself a quarterpound cheeseburger mr bahnmaier is the embodiment of the pride that people in this small town , which draws about 6 , 000 tourists a year , have in their history the importance of lecompton to the civil war era , he believes , rivals the likes of fort sumter , gettysburg and appomattox none of those places would be important had the events not occurred here in lecompton , he said kansas became a territory of the united states in 1854 , and lecompton was named the territorial capital the next year it was here that the territorial legislature elected through fraud because many proslavery missourians crossed the border to cast ballots drafted a constitution to admit kansas to the union as a slave state , even though a majority of its settlers were against slavery when the document was sent to washington for ratification , it passed the senate but stirred debates in the house so intense that a fight broke out in the chamber one night it ended when two wisconsin republicans , john potter and cadwallader washburn , ripped the wig off the head of william barksdale , a mississippi democrat , and mr potter declared , i 've scalped him the house eventually rejected the lecompton constitution in february 1858 , but not before it drove deep wedges within the democratic party president james buchanan pushed for passage of the constitution but senator stephen a douglas , a firm believer that each state should decide whether to legalize slavery with a popular vote of its people , opposed the constitution because of the territory s voting fraud the division led the democrats to put up two candidates for president in 1860 , including mr douglas , and they \( along with a thirdparty candidate \) split the party vote , opening the way for lincoln to win the election as a republican with about 39 percent of the popular vote lincoln would not have been president except for the lecompton constitution , said jonathan earle , a history professor at the university of kansas , who is writing a book on the 1860 presidential race the lecompton constitution is remembered in the twostory balloonframe clapboard hall where it was drafted in this hilly town on the kansas river the building , stilted to a grassy slope with limestone pegs , houses a museum on the events surrounding the constitution and bleeding kansas , the years of deadly fighting over slavery in kansas the secondfloor space , about the size of a large classroom , where most of the territorial legislature s 60 members met for weeks to draft the constitution , has been spruced up with flags hanging from the ceiling , exhibits tacked to the walls and polished gray wooden planks covering the original cottonwood floors locals treat visitors to reenactments of speeches and debates from the era constitution hall is an ode to lecompton s more bustling days in the late 1850s , when it was the capital and businesses packed the streets people flocked here , including mr bahnmaier s greatgrandfather , who immigrated from germany and worked as a tailor at a hotel the population peaked at 4 , 000 in 1858 , mr bahnmaier said but after topeka became the capital when kansas was admitted as a free state in 1861 , lecompton , near the university of kansas in lawrence , dwindled today , the city is so tranquil that it is easy to hear a chorus of hissing , chirping and fluttering birds the only businesses along the main thoroughfare are a gift emporium and an art shop clapboard homes line the streets , and several yards hold rusty vehicles looking back on lecompton , some might see a black eye in kansas s history , what with the town s having served as a hub for proslavery forces but mr bahnmaier disputed that view lecompton was where slavery began to die , he said without this constitution splitting the democratic party , lincoln would n't have been elected president , and who knows how much longer slavery would have existed \? and a movie named lincoln would not be playing in multiplexes across the country
manchester , nh mitt romney has won the new hampshire republican primary , achieving a sweep of the first two critical contests in the 2012 presidential race and boosting his chances at becoming his party s nominee this fall mitt romney has been declared the winner the candidates have given their speeches and are now on their way to south carolina , and we are , too check out nytimescom and the caucus for continuing coverage thanks for following along  the caucus with the primary season moving south in the coming weeks , what do the new hampshire exit polls suggest about each candidate s potential strengths and weaknesses in south carolina \? before the outcome of tonight s primary , surveys showed that the three top candidates in south carolina were mitt romney , newt gingrich and rick santorum although ron paul and jon m huntsman jr finished in the top three in new hampshire , the exit polls provide good reason to think they will not repeat those performances in south carolina both mr paul and mr huntsman did best among new hampshire voters describing themselves as liberal or moderate , and worst among voters describing themselves as conservatives \( but , of the 1 in 10 voters whose most important quality was choosing a true conservative , mr paul was selected by about 42 percent \) seven of 10 voters in the 2008 south carolina republican primary identified themselves as conservative , a much greater portion than voters in new hampshire about half this year can either mr gingrich or mr santorum emerge in south carolina as the conservative alternative to mr romney \? the new hampshire exit polls point to each candidate s possible strengths in this area mr gingrich outperformed mr santorum among fiscal conservatives in new hampshire and among those primarily concerned with the budget deficit , though both candidates lost to mr romney among both these groups on the other hand , mr santorum outperformed mr gingrich among social conservatives and among those primarily concerned with abortion while mr romney beat both of these candidates among social conservatives , he did not beat mr santorum among abortion issue voters presumably , these voters will become more important as the primary moves to south carolina in terms of candidate qualities , the new hampshire exit polls show that after mr romney , mr gingrich does the second best of any candidate among voters whose most important candidate quality is the ability to beat president obama mr santorum s biggest advantage comes from voters who say the most important candidate quality is being a true conservative a group he actually won in new hampshire over all , the exit poll results suggest that mr santorum s path to a strong showing in south carolina will rest largely on his continued emphasis on socially conservative issues like abortion and possibly also gay marriage \( although no exit poll questions have asked about this \) mr gingrich s base of support is a bit more broad than mr santorum s , but overlaps to a larger degree with mr romney s strengths this may explain , in part , why mr gingrich has chosen a more aggressive stance towards mr romney , while mr santorum has been content to stay above the fray david r jones is a baruch college professor who is an exit polls analyst for the times  david r jones manchester , nh to the majestic chords of to the skies , mr santorum entered a small hotel ballroom here , not to concede defeat in the new hampshire primary but to say that he had exceeded expectations at 9 54 pm tuesday , he walked on stage with his wife and some of his children and an entourage of about a dozen men in suits as he held a slim lead for fourth place we are going to go on to south carolina , he declared , to hoots and hollers from the crowd of about 100 people he said he would be the true conservative in the race because he started here barely registering in the polls , he said that depending on which polls were used as a baseline , he had come in at either 10 times , 5 times or 3 times where he started mr santorum said that his grandfather , who emigrated to pennsylvania to work in the coal mines , was not deterred by temporary setbacks , and suggested that he had that same determination he said that he competed in new hampshire because we wanted to respect the process and campaign in every state , and that he appreciated the opportunity to talk about faith and family we didn t spend a lot of money , but we put our message out there , he said we came where the campaign was and delivered a message not just for new hampshire but for america partway through his eightminute appearance , mr santorum referred to mitt romney , not by name , but as someone who had spent a lot of time and money in the state then he congratulated him , by name , for winning he worked hard in this state and invested in this state , mr santorum said he said he spoke with mr romney earlier and said he was looking forward to engaging on the issues mr gingrich , speaking at the same time as mr santorum , said he would continue on to south carolina and florida , which he called the next two great contests in the presidential campaign as we get to south carolina , as the choice becomes clear , mr gingrich said , i believe we can reach out and we can create a majority that will shock the country and a majority that will continue to put us on the right track mr gingrich added it is doable it is a daunting challenge but consider the alternative manchester , nh mr huntsman , addressing a crowd of supporters in manchester about 9 30 pm , quickly made it clear that he was continuing on to south carolina despite his thirdplace finish i d say third place is a ticket to ride , he said before launching into a version of the stump speech he has given dozens of times around the state we are the most bluesky , problemsolving , cando people on earth and we re going to get out there and we re going to address this trust deficit , he said all we need is a little bit of leadership and a plan in recent days , mr huntsman has stressed that he has spent time building support in south carolina and has the backing of henry mcmaster , the state s attorney general , among others he has scheduled campaign events in north charleston and columbia for wednesday  abby goodnough manchester , nh to the music of the reliable nonwinners theme won t back down , ron paul declared his secondplace finish a victory for the cause of liberty tonight shortly after mr romney ended his victory speech , mr paul delivered a trademark speech about overspending and big government , along with swipes at the media , which mr paul said had rightly described his campaign as dangerous that s one thing they are telling the truth we are dangerous to the status quo , mr paul said the enthusiastic crowd before him at a banquet hall in manchester , dominated by the jeansclad young volunteers and voters who have provided the energy for his presidential campaign , broke into lusty boos at every mention of fiat money or policing the world , hallmarks of the iconoclastic but energetic political views that have made mr paul a force for other republicans to contend with liberty has to be remphasized , mr paul said over the last hundred years , we ve taken liberty and chopped it up  nicholas confessore manchester , nh while rick santorum was locked in a tight race for fourth place with newt gingrich in the new hampshire primary , reporters and other media types appeared to outnumber santorum supporters at his party headquarters here at a small , unadorned hotel ballroom many in the crowd of fewer than 100 were volunteers for his campaign or related to someone who was they stood watching the primary unfold silently on a large screen on the stage while 60s and 70s pop music thrummed in the room long after mitt romney claimed victory , the crowd was still waiting for mr santorum to appear richard cote , 48 , a bagger at a local supermarket , said he came to the party because he had seen the numbers earlier on television and felt sorry for mr santorum i thought he d win , mr cote said i feel bad kevin moore , 34 , a volunteer for mr santorum who said he is basically a fulltime volunteer for political campaigns , said he was disappointed tonight i wish he d gotten more traction , he said susan stys , 55 , a nurse , said that after she voted for mr santorum , she found herself standing next to him when he appeared at the radisson hotel downtown for radio interviews she said she came because she was all about the process and liked the lowkey quality of the evening gathering i m just impressed , especially by the normalcy of everyone here , she said many were wearing casual , coldweather clothes including a sweater vest or two with suits in the minority around 9 35 , an aide said mr santorum was waiting for the numbers to solidify and perhaps break out , and then the candidate would address the crowd  katharine q seelye manchester , nh jon m huntsman jr hailed his thirdplace showing in new hampshire , declaring that his campaign is in the hunt for the republican nomination for president i d say third place is a ticket to ride , ladies and gentlemen , mr huntsman told an enthusiastic crowd hello , south carolina ! mr huntsman s campaign was hoping that a late surge in the state would push him into second place behind mitt romney that didn t happen but mr huntsman had repeatedly declared that he simply needed to beat market expectations , without ever defining what those expectations were in his remarks tuesday night , mr huntsman decried two deficits in the country an economic deficit represented by 15 trillion in debt and a trust deficit , in which americans no longer have faith in their institutions we are too good as people to be in this hole , mr huntsman declared  michael d shear for a deeper look into the challenges awaiting mitt romney in south carolina , check out jim rutenberg s news analysis   the caucus manchester , nh ron paul declared himself satisfied with his secondplace showing in the new hampshire primary , calling it a victory for the cause of liberty tonight mr paul , a congressman from texas , said he called to congratulate mitt romney on his win in the state but he said that he will continue to wage the intellectual revolution that he has started there is no way they are going to stop the momentum that we have started , mr paul told a raucous crowd shortly after mr romney gave his own speech mr paul bragged about getting the political system to talk about real cuts in spending , monetary policy and the federal reserve he said concerns about the future of the dollar will remain a dominant issue in future conversations about politics no matter what happens in this presidential campaign there s no way they are going to put it to bed , he said  michael d shear manchester , nh after his disappointing showing tuesday in the new hampshire primary , rick santorum is banking on south carolina to regain the momentum he had a week ago , when he nearly won the iowa caucuses mr santorum did not spend any money on television advertising in new hampshire his campaign figured that mitt romney had such a wide lead here that even if mr santorum gained a few percentage points , aides said , it would not matter the santorum campaign has raised 3 million since iowa and is already pumping 15 million of it into television ads in south carolina the ads began running tuesday john braebender , a top adviser and media strategist for mr santorum , said the moderate voters of new hampshire were not a natural constituency for mr santorum but , he said , the campaign decided to compete here because doing so offered priceless national media exposure without draining scarce resources if we had just gone to south carolina , we would have disappeared from the national radar and our fundraising would have gone downhill , mr braebender said the campaign also thought that if mr santorum did not compete here , his potential voters would have gone to newt gingrich , whom the santorum campaign sees as its main competition as the conservative alternative to mr romney mr santorum stayed on his conservative message here , which mr braebender said would make it easier for him to continue that approach in south carolina others , including mr romney and jon m huntsman jr , made explicit appeals to the moderates in new hampshire it will be hard for them to do an aboutface to appeal to the conservative voters in south carolina , he said the santorum campaign has a bigger campaign presence in south carolina than it had here and has redeployed its forces from here and iowa it is also starting to organize county chairmen in florida  katharine q seelye  the caucus manchester , nh despite finishing near the very bottom in new hampshire on tuesday night , rick perry vowed to continue on in the republican presidential contest as the party searches for what he called a conservative alternative to mitt romney i believe being the only nonestablishment outsider in the race , the proven fiscal and social conservative and proven job creator will win the day in south carolina , mr perry said in a statement from that state i have a head start here , and it s friendly territory for a texas governor and veteran with solid outsider credentials , the nation s best record of job creation , and solid fiscal , social and tea party conservatism , he said mr perry has spent several days in south carolina after finishing fifth in iowa s caucuses he suspended his campaign after the iowa results but said a day later that he would stay in the race in the last several days , mr perry has been the most aggressive of all the candidates in attacking mr romney s leadership at bain capital , an investment firm that mr romney founded in the 1980s in a particularly harsh attack on tuesday , mr perry compared mr romney s firm to vultures that tear companies apart , fire people and leave the skeleton behind  michael d shear manchester , nh a prevailing sense among new hampshire primary voters that mitt romney is the candidate most likely to defeat barack obama helped lift him to victory today according to exit polls , a majority of voters said mr romney was the most electable candidate , and about 6 in 10 of them supported him today mr romney has been making that argument for months , and has focused most of his rhetorical fire at the president in the hopes of demonstrating how he will run against him it appears that the argument worked over all , about a third of new hampshire voters said electability was the top quality they were looking for in a candidate it was cited more than any other quality and about 6 in 10 of these voters backed mr romney \( he won this group in iowa as well , but not as convincingly \) most voters in new hampshire said they would be satisfied with mr romney as the republican presidential nominee by contrast , a majority of voters said they would be dissatisfied if newt gingrich , ron paul or rick santorum was the nominee the most important issue by far for new hampshire voters was the economy , cited by about 6 in 10 , and these voters supported mr romney far more than any other candidate compared with iowa , more voters in new hampshire said the economy was their top issue , and more of them supported mr romney mr romney ran strongly among enrolled republicans and selfidentified republicans undeclared voters and independents were more closely divided between candidates the difference in the makeup of today s electorate compared with iowa s also worked to mr romney s advantage very conservative voters \( a group that divided their support between mr romney and mr santorum today \) accounted for only about 2 in 10 new hampshire voters in iowa , they accounted for nearly half of all caucusgoers similarly , evangelical christians \( who also split their vote today \) made up just over a fifth of new hampshire s electorate they comprised a majority of iowa s voters a week ago other groups helping to boost mr romney today were higherincome voters \( he won nearly half of voters whose household income was 100 , 000 or more , more than a third of today s electorate \) , older voters , catholics and voters who had made up their minds early dalia sussman , polling editor , contributed to this post  michael d shear manchester , nh jon m huntsman jr offered himself as a conservative alternative to mitt romney , but the bulk of his support on tuesday came from moderate and liberal voters , those satisfied with the obama administration , and those opposed to the tea party movement after campaigning in new hampshire for months , mr huntsman had a latebreaking surge of support to propel him into the top three but the surge came too late to overtake mr romney , who won the primary roughly 6 in 10 of mr huntsman s voters said they had decided whom to support in the few days leading up to the election just over onethird of ron paul s and mr romney s supporters said the same mr huntsman , who served as ambassador to china during the first half of president obama s term , toiled near the bottom of national polls and had little money to communicate with voters through much of last year mr huntsman s voters were the least likely to say they had been contacted by their candidate s campaign a 53 percent majority of huntsman supporters say they were never contacted by his campaign , compared with 42 percent of mr paul s supporters and 38 percent of mr romney s over all , mr huntsman performed best among groups of voters who either support the obama administration or share some of its views his likely second or thirdplace finish results from the relatively small numbers of these types of voters in the primary electorate mr huntsman s strongest showing , perhaps not surprisingly , was among voters with warmerthanaverage \( for the primary electorate \) views of president obama and his administration among voters who reported being satisfied with the obama administration , roughly 4 in 10 supported mr huntsman in contrast , he received fewer than 1 in 10 votes from those who described themselves as angry with the administration unfortunately for mr huntsman , the latter outnumbered the former by three to one mr huntsman was also a clear favorite among voters who oppose the tea party movement among those opposing the tea party , over 40 percent voted for mr huntsman , while only a quarter supported mr romney , the closest candidate among that category of voters here again , however , those voters made up a small proportion of the electorate fewer than onefifth monika l mcdermott , a polling analyst , contributed to this post  michael d shear even though mr paul appears to have gained a strong showing in the new hampshire primary , according to exit poll results and projections , he failed to win enough support from several key groups to cut deeply into mr romney s lead in new hampshire , mr paul s supporters were younger half of those under age 29 backed him and roughly 3 in 10 from ages 30 to 44 voted for him among those who said they were socially moderate or liberal , mr paul drew about 3 in 10 voters independents split their vote , with mr paul getting the nod from about 3 in 10 independents , nearly the same as mr romney and jon huntsman , who got about 2 in 10 he drew about 1 in 5 fiscal conservatives about three in five voters said cutting the budget , even if it limits job growth , should be a higher priority for the next president mr paul , with his proposed trilliondollar budget cut proposal , attracted almost 3 in 10 of these deficit hawks , about equal to mitt romney s draw but the economy as an issue dwarfed the deficit , and more of those economyfocused voters supported mr romney about a quarter of voters who said they were very worried about the future of the nation s economy supported him , but more supported mr romney about 3 in 10n of those who said they were falling behind financially supported mr paul , about the same number that supported mr romney allison kopicki , a polling analyst , contributed to this post  kate phillips manchester , nh

in the 2012 presidential race and boosting his chances at becoming his party s nominee this fall the new york times and other news organizations declared mr romney the winner in the race just moments after the polls closed at 8 pm eastern time tuesday , based on exit polls and early returns the margin of his victory and the order of those behind him remain uncertain until more votes are counted mr romney barely won iowa s caucuses a week ago , besting rick santorum by a mere eight votes out of more than 100 , 000 cast mr romney s second white house bid had been premised from the beginning on the idea that he could win in new hampshire , a state he has all but adopted as his own in the years since senator john mccain dashed his hopes here in the previous republican primary announcing his candidacy at a family farm in stratham , nh , last summer , mr romney praised the state s voters for being the ones who kick off the political process every four years you decide who will give that state of the union address , who will set the course of the country , who will be commander in chief , mr romney said that day mr romney has led the field here for months , and in recent weeks seemed out of reach for his rivals , who trailed by double digits but the contest here turned especially ugly in the last few days as several of his rivals attacked mr romney s stewardship of an investment firm he founded those attacks had seemed to chip away at mr romney s lead after they were delivered to a nationwide television audience during an nbc meet the press debate on sunday morning but polls released tuesday morning suggested that mr romney remained well ahead of the rest of the field as the state s voters began arriving at their polling locations anticipating a victory by mr romney here , his rivals have vowed to try to stop him in south carolina , a state where evangelical voters and conservatives tend to have more sway than they do in new hampshire but mr romney s campaign advisers have expressed confidence in robust operations in south carolina and other states they have said they are ready for the attacks in future contests and they have argued that they are prepared for a long fight to collect the needed delegates to clinch the nomination  michael d shear the candidates made their last appearances , some only for the benefit of media organizations , in new hampshire on primary night  the caucus  the caucus greenville , sc primary \? what primary \? while the political universe revolved around the voting in new hampshire today , there were people in at least one state yes , this one who seemed distracted by other \( more important , they would say \) concerns first of all , there is their very own south carolina primary coming up in just 11 days , and what better time for voters to take a quick breather before the marathon gladhanding begins in earnest \? although gov rick perry of texas has been campaigning all week and kept himself especially busy today , none of the other candidates are in town they arrive en masse on wednesday there s also this cultural reality people are still recovering from the big contest of monday night , when two football titans of the south louisiana state university and the university of alabama took to the field in new orleans if anything is the talk of this town , it s how alabama s defense didn t allow lsu to score even once not even a field goal ! did you see that game \? seems like everybody here did your correspondent , being a native of louisiana , appreciated the enthusiasm , if not the outcome \( geaux tigers ! \) but cutting back to politics , on wednesday , the republican candidates will descend on the state newt gingrich will be in spartanburg and rock hill representative ron paul of texas will be in west columbia jon m huntsman jr , a former governor of utah , will be in columbia mitt romney , a former massachusetts governor , will also be in columbia mr perry , who is already here , will make five stops in four towns south carolina , this will be your moment ! excited \? sort of , said chris isham , a 25yearold photographer and likely republican primary voter burnout happens quickly mr isham s friend aaron greene , 31 , said he had watched one debate before the iowa caucuses , was undecided about whom to support , and was already a bit weary i m tired of it and we re just getting started , he said that s kind of why i m not so excited , because i know it s a long haul mr greene expressed concern about how attackoriented the last couple of weeks have been for the republican contenders he is not looking forward to seeing more of that i hope that the battle for the primary doesn t destroy our candidate for the big game against obama , he said in any group of friends , there s usually one person who qualifies as the political one the person who likes the drama of it , and closely follows the news among these friends , that person is zach franzen , 33 , an artist  i m probably the most interested person in politics that i know , and even i am disinterested in the race at this point , said mr franzen , a republican who lives in greenville it seems that mitt romney has it all tied up at this point in new hampshire and i think the iowa stuff did get pretty ugly he continued the people here are very conservative and politics is really a blood sport , but this election , it seems that romney is running for the general and i think people aren t excited about that i get the feeling that he is trying to bypass the people who are most avidly political in south carolina because he thinks it will hurt him a quick check of the campaign schedule shows that mr romney will have a lot of time in the state to either prove or disprove that notion over the next week and a half in the meantime , campaign workers have been busy behind the scenes getting things ready for what they consider the truly important primary most people don t care much about what comes out of new hampshire , said kerry wood , the south carolina state director of rick santorum s campaign most southerners are not too connected to what comes out of the northeast region we re not going to be steered or swayed by anywhere else  susan saulny manchester , nh outside the polling place at ward 3 , ron paul was the only candidate with any supporters present voters there seemed to share the candidate s politics i considered romney , only because i thought he had a better chance in the general election , said rob fremeau , a 31yearold republican who only recently solidified his support for ron paul he s got some momentum he can make good numbers here he did well in iowa maybe we can push this thing a little further down the line jeff reno , 40 , a martial arts instructor , said he applies the same principles to his economic policies to the litigation for morality that we have in this country he doesn t support or advocate abortion in his own life he realizes that it s not his position to push that view onto everyone else that coincides more with my beliefs paul boudreau , 59 , an independent customer service agent , said he appreciated mr paul s unwillingness to play politics like the other candidates , specifically mitt romney i know he s the favorite , said mr boudreau , i don t know why  will storey since world war ii , just 24 men \( yes , all men \) have been nominated for president by one of the two major parties and every time a new choice emerges , political observers look for parallels from recent history given mitt romney s advantages in the 2012 republican race , that process started long before he secures the nomination some of the comparisons are flattering others are not disaffected conservatives liken mr romney , a former massachusetts governor , to the 1948 republican nominee , thomas dewey , another welltodo northeastern state executive \( new york \) who blew a winnable race against a vulnerable incumbent , president harry s truman others see mr romney as a latterday george hw bush , who carried the republican banner in 1988 after serving as ronald reagan s vice president both had prominent republican political fathers \( gov george romney of michigan and senator prescott bush of connecticut \) , and have the bearing of patricians , fuzzy ideological profiles and reputations for personal rectitude some comments by mr romney suggesting that he lacks the common touch have evoked memories of the 2004 democratic contender john kerry another wealthy massachusetts politician who had difficulty connecting with average voters veterans of the 1996 campaign view mr romney as a latterday bob dole , who ground out a victory as the nextinline contender for the republican mantle despite the misgivings of significant portions of an ideologically charged primary electorate mr dole had lost the 1988 nomination to george hw bush the secondtime around guy , said ken khachigian , a longtime republican campaign operative the same description applies to the elder mr bush , who won the presidency , and to john mccain , who lost the 2000 nomination to george w bush before winning the 2008 nomination and falling that november to barack obama mr romney s campaign would like the relevant comparison to be ronald reagan in 1980 a former california governor then , mr reagan ran to change the nation s economic course against a democratic incumbent , jimmy carter , who seemed unable to turn the nation around mr reagan beat mr carter in a landslide but one veteran of the younger mr bush s campaign fears a different parallel that of michael dukakis , another massachusetts governor , who won the 1988 democratic nomination it does have some appeal from an analytical point of view , said daron shaw , a university of texas political scientist who advised the 2000 and 2004 bush campaigns like mr dukakis , he explained , mr romney is a guy who s going to campaign on competence like mr dukakis , mr romney will face an incumbent president s skillful political team running a populist campaign george hw bush s campaign ran on a social populism that painted democrats and their nominee as out of the political mainstream on crime , patriotism and other issues president obama is planning a campaign of economic populism , arguing that mr romney is out of touch with middleclass concerns it s mostly about painting an unacceptable contrast , mr shaw concluded for the party trying to win back the white house , it looks good for a while , but then the incumbent party peels the bark off the challenger  john harwood merrimack , nh john gautieri , 46 , a retail manager , was undecided until recently , torn between mr romney s experience as a governor and mr gingrich s experience as house speaker but he ended up voting for mr huntsman he has experience in foreign affairs , mr gautieri said i want someone who can communicate with world leaders he briefly considered mr paul , he said , but believes that we do need allies america can t just go off and be a separate entity , he said kenny howe , 45 , a construction worker , said he had considered ron paul but decided that he was too old and voted for mr huntsman he said he was too busy to watch the debates but his mother suggested mr huntsman , and so he voted for him colleen mccarthy , 34 , a teacher , said she voted for mr huntsman because she liked that he talked about restoring trust he seems to be straightforward and he wants to rebuild the trust , and that s lacking all over , she said she had briefly considered rick santorum because she liked his emphasis on family values , but decided that the trust issue was bigger no one trusts washington anymore , she said  katharine q seelye  the caucus manchester , nh for months , polls have indicated what republican voters said anecdotally they were frustrated by their choices as they picked a presidential nominee but the voters in new hampshire tonight are pushing back against that narrative twothirds report that they are satisfied with their current field of republican primary candidates only around 3 in 10 say they would like to see another candidate running for the nomination when it comes to the specific candidates , however , only a mitt romney nomination would satisfy a majority of voters threefifths of primary voters say they would be satisfied if mitt romney won the republican nomination in contrast , only twofifths or fewer would be happy with each of three other leading contenders newt gingrich \( just over onethird \) , ron

romney is lucky tonight , he might be giving a victory speech before television viewers on the west coast even sit down to dinner last week , when it was unclear who had won the iowa caucuses hours after they ended on tuesday , mr romney did not speak until 12 30 am wednesday eastern time , long after most viewers had turned off their tvs and computers but tonight , network executives expect to be able to project a winner of the new hampshire primary close to the time that the final polls close in the state and they expect the winner to be mr romney the secondplace finisher will most likely take longer to determine , giving political pundits plenty to chew on well into the evening early projections would maximize the potential primetime audience for the winner s speech in new hampshire the republican strategist steve schmidt alluded to the possibility on msnbc on tuesday evening i think tonight what mitt romney s hoping for is to have an early call on the race , mr schmidt said , so he can go out , give a victory speech between 9 , 9 30 pm , not have to wait past 11 pm to begin to put this awful 48 hours behind him  brian stelter manchester , nh one of the key voting blocs in the 2012 election has been the young ron paul , in particular , has been targeting that group we will know more later tonight about how those groups voted , and whether young people helped mr paul boost

10 were under 44 about a third of voters had total family incomes over 100 , 000 , and about twothirds of voters had incomes under 100 , 000 \( new hampshire is a fairly wealthy state , and had the

the first time they voted in a republican presidential primary in last week s iowa caucuses , nearly 4 in 10 were firsttime caucusgoers but the republican primary this year has confounded many voters , who said they decided only in the last several days , as the candidates picked up their efforts to win support here in the data so far , there are about as many late deciders in new hampshire as there were in iowa last week nearly half of new hampshire voters say they made up their minds only within the last few days , including about 2 in 10 who said they decided just today in iowa , ron paul beat out the other candidates among firsttime voters , while late deciders favored rick santorum we ll keep an eye on later data coming in from new hampshire to see who these groups support today

biologists \( one \) , it could be a good night for jon m huntsman jr this is not just any bear biologist this is the bear biologist in new hampshire he is eric orff \( a bear of a man , naturally \) and he was new hampshire s chief bear biologist from 1978 to 1998 we encountered mr orff at the bar of the radisson hotel on tuesday afternoon , where he was drinking a budweiser and wearing a tan baseball cap with the likeness of a a big black bear on its front mr orff said he voted for mr huntsman , a former governor of utah , because mr huntsman was the only candidate who has been talking about global warming this is a matter of big concern to mr orff , who lives in the town of epsom and who has watched the habits of the state s 5 , 000 or so black bears shift with the changing climate i study the bears , obviously , said mr orff we have a wandering bear problem here when the weather is warmer , he explained , the bears are less likely to sleep so they will move into residential areas in search of food they dip into bird feeders they become a nuisance to people , though generally not a threat new hampshire s bears are the generally nonlethal black variety \( no polar or grizzlies here \) the last time someone was killed by a wild bear in the state of new hampshire was 1783 , said mr orff on the other hand , 418 bears were killed by people in the state last year during its septembernovember bearhunting season these are the kinds of factoids you learn from a bear biologist you encounter on primary day mr orff , an independent , became the state s bear biologist after working as a fish biologist when the permanent bear biologist job opened up , i jumped at it , he said new hampshire s bears thrived under his stewardship , he said under my tenure , the state s bear population went from 1 , 000 to 5 , 000 , he said in addition to his own vote , mr huntsman received the vote of mr orff s sister and niece so maybe there s something to this

television appearance , then headed to polling places , where he honed the case he would be making against mr romney beginning at a 9 am appearance on wednesday in rock hill , sc after his disappointing fourthplace finish in the iowa caucuses , mr gingrich has told downtrodden new hampshire supporters , in essence , to take heart , we ll lick em in the south the contours of his strategy there are well known to box mr romney in as too moderate , while simultaneously appealing to an antiwall street populism , flaying mr romney for making millions buying and selling companies at the expense of ordinary workers who lost jobs i have no problem with free enterprise , mr gingrich said but i do have some real questions if the investors took all the money and the employees took all the losses he also signaled that he will defend his right flank in south carolina from the conservative alternative of rick santorum in a rare chat with reporters aboard his campaign s press bus , mr gingrich said , if there s a clear distinction with , say , santorum , it is i actually know how to build a nationwide campaign and he lost pennsylvania by the largest margin of any senator in the history of the state if the reactions of a handful of voters here are a guide , the attack on the source of mr romney s wealth could be risky it could alienate supporters who rallied for him because of his early , now inoperative vow to run a positive campaign several new hampshire voters said they had decided on jon m huntsman jr because they were turned off by mr gingrich s recent turn to negativity we live in a free capitalist society , said laura gardner , 47 , of merrimack , who said she decided to vote for mr huntsman in recent days after rejecting both mr gingrich and mr romney i can t speak knowledgeably enough on what bain did , but i don t like that they re going after each other  trip gabriel manchester , nh mr romney barely edged out an eightvote victory in iowa over mr santorum last week if surveys are right , he will beat mr santorum by a much wider margin in new hampshire why \? one reason is that the two states are very different demographically , as demonstrated by information provided to pollsters as voters exited tonight compared with iowa s caucusgoers , new hampshire s primary voters include more independents , fewer evangelicals and a more moderate makeup over all , early results from exit polls show preliminary results of new hampshire exit polls show that nearly half of the primary voters identify as independents or something else , and half consider themselves republican about half of today s voters say they are conservative on most political matters , while a third say they are moderate about 1 in 5 primary voters say they are very conservative , and about 1 in 10 say they are liberal fiscal conservatives outnumber social conservatives in new hampshire s primary about twothirds of new hampshire voters say they are conservative on fiscal issues like taxes and spending , while only about 4 in 10 say they are conservative on social issues , like gay marriage or abortion compared with caucusgoers in iowa , new hampshire republican primary voters include proportionately more independents , more moderates , and fewer very conservative people there were also fewer tea party supporters , fewer bornagain evangelicals , and fewer rural people among new hampshire s republican primary voters results from iowa s entrance poll showed that 23 percent of caucusgoers were independents , and 75 percent were republicans in new hampshire tonight , preliminary exit poll data shows that about half of the voters identify as independents evangelicals accounted for a majority of caucusgoers in iowa , providing a big boost to rick santorum , while about one in five new hampshire primary voters identify as evangelical or bornagain christians nearly half 47 percent of iowa caucusgoers described themselves as very conservative , compared with about one in five new hampshire primary voters about half of new hampshire voters said they were somewhat or very conservative on most political matters , and nearly half said they considered themselves moderate or liberal and the tea party had less influence here nearly twothirds of iowa caucusgoers said they supported the tea party , while about half of new hampshire s primary voters said they did allison kopicki , a polling analyst , contributed to this post  michael d shear merrimack , nh rick santorum has had one of the more unusual rides of the candidates who joined the sixday sprint to the new hampshire primary he came in exhilarated from his unexpected nearwin in iowa last tuesday , when he lost to mitt romney , the frontrunner , by just eight votes that showing put relatively high expectations on mr santorum here he enjoyed a classic iowa bounce , as voters flocked to his events and he seemed to build up a head of steam but he has a high mountain to climb he had barely been registering in the polls here until recently and while he garnered considerable attention , it was often because of protests against his opposition to gay rights and abortion rights while he won points for taking questions from all comers and standing up to the hostility , it is not clear that he won many more votes than he might have polls suggest that he will finish near the bottom of the sixman field he says that repeating his iowa performance and coming in second here would be a dream come true and he has lowered expectations that he might he held no public events tuesday , spurning the usual lastminute appeals at polling places and spending his day instead conducting radio and television interviews and planning for the battle ahead in south carolina , where his future appears much brighter a rally monday night at a restaurant in manchester turned out to be his final public event , and it ended on a downbeat note he was surrounded by rowdy protesters from ron paul s campaign and from the occupy movement , who jeered at him and shouted bigot ! and shame ! his security staff closed ranks around him , his wife and the two of their seven children who accompanied them during a scuffle , one of his aides and a protester were knocked to the ground in his farewell address to the state inside the restaurant , he said he hoped that a strong showing tuesday night would give us that boost to show the momentum so that we can go down to south carolina , kick a little butt down in south carolina , move on to florida and keep kicking until we have a strong principled conservative in the model of ronald reagan few campaigns are looking as forward to south carolina as mr santorum s polls show him in second place , again behind mr romney mr santorum has already bought television time in south carolina , and the state s voters are more hospitable to his brand of conservatism he will have more money and more staff members , who had to plot strategy here on the fly they are even looking ahead to florida , where they are starting to organize county chairmen the barebones campaign here was not prepared to take advantage of the iowa bounce mr santorum spent no advertising money in new hampshire because it was too late to buy the time , and he had no serious money anyway and no expectations before iowa put him on the map the campaign had planned for only small venues in new hampshire , so when he came roaring in after iowa , he drew much larger crowds than anyone had been able to plan for this made his events seem packed , but could create a sense of haphazardness that sometimes worked to his disadvantage one night last week , for example , he had reserved the relatively small belmont restaurant in manchester for a townhallstyle meeting but so many people showed up that the fire marshal moved the event outside , to the parking lot , where it was dark and he had to compete for attention with protesters and mr santorum had no microphone , so few people could hear him but mr santorum kept plugging away , and that is what he plans to do in south carolina  katharine q seelye manchester , nh the weeklong campaign in new hampshire shifted dramatically toward a discussion about jobs exit polls show why this may be according to the polls , new hampshire voters say they are very concerned with the national economy , while they are feeling solid when it comes to their own finances over 90 percent are either very \( twothirds \) or somewhat \( onequarter \) worried about the direction of the nation s economy over the next few years at the same time , twothirds say that their own financial situation is holding steady fewer than 20 percent say they are falling behind perhaps as a result of this national concern combined with personal security , their primary economic concern is controlling the deficit rather than spending on job growth about threefifths want to focus on cutting the deficit , even if it limits job growth the remaining twofifths would prefer to focus on job growth even if it increases the deficit monika l mcdermott , a polling analyst , contributed to this post  michael d shear

hampshire voters call the economy the issue that matters most to them in deciding which candidate to support if that pattern holds as more new hampshire voters explain their voting rationale , then that issue would be far more important than it was in iowa \( 42 percent of iowa caucus voters said the same \) about a quarter of new hampshire voters say the budget deficit is their top issue in iowa , nearly one in four said they were looking most for someone who is a true conservative fewer have said the same as they exited polling locations in new hampshire about a third of new hampshire voters say the candidate quality that matters most to them is the ability to defeat president obama in november , while about a quarter say the quality is the right experience , and nearly as many say it is a strong moral character dalia sussman , polling editor , contributed to this post  michael d shear washington if it s a big republican primary night , it must be time for another big barack obama newspaper ad the obama campaign , fresh from its incursion last week into the iowa caucuses , which were supposed to be an allrepublican affair , has taken out another giant advertisement , this one on the home page of the union leader of manchester , nh readers who clicked on the home page of the newspaper s web site perhaps to check republican primary news were treated to a giant mug of president obama , looking determinedly off into the distance , above this caption only barack obama is fighting for the middle class if that sounds familiar , it s because the obama campaign took a similar action last week , when it staked out territory on the home page of the des moines register on the day of the iowa caucuses , calling the policies of all of the republicans running for president terrible meanwhile on tuesday , a helpful email from the democratic national committee to interested parties read reporters tried to move the bar on the perception of a victory by the frontrunner , mr romney by anyone s reckoning , romney should be running away with this thing , brad woodhouse , the communications director , said in the email , pointing to mr romney s home in the state and the fact that he worked and raised a family next door in massachusetts if romney doesn t greatly exceed the 32 points he got in his 2008 secondplace finish , this will be a loss for him  helene cooper it s been said a few times in recent weeks , but let s say it again polls in new hampshire can be off quite a bit in the days leading up to the nation s first primary in the last week , everybody was trying to figure out whether a particular candidate \( rick santorum \) received much of a bounce from his very tightclosing tally in iowa , even though conservatives in new hampshire tend to be more concerned about fiscal issues than social ones and indeed , he has gone from about 3 percent on dec 30 to the low double digits , but he hasn t moved much in recent days , at least according to the tracking polls of course , several candidates in the gop field have been sliding up and down , as new hampshire s potential voters meet and vet the candidates some even suspect that the weekend s back to back debates helped cement a few voters choices in watching for news out of the exit polls and actual returns tonight , though , hang on to a little of that granitespiced suspense that s what we ve learned about new hampshire from a few previous election cycles the state s voters love a surprise delivery or two and that s why polls this late in the game with sizable pockets of voters undecided or willing to change their mind can be easily misread , misleading or even behind the curve \( several of us were joking this week that we all know of people who stop answering their phones in the final days , because they have been inundated with robocalls from campaigns and survey companies and questioners from some of these automated polls that are the most frequently deployed , like those from public policy polling or the american research group , cannot by law contact cellphones and cellonly users make up a larger and larger percent of american households , now up to about 31 percent \) so those are big caveats heading into tonight , backed by the evidence of previous new hampshire primary stunners for example , remember how bill clinton , who came in second place , emerged as the comeback kid in 1992 and rendered that year in one simple slogan , it s the economy , stupid \? and much has been made of how nearly every poll in 2008 showed barack obama , the democratic winner of iowa s caucuses , several points ahead of hillary rodham clinton in new hampshire in fact , she wound up winning the state by a few points but a more telling example of polls gone awry can be found among the republican field of 2008 late tracking polls showed mitt romney with around 30 percent leading into new hampshire s primary , after mike huckabee won iowa \( and he had 13 percent in new hampshire \) but the candidate whose bus often seemed parked in a snowbank outside events in that state day after day senator john mccain was polling in the midtohigher 20s in the end , senator mccain pulled 5 points ahead of mr romney , getting 37 percent to mr romney s 32 percent the senator gained 10 or more points above his showing in the final days of tracking , defying seabiscuit odds , especially after nearly ignoring iowa and with south carolina ahead on the track the numbers are a little different this time according to the latest suffolk university tracking polls , which included interviews of likely republican and independent voters sunday and monday , mr romney has crept back up and no one in the field is polling as close as mr mccain did to mr romney in 2008 this time around , suffolk shows that mr romney leads at 37 percent ron paul at 18 percent jon m huntsman jr , who probably has clocked the most hours in the state in the last several weeks , up to 16 percent rick santorum at 11 percent and newt gingrich at 9 percent is there a wild card among them \? will the race for second place be more dynamic than it looks \? mr santorum , and even mr huntsman , has gotten a lot more attention since iowa we ll have to wait a few more hours to find out whether the real votes align with the polls meanwhile , we ll be watching the exit polls rolling in , and they may give us some clues allison kopicki contributed to this post  kate phillips manchester , nh polls here will remain open for several more hours as the republican candidates prepare to dash from the state unlike the iowa contest last week , new hampshire s is a traditional primary , with voters casting their ballots throughout the day here are a few things to keep in mind as we await the results 1 a romney sweep winning both iowa and new hampshire is a rare thing and is a key step toward mitt romney s plan a a quick , decisive capture of the nomination he also has a plan b a long slog to amass delegates but none of his advisers would deny that they prefer going the first route 2 second place matters the expectation that mr romney will win the primary tonight means that there will be as much focus on who comes in second but look for the big question to be whether the secondplace finisher has the resources and the appeal to build on that finish in coming weeks 3 victory \( or defeat \) speeches they matter rick santorum s address after iowa impressed voters and donors as he headed to new hampshire shrill and bitter speeches rarely work well neither do speeches that appear to take the process for granted 4 independents are key exit polls will help answer the question about which candidate is best able to appeal to independents , who often turn out in big numbers in new hampshire that could be an important signal for how mr romney , or one of the other candidates , might do against president obama in the fall  michael d shear

of all the vulnerable democratic incumbents in the senate , none might be more endangered than missouri s claire mccaskill , but the one bright spot in her uphill climb toward reelection has been the disarray on the republican side , where three senate hopefuls have battled for advantage for months on monday afternoon , one of those candidates , a businessman named john brunner , will get a big boost with the endorsement of freedomworks , a conservative group that helped inspire the tea party movement  max pappas , freedomworks s vice president of public policy and government affairs , said it took three different rounds of emails to the group s 24 , 000 contacts in missouri to start getting a sense that conservatives were coalescing around mr brunner over former state treasurer sarah steelman and united states representative todd akin long interviews with the three candidates all conservatives convinced the group that mr brunner , a former marine corp infantry officer , had the deepest intellectual background in free market economics of the three , mr pappa said freedomworks was an early backer of state treasurer richard mourdock of indiana in his longshot campaign to unseat veteran senator richard lugar mr mourdock s stunning victory on tuesday has thrown the spotlight back on the groups that helped lift his candidacy in an interview , mr brunner , whose personal wealth could be a difference maker , compared his candidacy to senator ron johnson of wisconsin , another businessman and political neophyte who rode the tea party wave in 2010 to beat incumbent russell d feingold he allied himself with the senate s most stalwart conservatives , kentucky s rand paul , oklahoma s tom coburn , and south carolina s jim demint  mr brunner also seconded mr mourdock s call for less cooperation and more conservative leadership good leaders have a way of sticking to principles and getting people to follow , he said too many people are there for their own careers and their own advancement we ve got to get more people up there who are thinking longer term and not just on the issue of the minute

on sept 26 , the uttar pradesh cabinet approved construction on the agralucknow access controlled expressway , the chief minister akhilesh yadav s ambitious , 270kilometer \( 168mile \) highway project that promises to connect two of the state s most populous cities in nearly half the time it currently takes it s the latest attempt by mr yadav to differentiate himself from his predecessor , mayawati , who goes by one name during her fiveyear term , ms mayawati erected statues and parks at considerable public expense in a bid to make her mark on the state she also proposed the building of the 1 , 047kilometer ganga expressway , designed to connect uttar pradesh from its eastern border of ballia to its western most border of noida and the vast metropolis of delhi today , the highway lies unfinished and utterly abandoned burdened by land acquisition issues and accusations of fraud , the failure of the ganga expressway has become to many uttar pradesh residents just another symbol of ms mayawati s gross mismanagement of the state s alreadyweakened finances time will tell whether or not mr yadav s ambitions succeed or meet a similar fate , but given and its shortages of power and water , the margin for error here is painfully thin the agralucknow expressway is a more modest project compared to the ganga expressway , but one that is necessary for the state s growth , mr yadav contended development will increase here , mr yadav said of what he hopes to become one of the signature accomplishments of his first year in office all the towns along the path of the highway , places like fatehabad , shikohabad , saifai , etawah , mainpuri , kannauj , and hardoi , for example , are agricultural communities that can benefit by getting products to consumers and sellers in major cities faster , and more efficiently , he said like the ganga expressway , it is intended to be financed through a publicprivate partnership redecon india , a consulting and engineering firm that specializes in transportation , designed the project the private limited company said that it has no special relationship with mr yadav , and it has helped plan infrastructure projects throughout india , including highways in bihar and delhi tr bhau , a managing director for redecon , estimated that the project will cost the state around 110 billion rupees \( 2 billion \) and will be completed by 2018 , soon after mr yadav s first term is finished certainly this highway will drastically save time , and generate resources for the state , mr bhau said agriculture , trade and commerce will be increased , he said , because when businesses save time , they save costs he absolutely expected the debtburdened state to recoup the expenditures for the highway quickly , he said of course , none of this will happen if mr yadav cannot finish the expressway , an outcome that is by no means guaranteed sharad misra , a former economic adviser to the indian government , who specializes in transportation , said in a recent interview that in india , the projects that adhere to a strict timeline are the ones that ultimately are completed the trouble is that many of them end up taking too long to be completed for a number of reasons , mr misra said when a thing is abandoned too long it tends to disappear mismanagement and corruption are two of the leading causes for delayed infrastructure projects throughout india , two things that mr yadav pledged to do away with in his home state so far , that he has not done that successfully mr yadav s ability to win a second term , which he intends to pursue is likely to hinge on the successful implementation of projects like the agralucknow highway ms mayawati , who will be a relatively young 61 by 2017 , will inevitably be there to challenge him with her bahujan samaj party counterparts and powerful contingent of dalit support mr yadav s strategy has already demonstrated its potential to backfire while unveiling plans for an it park in lucknow in april , a project meant to spur development in computers and technology in the city , mr yadav announced chidingly , the last government had established stone parks we want to establish it parks as of the august deadline , however , the it park had received the support of only two investors , delaying the project and giving some critics a reason to label the venture a failure the project was given an extended deadline of nov 5 , but mr yadav s administration has yet to update the public on the project s status but in a recent interview , anil gupta , the industrial development commissioner for the state of uttar pradesh , expressed doubt about whether the it park would ever come to fruition the two investors are backtracking and have been given additional time , mr gupta conceded i m no longer very optimistic about the construction of the park all is not lost , however mr gupta said that the uttar pradesh finance ministers are in the process of finalizing the land acquisition for an it city and that the administration was in the process of hearing plans from potential developers once we hear ideas from five to 10 developers , we can start moving forward , mr gupta said the it city , he said , would be approximately 150 acres , six times the size of the proposed 25acre it park , making it far more attractive to investors there will be hotels , apartments , he says it will be the kind of place where people can walk to work mr gupta , who works very closely with mr yadav on proposed infrastructure projects , said the chief minister is aware of the pressing need to see them through to completion and is willing to fight for his vision as far as priorities are concerned , mr gupta said , i d say that infrastructure and development is right at the top of his list michael edison hayden is an currently living in mumbai you can follow him on twitter
i grew up in arvada , colo , in the shadow of a nuclear bomb factory , so i read the justreleased report on the fukushima meltdown in japan with special interest coinciding with the first anniversary of the fukushima daiichi disaster , the 400page report details the extensive misinformation supplied to the public by the tokyo electric power company \( tepco \) in collusion with japanese officials the japanese government s failure to warn citizens about radioactive danger put the entire city of tokyo at health risk and the rest of us as well the report , which was written by an independent investigative panel established by the rebuild japan initiative foundation \( published march 1 in the bulletin of the atomic scientists \) , bluntly states that the much vaunted absolute safety of nuclear power is no more than a twisted myth the threat from nuclear power plants is twofold grand scale catastrophe and continuing health problems connected with radioactive contamination in our air , water , soil and food supply both shortterm , highlevel contamination and the longterm , lowlevel kind in japan , radiation was detected in beef , milk , spinach , tea leaves and rice and more than a dozen cities in the united states tested positive for fallout from fukushima in their water supplies scientists found radiation from japan in milk from phoenix to little rock , ark , to montpelier , vt a year later , many questions about fukushima s operations remain unanswered tepco may be the latest in a line of the nuclear businesses with a selfimposed mandate to suppress truth here in the united states , we have our own tightly held radioactive secrets rocky flats , the now notorious colorado bomb factory , produced plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons in the united states from 1952 to 1989 there were countless fires , leaks and accidents at rocky flats after decades of weapons production , and little environmental oversight , the area was profoundly contaminated during my childhood , none of us knew exactly what the plant actually did the rumor in the neighborhood was that it made household cleaning products we knew nothing about the 5 , 000 tainted barrels that leaked plutonium into the soil nor did we know about the two large fires , in 1957 and 1969 , that sent radioactive plumes over the denver metro area wind and water carried toxic elements into surrounding neighborhoods , including mine the public was never warned energy department studies confirm that plutonium , carbon tetrachloride and other radioactive and toxic contaminants routinely escaped from the plant although the plant closed more than 20 years ago , a recent study suggests that plutonium may be migrating into neighboring areas the connection between fukushima and rocky flats was made explicit when recent soil tests for offsite plutonium at rocky flats found cesium from fukushima i worked at rocky flats but did n't realize what kind of risks the plant posed until a 1994 nightline special informed me i was working next to 14 tons of plutonium , most of it unsafely stored one man tried to sound an alarm dr carl johnson , jefferson county health director from 1973 to 1981 , directed numerous studies on contamination levels and health risks the plant posed to public health based on his conclusions , dr johnson opposed housing development near rocky flats he was fired later studies confirmed many of his findings the government and private operators of rocky flats say that there s been no harm to local residents and that the plutonium that has escaped from the plant potentially as much as three tons over nearly four decades is harmless it s no greater than a pinch of salt and pepper , edward putzier , the health physics manager for dow chemical , which used to operate rocky flats , told a civic group in 1971 one difference between salt and pepper and plutonium is that onemillionth of a gram of plutonium , if inhaled or ingested , can cause cancer also plutonium , unlike salt or pepper , is invisible rocky flats was in my backyard , but our collective backyard from tokyo to cincinnati to denver to benton county , wash , home of hanford , which housed nine nuclear reactors and is now one of the most heavily contaminated places on earth is under similar threat interestingly , in 1991 when congress approved closure of fernald , an ohio uranium processing facility , federal scientists conceded that no one could ever safely live there , and that the site would have to be closely monitored forever the only absolute is the potential for tragedy yet president obama supports investment in nuclear energy , including two new nuclear power plants in georgia the national nuclear security administration wants to build a new facility to increase trigger production at los alamos national laboratory , in new mexico and in colorado there s a big push to build a highway and expand business and residential development on contaminated land in spite of everything we 've learned , profit continues to trump safety in 1995 , the department of energy said it would take 50 years and 37 billion to clean up rocky flats , and it was n't sure the technology existed to do the job the doe later awarded a 35 billion contract to kaiserhill to clean up the site the energy department based the standards for the cleanup project on the exposure level

baltimore horsemen have many ways of evaluating a thoroughbred s energy levels after a demanding race feel their legs for heat check on the way they eat but sometimes , it is not complicated sometimes , exhausted horses just sulk the hall of fame trainer was looking for signs over the last week or so , ever since his 3yearold bodemeister ran a blistering and brave race in the  i was worried he might be wiped out and just stay in the back of his stall for three days , baffert said of his horse , who was run down in the derby by i 'll have another , the eventual winner , in the final 100 yards but baffert found nothing worrisome no injuries , no temperature , no pouting and so on monday said he saw no reason not to run bodemeister in the on saturday at pimlico in baltimore in short order , baffert s confident pronouncement on what he had seen in his colt compelled multiple trainers of rival horses to say they had seen enough the connections for hansen and several other horses declared they would not run in the preakness against the derby winner and the speedy runnerup the demurrals are hard to fault baffert has won the preakness five times and knows how to condition a winning runner in the second jewel of the it is also a race that , at a mile and threesixteenths , can be won with early speed that does not have to last quite as long as in the mileandaquarter derby on monday morning , baffert joined the colt s owner , ahmed zayat , to watch bodemeister gallop a brisk mileandahalf circuit at churchill downs , the site of the derby of course we want redemption after the derby , said zayat , who also finished second in the derby with pioneerof the nile in 2009 and nehro in 2011 he ran a brilliant race to get beat like that after such a performance would lead one to say he deserves a chance to come back in the preakness , but i'm very protective of my horses and he had to show us he was happy , healthy and ready to go bodemeister was born ready in the derby , he led 19 other contenders behind a quartermile in 2232 seconds and a halfmile in 4539 only a superhorse could set some of the fastest early fractions in derby history and hang on in 137 previous runnings , only 10 horses sped the first halfmile in 454 seconds or less , and all faded to 10th or worse but there was bodemeister , the favorite at 41 , gangly legs churning , opening a threelength advantage at the top of the stretch under jockey mike smith s desperate hands and that was when his nemesis appeared i 'll have another , a 151 shot who had won the santa anita derby , came rolling from midpack with the determination of one destined to shatter dreams his gutsy run left bodemeister one and a half lengths short of a remarkable victory he was glorious in defeat , baffert said it was the only time i 've run second where i 've been happy , because he ran his race one cause for bodemeister s energetic condition coming off a sizzling derby run is his light r sum the colt has only five starts , none as a 2yearold he clocked 26 workouts in 2011 an unusual amount of preparation before his first start at the beginning of 2012 it was a fiveandahalffurlong sprint in the middle of january he ran second stretched out to a twoturn mile in his next start feb 11 , bodemeister smashed a maiden field by nine and a quarter lengths after a runnerup finish behind creative cause in the san felipe stakes going a mile and a sixteenth on march 10 , he had one shot at the big time win the arkansas derby and collect enough graded earnings to make the kentucky derby field he did that wiretowire romp by nine and a half lengths under smith on april 14 at oaklawn park gave racing fans a glimpse of things to come he just has so much raw talent , baffert said creative cause , went the day well , optimizer and daddy nose best are the only ones likely from the original 20horse derby field to face i 'll have another and bodemeister in the preakness frank carulli , the oddsmaker for the maryland jockey club , said he would install baffert s blazefaced colt as the morningline favorite wednesday afternoon when post positions are drawn that was also when the colt was scheduled to arrive in maryland even the derbywinning trainer doug o'neill recognized this runnerup as a dangerous foe i respect bodemeister and his connections big time , said o'neill , who has been conditioning i 'll have another at pimlico since may 7 what he did in arkansas was just wowing , and then to come back and do what he did in the kentucky derby was incredible but my colt is three for three this year and he s done nothing but win , so as long as he keeps doing that , i'm ok one would not blame the trainer for showing confidence in his contender the derby victory belongs to him but that will not deter bodemeister s connections from seeking a chance at vindication he just has to run that derby race back , said smith , who will be in the saddle again saturday if he runs his race like that , we 'll be in good shape to get the job done it s not like we 're trying to send him to the lead , it s just that he runs faster than everybody else if someone wants to take the lead , they 'll have to try to come and get him

the four players whose suspensions for their suspected roles in the ' bounty program were vacated by an appeals panel on friday will meet with nfl commissioner , as he prepares to determine what new discipline he will impose saints linebacker jonathan vilma , whose earlier suspension was to last the entire season and who has filed a defamation lawsuit against goodell , will meet with him early next week , said his lawyer peter ginsburg george atallah , a spokesman for the players' union who is representing the other three players , said tuesday that the union was involved in establishing conditions for the meeting the players will not be disciplined until the meetings are completed , the league said the appeals panel on friday instructed goodell to reconsider if any part of the suspensions he gave to the players was because the payments were a violation of the salary cap that would fall under the purview of an arbitrator for discipline but the panel also affirmed goodell s power to discipline the players for violations deemed conduct detrimental to the game the players have maintained that they never participated in a program with the intent to injure opponents , but merely put money into a pool to reward teammates for big hits it is unclear when the other three players who were suspended the cleveland browns' scott fujita , the saints' will smith and the free agent anthony hargrove will meet with goodell the four have been reinstated , but only smith played last sunday hargrove is not with a team , and vilma is on the physically unable to perform list because of a knee injury vilma had scheduled a meeting with goodell in august , but when the sides could not agree on the parameters of the meeting , it was canceled none of the four have shared information with goodell and none participated in an appeal with goodell

mike conley s nononsense style of playing point guard might not receive a lot of notice , but it has the memphis grizzlies climbing the western conference standings and starting to look like a team that no one will want to face come playoff time flying a little bit under the radar is nothing new for conley he played in high school and college with greg oden , who went on to become the no 1 overall selection in the 2007 nba draft out of ohio state although oden has played in a total of 82 games for portland \( and none this season \) because of knee injuries , conley is having a career season , leading the league in steals \( 256 a game \) and ranking fourth with an assisttoturnover ratio of three to one entering the weekend he has quietly become one of the nba s most underrated point guards despite losing zach randolph to a knee injury on jan 1 , the grizzlies have been one of the hottest teams in the league of late , winning five consecutive games and 11 of their last 13 before saturday night s game at phoenix memphis was tied for third in the western conference with the clippers and the lakers conley orchestrates a balanced grizzlies offense , with four starters scoring in double figures and o j mayo adding 122 points a game off the bench rudy gay leads the team at 191 points a game , and the big man marc gasol has excelled in the absence of randolph , averaging career highs in points \( 154 \) , blocked shots \( 21 \) , rebounds \( 10 \) and assists \( 31 \) memphis has been beating the teams it should beat , going 113 against teams under 500 the grizzlies have struggled , however , against the two teams at the top of the conference , going 06 against oklahoma city and san antonio last season , the grizzlies had a late hot streak to squeak into the playoffs , where they knocked off topseeded san antonio for the franchise s first series victory in the postseason with randolph s return coming as soon as tuesday , it will be interesting to see what this season s playoffs bring for memphis the wizard of vilnius jonas valanciunas was selected by the toronto raptors with the fifth overall selection in last year s draft and is expected to join the team next season in the meantime , he is playing in the lithuanian basketball league , where he was named most valuable player of the allstar game he scored 25 points , pulled down 13 rebounds and handed out 6 assists but his performance out of his basketball uniform was just as entertaining , if not more so on a video posted on yahoo s basketball blog , ball don t lie , valanciunas throws down an alleyoop off the backboard and dribbles behind his back in the allstar game more surprising , he wandered onto the court in a wizard costume while holding a sign encouraging a teammate later , he dressed as a referee and made a suspect traveling call on an opponent , tyrese rice , a former boston college standout , and called a technical on another referee then , after receiving the mvp trophy , he danced around the court with one of the cheerleaders to the vanilla ice tune ice ice baby imagine what valanciunas could have for next season s nba allstar weekend
this is not going to end well for the fbi we are now entering the second phase of the first phase began on nov 9 when petraeus revealed that he had had an affair for the next week , the press scrambled to keep abreast of every headspinning new plot twist general petraeus slept with \? did \? petraeus s biographer mistress \? phase 1 of any big national scandal ends when the new york tabloids stop writing their laughoutloud cover headlines \( screamed the new york post \) and relegate the story to the inside pages that happened on friday in phase 2 , people begin to grapple with the scandal s larger meaning , assuming , of course , that it has some larger meaning the sordid john edwards affair , for instance , showed that he had never been fit for public office , much less the vice presidency the bernie madoff scandal showed that investors will happily suspend disbelief when their fund manager s returns are too good to be true but the petraeus scandal could well end up teaching some very different lessons if the most admired military man in a generation can have his email hacked by fbi agents , then none of us are safe from the post9 11 surveillance machine and if an affair is all it takes to force such a man from office , then we truly have lost all sense of proportion let s go back to the scene of the socalled crime , to tampa , fla , where kelley , an attractive wannabe socialite , gets some unsettling emails from an anonymous sender if she had any sense , she would block the email address and be done with it but because she knows that men will bend the rules for her after all , highranking military officers to she goes to , who advocates with his superiors for an investigation they agree but on what grounds \? i looked up the cyberstalking statute it says that a crime has been committed when email causes substantial emotion distress or places the victim in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury this strikes me as a pretty high standard it is possible , i suppose , that the anonymous emails kelley was getting from paula broadwell , petraeus s former mistress , met that standard and to make broadwell s emails sound as threatening as possible but once they leak out , as they surely will , i strongly suspect that we 'll see that the law was just a fig leaf so , too , with the classified information broadwell is supposed to have \( and did n't you love \? \) given the government s propensity , since 9 11 , to stamp classified on every piece of paper short of the paper towels in the commissary , my guess is that this claim is also going to turn out to be less than earthshattering once the fbi learned the truth that it was just about sex it needed a highminded rationale to keep snooping broadwell did the fbi a huge favor by leaving classified information on her computer i understand why petraeus felt he needed to resign the affair had violated his own code of honor i also understand that and control made him unpopular among the cia rankandfile but i still wish president obama had refused his request to resign i wish the president had said that although general petraeus had made a mistake in his personal life an alltoohuman mistake , made by millions of people every day the consequences of that mistake should be dealt with by him , his wife and his former lover i wish he had said that the affair should not trump his decades of public service , or stop him from continuing to serve i wish he had said that the justice department s inspector general was going to conduct an inquiry into whether the fbi had acted appropriately in handling kelley s complaint on msnbc on friday afternoon , andrea mitchell spoke to senator roy blunt , a republican from missouri , who had just come from a closeddoor intelligence committee meeting where petraeus had testified do you think he had to resign \? she asked based on what i know , i would n't think so , clearly , he added , this is not someone who is going to be subject to blackmail thus did blunt swat away the one legitimate rationale for forcing petraeus from his job because of his affair in the weeks to come , a lot more people are going to come to the same conclusion and are going to ask the same questions about the ease with which the government can look at our emails and peep into our bedrooms such a rethinking is long overdue
rory staunton was always looking up as soon as he could walk , he wanted to fly the exuberant frecklefaced redhead from sunnyside , queens , yearned to be up in the romantic night sky where , as the french pilot and poet antoine de saintexup ry wrote , the stars are laughing his parents told him he 'd have to wait until he was 16 to take flying lessons but it s hard to tell a determined 5foot9 , 169pound 12yearold what to do he dreamed of being the next captain sullenberger , practicing on a flight simulator on his computer and studying global routes he read and reread sully s memoir , thrilled to learn that the flier s hair had once been red he found a long island aviation school that would teach 12yearolds on his 12th birthday , his parents shuddered and let rory fly with an instructor how could you resist that sweet irish face \? sure , rory drove his parents nuts , sneaking downstairs late at night to gorge on episodes of family guy , and pretending to do his homework when he was really devouring political stories in the times he was n't the kid who looked at porn online , he looked at cnn online , said his uncle , niall o 'dowd , my friend who publishes several irish publications in new york rory protected underdogs against schoolyard bullies he revered rosa parks and martin luther king jr and at the garden school in jackson heights , he led a campaign to curb the thoughtless use of the word retarded the last conversation i had with him , he got right in the face of my brother , fergus , the government minister in ireland with the mining portfolio , about fracking , niall recalled and he wrote the swedish ambassador to north korea asking for an explanation about why north korea fed their big army while their people were dying of hunger rory was so roaring with life , it was impossible to believe how quickly life drained out of him on wednesday , march 28 , he fell while playing in the school gym and scraped his elbow , opening a cut as dr jerome groopman wrote in the new yorker in 2008 , the most aggressive superbug bacteria often lurk in gyms and on artificial turf the following sunday , rory died of septic shock from a strep infection , his parents curled around his body in the hospital bed orlaith and ciaran staunton are irish immigrants who embodied the american dream ciaran owns o'neill s bar on third avenue , where rory made his first visit at 3 days old , and the molly blooms pub in queens every parent s nightmare unfolded at warp speed , as the web site everyday health reported and as jim dwyer heartbreakingly revealed in thursday s times rory might have been saved by a swift dose of antibiotics but instead perished in a perfect storm of false assumptions , overlooked data and overburdened doctors despite the cut , severe leg pain , blotchy skin and other clues pointing to sepsis , rory s pediatrician surmised that the vomiting , 102degree fever , 140 pulse and 36 breaths a minute spelled a stomach bug and sent him to the nyu langone medical center emergency room doctors there discharged rory with an antinausea drug , even though his vital signs were alarming the lab tests that were ordered came back three hours later showing abnormal production of white blood cells , a sign that infection could be raging , but that red flag was ignored nobody said anything that night , his mother told dwyer none of you followed up the next day on that kid , and he s at home , dying on the couch \? by friday , rory s body was covered with blue streaks , and a touch made him scream when ciaran reached the pediatrician , she advised going back to the er rory was put in intensive care , where doctors valiantly tried to save his life , even suggesting amputating his nose and toes but he was turning purple and black for anyone that has carried their son s or daughter s coffin , it s unnatural , ciaran told sean o'rourke on friday on rte , the irish radio network a child who loses a parent becomes an orphan if a man and wife lose each other , they become widow or widower it s so unnatural , there is n't even a word for families who lose a child rory s idol , sully sullenberger , was touched and left a message on the child s tribute page the hero of the hudson is now an advocate for applying lessons learned in blood in aviation safety to patient safety if something good comes from rory s death , it will be that we realize we have a broken system , he told me patient care is so fragmented for the most part , medical professionals are n't taught these human skills that some deride as soft skills' so there s insufficient sharing of information and ineffective communication some in the medical field look upon these deaths as an unavoidable consequence of giving care but they 're inexcusable and unthinkable rory is up there now , with the laughing stars but even before he got to heaven , he knew , as saintexup ry wrote , that one sees clearly only with the heart anything essential is invisible to the eyes
florham park , nj behind the desk in mike tannenbaum s office , a threesided whiteboard hangs on the wall it is loaded with magnets , one for each player on ' roster a visual representation of the underperforming and the overachieving , the injured and the fit , and everybody in between in truth , that board is more than a depth chart for tannenbaum , it is a daily puzzle to solve and a stark reminder of the decisions he has made during his six and a half years as general manager only two current jets , sione po'uha and brandon moore , predate tannenbaum s tenure , which began in february 2006 everyone else has arrived under his watch , a team created in his image , built to his , and coach rex ryan s , specifications not long ago , they reached two straight afc championship games but now the jets , after a disastrous finish to 2011 , are reeling again , even at 22 they are struggling to score , pass , run , defend , tackle and keep their fans' interest , which waned in the second half of a 340 home defeat last week to san francisco their flaws a paucity of offensive playmakers , a meager pass rush and an erratic quarterback are no less obvious in october than they were in august or june or april , long before seasonending injuries claimed darrelle revis and santonio holmes at the jets' seasonending news conference in january , tannenbaum vowed that he would field a better team he was asked in an interview last week whether he had fulfilled that mission absolutely , tannenbaum said i still think we have a chance to accomplish everything we want to that is , the the expectations have not changed , even if by any realistic measure they should on monday night , the jets will play undefeated houston with clyde gates , lex hilliard , konrad reuland and jason hill in line to play significant roles on offense none were with the team in training camp rosterdepleting injuries are inevitable , and the jets with holmes , revis , dustin keller and stephen hill have endured a disproportionate share but there are teams who seem better equipped to overcome them i think there are some teams whose last eight or nine guys are pretty darn strong , said daniel jeremiah , a former scout for three nfl teams who now works for nfl network i do n't think this is the case here when last season ended , the jets were like a house in disrepair they needed to fix the boiler \( right tackle \) , paint the walls \( proven receiver \) and refinish the floors \( impact pass rusher \) they wound up spackling holes , replacing the wellworn carpet \( safety upgrades with laron landry and yeremiah bell \) and buying an hd television for a guest bedroom \( tim tebow \) however much the jets adore tebow and value his versatility , so far he has been little more than a decoy and a distraction i 'll give him a grade of incomplete , tannenbaum said let s have that discussion in december a discussion could have been held about wayne hunter s poor performance last december , when the eagles exposed him the jets misjudged his ability to replace damien woody , and it took eight months seven , counting their failed trade for jeff otah before the situation became so untenable that , after allowing two and a half sacks in a preseason game against the giants , hunter was shipped to st louis realizing that he needed to infuse the offense with younger , faster players , tannenbaum drafted stephen hill , longing for packages that would include hill , holmes , keller , jeremy kerley and , at running back , bilal powell or joe mcknight by failing to add an established no 2 complement to holmes , the jets heaped responsibility on hill , who was rarely thrown to in a tripleoption offense hill had a strong debut , but before being sidelined by a hamstring injury , he dropped two passes in miami , including a potential touchdown the lack of explosive players at the skill positions on offense , that s what jumps out at me , jeremiah said you 'd like to have one dynamic weapon on the outside , which i do n't necessarily think they have you 'd also like to have a running back capable of hitting a home run , and they do n't have that that back would be shonn greene , who has been disappointing this season tannenbaum moved up to take greene in the third round in 2009 , an aggressive strategy that helped him select keller , revis , mark sanchez and david harris but one that contrasted sharply with the methodology that tannenbaum lauded as a senior at the university of massachusetts there , he wrote a paper which earned an a , according to his professor , lisa pike masteralexis exploring how to construct a championship team analyzing the 49ers , tannenbaum asserted that bill walsh s preference for trading back to amass a high volume of selections built san francisco s core tannenbaum favors quality over quantity , often using his picks to trade up or to acquire players with troubled pasts antonio cromartie , braylon edwards , holmes while filling the back of his roster with practicesquad signings \( austin howard \) and waiver claims \( gates and reuland \) it can be a risky tactic of the 65 players on the jets' roster as of friday , 26 were acquired through the draft , the ninthlowest percentage in the nfl , according to the elias sports bureau they have not , in my estimation , done a very good job of selecting players , said the former dallas executive gil brandt , who analyzes college players and the draft for assessing their strategy , brandt mentioned bill belichick of new england why do you think belichick trades and gets so many draft picks \? would you rather have two chances to win the lottery or one \? tannenbaum has presided over seven drafts the first three , with eric mangini as coach , produced a prominent bust in vernon gholston but also cornerstones like revis , nick mangold and d'brickashaw ferguson , and valuable pieces like brad smith , eric smith and leon washington in ryan s four drafts , the jets have made 21 picks tied with new orleans for fewest in the nfl nineteen of the league s 32 teams drafted a pro bowl player in that time , with three \( packers , patriots , steelers \) taking multiple , but the jets are not one of them none of their players acquired for picks have been so honored , either recent selections like muhammad wilkerson , kerley and powell have revealed promise , but it is unclear whether their most prominent pick , sanchez , will ever perform at a level worthy of being chosen fifth over all vlad ducasse has yet to validate his secondround grade , and although the firstround pick quinton coples has fared capably at defensive end , he has yet to register the impact of chandler jones of new england , selected five spots later , who was named the afc s top defensive rookie in september since ryan s arrival , the jets have added several players with character issues , believing that he can reform them it worked with cromartie but not holmes , whose petulance created a locker room rift the jets aspire to squeeze every drop of production out of a player before discarding him , though they have not always found suitable replacements for players considered replaceable a dependable blocking tight end like ben hartsock a reliable possession receiver like jerricho cotchery a vertical threat like edwards , though hill is a raw approximation the best organizations that show sustainable success are the ones that can make the hard decisions , tannenbaum said when tannenbaum examines that whiteboard , he sees the results of those decisions it is only going to get harder
the unexpected retirement of senator jim demint , a conservative republican from south carolina who will vacate his seat to become head of the the heritage foundation , will create an unusual circumstance in which both of the state s senate seats are on the ballot in 2014 a special election will be held to fill out the remaining two years of mr demint s term , which was originally set to expire after the 2016 election in addition , south carolina s other senator , the republican lindsey graham , who was reelected in 2008 , will also be on the ballot in 2014 mr demint s retirement could conceivably help mr graham , whose approval ratings in south carolina are middling mr graham also draws the ire of some republicans for being seen as too willing to compromise with democrats , making him potentially vulnerable to a primary challenge if the stronger republican candidates are drawn toward competing for mr demint s former seat instead , mr graham could be spared a difficult test on the other hand , some of the candidates whom gov nikki r haley might appoint to fill mr demint s seat for the next two years , like representative tim scott , are viewed as having bright political futures while being more reliably conservative than mr graham , meaning that mr graham could still be the more vulnerable target in a republican primary opportunities for republicans to ascend to the senate in south carolina ought to yield competitive primaries because there is a large supply of wellqualified candidates all nine of south carolina s elected executive officials , from the governor , ms haley , to the agriculture commissioner , hugh weathers , are republicans in addition , six of the seven representatives that south carolina will send to the united states house in january are republicans the exception is the democrat james e clyburn , who represents south carolina s majorityblack sixth congressional district the abundance of republican elected officials in south carolina precludes democrats from having much of a bench in the state and may prevent them from making a strong run at either senate seat in 2014 the statistical models that fivethirtyeight uses to forecast senate and gubernatorial races include , among other factors , a variable to designate a candidate s credentials , which is based on the highest office that he or she has been elected to the more prominent the races that the candidate has won , the better he or she tends to do when running for the senate or for governor we divide the offices into three tiers , which might be thought of as tantamount to professional baseball s system of major and minor leagues in the top tier are candidates who have already done the equivalent of ascend to the majors by having been elected to a united states senate seat or a governorship at some point but these candidates are hard to find unless they are already the incumbents in those races \( an exception is when a governor crosses over to run for the senate , or vice versa \) so in practice , parties draw more heavily from the second tier of elected officials , which provide them with their top prospects when they want to compete for a senate or gubernatorial seat in this group are united states representatives and statewide elected officials , like attorneys general and secretaries of state because almost none of these officeholders have been democrats in south carolina , the party has had to draw from the third tier of candidates , which consists largely of state senators and state representatives these candidates face a far bigger transition when trying to compete for a major elected office like united states senate or governor , in terms of raising funds , building name recognition and developing platforms that allow them to appeal to enough voters to win statewide and in some cases in south carolina , democrats have nominated candidates who have not held elected office at all in 2010 , their candidate for the united states senate was alvin greene , an army veteran who had never run for public office and who was unemployed when he was chosen as the nominee it is not mere happenstance that democrats have had trouble fielding competitive candidates for statewide elections in south carolina much of it has to do with the demographics and the geography of the state president obama won 44 percent of the vote in south carolina this november , more than he did in 19 other states however , in south carolina , it can be exceedingly difficult for a democrat to go from winning 44 or 46 percent of the vote to 50 percent this is because of a concept we call elasticity , which is related to the number of swing voters in each state who might consider voting for either party some red states like alaska are also fairly elastic , meaning they have their fair share of voters who are political independents or who have moderate or mixed political views democrats usually lose in these states but they can compete with the right candidates and under the right circumstances in south carolina and some other states in the deep south , however , there are very few swing voters africanamericans vote for democrats in overwhelming numbers , while the vast majority of whites are conservative and vote republican this makes the outcome of elections in these states much more predictable democrats have a high floor for how many votes they receive , but also a low ceiling , and they almost always wind up coming up short of 50 percent democrats problems are compounded in south carolina because of the geographical distribution of black voters , who are heavily concentrated in certain cities , counties and congressional and legislative districts this year , mr clyburn , the democrat , won overwhelmingly in south carolina s sixth congressional district , taking 94 percent of the vote and facing no republican opposition but democrats lost the other six united states house races , and their candidates won no more than 45 percent of the vote in any of them this does not just make it difficult for democrats to win elections in south carolina when they do , it is often in overwhelmingly democratic districts the candidates may have little practice in appealing to a broader constituency of voters , and they may accumulate liberal voting records that make them

you re an undecided voter your time is up the rest of us are sick of pretending to care about you , saying nice things to you , doing your damn laundry decide , ok \? when the choice was between scrooge mcduck and the kenyan socialist , you couldn t make up your mind now that you know it s between two harvard knowitalls , with clear , divergent views of government , you re waiting for what \? the longlost mormon tablets to reappear \? donald trump to reveal what his phantom investigators found among the birth records in hawaii \? no , of course not to your credit , you don t take your talking points from the toxic menu of farright radio nor from the conspiracy theorists of the paranoid left but that s the only nice thing i m going to say about you you re not solomon , carefully weighing the choices you re a ditherer you probably panic at paper or plastic in the supermarket , backing up the checkout line we know all about you , because the campaigns have spent millions studying you , probing you , stuffing you with those little sausage things your every emotion is wired and registered and here s what we know there aren t that many of you , not compared with past years in 2008 , 1 in 7 voters was persuadable at one time this year it is closer to 1 in 20 about 5 percent and in your hands , the savants of politics say , rests the future of the republic but here s the thing while we re paying so much attention to you , you re not paying that much attention to known facts about the two men who want to lead the united states you barely keep up on the news if you d been paying attention , of course , you wouldn t be undecided you , most likely , were not among the millions of americans who watched the first presidential debate of all voters , the undecided were the least interested in the debates , a washington post poll found last week so , here s what you missed , or may have heard something about today mitt romney wants to fire big bird he s got a plan , mostly secret , to restore america to fiscal sanity but first , he wants to cut taxes by 20 percent ultimately , that will cost 5 trillion at the same time , he wants to add things to the defense budget and none of this will add a penny to the debt a third grader could tell you that his numbers don t add up go ahead , ask a third grader romney knows it doesn t add up , so he s not specific oh , except for big bird no more subsidies for pbs , you monotoned moochers that s 000014 percent of the budget i forgot you hate policywonk stuff , so those numbers are not likely to move you then listen to your heart the one that may stop beating earlier than you think , if you have a preexisting condition romney vows to throw out obamacare , which will cover that condition but he says his plan would cover it as well that s true , but only if you live in a state , like massachusetts , that already has obamacare otherwise , in all truth , you re toast he said so earlier this month , when he explained that the millions of americans who would lose health care once he kills it can always go the hospital emergency room maybe you just want an overarching philosophy romney s slogan is believe in america \( as opposed to , say , lichtenstein \) he summarized his view wednesday night i ll restore the vitality that gets america working again you would think he has some fiscal viagra in mind , but again no specifics on to obama he saved the auto industry the recovery in michigan and ohio was not an accident you didn t like the stimulus because , like , where s my bailout , dude \? but the unemployment rate would be 10 percent , not 8 , without the stimulus whatever you don t know about any of this because obama never brought it home on wednesday , and therefore it will not be part of the distant chatter that will find its way into your orbit over the next few days obama s opponent thinks that nearly half of all americans many among you are deadbeats and victims obama didn t bring this up , either , and romney certainly wasn t going to for philosophy , obama gave you this are we going to double down on the topdown economic policies that helped to get us into this mess , or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says america does best when the middle class does best there you have it a clear choice , as everyone keeps telling you but still , you re not sure you say you don t like either of them romney s too snooty and just plain weird obama s too professorial and goes on , and on , and on you say they re corrupt , all politicians you say there s no difference between the parties you re wrong , but we re not supposed to tell you that the headline of an associated press story on you was typical many watch debate some are pleased , few are moved after the debate , a cnn focus group of your type found that eight of you were now leaning toward romney , and eight of you were coming over to the obama side no real movement , in other words i m going to let you in on a little secret , after many years of sitting with you during past presidential debates we don t like you not because you can t make up your mind , but because you won t
the historian victor davis hanson recently wrote a brutally cleareyed piece in the national review , looking back at america s different approaches to iraq , iran , libya , syria , egypt , pakistan and afghanistan and how , sadly , none of them could be said to have worked yet let us review the various american policy options for the middle east over the last few decades , military assistance or punitive intervention without followup mostly failed the verdict on far more costly nationbuilding is still out trying to help popular insurgents topple unpopular dictators does not guarantee anything better propping up dictators with military aid is both odious and counterproductive keeping clear of maniacal regimes leads to either nuclear acquisition or genocide or 16 acres of rubble in manhattan what have we learned \? tribalism , oil , and islamic fundamentalism are a bad mix that leaves americans sick and tired of the middle east both when they get in it and when they try to stay out of it and that is why it s time to rethink everything we 're doing out there what the middle east needs most from america today are modern schools and hard truths , and we have n't found a way to offer either because hanson is right what ails the middle east today truly is a toxic mix of tribalism , shiitesunni sectarianism , fundamentalism and oil oil that constantly tempts us to intervene or to prop up dictators this cocktail erodes all the requirements of a forwardlooking society which are institutions that deliver decent government , consensual politics that provide for rotations in power , women s rights and an ethic of pluralism that protects minorities and allows for modern education the united nations arab human development report published in 2002 by some brave arab social scientists also said something similar what ails the arab world is a deficit of freedom , a deficit of modern education and a deficit of women s empowerment so helping to overcome those deficits should be what us policy is about , yet we seem unable to sustain that look at egypt more than half of its women and a quarter of its men ca n't read the young egyptians who drove the revolution are desperate for the educational tools and freedom to succeed in the modern world our response should have been to shift our aid money from military equipment to building scienceandtechnology high schools and community colleges across egypt yet , instead , a year later , we 're in the crazy situation of paying 5 million in bail to an egyptian junta to get us democracy workers out of jail there , while likely certifying that this junta is liberalizing and merits another 13 billion in arms aid we 're going to give 13 billion more in guns to a country whose only predators are illiteracy and poverty in afghanistan , i laugh out loud whenever i hear obama administration officials explaining that we just need to train more afghan soldiers to fight and then we can leave is there anything funnier \? afghan men need to be trained to fight \? the problem is that we turned a blind eye as president hamid karzai stole the election and operated a corrupt regime then president obama declared that our policy was to surge us troops to clear out the taliban so good afghan government could come in and take our place there is no such government our problem is not that afghans do n't know the to fight it is that not enough have the to fight for the government they have how many would fight for karzai if we did n't pay them \? and so it goes in pakistan , we pay the pakistani army to be twofaced , otherwise it would be only onefaced and totally against us in bahrain , we looked the other way while ruling sunni hardliners crushed a shiiteled movement for more powersharing , and we silently watch our ally israel build more settlements in the west bank that we know are a disaster for its jewish democracy but we do n't tell pakistan the truth because it has nukes we do n't tell the saudis the truth because we 're addicted to their oil we do n't tell bahrain the truth because we need its naval base we do n't tell egypt the truth because we 're afraid it will walk from camp david we do n't tell israel the truth because it has votes and we do n't tell karzai the truth because obama is afraid john mccain will call him a wimp sorry , but nothing good can be built on a soil so rich with lies on our side and so rich with sectarianism , tribalism and oilfueled fundamentalism on their side do n't get me wrong i believe change is possible and am ready to invest in it but it has got to start with them wanting it i 'll support anyone in that region who truly shares our values and the agenda of the arab human development report and is ready to fight for them but i am fed up with supporting people just because they look less awful than the other guys and eventually turn out to be just as bad where people do n't share our values , we should insulate ourselves by reducing our dependence on oil but we must stop wanting good government more than they do , looking the other way at bad behavior , telling ourselves that next year will be different , sticking with a bad war for fear of being called wimps and selling more tanks to people who ca n't read

republicans howled on thursday when the federal reserve , at long last , took steps to energize the economy some were furious at the thought that even a little economic boost might work to benefit president obama just before an election said raul labrador , a freshman tea party congressman from idaho , and the obama administration is going to claim credit mr labrador need n't worry about that the president is no more likely to get credit for the fed s action for which he was not responsible than he gets for the transformative law for which he was fully responsible the 2009 stimulus , which fundamentally turned around the nation s economy and its prospects for growth , and yet has disappeared from the political conversation the reputation of the stimulus is meticulously restored from shabby to skillful in michael grunwald s important new book , his findings will come as a jolt to those who think the law failed , the typical republican assessment , or was too small and sloppy to have any effect on the most basic level , the american recovery and reinvestment act is responsible for saving and creating 25 million jobs the majority of economists agree that it helped the economy grow by as much as 38 percent , and kept the unemployment rate from reaching 12 percent the stimulus is the reason , in fact , that most americans are better off than they were four years ago , when the economy was in serious danger of shutting down but the stimulus did far more than stimulate it protected the most vulnerable from the recession s heavy winds of the act s , 15 billion went to rent subsidies and emergency housing that kept 12 million people under roofs \( that s why the recession did n't produce rampant homelessness \) it increased spending on food stamps , unemployment benefits and medicaid , keeping at least seven million americans from falling below the poverty line and as mr grunwald shows , it made crucial investments in neglected economic sectors that are likely to pay off for decades it jumpstarted the switch to electronic medical records , which will largely end the use of paper records by 2015 it poured more than 1 billion into comparativeeffectiveness research on pharmaceuticals it extended broadband internet to thousands of rural communities and it spent 90 billion on a huge variety of wind , solar and other clean energy projects that revived the industry republicans , of course , only want to talk about solyndra , but most of the green investments have been quite successful , and renewable power output has doubled americans do n't know most of this , and not just because mitt romney and his party denigrate the law as a boondoggle every five minutes democrats , so battered by the transformation of stimulus into a synonym for waste and fraud \( of which there was little \) , have stopped using the word only four speakers at the democratic convention even mentioned the recovery act , none using the word stimulus mr obama himself did n't bring it up at all one of the biggest accomplishments of his first term a clear illustration of the beneficial use of government power , in a law 50 percent larger \( in constant dollars \) than the original new deal and its author does n't even mention it such is the power of republican misinformation , and democratic timidity mr grunwald argues that the recovery act was not timid , but the administration s effort to sell it to the voters was muddled and ineffective not only did white house economists famously overestimate its impact on the jobless rate , handing mr romney a favorite talking point , but the administration seemed to feel the benefits would simply be obvious mr obama , too cool to appear in an endless stream of photos with a shovel and hard hat , did n't slap his name on public works projects in the selfpromoting way of mayors and governors how many new yorkers know that the stimulus is helping to pay for the second avenue subway , or the project to link the long island rail road to grand central \? almost every american worker received a tax cut from the act , but only about 10 percent of them noticed it in their paychecks white house economists had rejected the idea of distributing the tax cuts as flashy rebate checks , because people were more likely to spend the money \( and help the economy \) if they did n't notice it good economics , perhaps , but terrible politics from the beginning , for purely political reasons , republicans were determined to oppose the bill , using silly but tiny expenditures to discredit the whole thing even the moderate republican senators who helped push the bill past a filibuster had refused to let it grow past 800 billion , and prevented it from paying for school construction republicans learned a lesson from the stimulus that democrats did n't expect unwavering opposition , distortion , deceit and ridicule actually work , especially when the opposition does n't put up a fight the lesson for democrats seems equally clear when government actually works , let the world know about it
d sseldorf , germany a hockey jersey hung in each player s locker it bore germany s national colors , black trimmed in red and gold the front was emblazoned with an eagle above the word deutschland this would be evan kaufmann s first time wearing the jersey he removed it from the hanger and turned it around to see his family name spelled in capital letters he would recall feeling a tingle of excitement he felt something else , too , emotions that crisscrossed like the laces of his skates he was proud to wear the jersey but also solemn about what history had done to the name on the back his greatgrandfather starved to death by the nazis his greatgrandmother herded to extermination on a train to auschwitz his grandfather shuttled between ghettos and concentration camps , surviving somehow , finding a displaced sister after the war , pushing her from a hospital in a wheelbarrow after her lower left leg was amputated because of frostbite on feb 10 , kaufmann finished dressing and skated onto the ice at a tournament in belarus with his initial shift , he became one of the few jews to represent germany in elite international sports since world war ii , the first in ice hockey since the 1930s and perhaps the most visible to have had family members murdered in the holocaust , according to sports historians and jewish officials it was almost surreal , said kaufmann , 27 , a forward who was born in minnesota and is the secondleading goal scorer here for the deg metro stars of the german professional league from an achievement standpoint , it was amazing to represent the country but it was pretty insane to think about what my grandpa had to survive to allow me to be where i am today and how it s come a long way from then to now he came to germany four years ago , not as a symbol but as a yearning hockey player slight at 5 feet 9 inches and 165 pounds , undrafted by the nhl out of the university of minnesota in 2008 , kaufmann found his best pro opportunity in perhaps the least likely place the country where his greatgrandparents and other relatives were murdered now offered him accelerated citizenship because of his family s brutalized past in hockey terms , kauffmann is considered fully german , eligible for the national team , unbound by restrictions on the number of foreigners allowed to play in the domestic pro league on his d sseldorf club team , some international players wear a small flag on their jerseys denoting their home countries kaufmann displays the german flag with each year , you do feel a little more loyalty toward germany , a stronger connection , he said i still consider myself more american , but from a hockey standpoint , i 've committed myself to germany it s something i'm proud about in june , kaufmann s wife , danielle , 25 , is due to give birth to the couple s first child as fatherhood approaches and news of his personal story begins to spread , there is an issue beyond hockey to consider while the murder of six million jews was a barbaric collective , forgiveness among their descendants must be individual has enough time passed \? will enough time ever pass \? each must decide for himself obviously , you never want to forget , kaufmann said but everybody deserves a second chance and a right to rectify their mistakes most people today had nothing to do with it i'm not going to hold it against a whole country for what happened long ago you 're never going to move forward if you keep doing that those who agree with him point out that more than 100 , 000 jews live in germany today , far fewer than the 550 , 000 before the nazis came to power but many more than two decades ago , before an influx from the former the soviet union they note that germany has confronted its nazi past and made holocaust denial a crime , that many germans are committed to reconciliation and acceptance of responsibility we 're not there yet , but we are on the way to being less exotic and a little more normal , said dieter graumann , the president of the central council of jews in germany kaufmann s presence on the national hockey team is something to be glad about and rejoice it shows that jews in germany are not strange and something to be wondered at , he said , but that they are normal citizens , wanting to take part in all of society no one can say precisely how many elite jewish athletes have represented postwar germany fewer than a dozen , many say , but even that might err on the high side of course it s absolutely rare because we have so very few jews in germany , graumann said there were only 30 , 000 here 20 years ago a south africanborn won a bronze relay medal for germany at the 2004 athens olympics another swimmer , herbert klein , won a bronze medal at the 1952 helsinki games , but there is debate whether he was jewish for some , such ambiguity represents thankful progress that jews are no longer so easily put on lists , filed into categories we do n't ask those kinds of questions anymore , fortunately , said ella rujder , the executive secretary of the sports organization maccabi germany the german women s team that won the european indoor field hockey championship last month included two or three jewish players , rujder said about 200 participants from germany took part last july at the , a kind of olympics for jewish athletes germany and israel also have regular exchanges of young athletes an plays in the bundesliga , and yearly , the german soccer federation honors those who fight racism and antisemitism in memory of julius hirsch , a jewish star killed at auschwitz i think it s fine for an american jew to represent germany , said , a champion high jumper who was prevented from competing for germany at the 1936 berlin olympics because she was jewish and who , at 97 , now lives in queens it s a step forward it is not so unambiguous for everyone in may , kaufmann and germany could face the united states at the world hockey championships and again at the 2014 olympics in sochi , russia it is a silly question to ask , as someone did , whether he would want to defeat the americans any competitor would want to defeat his opponent but it is another aspect to sort out in a story that will never be resolved to everyone s satisfaction i have mixed emotions , said menachem z rosensaft , a new york lawyer who is the vice president of the american gathering of jewish holocaust survivors and their descendants i think everyone has to make his own decisions in this respect it is clear for kaufmann that hockey is the most important priority just like there are israelis or other jews who have settled in germany out of economic or career convenience , he is doing the same i do not presume to judge him at the same time , rosensaft said he felt a bitter aftertaste and a certain degree of sadness for kaufmann he has effectively turned his back on the united states and has willingly taken on citizenship to identify henceforth as a german , rosensaft said that , in terms of his family history , is at best a somber reality there is a question in my mind whether a jew should voluntarily go to germany and take on that role recently , kaufmann was interviewed by rabbi jason miller of detroit , that he approved of his career choice , saying , this is just one more way in which the jewish community will come to view germany differently one of miller s readers , jason klein , the president of a webbased company that helps patients find discounted drugs , responded online my family is 25 percent of what it once was prewwii i subscribe to never forgive , never forget and i ca n't imagine \( no matter how talented i was \) a meaningless sport being worthy of this do n't get me wrong i do n't blame the germans of today for the crimes of their grandfathers , but i certainly would n't be in the spotlight supporting their country and waving their flag kaufmann has seen this and similar rebukes he and his family believe such views are corrosive perhaps the best understanding of their mercy for others comes from the place where their forebears found none for themselves it is the family s prewar village of , located three hours south of d sseldorf in the winemaking region of the moselle river valley on thursday , the village of 15 , 000 was full of young people costumed for carnival at the local jewish studies center , a photograph from 1935 showed evan kaufmann s grandfather , kurt , smiling a thin smile and wearing a crown at school for the jewish festival of purim kurt s sister ilse sat next to him in a fancy outfit but these joyous times were ending as persecution of the jews accelerated according to the book , jewish life in wittlich , kurt and ilse kaufmann would become the only students to survive deportation to the concentration camps in a postwar letter , kurt kaufmann wrote of persisting on chance , turnips and potato skins after being liberated , he found his sister in a berlin hospital eventually , they made their way to the united states as he aged , he still had nightmares and other psychological scars , but he felt no ill will toward germany and its people , said farley kaufmann , kurt s son and evan s father the elder kaufmann continued to drink wine from the region , gave an oral history and , before he died at age 68 in 1990 , he had planned to visit wittlich for the first time since his family fled in 1939 it is a place , like other places , that took everything the kaufmanns had but it has since become a place of remembrance there is a jewish cemetery there , a study center the desecrated synagogue had been restored as a museum and culture center on display is a torah scroll that kurt kaufmann helped rescue , storing it in the attic of his father s upholstery business it was found years later at the family home , refurbished by new owners and still standing at 26 tiergarten street i'm sure some people do n't like it , farley kaufmann , a certified public accountant in suburban minneapolis , said of his son s playing in germany i understand and sympathize it s bittersweet to me i thought long and hard , would my dad be happy or not with what evan is doing \? i honestly feel my dad would be very proud he did n't hold grudges in visits to wittlich and elsewhere in germany , farley kaufmann said it had begun to feel more like home the people are nice , he said i see german people trying to educate about what happened i do n't see anybody denying what happened i do n't see anything but people trying to make sure it does n't happen again on the first day evan kaufmann spent in germany , in july 2008 , he went for a walk in d sseldorf to stay awake after a transatlantic flight an elderly man approached and began saying something repetitive in german kaufmann did not understand then the man said in english , jew \? jew \? kaufmann was shocked he had only just arrived already a random encounter had validated every reservation he and his family had about him being in germany i do n't know , he told the man guardedly are you \? yes , i am , the man said i saw your nose i thought maybe you were jewish , too the man explained that he had gone to israel before or after the war then he went on his way i had a feeling in my stomach that something bad had just happened , kaufmann said there have been other unsettling moments he and his wife were once intercepted by the police at a synagogue here and made to show their identification security was tight because in 2000 down the street from their apartment , a swastika has been spraypainted on an electrical box it makes us a little hesitant when we decorate for , danielle kaufmann said but it does n't stop us we feel very comfortable here we 're not hiding who we are we are very proud where we came from we 've been embraced germany s a different place now on a daily basis , life here feels no different from life in minneapolis , evan said jewish customs and holidays have become a connecting point between himself and his german club teammates evan takes a break from play for rosh hashana and yom kippur danielle bakes hanukkah cookies for the metro stars' holiday party and pastries to share for purim they never really understand that we do n't celebrate christmas , evan said with a laugh gradually , he has shed his reluctance and begun to share some details about his family history if it is not exactly healing , it is an attempt to inform , to build a bridge , to help show that germany is a more open place now his teammates seem curious , surprised evan is the first jew i really met , said patrick reimer , a teammate on the metro stars and kaufmann s roommate last weekend on the german national team s trip to belarus reimer said he felt a sense of gratitude that a jew could be named to the national hockey team and sad that it had taken so long since the 1930s , in fact , when a star named to a bronze medal at the 1932 winter olympics and was said to be the only jewish participant for germany at the 1936 winter games in the bavarian resort of garmischpartenkirchen to be honest , reimer added , he did not pry into details of the darker events in the kaufmann family history there is still a barrier in the head , he said we both know it should never have happened , what happened 70 years ago frieder feldmann , a spokesman for the deg metro stars and a history teacher at a private school , has encouraged kaufmann to tell his story but even feldmann fumbles for the words , seeks the neutral ground of euphemism i ca n't speak with someone when my people killed his people , feldmann said hockey is safer territory on that subject , the metro stars speak effusively of kaufmann , his calm , his ability to read the game , his willing muscularity for a small player i can use him in any situation , coach jeff tomlinson , a canadian , said at the tournament in belarus , kaufmann was named germany s star of one game on tuesday , in league play , he scored in a victory over firstplace berlin on friday , he scored again in a shootout victory there are still times , he said , he wonders whether he is doing the right thing what would his grandfather think \? knowing he was planning on coming back after all those years , i think it shows he was ready to forgive , kaufmann said that helps me be comfortable with it next season , he will play for nuremberg , which has its own fraught history it trivializes the holocaust to call kaufmann s presence in germany closure or a happy ending , feldmann said but if it is ever possible to have peace in this story , he said , maybe it is a small brick in a good wall

sits high in the saddle , stretches his hands onto the reins in an unorthodox manner and flashes his whip in an almost exaggerated halfwindmill arc there is an easier way to spot him , too look for who is in front at the finish dominguez , who will turn 36 on saturday , is the best rider in the united states , at least by the metric of money earned based in new york , he led the nation in earnings the previous two years and is about to do so again he received the eclipse award for outstanding jockey the past two years , with another in store this year his mounts have earned 242 million and counting , already a record and dominguez is selftaught of his riding style , he said i learned on my own in venezuela sometimes it looks awkward , but it feels very comfortable for me if i could change it , i might he smiled but it s too late to be making changes now why would he \? with purses in new york higher than ever , aided by the yearold slot machines at aqueduct racetrack , the riding colony around dominguez is as strong as ever and yet he has dominated since arriving permanently in late 2008 facing the best at saratoga last summer , dominguez rolled to a record 68 wins in recent years he has piloted the champions gio ponti , havre de grace and hansen at the breeders' cup this month , he won the aboard the long shot little mike he is also the king of aqueduct , the ozone park oval that opened nov 2 for its sixmonth haul the top riders will move to gulfstream park in south florida at the end of this month , except for dominguez he has won the last five winter meets at aqueduct , and he is a short bet to win a sixth in the past , staying behind would cost a rider opportunities on the better horses once the stables returned to new york from florida , but dominguez changed that notion the perception of a winter rider in quotation marks has shifted over the years , he said it s also not a financial sacrifice any longer , because the money is so good here you can make more here than going south after aqueduct s purses skyrocketed last winter , the new york racing association faced fierce condemnation over a rash of during that time a stateappointed task force that investigated the breakdowns proposed new rules on medication and veterinary oversight that the new york state racing and wagering board approved of course everybody had their concerns , dominguez said but i feel like something good came out of this negative event i'm optimistic that these reforms will work it gives everybody peace of mind last wednesday morning in the aqueduct jockeys' room , dominguez answered questions while running on a treadmill at top speed to make sure his weight stayed no higher than 115 pounds , he wore a heavy polyester sweatshirt and , with a rag in one hand , wiped the sweat from his face he also frequents the sauna , which jockeys call the box dominguez is an avid chess player , and the way he explains his fortunes on the track speaks to that mindset you can sense how things are going to happen before they happen , he said it s hard to put into words it s second nature you see the paths before they open dominguez was born in caracas and brought up in cagua , an hour and a half away his mother was a schoolteacher , and his father ran an parlor in caracas that had been in the family for two generations it was open on weekends , and dominguez s father would sometimes take him to help around the shop at the end of the weekend , his father had to drive the betting machines to la rinconada , the caracas racecourse , where they were emptied of money at 13 , dominguez first watched a live race there and resolved to become a jockey but there was no horsemanship in his family , and his parents disapproved of his career choice as a tradeoff , and perhaps as a way to placate the boy , they allowed him to take showjumping lessons nearby dominguez was content , and after a year he entered some competitions but after one competition , he had a fateful encounter i was on the bus on my way home and saw this kid with a helmet on , dominguez recalled i went up to him and asked him about it , and he told me he was riding racehorses at a training center nearby i did n't even know there was a training center nearby so the next time i was on my way to showjumping lessons , i stayed on the bus and got off at the training center dominguez did this a few times , but his parents quickly found out they were not as unhappy as he expected , dominguez said , and he soon won them over with his commitment most mornings he would travel on three buses to the training center , where he taught himself the basics of riding racehorses , and then return home , shower and ride another bus to high school contrary to his individualized path , most wouldbe jockeys in latin america attend formal riding schools the best graduates are then connected to agents in the united states but during his development , dominguez said , the riding school at la rinconada was closed so he received his apprenticeship at two perilous , roughriding bush tracks outside the city limits he lived in dreary , dirty tack rooms and also groomed the horses seven months later , there was a promotion for young jockeys to go to la rinconada , and with the help of a politically connected friend , dominguez jumped at the opportunity he rode there throughout 1995 , after he had turned 18 , having little success the first six months but finishing with 53 wins it was exciting for me to make it to the big track , but the reality of it is i was extremely green , dominguez said i did n't have much confidence at all i was focused on making a career of this , but i was pretty far behind the other kids i was intimidated it was n't easy for me by any means dominguez did not linger in venezuela with the help of the same friend who got him to la rinconada , he was set up with an agent in the united states he arrived in 1996 and won his first race , at hialeah park in florida , that march success came swiftly from florida he moved to maryland , long known for able horsemen and jockeys , like chris mccarron and kent desormeaux , who had gone on to hall of fame careers in california and new york edgar prado was another such rider when prado left maryland for new york in 1999 , his agent , steve rushing , stayed behind in what dominguez called a turning point for me , he soon joined with rushing much of prado s business went to dominguez , who is still with rushing after almost 13 years in 2001 , only five years after arriving in the united states , dominguez led all riders nationally in wins , and he repeated the feat in 2003 his move to the big stage was only a matter of time , and in new york his immediate success was startling he won nine consecutive leading rider titles in his first year and a half dominguez is known for his quiet hands , his tremendous patience and his strong , signature style of pushing and driving in the final furlongs graham motion , the trainer of last year s winner , animal kingdom , was one of dominguez s earliest supporters their success together in maryland and delaware helped propel both careers ramon had a knack he still has a knack for getting horses to relax that other jockeys find difficult to ride , which is something i noticed about him from the beginning , motion said i think that s his biggest asset he s just got remarkable hands on a horse asked to explain his talent , dominguez said it was more art than science it s something you kind of learn on your own , he said i ca n't describe how i do it i have a passion for horses and i just try to listen to what they tell me , instead of maybe being a more mechanical rider i feel like that patience pays off motion often gave dominguez his most unruly horses one of those , a headstrong gelding named better talk now , responded to dominguez s patient handling , and their rapport shaped a memorable career with dominguez riding for the latter half of better talk now s nearly eightyear racing career , the horse won the 2004 breeders' cup turf a milestone victory for trainer and jockey and more than 43 million and five grade i races i enjoy the challenge if a horse is difficult or too aggressive , dominguez said i take it as a personal challenge to get that horse to relax this suits the rider , and helps make him stand out in grass races , where saving ground and patience decide razorthin margins dominguez s calm demeanor and humble attitude also stand out in the jockeys' room , where he is widely admired asked if success had changed dominguez , motion said no , not at all that s the most remarkable thing he s still personable , down to earth , kind , well spoken none of that has changed , not even a little bit to figure out a jockey s income , the rule of thumb is to take 85 percent of his horses' earnings for his career , dominguez s mounts have earned nearly 190 million but he does not flash his wealth he drives a 2006 honda civic , which replaced the 1993 honda accord he drove for 13 years he lives near belmont park in floral park , ny , with his wife , sharon , a former exercise rider he met at delaware park , and their sons , alexander , 7 , and matthew , 6 they also own a 14acre horse farm near elkton , md his family is the main reason he rides yearround in new york i'm well aware of this being a short career , he said i just hope that i can do the best i can with what i make , not only for myself but the future of my family my wife and i have a simple lifestyle , and we take pleasure in the small things i do n't keep up with the joneses , so to speak i feel like i have it all dominguez s rise to the top has encountered a few blips jockeys are regular visitors to emergency rooms dominguez missed a month last spring because of a separated collarbone other major injuries included fractured collarbones , wrists and even his skull , the outcome of a nasty spill in 1998 at delaware park his longest layoff has been four months , with a broken wrist , which is better than most of his contemporaries out of superstition , dominguez said he liked to avoid the topic dominguez said he also refrained from setting goals , but he acknowledged that the classic victories that had eluded him were in his mind his best finish in the kentucky derby , for example , was a second in 2006 although he is a firstchoice jockey , dominguez continues to put in his work off the track , arriving at the jockeys' room several hours before the races , to exercise and study the card and watch race replays for the horses he is riding for the first time he does not cherrypick races , either from the derby pageantry to unmemorable races on frigid wednesdays in january , dominguez has been the busiest jockey in racing in 2012 , with 1 , 333 mounts through sunday a day on which he won five races at aqueduct i'm very critical of myself , he said after a race , i always replay what i could have done differently , even if i win i still have my doubts on a daily basis you ca n't rest on your laurels this business sure changes quick last wednesday , with the first race 45 minutes away , dominguez slowed to a jog on the treadmill he usually runs two miles , but this morning he ran three and a half wednesday mornings are often challenging after two days off and an accompanying weight gain the extra fitness was also necessary for the winter ahead , the bonechilling , thumping winds off nearby jamaica bay as familiar as losing tickets scattered on aqueduct s grandstand floors winters are physically demanding , dominguez said , but not as mentally demanding as the highstakes drama of saratoga or belmont but this is dominguez s turf , and he was excited for another meet in which his fellow riders could hope for only secondplace money with a smile , he said , winning always makes you feel a little warmer
when it was over the nation two nations as it were , for the moment convulsed , horrified , at the results a great battle had indeed been anticipated at stake was control of the mississippi river valley , which would likely decide who won the war but the battle of shiloh was not the outcome that anyone wanted beyond the grisly statistics , americans north and south of the masondixon line were suddenly confronted with the sobering fact that shiloh hadn t been the decisive battletoendallbattles there was no crushing victory only death and carnage on a scale previously unimaginable the casualty figures at shiloh were five times greater than its only major predecessor engagement , the battle of bull run , and people were left with the shocking apprehension that more , and perhaps many more , such confrontations were in store before the thing was settled among the many ironies of the battle is that its name was taken from a small chinkandmortar methodist chapel on the battlefield that had been christened after the hebrew expression for place of peace the building itself was hardly better than a respectable tennessee corncrib , but it was a house of god and gave its name to the first of the great battles of the civil war the fate of the armies was sealed in midmarch when gen ulysses s grant s 49 , 000 men began disembarking at pittsburg landing elsie duncan hurt was 9 years old at the time , a child of one of the area s farmers her black nurse returned from the landing one day with word that there were strange steamboats on the river and yankees camped in the hills this news soon flashed to corinth , miss , a mere 20 miles to the south , where the renowned confederate general albert sidney johnston had gathered 45 , 000 rebel soldiers bound to the destruction of yankee host invading southern soil at johnston s side was the dashing and magnificently named louisiana creole general pierre gustave toutant beauregard , recently celebrated as the hero of bull run noted as a master of strategy and tactics , beauregard urged an immediate attack on grant , who was awaiting the arrival of a second union army marching overland from nashville under gen don carlos buell when the two combined , they would constitute an irresistible force against any rebel army in the western theater johnston also wanted to wait for another army , a 14 , 000man force coming from arkansas under gen earl van dorn , but beauregard persuaded him to strike at once , before buell could arrive johnston told the creole to draw up the attack order confusion and disarray reigned from the outset first came an appalling mixup in the muddy streets of corinth , where the 10 , 000man corps of gen leonidias polk \( a cousin of president james k polk and , until recently , the episcopal bishop of louisiana \) was encamped with all of its wagons , animals and baggage for reasons unknown , polk idiotically refused to march without a written order which was still being composed and it proved impossible for the other corps to move around him at long last polk shoved off , but the delay cost the confederates precious time and prompted one of his officers to remark , polk had been in the cloth too long the remainder of the march quickly turned into such a ceaseless military fiasco that it reminded an artillery captain of the temple scene from orlando furioso a mighty rainstorm doused the countryside in floods and washed out roads men became lost during the night whole regiments got lost , even guides got lost and by dawn entire divisions were so hopelessly entangled that it became necessary to postpone the attack until april 6 , perhaps a fatal error meanwhile grant s army languished at pittsburg landing , supremely ignorant of the menace slowly lurching toward it the yankee soldiers had not been told to fortify their positions in fact they were ordered not to which left them camping in the open like boy scouts , while daily instruction was given in closeorder drill , weapons training and latrine building this lack of preparation against attack has never been satisfactorily explained after the battle , gen william tecumseh sherman suggested that fortifying adversely affected the courage of the men , implying that if they dug in it would look like they were scared of the rebels both he and grant maintained that since there were so many green , or untrained , volunteers in the army , the men s time would be better spent learning military technique in any case , even as the attack was about to burst upon them , when yankee officers in the most forward camps began reporting a strong enemy presence in their fronts , sherman threatened to have them arrested for spreading false rumors on the morning of april 6 , when these reports could no longer be ignored , sherman crossly mounted and rode forward just as the main confederate battle line emerged from a hedge of trees as he reached for his field glasses , a bullet struck his orderly in the head the orderly toppled from his horse , dead sherman himself was hit in the hand and dashed off , shouting , my god , we are attacked ! all of this overshadowed an otherwise idyllic sunday morning that had broken cool , bright and clear in the yankee camps , where the men were finishing breakfast , polishing brass and leather or attending services orchards were in full flower , dogwoods were in bloom , the forest floor was carpeted with violets a number of men recorded that a great many birds were singing in the trees , an ironic cacophony against the sudden spatter of gunfire the rebel army , together at last , presented a stirring and dismaying sight , as regiment after regiment , dressed in confederate gray or butternut brown , emerged from the woods in three successive waves , each in a line two miles long banners waving , officers on horseback shouting orders , they marched in perfect order as if they were on parade sunlight glinted off their gun barrels and bayonets and their bands played dixie , but above it all the bonechilling rebel yell rose from tens of thousands of throats , nearly drowning out the music and the gunfire on they crashed forward through forest and field , preceded by a diaspora of frightened wildlife bounding rabbits , leaping deer , whirring coveys of quail while union officers tried frantically to put their units into fighting order men , some of whom had only received their weapons the day before , were hastily shoved into a line of battle artillery batteries that had never fired a round were raced to the front , where they began blasting shot , shell , canister and grape into the surging enemy among the first casualties was the rebel general adley h gladden , a prominent new orleans merchant and president of that city s exclusive boston club leading a charge , he was blown from his horse by a cannonball that tore off his arm at the shoulder , mortally wounding him his opposite in the union line was 38yearold col everett peabody , a 6foot1 , 240pound , massachusettsborn and harvardeducated engineer commanding a missouri volunteer regiment that bore the brunt of gladden s attack he was struck by five bullets during the first two hours of fighting , buying time for the yankee divisions in his rear , before a sixth slug shattered his skull , killing him all morning the confederates drove the blue coats northward in a carnival of carnage that left the mutilated bodies of both sides strewn in heaps amid great heroism and equally great cowardice an estimated 10 , 000 of grant s troops fled the fighting and hid under the bluffs by the river , while a number of rebel regiments were banished to the rear for timidity in battle grant had arrived on the battlefield about 9 am after a twohour steamboat trip from the mansion where he d been staying , nine miles downriver it was an unfortunate and unfair stain on his reputation that , even years afterward , the lady of the house was called upon to testify that grant was sober when he left the premises thirtynine years old , flawed , an indifferent west point student , disgraced as an army officer , gossiped about as an alcoholic , a failed farmer and a failed businessman , ulysses grant had come to his command almost as a fluke only nine months earlier the illinois governor had appointed him to take charge of a dissolute regiment of volunteers that he described as a mob of chickenthieves , led by a drunkard grant managed to whip these miscreants into shape so efficiently he was given two more troublesome regiments , which constituted a brigade under army regulations , such a command required a brigadier general , and thus the oncedisgraced grant suddenly found himself wearing the stars of a general officer in the united states army early on he had become friends with another flawed officer , sherman , who had been publically accused of being both timid as well as insane and sent into military limbo before redeeming himself with the army during grant s push south it was suggested that at shiloh sherman might have been overcompensating for the accusation of timidity by belittling the notion of a rebel attack the rebel onslaught continued unabated , and the union front lines grudgingly collapsed as the confederates pressed forward elsie duncan hurt remembered the fighting began at our gate just past the house as the battle raged it got further away leaving dead men and dead horses behind about midday the fighting coalesced around the union center , at a scrubwood forest that became known as the hornet s nest for the interminable bullets zinging through the air it was bisected by an old wagon trail called the sunken road , where so many soldiers of both sides perished men who went through there next day said that such trees as remained standing were riddled with so many thousands of bullet holes they were astonished anyone , or anything , had survived it by midafternoon general johnston was exceedingly pleased with the progress of his assault the original intention was to drive the yankees northwestward , into the boggy , moccasininfested swamps of snake and owl creeks , where they could be rounded up as prisoners now they were simply being driven backward due north but the fortunes of war frowned on general johnston that day acclaimed personally by jefferson davis as the confederacy s finest officer , johnston was a perfect specimen of military prowess and acumen , and at 59 , he was at the height of his career when the war broke out he spurned an offer of high union command to side with his native south and was put in charge of the department of the west even with the frequent bullet or cannonball whizzing overhead , and with death and destruction all around him , johnston was in unabashedly good humor until word came from one of his corps commanders that a tennessee brigade was refusing to fight shocked , he rode to the scene and shamed the tennesseans by declaring that he would personally lead their charge the attack was soon successful in taking a bloody union strong point known as the peach orchard , amid a rain of bulletclipped blossoms that fluttered down like snowflakes among the wounded , the dying and the dead shattered refugees from both sides made their way nearby to the socalled bloody pond to bathe their wounds beneath an unspoken \( and unauthorized \) truce , as the savage fighting raged all around them returning from his charge about 2 pm , johnston suddenly reeled in his saddle when he was lowered from his horse it was discovered that a bullet had severed an artery behind his knee within a few minutes he bled to death in his boot in the rush of battle , he hadn t even known he was hit a doctor would have immediately stanched the wound with a tourniquet , but as luck would have it , johnston had sent his doctor away to tend some wounded yankee soldiers command abruptly devolved on beauregard , whose headquarters had moved forward near the shiloh church where sherman had been encamped following johnston s death a lull was said to have settled over the field for nearly an hour , which many southerner s blamed on beauregard s inaction nevertheless , as the afternoon wore on , the confederates pressed nearer to pittsburg landing , the last union stronghold the hornet s nest finally collapsed between 5 and 6 pm with the mortal wounding of union gen whl wallace , a division commander , whose young wife , come to surprise him , was waiting on a steamboat at the landing shortly afterward came the capture of union gen benjamin prentiss , along with the surrender of his entire division as the sun cast its last , long shadows , it was beginning to look like the end for the federal army good news came with the arrival of buell , whose army would cross the river near sundown it was not a moment too soon , for grant s army had begun to draw up for a lastditch stand with its back to the miry wastes of snake creek gen braxton bragg immediately ordered his corps to sweep everything forward drive the enemy into the river grant s adjutant had placed a battery of enormous siege guns in the union line at that particular point , and the very shock of its fire drove the confederates back as grant was observing these proceedings , a rebel cannonball blew the head off of one of his aides standing not 10 feet away soon bragg was sending out reinforcements , organizing another , final charge to break the union line then he was staggered by orders from a messenger beauregard , unaware that buell had arrived , had called off the attack till morning bragg was convinced that even though some of buell s army was taking the field , one last great charge would split the line and the battle would be won my god ! bragg cried , as he watched other rebel units pulling back too late ! my god ! too late ! it was also too true beauregard , commanding from the shiloh church nearly two miles from the present scene of battle , was unaware that buell s army was arriving he believed only the remaining yankees of grant were milling around pittsburg landing like goats being prepared for the sacrifice and could be mopped up in the morning but with morning instead came one of the great reversals of the civil war dawn brought an uproar of union artillery and word that the yankees were attacking all across the rebel front for half a day beauregard put up a good fight , if for no other reason than he couldn t think of anything better to do , but the odds were hopeless and his men were spent at around 2 pm on april 7 , beauregard ordered a withdrawal back to the stronghold of corinth that should have ended the matter , but instead the next day sherman took a large force in pursuit until he ran into a man nathan bedford forrest with whose name he would become well acquainted as the war progressed at the battle of fallen timbers on april 8 , forrest taught sherman a lesson about the power of cavalry that he would not soon forget , and with that , the fighting at shiloh came to an end there remained the repugnant task of burying the thousands of dead , as well as hundreds of dead horses the butcher s bill at shiloh was just shy of 24 , 000 killed , wounded and missing , about evenly divided between both sides nothing like it had ever happened in the western hemisphere by comparison , the combined casualties at the battle of bull run were 4 , 800 in fact , the two days fighting at shiloh had produced more casualties than all the previous wars of the united states , combined word soon got out to the union public that grant s army had been surprised , that men were bayonetted to death in their tents while they slept , which was an exaggeration the public was incensed to hear that an entire 8 , 000man division never took the field on the terrible first day , which was true \( it belonged to gen lew wallace , who took the wrong road and would afterward write the novel ben hur \) there was also the shameful matter of the 10 , 000 of grant s soldiers who ran away in the press and in the halls of congress grant was censured for dallying in a mansion miles from the battlefield , for failing to fortify , or reconnoiter , or to even have a battle plan in case of attack , as well as failing to pursue and destroy the beaten confederate army much of this sticks but there were also accusations of drunkenness , indifference and sloth , which do not in washington , a chorus arose for grant s removal , despite the fact that he had won the battle popular lore has it that when grant was accused of drunkenness , lincoln told the critics , then find out what kind of whiskey he drinks and send a barrel to my other generals there is no real evidence he ever said this , but there is evidence that he said of grant i can t spare that man he fights in the south there was widespread dismay over the outcome and over the death of sidney johnston late on the first day of battle beauregard had foolishly sent a telegram to richmond saying , the day is ours ! disappointment was palpable , and davis wept bitterly over johnston s death they had been at west point together he never forgave beauregard for calling off the attack the significance of shiloh cannot be overstated if the union had lost badly , there would have been practically nothing standing in the way of a southern invasion of the north cities like st louis , cincinnati , chicago , even cleveland , would have been exposed almost certainly kentucky would have joined the confederacy and probably missouri as well , a calamity for the union southern states would have rallied and recruits poured in lincoln would have had to shift his armies to counter the threat , upsetting the military and political balance at the most critical time none of that happened , of course but a very real and important result of the battle was that after shiloh grant reached the stark conclusion that the only way to restore the union would be the total conquest or in his words , subjugation of the south sherman had understood this long before shiloh and began to indulge his soontobe wellknown pyromaniacal urges along the mississippi river near memphis but the overarching significance of shiloh was to impress on everyone that there was never going to be one neat , brilliant , military maneuver that would end the war or even come close to winning it it was as if shiloh had unleashed some tremendous , murderous thing that was going to drench the country in blood , as sherman had prophesied on the eve of secession from the ordinary foot soldiers point of view , they had seen the elephant , as the expression of the day went for many it was so terrible that they ran and hid behind the bluffs it was terrible for others too , but they stood their ground and faced it , or died trying none of them who went through shiloh would be the same again confederate private sam watkins of the first tennessee summed it up in his countrified elegance i had been feeling mean all morning , as if i had stolen a sheep i had heard and read of battlefields , seen pictures of battlefields , of horses and men , of cannons and wagons , all jumbled together , while the ground was strewn with dead and dying and wounded , but i must confess i never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called glorious war until i saw this winston groom is the author , most recently , of shiloh , 1862 photo by squire fox
london far from the london games , in the eastern german town of jena , marlies gohr watched television friday as the united states broke one of track and field s oldest and most suspect records in the women s 4x100meter relay when the time flashed 4082 seconds even the americans were stunned most sprint records are sliced onion thin , set by hundredths of a second at a time this one was slashed by more than half a second from the 4137 run by gohr and three east german teammates on oct 6 , 1985 , in canberra , australia on saturday , gohr , now 54 and a psychologist , said by telephone that she was not surprised the record had fallen twentyseven years is a long time , gohr said the americans put on a very strong performance that east german record had been set on one of the most infamous days in track and field another east german , marita koch , ran the open 400 in 4760 seconds that october in canberra no woman has since come closer than 65hundredths of a second to that mark koch s record seems likely to remain unapproachable for years after the fall of the , it was revealed in documents and trials that east germany had operated a statesponsored system of doping known by an orwellian euphemism supporting means sport became a propaganda tool , and a country of 16 million rivaled the united states and the soviet union for olympic medals i'm glad these records are coming down , said steven ungerleider , an american sports psychologist and the author of faust s gold , about the east german system they should have been rescinded or marked with asterisks years ago everybody knows these were clear violations and doping infractions of course , doping did not exist only behind the berlin wall many sprinters other than east germans have used banned substances ben johnson of canada and marion jones of the united states , to name two , have been stripped of golds every sensational performance in track and field now brings celebration tempered by skepticism when asked about the validity of the east german relay record , gohr said , with doping , why do they always mention the east germans but not the americans or the jamaicans \? gohr won gold medals in the 4x100 relay at the 1976 montreal games and the 1980 moscow games she finished second at 100 meters in moscow in 1977 , gohr was credited with being the first woman to run 100 meters under 11 seconds with electronic timing on saturday , as she has previously , she denied ever having knowingly used illicit substances to fuel her speed the east german system was very strong , gohr said we had many good trainers the problem with gohr s denial is that it has been proved to be false , said dr werner franke , a molecular biologist from heidelberg , germany upon german reunification in 1990 , franke uncovered a trove of secret doping documents in the east german central army hospital in the resort town of bad saarow he assisted his wife , brigitte berendonk , whose landmark 1991 book , translated as doping from research to cheating , revealed the details of the east german system on saturday , franke said by phone that gohr had received performanceenhancing drugs from the time she was a teenager , according to the documents he uncovered her highest annual dosage of the steroid oralturinabol was 1 , 405 milligrams in 1984 , a year before the relay record was set , franke said that was high , twice the concentration the male sprinters got , franke said crazy he sympathized with the former east germans who took banned substances , franke said they lived in an authoritarian society some young athletes thought they were taking vitamins , not steroids a number have developed health problems thought to be related to steroids about 200 former athletes have been acknowledged as victims by the german government and have received payments the real number of victims may be 2 , 000 , franke said some former east german athletes have admitted using banned substances a few have renounced their medals others like gohr should step forward , franke said the international olympic committee has decided not to do anything to them , he said they should clarify and clear their name to tell the truth does not damage you at the london games , the united states had run a blistering time in the heats of the 4x100 relay before friday s final , bianca knight turned to and said , we 'll probably get the world record today knight , 23 , was not yet born when the east german record was set in fact , her birth date came only 10 months before the berlin wall fell for all she knew , knight said , the east german record stood so long because relay runners struggled with their baton exchanges , a familiar american malady our main goal get the stick around , knight said the americans did , flawlessly tianna madison handed the baton to felix , who passed it to knight , who gave it to for the anchor leg as she sped home , jeter pointed to the clock near the finish line my heart said , we just did it , ' jeter said i did n't know we ran 4082 but i definitely knew we ran well felix , the olympic 200meter champion , saw the time on the scoreboard and was confused that is not a 4x100 time , she told herself what is going on \? the east german record had been considered beyond reach for so many years so felix waited to celebrate the posted results are unofficial sometimes they change but 4082 stood this is insane , felix told herself none of the american sprinters on the recordsetting relay team have been implicated in doping but history made the reaction to their accomplishment complicated , joy mixing with restraint most people in the olympic bubble have to look carefully at every record that is broken , said ungerleider , the author and sports psychologist everyone has to shake their head and say , i hope it s clean' there s a bit of skepticism everyone is careful , circumspect
london denmark is in afghanistan to secure denmark that is the bald official message that has sustained a danish contribution to natoled operations in afghanistan for a decade given the overwhelming numerical contribution of us forces to the military effort in afghanistan , it is sometimes easy for enemies and allies alike to view the conflict as america s war this week s headlines have been dominated by the deaths of 16 afghan civilians at the hands of a lone us soldier before that came the uproar over us personnel in afghanistan burning copies of the koran however , 49 other nations have , to a greater or lesser extent , been involved in the international campaign , sharing its triumphs and its tragedies and of these none have been more supportive than denmark the danes , therefore , provide a bellwether of european opinion about the war amid a growing , continentwide popular consensus that it cannot be won if even the danes decide the war is unwinnable , then perhaps it is in denmark , as elsewhere , retreat with some honor intact appears to be the best option now on offer jens ringsmose and berit kaja b rgesen , two academics from the university of southern denmark , have argued that a consensus among atlanticist danish politicians , and a skillful narrative of success that has been woven around denmark s contribution , has helped sustain public support for the war at up to 50 percent in recent years that was despite the fact that with 42 deaths , mainly in the frontline province of helmand , denmark lost more soldiers per capita from its 55 million population than any other european army there are presently 720 danish soldiers serving in afghanistan in the official danish narrative , according to ringsmose and b rgesen denmark must , so a much reiterated government soundbite asserts , confront the terrorists in helmand in order not to encounter alqaeda in copenhagen but villy soevndal , the danish foreign minister , broke a taboo late last year by acknowledging this war will not let itself be won militarily he told the danish broadcaster dr news that is why i am very happy with the new strategy of transferring responsibility for military tasks and policing tasks to the afghans themselves james p cain , when he was us ambassador in denmark , warned as early as 2008 that danish support for the afghan war should not be taken for granted despite broad support in parliament in a confidential memorandum , subsequently published by wikileaks , he noted danish public support regarding nato s engagement in afghanistan , however , is slipping , jarred by continuing casualties and the perception that other allies are unwilling to share the risks and dangers of fighting in afghanistan s restive south he urged his own government to acknowledge denmark s contribution while helping with the success stories denmark needs to convince an increasingly skeptical public that nato can prevail against the taliban that skepticism appears to have grown in the intervening period after denmark spent 13 billion kroner , or 23 billion , as its contribution toward the decadelong war against the taliban the bill is too big compared to the poor results , according to mikkel vedby rasmussen of copenhagen university s center for military studies the worstcase scenario is that we simply withdraw and the taliban takes over , he told the daily jyllandsposten bad news from the front line has now eclipsed the positive official narrative , adding to negative portrayals of the war in popular entertainment media that have undermined public support the second season of the blockbuster danish tv drama series forbrydelsen \( the killing \) that was screened throughout europe involved a coverup of civilian killings in afghanistan involving danish soldiers then , a film by the young director janus metz further dented the perceptions of his fellow danes about the conduct of the war armadillo , a fictional work that implied danish soldiers had broken the rules of war by killing wounded afghans , incited a nationwide debate mr metz would not comment at the time on whether denmark should withdraw its troops the copenhagen government has since set a departure date of 2014 but he commented many of the afghans i have spoken to see the international forces as people who ve just landed from the moon
r a dickey has been pitching with such profound dominance lately that when he digs his fingernails into the ball at citi field on sunday night and stares in at derek jeter , it will be hard not to think back to what a predecessor of dickey s did 54 seasons ago the last pitcher to nohit the by himself was hoyt wilhelm , a godfather of the knuckleball , who twisted yankee hitters into knots on sept 20 , 1958 , while pitching for the more than half a century later , dickey , one of wilhelm s knuckleball descendants , is pitching well enough to make you wonder could he do what wilhelm did , and on national tv no less \? dickey s last two starts were onehitters , making him the first pitcher since dave stieb of the toronto blue jays in 1988 to accomplish that feat dickey also struck out 12 and 13 batters in those games and became the first pitcher since 1900 to throw backtoback complete games with one hit or fewer and at least 10 strikeouts in each game dickey , of course , is pitching better now than wilhelm was in '58 wilhelm was a combined 310 that season for the orioles and the cleveland indians , although his earned run average was a fine 234 dickey s current era is even better , standing at 200 his record , 111 , is the best in baseball , and his matchup with c c sabathia on sunday night is the highlight of this yankees weekend and if it seems unlikely that a team with jeter , robinson cano , curtis granderson , alex rodriguez and dickey s friend mark teixeira could get nohit , consider that wilhelm did it against mickey mantle , yogi berra , elston howard , bill skowron and bobby richardson , all of whom would go on to beat milwaukee in the world series whatever hoyt wilhelm was able to achieve and pass on , that s definitely in me and in my pitches , in a sense , dickey said thursday it s part of the legacy , for sure but it s not like i'm going into a game thinking about that i'm trying to give my team a chance to win the lineage of knuckleball pitchers is a tight one , and the line from wilhelm to dickey is easy to trace wilhelm tutored charlie hough , the los angeles dodgers knuckleballer , and hough tutored dickey in a way , wilhelm s knuckleball is the grandfather of dickey s in 1971 , wilhelm was released by the atlanta braves and signed by his old dodger teammate tommy lasorda to pitch for class aaa spokane lasorda wanted wilhelm to help hough perfect his knuckleball , and he did wilhelm gave hough a new way to hold the ball , and he aligned him to the firstbase side of the pitching rubber , which helped get hough s knuckler over the plate later , when dickey was with the texas rangers , hough was asked to tutor him , and he gave dickey personalized instruction on the idiosyncratic art of the knuckleball , including tidbits culled from wilhelm i was so fortunate to be able to learn from a hall of fame pitcher in triplea , hough said of wilhelm in a telephone interview the entire time i was with him , i made sure to play catch with him every day , because i felt i could learn from watching him closely anything i could pass on , some of it came from hoyt , certainly hough said wilhelm who was born in 1922 in huntersville , nc fought in the battle of the bulge in world war ii and pitched in the majors until he was nearly 50 was modest he never bragged about his nohitter , even though it came against a team that was in the world series almost every season wilhelm came up with the giants and was a relief pitcher until 1958 , when the orioles asked him to start for the first time , at age 35 his nohitter came in only his ninth career start , on a rainy day at memorial stadium the baldish north carolinian , whose delivery often baffles catchers as well as batters , held the yankees hitless and runless as the orioles gained their second straight triumph over the bombers , 10 , before a cheering crowd of 10 , 941 , the new york times reported at the time it was the fifth nohitter against the yankees , and by coincidence , the opposing pitcher was don larsen , who two years earlier made history by throwing the only perfect game in world series history the only nohitter against the yankees since wilhelm s was a combined effort by six houston astros pitchers on june 11 , 2003 wilhelm had a distinguished 21year career and was elected to the hall of fame in 1985 he died at 80 on aug 23 , 2002 one of the quirks on his r sum is that he had a home run in his first atbat in the majors in april 1952 at the polo grounds but never hit another \( for those who are wondering , dickey has none \) over all , wilhelm appeared in 1 , 070 games , only 52 as a starter , and compiled 227 saves he was one of the best teammates i ever had , said don sutton , who pitched with wilhelm in los angeles he was just such a gentleman everyone loved being around him everyone , that is , except the 1958 yankees , who stand as the last yankee team to get nohit by one man it took a knuckleballer to do it i guess it builds into the story , dickey said , playing along just a little bit but my focus has to be on the hitters , not on history
atlanta let the record show that before this past weekend , could not have owned the east lake golf club course more if he had held the deed to the property in four previous events at the site of the tour championship , woods had one victory and three secondplace finishes he had gotten the better of par in 13 of 16 rounds , with one gem of 63 and two of 64 east lake was foreign to rory mcilroy until last week , but he had been bringing slightly more familiar layouts to their knickered knees all season mcilroy topped the pga tour in wins and earnings and had formed a chain link of 11 straight rounds in the 60s the two were tournament cofavorites they had a high old time as the spotlighted firstround pairing , amused by greg norman s suggestion that mcilroy intimidates woods they traded brotherly barbs tiger being reminded that he is follicly challenged , rory that he is lacking in height on sunday , the golf gods issued fresh reminders of the sport s vagaries woods recorded a twooverpar 72 and tied for eighth mcilroy s 74 , superior to only four players , sentenced him to a tie for 10th both found sources of solace woods that he reached the semiexclusive field of the fedex cup finals after the personal and physical obstacles that waylaid him the last three years , mcilroy that he shoveled up the second prize of 3 million in the cup race considering where i was last year , it s nice to be where i'm at now , said woods , who displayed none of the slow burn that has occasionally followed foundering sunday rounds i was obviously struggling with my health last year , and this year i was able to turn it around still , when he was gripping a club other than a wedge or putter , woods was frustratingly mortal i hit it great the first day , but after that it was n't very good , especially on the weekend i fought very hard just to shoot what i shot i was n't sharp woods figured to carry one advantage over his competitors as the one with the largest savings account , he would seem least affected by the pressure of 10 million , the winner s portion of the cup bonus , at stake but his leftleaning shot off the first tee foreshadowed a bogey , and he would have closed even with mcilroy if not for a drive on the par3 no 18 that nestled within a foot and a half of the hole mcilroy , though new to the cup format , was sufficiently aware at the turn that his ceiling was very likely second place , so he downshifted and played conservatively i'm a little disappointed , to be honest , he said , blaming errant drives that found only three fairways you 've got to hit fairways when the rough is as tough and the greens are as firm as this i 've had a great few weeks , but it would have been nice to have given myself a bit more of a chance each player was torpedoed by the par3 no 6 , whose green is enveloped by water on sunday , plopping the ball on it was like trying to land a jumbo jet on a tiny island woods and mcilroy were among seven players out of 30 who doublebogeyed the hole , after only three double bogeys were logged before sunday their day was all but done , with a dozen holes to play it was gusty out there , woods said of the sixth his 5iron shot , programmed to travel 188 yards , fell about 10 shy and splashed into the lake mcilroy was initially pleased with his drive , until it caught a hill in front of the green and met the same fate very deflating , said mcilroy , who may soon be coming into some more cash he is seeking a reported 324 million for his house in northern ireland with four greens , a driving range and a fulltime greenskeeper there will be no fedex cup trophy to brighten his next home
kabul , afghanistan at least 11 people died thursday after insurgents attacked a provincial governor s office , but were beaten back by security forces , afghan officials said the attack was apparently an attempt to assassinate the governor of western farah province , mohammad akram khapalwak , who was in his office at the time , and the insurgents once again resorted to the ruse of disguising themselves as afghan police officers , according to the police security chief for the province , mohammad ghaus malyaar mr malyaar said the four attackers wore lightweight explosive vests and carried rocketpropelled grenade launchers and small weapons the target was clearly the governor and his staff , he said six police officers have been martyred , and an employee of the governor s house was also killed all four of the attackers were shot to death by police officers defending the compound , mr malyaar said , and none were apparently able to detonate an explosive vest the attack came less than three weeks after a the governor of kandahar province thursday s attack in remote farah province began when the attackers shot to death two guards at the entrance to the governor s compound in the city of farah , and raced inside , initially confusing defenders who thought they were policemen naqibullah farahi , the spokesman for the governor , put the number of attackers at five and said one of them did manage to detonate his explosive vest

with all remaining players in action and up to six fourthround singles matches going on at once , day 7 of wimbledon has become known as manic monday following it all can be dizzying , but there s not a better ticket to be had on the entire tennis calendar the biggest upset of the day has already happened , with no 15 sabine lisicki turning in a shockingly convincing 64 , 63 upset win over maria sharapova former champions serena williams and petra kvitova both survived dropping sets en route to victories , and will face each other in a quarterfinal tuesday added to that drama is the perennial wimbledon rain , now with the added wrinkle of debates over whether to close the roof for now it s open , and for now there is no rain all that and more might change dramatically straight sets will be providing live coverage throughout the day novak djokovic eased to victory over viktor troicki on centre court , cruising to a 63 , 61 , 63 victory and moving to his 13th consecutive slam quarterfinal \( just 20 short of federer s active record streak \) despite there being over three hours until the 11 pm curfew , no other match was moved to centre court to finish under the roof this is an especially unfortunate development for richard gasquet and florian mayer , who are playing the lone fourthround match on the top half of the draw that did not finish monday play will resume on outer courts tomorrow at 11 30 am bst \( 6 30 am est \) , and on centre and no 1 courts at noon \( 7 am est \)  ben rothenberg novak djokovic has continued to cruise , taking the second set 61 against troicki he leads 32 on serve in the third the two \( along with no 8 janko tipsarevic \) will play singles for serbia at the olympics djokovic and troicki will play doubles , and tipsarevic will partner with doubles specialist nenad zimonjic the two mixed doubles pairs the players have said they hope to enter are tipsarevicjelena jankovic and zimonjicana ivanovic serbia has won one olympic medal in tennis , a bronze that djokovic won in 2008 with a win in the thirdplace match over james blake  ben rothenberg novak djokovic cruised to a comfortable 63 first set over friend viktor troicki , and broke in the first game of the second set as well the official wimbledon twitter account has tweeted that weather forecasts do not look promising for other matches to be able to resume it is possible \( but highly unlikely \) that if djokovic routs troicki especially quickly there could be another match placed on centre court the match that might make the most sense would be gasquetmayer , since the completion of that match would mean the entire top half of the draw had finished the fourth round  ben rothenberg the wimbledon schedulers , normally prescient with picking which matches to put on which court in what can sometimes be considered descending levels of intrigue , seem to have miscalculated somewhat with their centre court picks today , at least on the women s side azarenkaivanovic , the only one of the eight women s singles matches placed on centre court , was the most lopsided of all , as azarenka ran away with a 61 , 60 win over an uncharacteristically sparkless ivanovic in matches on other courts , former champions kvitova and serena williams were pushed to three sets , no 1 maria sharapova was eliminated , and kim clijsters lost what became her the final match of her wimbledon career on tertiary no 3 court the day s final match , djokovictroicki , also would seem unlikely to sparkle djokovic has an 111 record against his serbian countryman , and has won their last 11 meetings troicki should have arguably won the pair s seventh meeting , but could not close after establishing a twosetstoone lead \( with a break in the fourth \) in the first round of the 2010 us open that result turned around djokovic s entire career after unexpectedly reaching the final of that tournament , he won four of the next five grand slams djokovic has broken for an early 31 lead it is looking less likely that any of the other suspended matches will be able to resume on outer courts due to continuing rain  ben rothenberg in the only match currently able to be played , no 2 victoria azarenka has cruised to a 61 first set over no 14 ana ivanovic under the roof of centre court ivanovic has been misfiring from all parts of her game her weaknesses \( movement , serve \) particularly weak and her strengths \( forehand , first strike \) largely ineffective the stadium , which emptied to seemingly under 25 at the beginning of the match , is now more than threequarters full the tarps on outer courts have not been inflated , which should be seen as a positive sign that rain is not expected to last much longer  ben rothenberg after a light rain caused short delays on some but not all courts early in the afternoon , play has now been stopped on all courts due to heavier rain the roof on centre court will be closed , but all other courts have been tarped and their players sent off until further notice the match that will continue on centre court is victoria azarenka vs ana ivanovic , which azarenka leads serving at 41 ivanovic struggled with her toss and most other aspects of her game at the outset of the game , and the steady , relentless azarenka capitalized in other action , andy murray is up a set and 41 over marin cilic on no 1 court on no 2 court , mardy fish and jowilfried tsonga are knotted at 11 in the second after fish took the first on no 3 court , richard gasquet is looking to better his abysmal 112 career record in the fourth round of slams , but trails florian mayer by a set and 12 maria kirilenko and agnieszka radwanska both finished wins before the rains came to set up a quarterfinal clash none of the four quarterfinalists on the top half \( kirilenko , radwanska , sabine lisicki , angelique kerber \) has ever made the final of a slam  ben rothenberg andy murray pounced on an opening late in the first set against marin cilic , breaking the lanky croatian at love to take the first set 75 he shouted yes ! as cilic s final errant forehand twisted wide meanwhile on no 2 court , mardy fish became the first player to break jowilfried tsonga in the tournament , eventually clinching the opening set 64 in what would be a sizeable upset given the vastly different momentum with which the two entered wimbledon and on court 18 , mikhail youzhny came back from 24 down in the fifth set to survive denis istomin to reach the quarterfinals of wimbledon for the first time youzhny was previously 07 in fourth round matches at wimbledon the win means that youzhny has now reached the quarterfinals at all four grand slams he has made two us open semifinals , but never a final at any grand slam he will play roger federer next , a match that could be tricky for the sixtime champion depending on his health  ben rothenberg roger federer made his hold on yet another record even more unassailable , advancing to his record 33rd consecutive grand slam quarterfinal with a 76 \( 1 \) , 61 , 46 , 63 win over xavier malisse though it all might seem routine , the match was \( at times \) anything but federer left the court at 43 for an extremely uncharacteristic medical timeout , apparently to treat an iffy back malisse then broke federer for a 65 lead in the first set , but wilted under the occasion of having the chance to take a lead against federer in his postmatch interview , federer apologized to malisse for the delays , calling the trouble a bit of a shock and a freak thing when i was in treatment i was in a lot of pain , federer said he later added if this is my worst , i m happy federer will face the winner of the match between mikhail youzhny and denis istomin , which is in a fifth set on court 18  ben rothenberg in her much discussed final wimbledon , kim clijsters was blown off the court by an inspired angelique kerber , losing 61 , 61 in just 50 minutes the athletic no 8 seed blasted through clijsters from the baseline , using incredible lower body contortions to drop herself low enough to blast the ball despite low bounces clijsters , who won only 30 points to kerber s 54 , left the court with a small wave as she walked off no 3 court definitely not the exit for which she would have hoped clijsters will return to wimbledon to represent belgium at the olympic games at the end of july , and also plans to play the us open before hanging up her racket for good kerber will face maria sharapova s conqueror sabine lisicki in a rare allgerman quarterfinal

he responded by earnestly weighing silver against gold , the pol as metallurgist he terrifies more pragmatic conservatives like the commentator michael medved , who has called him dr demento medved in the daily beast last week that a strong showing by paul in the caucuses and beyond would be disastrous to republican prospects , validating the impression that today s republicans have become a wild and crazy bunch , harboring oddball , irresponsible notions that place them far outside the american mainstream and make them untrustworthy when it comes to the serious business of governance he added , rightly , that paul s associations are n't helpful to a party whose future may depend on its appeal to hispanic and black voters that future was lost on perry , too i caught up with him on wednesday in pella , where he was introduced by , the polarizing arizona sheriff who once 200 immigrants awaiting deportation through the streets and is widely loathed by hispanics perry spoke of arpaio s support as a compliment higher than any imaginable and when one of the iowans who got to ask perry a question commenced a vicious tirade against these mexicans who come to america and fly their flag above the united states flag , perry did n't push back one iota in response to weak poll numbers , he also doubled down on god early in the week he toughened his already tough stance on abortion , saying he was now opposed to it even in instances of rape and incest in pella and elsewhere he crowed about how many planned parenthood clinics in texas he had shut down he quoted the bible , telling voters they must , like the prophet isaiah , offer their service to the lord by voting for perry the symbolism in one of his television included stained glass , a church steeple , a cross religious imagery that was par for the pious course in iowa as the political strategist mark mckinnon the times s jeremy w peters , votedesperate , subtletybereft candidates will light a fire and stand by a burning bush in order to send a signal to evangelicals , i'm one of you' a of perry s questioned the end of the united states military s do n't ask , do n't tell prohibition concerning gays they remain favorite punching bags for conservative republicans , and that s another way in which the party jeopardizes its future surveys make clear that younger americans are much more supportive of gay rights than older ones you would n't know it from the likes of perry and santorum santorum at long last experienced a surge of his very own you have to wonder if tim pawlenty has developed hematomas from kicking himself for quitting the race and reveled in it and he talked not only about the economy but also about abstinence , christianity , morality , decency a remark he made in coralville had a xenophobic , even racist edge digressing to recall that hillary clinton had written a book titled , it takes a village , he pointed out , gratuitously , that s an african proverb he then plugged his own book , it takes a family it takes a perspective less morally smug and divisive to lead this country and for all of romney s own pandering and cringeinducing policy gyrations , he gets this , i think it s possible he 'll prevail in tuesday s caucuses and indeed be speeded toward the general election but the rightward bobs he has felt compelled to make and the ugly carnival here will cling to him and his party more than any vote tally , that will be iowa s harvest , a bitter one
graham motion is the first to admit that he simply will not know how his horse went the day well is doing until he races saturday in the preakness stakes such is the quandary faced by trainers who are starting horses after only a twoweek break since the kentucky derby went the day well appears to be doing well he trained nicely when he was at fair hill training center in elkton , md , for a little over a week after the derby he also trained well the first morning after he arrived at pimlico race course but until saturday , motion will not put the horse under anything like race conditions there will be no halfmile or fiveeighthsofamile works in which a trainer is able to really evaluate the condition of his horse all the trainers who ran their horses in the derby will be similarly challenged i ll have another has galloped very strongly while at pimlico sometimes he gallops faster than a twominute clip he has shown great energy , but we will not know until saturday whether he is really on top of his game bodemeister is another who has not worked between races he ran a huge derby and came up just short many are convinced that he will get an easy lead at pimlico and this will be his race but perhaps the effort to finish second in the derby will be his undoing in the preakness he may bounce , as they say we shall see the new shooters coming into the preakness have a distinct advantage their trainers have been able to prepare their horses for this specific race michael matz , for example , was able to get a very nice workout into teeth of the dog last weekend he was able to get a good handle on how teeth of the dog is doing when i asked him bout that on thursday morning , he quickly replied , he s ready other trainers of the new shooters will be similarly confident in how they think their horses are doing but the connections of the new horses do have to overcome one key question are their horses good enough \? logic would dictate that if they were good enough to compete with the derby starters , they would have started in the derby none of them had the earnings to do so , but perhaps they are simply laterdeveloping horses that are now improving and ready for their best efforts the triple crown presents a unique challenge in sports it is difficult to return a horse for a second top effort after only two weeks , and it is even more challenging to return again in three weeks especially when facing fresher horses in the second and third legs is that fair \? should we change the rules of the triple crown so that only those that compete in the derby can move on to the other legs \? or maybe change the spacing between the races \? well , then it would not be the triple crown it s a very tough challenge , and very hard to win but there will be plenty of us rooting saturday for i ll have another
if tom coughlin wins two more games , does he deserve serious consideration as a hall of famer \? that this question can even be posed is a reflection of the nfl s rollercoaster nature because if coughlin had lost to the jets a couple of weeks ago , many giants fans \( most of them \? \) would have wanted him fired and plenty of fans have wanted him fired at several junctures in his tenure with the giants , including before the runup to his last super bowl title , in the 2007 season so this is more of a speculative exercise than anything he hasn t won anything this year but let s explore a little winning two super bowls doesn t punch a hall of fame ticket tom flores won two with the raiders so did jimmy johnson with the cowboys so did george seifert with the niners none are receiving significant consideration as hall of famers flores has a low winning percentage \( 527 \) johnson lacks longevity \( nine seasons \) seifert was handed a mercedes by bill walsh bill parcells won two with the giants and will be in the hall , maybe even this year mike shanahan has won two , with denver , and will most likely make it , although he has seemed to be trying to give it away in the last five years bill belichick will obviously be in everyone else with at least two super bowls is in the hall coughlin is tied with jeff fisher for 19th in career victories , with 142 he has 114 losses and a winning percentage of 555 he performed wonders with the expansion jaguars , taking them to the afc title game in his second season and also in his fifth if he coaches three more seasons at his current win percentage , he ll pass coaches like marv levy , bill cowher , joe gibbs , bud grant , mike holmgren , and he ll be near parcells territory \( no 11 on the career list with 172 wins \) extra point do you think coughlin has a better resume than seifert , flores and jimmy johnson and could make it into the hall if he wins this year s super bowl \? andy barall has been a voice of reason on giants matters last january , he wrote why keeping coughlin was the right call below is the list of coaches george allen 19661977 paul brown 19461962 guy chamberlin 19221927 jimmy conzelman 192130 , 194042 , 194648 weeb ewbank 19541973 ray flaherty 19361949 joe gibbs 19811992 sid gillman 19551969 , 19711974 bud grant 19671983 , 1985 george halas 192029 , 193342 , 194667 earl \( curly \) lambeau 19191953 tom landry 19601988 marv levy 19781982 , 19861997 vince lombardi 19591967 , 1969 john madden 19691978 earle \( greasy \) neale 19411950 chuck noll 19691991 steve owen 19301953 don shula 19631995 hank stram 19601974 , 19761977 bill walsh 19791988
bob chappuis left the after his sophomore football season to enter the army air forces during in february 1945 , his bomber was shot down over germanoccupied italy , and he spent three months hidden from the nazis by the italian resistance when chappuis returned to michigan in 1946 , he was none too eager to play football again i did n't think i wanted to get myself all excited and lose sleep the night before a game , he told rob newell in the 2006 book but he went on to become an allamerican halfback , leading the wolverines to an undefeated 1947 season , a rose bowl championship and a no 1 final ranking a brilliant passer and an outstanding runner , he finished second , behind notre dame quarterback , in the balloting for the heisman trophy chappuis \( pronounced chappeeus \) was elected to the in 1988 , and when he died on thursday at 89 in ann arbor , mich , he was among the wolverines' most celebrated football figures chappuis appeared on the in november 1947 , when michigan was moving toward a 90 regularseason record and a 490 trouncing of southern california in the rose bowl he passed for 188 yards and 2 touchdowns and ran for 91 yards in that victory that team , which also featured chappuis s backfield teammate , a future michigan head coach , was known as the mad magicians for the deceptive offensive maneuvers run out of s single wing for a singlewing offense , we threw the ball an awful lot , elliott said in an interview sunday it was more passing and deception rather than power the key was bob s ability to pass so well robert richard chappuis was born on feb 24 , 1923 , in toledo , ohio , the son of a businessman after his debut for michigan in 1942 , he became an aerial gunner and radio operator when chappuis s bomber was shot down over northern italy , he parachuted into an olive orchard antinazi partisans picked him up , along with two fellow crewmen , and took them to a family named ugolini in asola , a town in lombardy the ugolinis lived only a few doors from the german military s local headquarters , but they hid the airmen in a 10by10foot upstairs room in a 2008 interview for the legacies project , which makes online videos , chappuis told how the boyfriend of gina ugolini , one of the family s two daughters , discovered the airmen one day and threatened to turn them over to the nazis gina said , you know what will happen \? they will be taken prisoner , and my family will be shot , ' chappuis recalled the boyfriend stayed silent one evening , mama ugolini took the airmen for an evening stroll through the town market to relieve their monotony , dressing them in peasants' garb \( except for their army boots \) so they could blend in she casually spoke to chappuis in italian , calling him roberto , to keep up the ruse , although he had no idea what she was saying chappuis returned to america at the war s end , but he did not forget the ugolinis in 1974 , he and his wife , ann , visited them in asola and received a warm welcome from the townspeople after graduating from michigan , chappuis played for two seasons in the allamerica football conference , with the brooklyn dodgers and the chicago hornets he then settled in fort wayne , ind , and became a corporate labor relations director chappuis had parkinson s disease and died of complications from a fall , his wife said he is also survived by his sons , rob and mark his daughters , mary mccord and betsy wilson nine grandchildren and a greatgrandchild chappuis and his wife moved to ann arbor in 2003 , and while chappuis closely followed michigan football , his thoughts were sometimes far afield from his collegiate exploits he wondered how he would have reacted if he had been in the place of the ugolini family i would hope that given the same circumstances , i would do what they did for me , chappuis said in the 2006 interview but to be honest , i'm not sure i 'd be that brave
the conventional wisdom holds that the periodic rise and fall of various conservative or outside challengers to mr romney newt gingrich , rick santorum , herman can , gov rick perry of texas is a sign that republican voters have aligned into romney and not romney camps further , it claims that mr romney is benefiting since two of the not romney choices , mr gingrich and mr santorum , remain available to republican voters the polling data on this is more ambiguous as lynn vavreck and john sides noted in january , polls have sometimes shown that many of mr gingrich s supporters list mr romney rather than mr santorum as their second choice , and that many of mr santorum s supporters prefer mr romney to mr gingrich but when it comes to the actual behavior of voters once they get around to voting in each state , the evidence seems to be on the side of the anybody but mitt theory take a look at what the polls are projecting right now in georgia , oklahoma and tennessee three southern states that will vote on super tuesday \( virginia will also vote , but only mr romney and mr paul are on the ballot there \) in all three states , mr romney is running in second , and he has an almost identical percentage of the vote in each one he projects to receive 27 percent of the vote in georgia , 28 percent in oklahoma , and 30 percent in tennessee but while mr santorum is running ahead of mr romney in oklahoma and tennessee , in georgia it s mr gingrich with the lead , who long made his home there and so has a unique advantage in the state mr romney could be harmed , of course , if one of the opponents probably mr gingrich were to drop out but a win in georgia for mr gingrich our model has him as a substantial favorite there could give him some justification for continuing his campaign alabama and mississippi vote on march 13 , where mr gingrich could seek to reassert himself if mr gingrich failed to win either of those states , perhaps he would consider dropping out then but at that point , about half the states will already have voted , and mr gingrich will have accumulated some delegates , the majority of which might have wound up in mr santorum s hands of course , some of those delegates could still wind up with mr santorum if mr gingrich were to endorse him after dropping out rules about what delegates are allowed or obliged to do under these circumstances differ from state to state in some ways , however , the republican contest bears resemblance to the democratic primaries of 1988 in that year , michael dukakis lost his fair share of states and won very little in the south but on super tuesday , three candidates al gore , jesse jackson , and richard gephardt each won southern states rather than consolidating the vote mr dukakis was buoyed by the fact that none of them appeared to have a majority path to the nomination , even though he wasn t winning all that many states himself mr dukakis still had some work left to do parrying a challenge from mr jackson in new york on on april 19 , for instance but by that point the outcome of the race had become fairly clear mr romney could follow a similar path his case will be stronger , of course , if he also wins ohio , a state where he still trails in the polls in 1988 , mr dukakis lost most states on super tuesday , but he was helped by wins in texas and florida that may have been of similar symbolic importance
like other shootings before it , the newtown , conn , tragedy has reawakened america to its national fixation with firearms no country in the world has more guns per capita , , or nearly one for every adult experts from the harvard school of public health , using data from 26 developed countries , that wherever there are more firearms , there are more homicides in the case of the united states , exponentially more the american murder rate is roughly 15 times that of other wealthy countries , which have much tougher laws controlling private ownership of guns there s another important difference between this country and the rest of the world other nations have suffered similar rampages , but they have reacted quickly to impose new and stricter gun laws australia is an excellent example in 1996 , a pathetic social misfit , as a judge described the lone gunman , killed 35 people with a spray of bullets from semiautomatic weapons within weeks , the australian government was working on gun reform laws that banned assault weapons and shotguns , tightened licensing and financed gun amnesty and buyback programs at the time , the prime minister , john howard , said , we do not want the american disease imported into australia the laws have worked the american journal of law and economics reported in 2010 that firearm homicides in australia dropped 59 percent between 1995 and 2006 in the 18 years before the 1996 laws , there were 13 gun massacres resulting in 102 deaths , , with none in that category since similarly , after 16 children and their teacher were , the british government banned all private ownership of automatic weapons and virtually all handguns those changes gave britain some of the toughest gun control laws in the developed world on top of already strict rules hours of exhaustive paperwork are required if anyone wants to own even a shotgun or rifle for hunting the result has been a decline in murders involving firearms , which has very strict laws , only 11 people were killed with guns in 2008 , compared with 12 , 000 deaths by firearms that year in the united states a huge disparity even accounting for the difference in population while ratcheting up his national antigun campaign , we are the only industrialized country that has this problem in the whole world , the one americans do not have to settle for that
samuel ballton was born into slavery on new year s day in 1838 on vincent a marmaduke s plantation in westmoreland county , va , about 80 miles south of washington the county was home to the washington and the lee families , part of a tidewater district made rich by bountiful wheat , tobacco and livestock it was a rough , bucolic existence , to which the civil war would bring wrenching , surprising change in the form of new technologies , change that meant new hardships for the region s slaves but also opportunities for escape from servitude when the war broke out , marmaduke immediately sent all his ablebodied slaves , including ballton , to work as section hands on the virginia central railroad in the blue ridge mountains , 200 miles to the west later , probably in early 1862 , ballton was transferred from the mountains of western virginia to fredericks hall station , 45 miles northwest of richmond and a few dozen miles from his birthplace ballton s experience on the railroad was not unusual slavery is often thought of as a primarily agricultural phenomenon , but thousands of enslaved blacks worked on the railroads right up to and during the civil war , grading lines , building bridges and blasting tunnels they hauled timber , cut wood and shoveled dirt and stone skilled slaves , especially blacksmiths , stone masons and carpenters , worked on the railroads too railroad companies and contractors hired slaves by the hundreds they also purchased slaves directly , in lots of 50 or more in fact , by the 1850s , the south s railroad companies could be counted among the largest slaveholders in their regions they even developed special accounting entries on their balance sheets to show the value of the negro fund in the south carolina railroad s 1857 annual report , for example , the company listed 57 slaves in its possession in 1859 , its holdings had almost doubled , to 90 slaves confederate railroads bought and hired slaves right up to the end of the war , even as slavery fell apart wherever the union army opened corridors of freedom in 1863 the virginia central railroad purchased 35 negro men for 83 , 48460 ballton , in other words , was pitched into one of the fastest growing industrial settings in the south , one which the region s leaders associated with the future and with modernity the south pursued railroad expansion as fast as the north , laying as many miles of track in the 1850s as the midwest , even exceeding the pace of construction in much of the north and slavery was inextricably bound to the south s railroad boom slaves could be moved at the will of a slaveholder quickly from one part of the south to another , and whites could use slaves as collateral on loans to build railroads or purchase new farms what s more , railroads opened up new cotton frontiers in the interior south , expanding the need for slavery in agricultural contexts but the constant moving and confusion of the railroad boom also made escape easier in april 1862 , with union forces outside fredericksburg , va , ballton and a small group of men escaped their camp and struck out for the richmond , fredericksburg potomac railroad they followed it north toward fredericksburg , at one point meeting the road master who had hired them claiming to be on the job , they made their way along the railroad and then through to the union lines , where they encountered the sixth wisconsin , a unit later made famous for its toughness on the battlefield ballton wasn t the only slave to utilize the lines cut by railroads to escape the r f p and the virginia central railroad connected some of the wealthiest slaveholding counties in virginia nearly 80 , 000 enslaved people lived in the surrounding counties , almost a fifth of virginia s total slave population this northsouth axis , running from richmond to washington , became an avenue of freedom tens of thousands of blacks used the railroad to guide them north to union lines the richmond daily dispatch reported 36 slaves had run away from the r f p in april 1862 , almost certainly to the union army one of them , john henry , who was owned by mrs bb wright , was 26 years old and described as 5 feet 10 inches high , black , and slow spoken whether he became the john henry of railroad legend on the c o cannot be known , but the r f p was still looking for these former slaves three months later none had returned or been recaptured in august 1862 , when the union forces retreated back up the line toward washington , black families went with them col ww wright , the engineer and superintendent of the united states military railroads , witnessed the evacuation the contrabands fairly swarmed about the fredericksburg and falmouth stations , and there was a continuous black line of men , women and children moving north along the rail road , carrying all their worldly goods on their heads every train running to aquia was crowded with them according to wright , well over 10 , 000 contrabands walked or rode on the tracks north toward freedom in one week meanwhile , confederate railroad operators took back the r f p the road superintendent immediately took out advertisements in the richmond daily dispatch for the 36 slaves who had run away in april and put up an additional 5 reward for their recapture the skilled africanamerican railroad workers who had moved north with the union troops proved a boon for the northern war effort some of the earliest photographs we have of africanamericans in the civil war come from alexandria in 1861 , where black railroad workers assembled at the orange and alexandria railroad shops they and thousands of others would soon return south , rebuilding sabotaged rail and ensuring the swift movement of troops and supplies turning the confederate railroads against the confederacy was not only a military act but also a social and political one it challenged the south s vision of itself as an advanced modern society marked by railroads and slavery in the premier industry of the age , slave labor on the south s railroads stood in stark contrast to white labor on the north s , and black railroad workers knew that the confederate railroads relied on their labor and skill for his part , samuel ballton became a cook for the sixth wisconsin later , on aug 6 , 1862 , the sixth wisconsin marched to fredericks hall station , where ballton had once worked , and destroyed bridges and railroad track , and burned a large amount of confederate supplies we do not know whether samuel ballton guided the sixth wisconsin on this targeted raid or whether he provided the key intelligence about the location of confederate material there rufus r dawes , the eventual commander of the sixth and hero of gettysburg , described this raid in his memoirs but made no mention of ballton evidence suggests he played a crucial role , however formerly enslaved railroad workers knew a great deal about the location and operation of the confederate supplies and forces , and they served as guides for the union army throughout the south in the official record of events for the sixth wisconsin , moreover , no other confederate railroad station was so explicitly targeted in the summer 1862 campaign ballton s wife was still enslaved on the marmaduke plantation , so he decided to risk recapture and go back into confederate territory to help her escape the pair safely came back through to fredericksburg and then moved to alexandria two years later ballton left alexandria and traveled to boston to enlist in the fifth massachusetts calvary , a regiment of united states colored troops after the civil war ballton moved to long island , eventually became a prosperous farmer with 5 , 000 in real estate and a thriving business , earning a reputation as the pickle king a whole generation of black railroad workers came out of the civil war some continued to work for the railroads over half of all railroad workers in virginia were africanamerican in 1880 but others migrated across the south and out of the south , like ballton , seeking opportunity and acting on what they heard their experience in the first months of the civil war in 1861 and 1862 suggested an important truth that they could turn enslavement on the railroads into freedom , that they could undermine , and even target , the confederacy s key military structures , and in so doing could challenge the confederacy s claim as a modern nation built around railroads and slavery follow disunion at or join us  sources long

andy benoit , who is previewing all 32 nfl teams , concludes his tour of the nfc south with a look at the falcons , whom he picks to win the atlanta falcons have done everything the nfl manual says to do the owner arthur blank has assumed an active role in the club s daytoday operations , but he spends a majority of his time on the business side with the team president rich mckay he leaves the football side to general manager thomas dimitroff dimitroff has the type of autonomy every executive covets , though he doesn t hoard power he has an intricately involved scouting department and a strong working relationship with coach mike smith  under this stable power structure , the falcons have constructed one of the soundest , richest rosters in the league they ve groomed what they believe is a franchise quarterback in matt ryan they have a topfive receiver in roddy white , flanked by a secondyear phenom , julio jones lining up between them is a future hall of fame tight end , tony gonzalez this isn t just an aerial offense , though , far from it atlanta has a big , cohesive front five , which is well suited for the sustainable power run game that veteran michael turner provides the falcon defense is not quite as talented as the offense , but it s just as balanced there are a handful of praiseworthy pass rushers up front , staunch interior players , a rising star at linebacker \( sean weatherspoon \) and a secondary featuring three bigname corners brent grimes , dunta robinson and newbie asante samuel  according to the nfl manual , the falcons should be serious super bowl contenders they may have been the only team that went into this past april s draft without a single obvious hole to fill on either side of the ball \( which is why no one voiced any concern about the fact that , thanks to past trades , just two of their six total selections came before the fifth round \) yet , heading into the 2012 season , the falcons are known as the team that can t win a playoff game they re 03 in postseason play since the dimitroff smith ryan era commenced in 2008 if you re dimitroff , what do you do \? you can t change head coaches smith has done way too good a job you can t make drastic alterations to your personnel none of your weaknesses are distinct enough to justify an expensive repair job you can t gather the team and give them a moving speech about focusing , stepping up in big moments and wanting it more because such dramatic nonsense only carries weight in disney movies and on lazy studio shows so what do you do \? how do you push your morethanready franchise to the next level \? dimitroff and smith actually came up with a solution bring in new toplevel assistant coaches to install more sophisticated schemes ladies and gentlemen , say hello to offensive coordinator dirk koetter and defensive coordinator mike nolan the two men charged with propelling atlanta to the top offense it might seem ridiculous to talk up dirk koetter as the man who can save atlanta s offense after all , koetter s offenses in jacksonville ranked sixth , 24 th , 24 th , 18 th and 28 th in scoring in the five years he was there but koetter s offenses in jacksonville never had any quality weapons in the passing game and koetter is a passing connoisseur under previous coordinator mike mularkey , the falcons spent a lot of time in heavy base personnel \( multiple tight ends , multiple backs in the backfield \) they were built around a highvolume interior run game , with a passing attack that was full of rudimentary isolation routes koetter will add more dimension and variables to the passing attack he ll design more complex route combinations that will rely on matt ryan s ability to dissect and manipulate defenses a more sophisticated passing game should play to ryan s strengths one plus from playing in mularkey s system was , last season , when the falcons did go to the air , they tended to do so with threereceiver personnel out of a nohuddle ryan gained valuable experience calling signals at the line of scrimmage and setting his own protections ultimately , these are traits a young quarterback must hone koetter , who values having strong working relationships with his quarterbacks , should expand ryan s freedoms and responsibilities this season ryan has the mental makeup to handle the heaviest of loads but it won t show unless he becomes more proficient physically if he has more to read while dropping back , he must get more comfortable holding the ball longer and playing from a congested pocket ryan has goodbutnotgreat arm strength , which isn t a problem until he gets a little rattled when defenders crowd him his accuracy , which is normally stellar , can be compromised under duress discomfort in a congested pocket isn t a glaring weakness of ryan s , but it s the weakness currently keeping him from blossoming into a topshelf quarterback he has to change this because , not only are muddied pockets as common in the nfl as third downs and tv timeouts , but the falcon offensive line is an unathletic bunch that has trouble sustaining blocks in sevenstep pass protection koetter , as mularkey did , will probably work around this by dialing up frequent quick drops and rolling pockets for ryan \( who , as a fundamentally sound timingandrhythm passer , excels with these tactics anyway \) nevertheless , the signature of koetter s offense is its innovative downfield aerial designs those often require longer dropbacks koetter never got to showcase his downfield designs in jacksonville if he s to showcase them here , ryan must improve as a lateinthedown pocket passer ryan s not the only player being expected to step forward in 2012 the enticing skills of secondyear wideout julio jones were , ostensibly , a big inspiration behind the decision to bring in koetter and his system jones has extraordinary explosiveness as a straightline , downfield weapon his quicktwitch , stopstart ability still needs refining \( and so does his route running \) , but his raw strength alone can compensate while these attributes develop defenses will have a difficult time figuring out how much attention to give jones if he s primarily used on downfield patterns , it s probably worth regularly cheating a safety over the top to his side problem is , opposite jones is roddy white , one of the most dynamic allaround receiving threats in football with jones s development and koetter s system being structured to incorporate more ancillary receivers in the passing game , white says he s prepared to assume a lesser role in 2012 this doesn t mean you shouldn t take the 30yearold early in your fantasy draft white led the nfl in pass targets last season \( which is partly why he also led the league in drops \) his role is decreasing from that of an overused star to that of just a regular star and it s not as if the falcons have mountains of upandcoming receivers in need of more touches with jones and white lifting more coverages , darting fifthyear slot man harry douglas figures to play a slightly more prominent role running crossing patterns underneath and , of course , there s tight end tony gonzalez , who , at 36 and in what he claims is his final season , can still easily beat the oneonone coverage of just about any linebacker or safety but douglas and gonzalez are it atlanta s fourth wideout , kerry meier , is mostly a special teamer \( in fact , he may fall behind undrafted secondyear pro kevin cone in the pecking order \) no 2 tight end michael palmer is almost exclusively a blocker \( a fine one , at least \) the increased diversity brought forth by koetter s scheme won t lead to using more weapons in the passing game it will lead to using the existing weapons in more ways in the run game , it s a different story the falcons plan on decreasing michael turner s workload and going with more of a backfield by committee this is a wise move on paper , turner didn t show any glaring decline last season \( he rushed for 1 , 340 yards , averaging 45 yards per carry \) but his yards per carry fell below 37 in games after week 10 save for week 17 , when he took advantage of a bucs defense that had quit by that point some speculate that turner s drop in production had to do with the downgrade at fullback , as veteran thumper ovie mughelli was injured and replaced by the weaker mike cox \( cox will be pushed this year by freeagent pickup lousaka polite \) perhaps , but you can t overlook the fact that turner is also a 30yearold pounder who has topped the 300carry mark three of the last four seasons of course , turner averaged just 57 rushing attempts per season in his first four years with the chargers , so you couldn t blame him for arguing that he s still fresh turner isn t arguing that , though or , at least , he s saying all the right things about sharing the load it will be interesting to see how he actually does with this turner s not a very dynamic runner he doesn t succeed by changing the pace of the offense he s methodical and has always thrived on a high volume of touches turner will at least be sharing his touches with a solid group the backup jason snelling is like a quicker , more upright but less controlled version of turner unlike turner , snelling can moonlight at fullback and also catch passes out of the backfield more intriguing is secondyear man jacquizz rodgers it s natural to assume that the 56 fifthround pick is a scatback type rodgers has the quickness to play that role , but he also has surprisingly compact strength \( sort of like a poor man s maurice jonesdrew \) considering he s adept in the passing game , rodgers should give koetter s offense some added dimensions as for the unathletic offensive line , understand that it s not a bad group in fact , it s one of the more cohesive groups in all of football but it s deprived of any standout forces left tackle sam baker has been somewhat disappointing since being drafted 21st over all in 2008 he battled injuries last season and was at one point benched for the more agile will svitek that won t happen this year because svitek is out for the season with an upper arm injury left guard justin blalock has thunderous size but limited range on pull blocks center todd mcclure is reliable but far from dazzling in fact , considering that thirdyear backups mike johnson and joe hawley can both play guard , the falcons may have drafted the nimble peter konz in round 2 this past april to replace mcclure before too long konz projects as a guard , but he spent his entire wisconsin career snapping the ball at right guard , garret reynolds will get a shot at reclaiming the starting job that he lost to hawley midway through last season rounding out the front is right tackle tyson clabo , a mudder who many erroneously believe is atlanta s best blocker \( blalock is atlanta s best blocker \) defense mike nolan won t transform the defensive scheme as drastically as koetter will transform the offense keep in mind , mike smith earned his head coaching job by overseeing a classic zone scheme in jacksonville it s doubtful the 43 based falcons will drift too far into nolan s 34 hybrid system there will be changes , though most of the passrushing pressure manufactured in smith s scheme comes out of zone blitzing with base personnel the falcons hired nolan to spice up their nickel and dime schemes in today s passhappy nfl , defenses spend as much time in subpackages as they do in base the falcons know this that s why they traded a seventhround pick and handed out a threeyear , 145 million contract to acquire eagles corner asante samuel the fourtime pro bowler gives them an accomplished cornerbacking threesome that includes dunta robinson and brent grimes  accomplished does not necessarily mean potent , though there s a reason the eagles were eager to dump samuel it s not just that the 31yearold is in decline samuel has inherent limitations as a press corner he can play well in offcoverage \( ie zone or mantoman with a serious cushion \) that s not all bad in this style samuel is very good at reading quarterbacks and jumping routes but it limits what a coordinator can do with the rest of his defensive backfield no matter what , the falcons will have to play some sort of zone to samuel s side of the field , which means they ll often have to dedicate at least one extra defender over samuel s not the only one who plays with a cushion robinson , though a quick former firstround pick , is one of the league s softest cover artists he requested extra slot duties even before samuel s arrival , but in the slot he ll have to deal with more manbased concepts robinson will probably be an upgrade over christopher owens or dominique franks inside , but don t expect him to flourish as for grimes , he s one of the smarter zone defenders in the game , and he has the athleticism to win oneonone matchups downfield the falcons franchisetagged him this past offseason , which could end up costing them more in a signing bonus if the fifthyear veteran has another big season injuries and inconsistency at cornerback weren t what led to atlanta s hohum ranking of 20th against the pass in 2011 safeties william moore and thomas decoud had their iffy range and coverage instincts exposed the truth is , the falcons are trying to get by with two inthebox type safeties moore , a secondround pick in 09 , can be a playmaking thumper in the flats he fits the mantra of playing faster \( which is something else nolan was brought in to teach \) decoud is the one who needs to be challenged dimitroff and the front office might say they like the guy and that his wrinkles can be ironed out , particularly if the zone scheme is tweaked to help him but when they signed decoud to a fiveyear , 175 million contract this past march , they made just 4 million of it guaranteed in other words , they view this as a makeorbreak season for the 27yearold if decoud flounders , the falcons could turn to veteran chris hope then again , hope is only here because he struggled in tennessee s zone scheme the last two years the falcons , like any 43 zonebased team , rely on generating pressure primarily with a fourman passrush they don t do it unimaginatively , though smith is willing to deploy tricky zone blitzes with his linebackers and safeties that said , they still rely heavily on the guys up front they re hoping that 34yearold john abraham can continue to turn the corner as the leading speed demon outside there s no indication that abraham can t , though his firstand seconddown snaps may need to be curtailed even more the falcons have depth outside to accommodate abraham the sinewy fifthyear pro kroy biermann is a fluid rundefender and probably a more dynamic pass rusher than last year s big freeagent pickup , ray edwards this , however , says more about edwards than biermann edwards is a solid allaround presence , particularly against the run , but he doesn t have great burst and swivel off the snap someone who does is lawrence sidbury , though the 2009 fourthround pick recorded just four sacks as a passrushing specialist in 2011 , and two of those sacks came from being in the right place at the right time against minnesota injuries and inexperience have hindered sidbury somewhat if he has a breakout season in him , this will be it if he doesn t , then fifthround rookie jonathan massaquoi will most likely replace him in the longterm plans inside , jonathan babineaux remains perhaps the most underrated threetechnique tackle in football he s been what 2009 firstround pick peria jerry was supposed to be jerry hasn t been a complete bust he plays with energy and occasionally creates opportunities for others however , unless quick , athletic thirdyear pro corey peters can t bounce back from his early june foot injury \( he missed the first few weeks of training camp \) , jerry has no chance at cracking the starting lineup he ll have to compete for snaps with effective 09 seventhround vance walker  at the second level of the defense , atlanta is rolling the dice by having akeem dent take over for the departed curtis lofton at middle linebacker the 2011 thirdround pick has flashed athleticism , particularly on special teams , and is expected to be rangier in coverage than lofton was nevertheless , this scheme demands sharp readandreact skills against the run , which aren t always easy for young players to immediately cultivate it helps that dent will be playing alongside rising star sean weatherspoon expect the 2010 firstround pick to be regarded as the defense s clearcut best player by season s end weatherspoon plays with an allaround explosiveness that can t be taught and he s very good in coverage , which is critical in this scheme for depth purposes , the falcons brought back 36yearold mike peterson , who has played for mike smith since the two arrived in jacksonville in 2003 the versatilebutnowlimited peterson will most likely be the no 4 linebacker , behind starting strongside man stephen nicholas  special teams kicker matt bryant has always had phenomenal range playing in the climatecontrolled georgia dome only helps as a sixthround rookie last season , matt bosher ranked 12th in both net punting and balls inside the 20 in the return game , harry douglas will handle punts , and jacquizz rodgers will take care of kicks bottom line with the bounty turmoil in new orleans and with the panthers and bucs still young , the falcons window in the nfc south is open wider than ever but the focus with this team is not on winning the division it s on finally winning in the postseason that will come down to how well matt ryan and the offense adapt to dirk koetter s new system the prospects look good predicted finish 1st nfc south nfc title game appearance follow andy benoit email andybenoit

mitt romney condemned efforts to use president obama s former pastor , the reverend jeremiah wright , in ads attacking the president , as reportedly planned by a super pac working toward electing mr romney in november i repudiate the effort by that pac to promote an ad strategy of the nature they ve described , mr romney said during an interview with the conservative townhall web site i would like to see this campaign focus on the economy , on getting people back to work , on seeing rising incomes and growing prosperity particularly for those in the middle class of america mr romney used the opportunity to accuse mr obama of running a campaign is a campaign of character assassination but said of the pac that i repudiate what they re thinking about earlier , mr romney s campaign manager , matt rhoades , said that gov romney is running a campaign based on jobs and the economy , and we encourage everyone else to do the same the times s jeff zeleny and jim rutenberg reported thursday morning on a plan by a group of republican strategists to run ads linking mr obama to his former pastor a copy of the group s detailed advertising plan , obtained by the times , suggests using mr wright s black liberation rhetoric against the president , who attended mr wright s church for years in a statement issued thursday afternoon , a spokesman for joe ricketts , the billionaire to whom the super pac proposal was made , said mr ricketts had no interest in financing the plan joe ricketts is a registered independent , a fiscal conservative , and an outspoken critic of the obama administration , but he is neither the author nor the funder of the socalled ricketts plan to defeat mr obama that the new york times wrote about this morning , said brian baker , the president of the ending spending action fund it reflects an approach to politics that mr ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take , mr baker said the disavowal from mr ricketts did not address whether he had given preliminary approval to the plan , as suggested in the proposal in an interview on wednesday evening , mr baker did not reject the contents of the proposed ad as mr romney s campaign confronts the story about the super pac s plans , its response may be constrained by the forceful denunciation of that very tactic by the republican party s former presidential nominee in 2008 , senator john mccain forbade his advisers from using mr obama s association with mr wright in campaign commercials but his direction was not only made in private mr mccain spoke forcefully and publicly in defense of his democratic rival speaking on fox news four years ago , mr mccain said that he did not believe mr obama should be held accountable for the things that mr wright said from the pulpit , despite mr obama s attendance at the church for years when people support you , it doesn t mean that you support everything they say , mr mccain said in the interview noting the incendiary language that mr wright used , mr mccain said obviously , those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with i don t believe that senator obama would support any of those as well given repeated opportunities by sean hannity , the fox host , to link mr obama to mr wright , mr mccain steadfastly defended his rival , saying i do know senator obama he does not share those views later in the campaign , mr mccain again said he did not believe that mr obama shared mr wright s views about america , though he said mr obama had acknowledged the issue was a legitimate one for people to consider i don t believe that senator obama shares his views in any way , mr mccain said but he has said it s a legitimate topic of discussion if that s what the american people want to discuss , that s fine statements like that from mr mccain may be part of the reason mr romney s campaign quickly rejected the idea of using mr wright as a way of attacking the president already , advisers to mr obama have raised the question of whether mr romney will speak out like mr mccain did stunning ! will mitt stand up , as john mccaln did \? or allow the purveyors of slime to operate on his behalf \? david axelrod , a senior campaign adviser to mr obama , wrote on twitter early thursday morning mr romney s campaign may also fear shifting the conversation of the campaign away from the economy , where advisers believe the president has a weak and indefensible record mr romney has , for example , shied away from discussing the samesex marriage issue , preferring to keep his attention focused on the economy mr romney declined to answer a question about the report when asked about it , saying he had not read the story in a statement mr obama s campaign manager , jim messina , slammed the super pac s plans and criticized mr romney for not publicly condemning the effort in person this morning s story revealed the appalling lengths to which republican operatives and superpacs apparently are willing to go to tear down the president and elect mitt romney , mr messina wrote he added it also reflects how far the party has drifted in four short years since john mccain rejected these very tactics once again , governor romney has fallen short of the standard that john mccain set , reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party mr mccain , in a statement provided to the times by his spokesman , said he stands by his opposition to using mr wright against the president senator mccain is very proud of the campaign he ran in 2008 , said brian rogers , the spokesman he stands by the decisions he made during that race and would make them again today
in a broadside posted prominently throughout nashville in march 1862 , the newly installed military governor of tennessee , andrew johnson , issued an appeal to the people of tennessee after describing the lamentable crisis through which the state s government was set at defiance , and the constitution and the laws contemned , by a rebellious , armed force , johnson solicited support from all those citizens desirous or willing to see a restoration of her ancient government , without distinction of party affiliations or past political opinions despite his cooperative tone , johnson quickly discovered that his task of restoring civilian government in tennessee was far more difficult than he had imagined he had served as governor in the 1850s and maintained his seat in the senate in 1861 , even as his state seceded but none of those experiences quite prepared him for his return as military governor the first to oversee a rebellious southern state as would be the case later in the war and beyond , andrew johnson found himself in a struggle for leadership with few political friends on his side a strictconstructionist jacksonian democrat , whose staunchest unionist allies were southern whigs , johnson was appointed to a constitutionally dubious position by a republican president who did not even appear on tennessee s presidential ballot in 1860 that may explain why he took a moderate tack at first johnson insisted that the new state government would honor those who supported the union all along through the dark and weary night of the rebellion but the erring and misguided would also be welcomed on their return he offered a full and complete amnesty to those who formerly assumed a private , unofficial hostility to the government , so long as they now recognized the just supremacy of the laws and yet almost immediately that spring he faced a hostile local population willing to challenge his right to rule which , in turn , forced his hand more quickly than he might have expected at one point , he arrested prominent confederatesupporting clergymen in nashville , declaring , i punish these men , not because they are priests , but because they are traitors and enemies of society , law and order he then required all local officials to take an oath of loyalty to the federal government or face arrest when nashville mayor richard cheatham was imprisoned for refusing to take the oath , nashvillians insisted upon their right to elect replacements for imprisoned officers johnson acceded , but when a fierce and intolerable rebel was elected to a circuit court judgeship , johnson asserted that statewide democratic elections would have to wait until the state was free from confederate military control he would have to wait two more years for that to happen , and by then , he was already on his way to the vice presidency of the united states johnson faced a challenge from ostensible allies as well his military governorship came with the appointment of a brigadier generalship , which ostensibly gave him weight on army matters but that did little to prevent ongoing disputes with union officers like gen don carlos buell over the protection of nashville and his unionist allies in east tennessee also proved troubling , especially as most of them remained in exile until september 1863 and many others insisted that east tennessee be allowed to pursue separate statehood a proposition that would only weaken unionist influence in the remaining part of tennessee later on , the question of emancipation in tennessee embroiled him in even more conflict with fellow unionists when johnson came around to support emancipation in 1863 , he did so in a clumsy manner he even called himself moses to a gathering of blacks in nashville but this merely opened up new fissures in the state s unionist coalition , which included some deeply conservative men who insisted that the institution of slavery must remain intact most aggravating for johnson was the anomalous military position of the state , where its confederateleaning middle and west sections lay under federal military control , while the heavily unionist east continued to suffer confederate military occupation attempts to restore loyal , civilian rule through democratic election would face either military interference in the east or voter rejection in the middle and west but johnson s task was far greater than the establishment of civilian rule in tennessee the appeal to the people of tennessee was , in effect , the first great act in the reconstruction of the south long before the surrender of confederate armies or even the emancipation of the slaves , andrew johnson set out the basic terms through which the seceded states could return to the federal fold though the appeal was written and proffered by andrew johnson , it received the full blessing and support from president lincoln and the union army what this document reveals , more than anything else , is the direct connection between the debate over secession s legitimacy and the course of reconstruction during the secession crisis , johnson , then a senator , insisted that secession was treasonous and , more important , an act of a few men who conspired to overthrow the federal government throughout the war , johnson maintained that secession was an illegitimate even criminal act that was not only politically treacherous but also constitutionally and theoretically impossible in other words , the socalled confederate states never actually seceded because the power to do so did not exist lincoln agreed with johnson on this point , and in the early phases of the war , it was advanced throughout the federal government as a means of isolating the confederate leadership and stimulating loyalty of the southern rank and file toward the union in some ways , march 1862 was the last moment during which large numbers of unionists , north and south , accepted that limited understanding of secession nashville , along with the rest of middle and west tennessee , had fallen to the union army after the fall of fort donelson in february 1862 with only eight months of allegiance to the confederacy and much of its population maintaining loyalty to the union tennessee seemed the perfect state to employ the individual traitor descriptor of secession but a month later , the epic battle of shiloh on the state s southern border put an end to the illusion that ordinary white southerners continued on as secret unionists waiting for the signal to return to their ancient government more radical members of congress , including massachusetts senator charles sumner , argued that the people of the southern states had , in fact , severed ties with the union but in doing so , the seceded states had effectively committed state suicide and could be treated as conquered provinces and territories to be ruled and reconstructed as the victorious federal government saw fit not only did this justify military rule , but it also opened the path to emancipation slavery could be eliminated via a wartime measure because the earlier state rights to its protection had been rendered obsolete by virtue of secession and war by the end of 1862 only the most conservative unionists doubted the constitutionality not to mention the wisdom of wartime emancipation but if the rest of the union leadership changed its position , johnson didn t his understanding of secession as an illegitimate act of individual treason persisted throughout the war and served as the constitutional foundation for his conservative approach to reconstruction when he assumed the presidency in 1865 for johnson , congress had no right to dictate terms to the sovereign states of the south after the war , just as the states of the south had no right to sever their bonds of union with the federal government but by then the rest of the north , victorious in war and vindictive toward the south , was firmly against him johnson s insistence that the south never actually seceded proved to be a major thorn in the side of radical republicans who hoped to remake the south into a wagelaborbased ,

el segundo , calif as the miles in the air and on the ice accumulate , as the hits become unrelenting , the temptation to sit on the beach and feel the soft breeze can become more pronounced such a temptation seems an enticing way to relieve the physical and emotional fatigue that those contending for the stanley cup feel with summer approaching i think it s been a long , long playoffs , dustin brown , the ' captain , said after a 21 loss to the in game 5 on saturday night physically and emotionally , you 're going to be tired the kings , among the nhl s most frequent fliers , returned to their training complex sunday for a team meeting and to begin resting and rehydrating for monday night s game 6 at staples center a victory would give the kings their first stanley cup in their 45yearhistory it s been tough , but it s been fun at the same time , said defenseman drew doughty , playing in his first cup final playing this long in the season is definitely a little more tiring but because you 're at this stage , you just do n't feel it you do n't feel the bumps and bruises you do n't get tired you 've got so much adrenaline running through your body , and you want it so bad that you put all that aside adrenaline or no , none of the kings took the ice sunday for an optional practice this is where you have to decide if you 're going to keep your energy for tomorrow or do morning skates , forward simon gagne said each player will have to find a way to get that extra energy that might make the difference at the end kings coach darryl sutter provided some assistance by playing gagne in brown s spot on the left side of the kings' top line with anze kopitar and justin williams brownie s spending a lot of energy , said sutter , adding that he also must keep track of the time gagne spends on the ice gagne returned to action in game 3 after sustaining a concussion that caused him to miss more than five months you 're just trying to watch it a little bit , sutter said i do n't know how much gagne played about 10 minutes last night \? that s probably what he can give you , and they have to be very highend minutes the intensity of the stanley cup playoffs causes sutter to wonder why observers expect his team to sweep every opponent los angeles has taken 30 leads in all four series there s some sort of a point that you 're supposed to win four in a row all the time , sutter said that s tough to do i have a hard time figuring that out it s not a picnic playing the games you 've got guys banged up and recovering yet sutter has confidence in his players' ability to generate the energy they need our guys are playing hard , sutter said we know how hard we play we know how to recreate that for brown , that ability will prove pivotal ultimately , i think that s what it comes down to this time of year , the team that finds the next gear , brown said it s going to have to be everyone collectively it s not going to be one or two guys yet brown believes that the stanley cup , which will be at staples center in case the kings win , will provide any extra fuel his teammates might need as tired as we are , we all understand what we 're playing for , he said that s a pretty motivational boost
it hardly needs to be said that any armed force has the potential for internal as well as external violence but the invisible war , kirby dick s incendiary documentary about the epidemic of rape within the united states military , is a shocking and infuriating indictment of widespread sexual attacks on women such behavior , the film argues , is tacitly condoned and routinely covered up the victims are often blamed and their reputations destroyed this unsettling expos \? which won the audience award at the 2012 sundance film festival , may be the most outraged film in the annual human rights watch film festival , which opened on thursday and continues at the walter reade theater in lincoln center through june 28 it is likely to fuel a growing perception of the military as a broken institution , stretched beyond its limits and steeped in a belligerent , hypermasculine mystique that has gone unchecked last week the pentagon reported that there had been 154 suicides among activeduty troops this year , a rate of nearly one a day the rate is higher than that of military fatalities in afghanistan , and it is another sign of incipient breakdown the invisible war is one of

addition to villains , many of this year s films feature heroes who stand up to power and injustice one hero , ai weiwei , is the dissident chinese artist profiled in the official openingnight selection , ai weiwei never sorry directed by alison klayman , the movie covers three years in the life of mr ai , a principal designer of the bird s nest stadium for the 2008 summer olympics in beijing mr ai , an internationally celebrated artist , became an important political figure in china through blogging and via twitter after he researched the deaths of several thousand schoolchildren in the 2008 sichuan earthquake he then created an artwork listing their names , which had been suppressed by the government another of his bestknown projects is a taunting series of photographs that show him making an obscene finger gesture in front of tiananmen square and other sites the film is less a career survey than an admiring political portrait of a stubborn dissident playing a risky catandmouse game with the government in 2011 mr ai was finally detained after spending three months in custody , he emerged unharmed but unwilling to answer questions about the experience another hero

and he followed through among other steps , the environmental protection agency was established in december 1970 \) dr commoner was an imposing professorial figure , with a strong face , heavy eyeglasses , black eyebrows and a thick head of hair that gradually turned pure white he was much in demand as a speaker and a debater , especially on college campuses , where he helped supply a generation of activists with a framework that made the science of ecology accessible his four informal rules of ecology were catchy enough to print on a tshirt and take to the street everything is connected to everything else everything must go somewhere nature knows best there is no such thing as a free lunch although the rules were plain enough , the thinking behind them required leaps of faith dr commoner s overarching concern was not ecology as such but rather a radical ideal of social justice in which everything was indeed connected to everything else like some other leftleaning dissenters of his time , he believed that environmental pollution , war , and racial and sexual inequality needed to be addressed as related issues of a central problem having been grounded , as an undergraduate , in marxist theory , he saw his main target as capitalist systems of production in industry , agriculture , energy and transportation that emphasized profits and technological progress with little regard for consequences greenhouse gases , nonbiodegradable materials , and synthetic fertilizers and toxic wastes that leached into the water supply he insisted that the planet s future depended on industry s learning not to make messes in the first place , rather than on trying to clean them up it followed , by his logic , that scientists in the service of industry could not merely invent some new process or product and then wash their hands of moral responsibility for the side effects he was a lasting opponent of nuclear power because of its radioactive waste he scorned the idea of pollution credit swaps because , after all , he said , an industry would have to be fouling the environment in the first place to be rewarded by such a program in with the new york times in 2006 , videotaped to accompany this obituary online , dr commoner elaborated on his holistic views and lamented the inability of society to connect the dots among its multitude of challenges , calling it an unfortunate feature of political development in this country noting the success of movements that had promoted civil rights , sexual equality , organized labor , environmentalism and an end to the war in vietnam , he said one might think that if they would only get together , they could remake the country but , he added , that has not happened then he said i do n't believe in environmentalism as the solution to anything what i believe is that environmentalism illuminates the things that need to be done to solve all of the problems together for example , if you 're going to revise the productive system to make cars or anything else in such a way as to suit the environmental necessities , at the same time why not see to it that women earn as much as men for the same work \? dr commoner s diagnoses and prescriptions sometimes put him at odds with other environmental leaders he is rightly remembered as an important figure in , april 22 , 1970 , a nationwide teachin conceived by of wisconsin , and he himself regarded the observance as historically important but earth day also illustrated the growing factionalization of a movement in which environmentalism comprised a number of agendas , all competing for attention and money , and could mean anything from ending the vietnam war to growing one s own cabbages that was the context for the rift between dr commoner and advocates of population control , who saw environmental degradation as a byproduct of overpopulation they had become a force on the strength of paul r ehrlich s huge best seller the population bomb conservationist groups like the sierra club and the national wildlife federation were strong supporters of dr ehrlich s views dr commoner took aim at the neomalthusians , as he called those who , like the english scholar thomas malthus , foresaw perils in population growth in a panel discussion with dr ehrlich in 1970 , he said it was a copout of the worst kind to say that none of our pollution problems can be solved without getting at population first he elaborated in his bestknown book , the closing circle , published the next year reducing population , dr commoner wrote , was equivalent to attempting to save a leaking ship by lightening the load and forcing passengers overboard one is constrained to ask if there is n't something radically wrong with the ship in the science establishment , dr commoner s standing was ambiguous along with eminent figures of the postwar years like the chemist linus pauling and the anthropologist margaret mead , he was concerned that the integrity of american science had been compromised first by the government s emphasis on supporting physics at the expense of other fields during the development of nuclear weapons , and second by the growing privatization of research , in which pure science took a back seat to projects that held shortrange promise of marketable technologies it was a concern remarkably similar to that of the distinctly unradical dwight d eisenhower , who warned of the dangerous power of the militaryindustrial complex as he was leaving the presidency but although dr commoner had a record of achievement as a cellular biologist and founding director of the governmentfinanced , he was seen primarily as the advocate for a politics that relatively few considered practicable or even desirable among other positions , he advocated forgiveness of all third world debt , which he said would decrease poverty and despair and thus act as a natural curb on population growth his platform did not get him very far in the 1980 presidential race , which he entered as the he won only about 234 , 000 votes as ronald reagan swept to victory dr commoner himself conceded that he would not have made a very good president still , he was angry that the questions he had raised had generated so little interest his own favorite moment of the campaign , , was when a reporter in albuquerque asked , dr commoner , are you a serious candidate , or are you just running on the issues \? barry commoner was born on may 28 , 1917 , in the east new york neighborhood of brooklyn his parents , the former goldie yarmolinsky and isidore commoner , were jewish immigrants from russia , his father a tailor until he went blind \( the original family name , comenar , was anglicized at the suggestion of an uncle of barry s , avrahm yarmolinsky , chief of the slavonic department at the new york public library \) young barry grew up at a time when it was possible to be both a tough street kid and a studious sort he spent hours in prospect park collecting bits of nature , which he took home to inspect under a microscope that uncle avrahm had given him he was so shy at james madison high school that he was referred to a speech correction class , and after graduation he set out on the track of a quiet academic career with money earned from odd jobs , he put himself through columbia , earning honors in his major , zoology election to phi beta kappa and sigma xi and a ba degree in 1937 , at 20 he went on to do graduate work at harvard , where he got a phd in cellular biology he taught for two years at queens college and served in the naval air corps in world war ii , rising to lieutenant in 1947 he joined the faculty of washington university in st louis parallel to his life as a public figure , dr commoner had a reputation as a brilliant teacher and a painstaking researcher into viruses , cell metabolism and the effects of radiation on living tissue a research team he led was the first to show that abnormal free radicals groups of molecules with unpaired electrons might be the earliest indicator of cancer in laboratory rats he found his political voice when he encountered the indifference of government authorities to the high levels of strontium 90 in the atmosphere from atomic tests quite simply , he said in an interview with the chicago tribune in 1993 , the atomic energy commission turned me into an environmentalist he helped organize the st louis committee for nuclear information in 1958 , and was eventually its president dr commoner told scientific american years later that the committee s task was to explain to the public first in st louis and then nationally how splitting a few pounds of atoms could turn something as mild as milk into a devastating global poison at about that time , he continued , several of us met with linus pauling in st louis and together drafted the petition , eventually signed by thousands of scientists worldwide the petition was part of the scientific underpinning for president john f kennedy s proposal of the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 the first of continuing international actions to fully cage the nuclear beast , dr commoner said as the founding director of the center for the biology of natural systems in st louis , he led a staff drawn from many disciplines in investigating , among other things , lead poisoning in slums , the ecology of ghetto rats , the economics of conventional versus organic farming , and the pollution of rivers by fertilizer leaching dr commoner moved the center from st louis to queens college in 1981 he remained in the thick of things , helping to set up new york city s trash recycling program and defending it against critics like mayor rudolph w giuliani , who had declared the recycling law irresponsible in 2000 , at 82 , dr commoner gave up the center s directorship to concentrate on new research projects , including work on the effects of genetically altering organisms by then he was no longer getting anything like the attention he had enjoyed in earlier times some experts had begun to think that his view of the planet , as a place harmoniously balanced by the trial and error of long evolution , left out too much complexity and too much potential for the unexpected stephen jay gould , the harvard paleontologist and evolutionary biologist , making peace with the planet for the times in 1990 , said that it suffers the commonest of unkind fates to be so selfevidently true and just that we pass it by as a twicetold tale although he has been branded by many as a maverick , dr gould added , i regard him as right and compassionate on nearly every major issue dr commoner married ms feiner in 1980 he is also survived by two children , lucy commoner and frederic , by his first wife , the former gloria gordon and one granddaughter dr commoner practiced what he preached in his personal habits he was as frugal as a yankee farmer , and as commonsensical he drove or took taxis if the route by public transit took him far out of his way on the other hand , he saw no need to waste electricity by ironing his shirts and when a times writer once asked his queens college office to mail some material , it arrived in an old brown envelope with the crossedout return address of the botany department at washington university where he had last worked 19 years earlier
parts of alexei ratmansky s firebird make me wish that i were a child again , with him as a parent or godfather telling old stories with new twists and dimensions at its best , his firebird , which had its new york premiere with american ballet theater on monday night at the metropolitan opera house , feels timeless and modern , an ancient myth for the children , with sexual and psychological layers that appeal to adult intelligence today like that of older firebird ballets , his story has ivan capture a firebird , who buys her freedom with a magic feather he later finds love but is thwarted by the sorcerer kaschei until his feather summons the firebird and wins him victory and marriage but whereas previous ivans have become ruler of russia , this one undergoes a more psychological journey there are also , however , central points where mr ratmansky s storytelling is entirely disappointing , and others where it is simply unclear in many episodes he strains gracelessly hard against the music and in few does he show his best gifts as a dance maker the title role , though danced with many brilliant jumps on monday by the illustrious natalia osipova , proves the most anonymous of its four chief characters stravinsky s complete 1910 score , employed by mr ratmansky , is a masterpiece of narrative moment by moment it s suspenseful , evocative and poetic each phrase conjures up picturesque marvels it covers a vast span of colors , moods , energies on monday , conducted by charles barker , the company s orchestra was at its most luminous stravinsky composed this score in intimate collaboration with the choreographer michel fokine for diaghilev s ballets russes fokine s version today is presented by the and by the royal ballet of london new york is best acquainted with of stravinsky s abbreviated 1945 score , with designs that derive from a version by marc chagall , for new york city ballet some of the most originally successful aspects of the new firebird come from simon pastukh s scenery , a changing psychological dreamscape he and mr ratmansky deviate from other stagings by adding a prologue in which ivan , the hero , dances out frustrations in a dilapidated room fokine s and balanchine s ivan was effectively a nondance role , only acting and partnering the way marcelo gomes s virile , troubled hero makes rhythms that have no counterpart in the music is a foretaste of much that makes the ballet s choreography musically uncomfortable the first exterior scene is brilliantly ambiguous , a landscape of strange forked objects that might be firetipped cactuses or giant hands with scarlet nails , and which , like surreal smokestacks , emit odd puffs of smoke this setting or forest is visited not by one firebird but by a flock of them , dressed in scarlet bodysuits with wildplumed headdresses and bustles costumes are by galina solovyeva it s a pity that neither her designs nor brad fields s lighting makes the title character distinctive ms osipova s firebird exerts none of the psychological force of the other main characters why should we believe she cannot escape her captor , ivan \? she looks free to depart most of the time later the locale is visited by a gang of spiky , conflicted maidens with dresses and hair in matching emerald green ivan finds love with one of them \( simone messmer , with an appealingly impulsive oddness \) when the sorcerer kaschei arrives , the scenery realigns itself , marvelously , into a palatial interior with romanesque vaulting kaschei , traditionally a nondancing grotesque who despotically holds his realm in terrified thrall , is here a vain , highly mobile figure of bizarre glamour with black robes , green gloves and green headdress his hold over the maidens is magical but also abusive whenever you think this kaschei is a marvelous role for david hallberg he too emits puffs of magic smoke , and his dangerousness is partly that of a control freak whose power is threatened it fizzles the main struggle for power between him and the firebird is a trite quartet in which he and ivan take turns to partner the firebird and the maiden to no great effect then , when kaschei s spell is broken , his realm diminishes into lairs from which his male and female prisoners , transformed , are released although stravinsky intended a nondance finale , mr ratmansky releases its dance qualities in a series of jubilant steps , jumps and lifts as longsundered lovers are reunited ms solovyeva s final costumes , however , are any feminist s nightmare now that these maidens have pretty pale blond tresses and white dresses , they seem far less modern and individualized than when they were difficult girls in green the dark , awkward middle of the story was actually the best bit monday s program also included performances of christopher wheeldon s thirteen diversions , new last year , and balanchine s apollo , returning to repertory after an absence of several seasons thirteen diversions to benjamin britten s diversions for piano \( left hand \) and orchestra \( op 21 \) with an excellent cast led on monday by misty copeland and stella abrera , is an impressive spectrum of reasons for which mr wheeldon is acknowledged as one of the most accomplished choreographers today all his solo roles exhibit fine qualities of constantly eyecatching dancerly rhythm and shape his mastery of groups is especially impressive here but mr fields s lighting refuses to make the dancers distinct as individuals , and the ballet s sole goal seems to be to wow us with a series of impressive choreographic effects apollo kept starting to be wonderful , despite david lamarche s too soft conducting of stravinsky s 1928 score this is the uncut version of the ballet , with prologue and apotheosis , which i far prefer to the puredance adaptation performed by most companies today but richard tanner s staging has too much acting out , even becoming sentimental mr hallberg s apollo a diametrical opposite to his kaschei was raw and na ve , and veronika part s terpsichore , despite her needless bright smiles halfway through the pas de deux , had beautiful moments of experimental playing of shape against rhythm the ballet s force , however , ebbed away rather than accumulated
we interrupt this nfl playoff season with the disturbing news that the nba season is going on while the conclusion of the league s shameful lockout did bring a few benefits , including festive christmas day openers and a blissfully shortened season , it turns out the benefits quickly developed downsides christmas day was , alas , only one day and the blissfully shortened season came with a microscopic preseason , creating teams with all the organization of new jersey traffic , and has been condensed like a can of tomato soup there are games on top of games on top of games , all held together by xanthan gum those games have been about as tasty as eating condensed soup , cold and with a fork this is not restricted to games involving the wizards or nets or pistons or the dozen or so teams hoping a midseason surge lifts them to mediocre the lakers played the mavericks on monday in a rematch of last year s mesmerizing playoff series that was so decidedly unmesmerizing \( 7370 \? really \? \) that in the end , there might have even been mavericks fans happy that put the game out of its misery the eastern conference countered with a magicknicks clash that would have been a marquee matchup had the marquee not shortcircuited orlando s dwight howard did not score a basket until the third quarter and fouled out in the fourth , and this came with the lovely sidelight of the howard trade standoff minidrama , with none other than patrick ewing telling howard to steer clear of new york , , and howard trying to pretend it s all not actually happening ,  still , the lakersmavericks game still took the award for the day s ugliest \( no small feat considering the 112 wizards were playing on monday \) the lakers scored seven points in the third quarter and still won the mavericks shot 28for80 and still almost won as , they were the lsualabama of the nba and no , he did not mean it as a compliment kobe bryant continued his season trend of taking more shots than breaths , a development that lakers coach , but in the meantime prompts to compile some of his notsogreatest hits college basketball rumbled along in its own little orbit , kansas making the biggest headlines of the day by handing baylor its first loss tyshawn taylor had a big game at the right time , , and believes the jayhawks have a final fourcaliber team in defeat , at least baylor s scott drew did not pull a roy williams in defeat north carolina s coach having to , whom he left on the court while clearing the rest of his team out early \( theoretically for safety purposes \) in his team s horrendous loss at florida state the nfl playoff news is still swirling around the giants after their impressive win over the packers in green bay , with hailing coach tom coughlin for his unflappable approach and congratulating them for the trade they never made to deal disgruntled defensive end osi umenyiora the victory does send them back to san francisco , the scene of their , where jim harbaugh has the 49ers thinking big again , his success has made it difficult on his parents , however , who have to divide their attention between  the patriots are hogging attention in the afc , with that they are the most dangerous team in the playoffs , while they wo n't be so successful as an outdoor team trying to overcome a leaky defense with lots of offense the team they sent packing on saturday , the broncos , have settled on tim tebow as next year s starter while that he can be the team s longterm solution at quarterback , that john elway does n't seem so convinced in the middle of all that , you might take a minute stop to appreciate muhammad ali on his 70th birthday it is odd to think of him as 70 , , because he seems so frozen in time as a young , unforgettable champion that would be a worthwhile minute and at least one you wo n't be spending watching an unwatchable nba game
during my 14 years in the nfl , my favorite day was monday as long as i was n't preparing for surgery or being released , mondays were special they signified that i had made it through another week and was ready for another opponent even the soreness was oh , so sweet how i miss those days now my mondays go something like this work on my tennis serve take a conference call with get my three children to school browse my favorite web sites , none of them involving football check my words with friends and take the dog to day care by then , it s only 10 30 am welcome to the life of the secure and utterly bored former professional athlete the last thing i need is anybody feeling sorry for me i'm retired at 36 i'm still in shape , i still run fast and i'm injury free so how did i arrive at this place , where the days run together , where sleep is so abundant that i ca n't remember the last time i felt tired \? the steelers that s how a few hours after the to pittsburgh in the afc championship game that i played with in january 2011 , i was standing by the bus and saying to myself this is it i'm done ! then coach rex ryan walked up to me and asked what i was thinking about the next season i told him that i was emotionally and physically spent and that the last thing i wanted to do was deal with football again i'm a man of my word fourteen years on the defensive line was long enough i lasted about 13 more than i thought i would , so i was content was i sad \? a little was i elated and relieved \? a lot but now i have a question rex , do you need a pass rusher next season \? having retired way before my time , i have started to lose focus and drive i'm retired from the game i loved i'm retired from the perks , like getting a table instantly at my favorite restaurant and i'm retired from the nfl brotherhood passed by at times , i feel ostracized the nfl is n't a street gang we 're mercenaries willing to work for the highest bidder and willing to get along with whomever we need to in order to keep working i know why i have n't heard from any of my former teammates but it s not as if i'm looking for them , either what would we talk about \? what do we have in common now \? not much once you 're out of the circle , you 're out so besides my family and a couple of my high school buddies , i do n't have many friends early retirement sounds wonderful it certainly did that cold night in pittsburgh i was going to use my time to conquer the world boy , was i wrong now i find myself in music chat rooms arguing the validity of frank zappa versus the mars volta \( if the others only knew walkingpnumonia was the screen name for a former and not some oberlin college student trying to find his place in the world \) i wrote a book i set sail on the picturesque and calming waters of bodymore , murdaland and when i'm in dire straits , i do what any 8yearold does i kick a soccer ball against the garage hoping somebody feels sorry and says , hey , want to play \? with millions of americans out of work or doing work for which they are overqualified , i consider myself lucky but starting from scratch can be unsettling if you 're not prepared for it , retirement can become a form of selfimposed exile from the fulfillment and the exhilaration of knowing you did a good job many people retire around 65 i will turn 37 this summer , yet like all former nfl players , i face greater health risks , both physical and psychological , that compound my fears i do n't know why i'm surprised by any of this i 've been preparing for retirement since the denver broncos drafted me in the first round in 1997 i was part of the inaugural rookie symposium the nfl conducts to help college players make the transition to professional football three days of meetings pretty much consisted of the same two messages use a condom and save your money the players who are drafted this week will hear the same warnings the nfl stands for not for long , and if you do n't heed that advice , you will be another statistic to avoid that fate , i started thinking about the end before my career even started the nfl helps active and retired players with offseason programs that teach ways to conquer the music business or the film business , or to work for espn those programs were n't around when i started to accept that my career was n't going to last forever , so each offseason , i embarked on postfootball endeavors during the sixmonth offseasons , i pretty much educated myself , dabbling in music , hollywood , journalism , real estate and everything in between , with varying degrees of success i was able to do a lot in so little time now that i have all the time in the world , it s amazing how little i accomplish every day sometimes , that s a good thing most times not nothing truly prepared me for retirement it hit me across the face like a deacon jones head slap suddenly , i'm sitting around at 10 30 am looking for something good on television which is impossible do n't cry for me , though i'm getting used to it slowly and will be content with my new life that is , until rex calls
as oil and gasoline prices rise , political pressure to tap the roughly 700 million barrels in the national strategic petroleum reserve is building , including among some in congress the global oil market is fundamentally strained and suffering from an array of unwelcome but unremarkable problems yet the oil reserve is neither designed nor well equipped to address these chronic weaknesses instead it should be preserved to address an emergency disruption in supply while no one can confidently predict the global oil market , arguments that prices will remain high throughout the year seem at least as compelling as the more optimistic alternative global supplies are tight , and the hope for an improving global economy will only increase demand historically , saudi arabia has maintained a cushion of spare production capacity of about 5 percent of global daily supply this spare capacity has played a critical role in calming the market when instability threatens oilproducing nations that spare capacity is now likely to be only 3 percent , which will make it more difficult for saudi arabia to increase production on short notice the past year of unrest in north africa and the middle east has not resulted in any major supply disruptions , but roughly 1 percent of global production has come off the market because of diminished production in sudan , yemen and syria , and the growing impact of united states and european sanctions on iranian production if successful , president obama s recent decision to press forward with more aggressive sanctions will put pressure on iran and strain global oil markets further indeed , increased international cooperation in putting the sanctions into effect is good news in the effort to prevent iran from gaining nuclear capability iran s total production is now about 34 million barrels per day , of which 2 million barrels per day are exported the united states energy information administration predicts that the tougher sanctions scheduled to take effect this summer could cut demand for iranian oil exports in half this combination of circumstances , however , does not yet constitute a severe supply disruption using the reserve now would be premature , reduce our national security options and perhaps even undermine the goal of calming oil markets since its inception in 1975 , the oil reserve has been drawn upon under two types of circumstances there have been a variety of minor withdrawals unrelated to global market disruptions , including test sales , exchanges to address minor domestic supply interruptions and even sales in 1996 and 1997 to raise 220 million to balance the federal budget the oil reserve has also been employed three times to address global supply disruptions during the first iraq war , after hurricane katrina , and last year , when president obama authorized the release of 30 million barrels in response to the withdrawal of libyan oil during that country s civil war in each instance , the releases were coordinated internationally , through the international energy agency , with some oil offered by the european union , the united states and other nonopec nations each of these emergency releases sought to remedy a discrete supply reduction and none offer a precedent for a release under the current circumstances while the strategic petroleum reserve is not an effective tool to address the present circumstances , the president and congress must take more strategic and lasting action to protect the public and the economy from the effects of 100abarrel oil and 4agallon gasoline despite the traditional electionyear rancor , there is actually considerable bipartisan agreement on what needs to be done increasing domestic oil production is extremely important to our economy and to reducing our trade deficit the united states is the in the world and united states production must continue to play a critical role in meeting global demand that production is projected to grow by more than 1 million barrels a day by 2020 if this increase is achieved , the american contribution to the global market will push down global prices and could enable some increase in global spare capacity the obama administration should continue to accelerate efforts to open new areas for production and encourage efforts to construct the distribution infrastructure needed to support increased production however , no amount of production can insulate the united states from the global market and global price spikes the ability to protect our economy from oil price shocks is determined primarily by the amount of oil we use compared to the size of our economy in 1975 , our economy used 12 barrels of oil for every 1 , 000 of gross domestic product \( 2005 dollars \) in 2010 , we used only half a barrel of oil for the same amount of gdp this reduction was achieved by moving away from oil in the production of electricity and by substantial increases in fuel economy a diversified energy sector and highly efficient vehicles are strategies supported by a vast majority of congress while it is certain that we will continue to rely on oil for decades , there is considerable support in both parties for efforts to diversify transportation fuels through research and development and the deployment of biofuels , electric and natural gas vehicles all of these actions will continue to increase the oilefficiency and resiliency of the united states economy for four decades , the emergency role of the strategic petroleum reserve to specifically address large supply disruptions has been a subject of national consensus we must protect this critical component of our national and economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil markets

cheer up , clippers fans ! it s no disgrace to lose to the spurs you have a promising future with chris paul and blake griffin anchoring the team here s something else you might know you also have a championship pedigree that s because , in the strictest of strictest interpretations of the law not to be confused with what actually goes on in the nba the clippers are , in reality , the boston celtics the owner , donald sterling , longed to model his franchise after the celtics \( even though every move he made basically killed that plan \) well , he got his wish we re talking legalese and very fine print here , and the story goes all the way back to 1978 that year , the owner of the celtics was a hollywood guy by the name of irv levin he wanted to move the team to southern california , but he knew the nba would never allow that to happen so levin did the next best thing he convinced the owner of the buffalo braves , the kentucky fried chicken magnate john y brown , to swap franchises my understanding , as best as i can remember , is that the current celtics team is a successor to the buffalo braves , russ granik , former deputy commissioner of the nba , said in a telephone conversation on tuesday he was the nba s assistant general counsel in 1978 and that would mean that the current clippers team is the successor to the boston celtics \? yes , granik said in a strictly legal sense but in the nba world , none of that legal mumbojumbo matters the swap merely meant that the celtics were now in the hands of a new owner the franchise swap was approved by the nba s board of governors by a 211 vote the teams swapped rosters , but not before brown and levin completed a trade that involved several players , including future hall of famer nate archibald levin moved the braves to san diego , where they became the clippers the business entity that owned the boston celtics in 1978 moved to san diego and became the business entity that owned the clippers when deferred compensation checks were mailed out to the likes of former celtics player and coach tom heinsohn and others , they were from the clippers bank account levin later sold the team to sterling , who moved the team to los angeles in 1984 levin and brown did their negotiating without consulting anyone in celtics management red auerbach , then the team s president and general manager , knew nothing of the franchise swap he and the celtics assistant general manager , jan volk , had gone to washington , dc , at the end of june to sign deals for kevin kunnert , a free agent , and kermit washington , whom the celtics had acquired from the lakers the previous december little did the two men realize that the deals were the final step in the franchise swap process they triggered the swap in an interview in the early 1990s , volk said , the next morning i woke up and found out the franchise had been sold we had done their dirty work for them i felt like the japanese ambassador in washington , dc , going to the white house on dec 7 , 1941 kunnert and washington went to san diego along with sidney wicks and the draft rights to freeman williams , whom the celtics had picked no 8 in the 1978 draft the celtics received archibald , marvin barnes and billy knight in a stillamazing what if , the name of larry bird surfaced in the talks when brown and levin were going over their respective rosters bird had been drafted by the celtics in june 1978 as what was known as a junior eligible , but had decided to return to indiana state for his senior year under nba rules at the time , boston had until the 1979 draft to sign bird or he would reenter the draft that is why several teams shied away from drafting bird in the first place levin died in 1996 , but a few years before his death , he said he easily could have included bird in the player exchange and would have done so had he been convinced that bird would have signed with the clippers i absolutely could have had larry bird if i wanted no question about it , levin said but i knew red was very high on the kid and i felt if i took bird to san diego , red would in some way make sure that he never signed with me it was too risky we were starting a new franchise of course , had i known then what i know now , i would have taken that risk granik said that the teams swapped rosters immediately after the franchise swap so , for one brief shining moment , the clippers did indeed own the rights to larry bird before they were sent back to boston the same applies to dave cowens and cedric maxwell , the latter of whom actually became a clipper in 1985 when he was traded for bill walton walton always said he wanted to bring a championship to the clippers when he signed with them as a free agent in 1979 he did , in a roundabout way he was a big part of the 1986 celtics championship , the celtics 16th or was it really the clippers third \? either way , walton could say he pleased both masters
istanbul and six world powers agreed saturday to hold a new round of talks in baghdad on may 23 , catherine ashton , the european union s foreign policy chief , said after the first meeting in nearly 15 months on tehran s disputed  ms ashton , speaking for the six nations , called the daylong meeting constructive and useful and said that we want now to move to a sustained process of dialogue she gave no specifics on any proposals made during the sessions , but said that the six nations were satisfied that iran was serious about negotiations that will lead to concrete steps toward a comprehensive negotiated solution which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program testing iran s willingness to negotiate seriously on its nuclear program was the purpose of this meeting , european and american officials said that was a low bar to hurdle and represented no real breakthrough , and there were no negotiations here on specific steps or proposals the lack of concrete detail is likely to lead to political criticism of president obama as the presidential election campaign unfolds and will make the meeting in iraq even more important the weeks until may 23 will be used by experts on both sides to draw up a concrete agenda for those talks , ms ashton said a senior american official at the talks emphasized that this meeting was about testing iran s seriousness but dialogue is not sufficient for any sanction relief , said the official , who , like others involved , spoke on the condition of anonymity as a matter of diplomatic practice there must be an urgent effort and concrete steps , the official said , to restore confidence in iran s assertion that its program is not military we believe there is a conducive atmosphere , but we need to test it , and success in baghdad is not at all guaranteed , the official added , repeating mr obama s warning that the window for diplomacy is closing a senior european diplomat at the talks said that we 've opened a box , and now we have to fill it the iranians were serious and receptive , but in a sense , he said , we 've pushed the problem six weeks down the road , and the six powers must work hard to shape the baghdad agenda and decide what to do in response to possible iranian actions although iran said it would have new proposals , the diplomat said there were none , but rather a promise for a serious dialogue the leader of the iranian delegation , saeed jalili , told reporters that there were important points of agreement as well as differences he praised the desire of the other side for dialogue and cooperation and said that we consider that as a positive sign , compared with the language of threats and pressure that do not work on the iranian people during the talks , mr jalili held a 90minute session with ms ashton in which he argued that since iran was cooperating with the international atomic energy agency , sanctions should be lifted , but he was rebuffed , another european diplomat said russia and china maintained a unified stance with the other four nations the united states , britain , france and germany and russia was chosen to begin the discussion because of its relatively close ties to iran but after mr jalili thanked moscow for its support , the russian delegate , sergei rybakov , said bluntly that russia does n't have to be thanked , but you need to do what we need you to do , a senior european diplomat said the centerpiece for future talks , ms ashton said , will be the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , which permits peaceful nuclear energy but requires strict oversight and monitoring by the atomic agency , which has been rebuffed in its efforts to investigate possible evidence of iranian efforts to make a nuclear bomb we want now to move to a sustained process of serious dialogue , where we can take urgent practical steps to build confidence and lead on to compliance by iran with all its international obligations , ms ashton said in our efforts to do so , we will be guided by the principle of the stepbystep approach and reciprocity the agreement to hold another meeting is without question a success , given that a failure here would make the chances of a military strike on iran more likely but putting off any hard decisions until the next meeting will increase pressure on both sides to make progress there , especially on the question of iran s growing stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent purity , only a few steps from bomb grade that stockpile is the most urgent matter to settle , american officials have said they want to get iran to agree to stop enriching to 20 percent purity and to export its 20percent stockpile , in order to buy more time for diplomacy and reassure israel that iran is not close to being able to make a nuclear weapon mr jalili said saturday that iran needed 20 percent uranium for its medical reactor , on which 150 , 000 people depend in previous meetings , the west has offered to supply iran with the necessary fuel for the reactor michael adler , who works on the iranian nuclear issue at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars in washington , said that in baghdad the six powers are going to have to make clear their primary concerns , why they need to be answered , and lay out an effective timeline for moving forward in particular , he said , there is urgent concern over enrichment to 20 percent and expanding enrichment at the site in fordo , iran , which is almost impregnable since it is under a mountain and which is fanning tensions , while there is plenty of room for more centrifuges in a plant in natanz other issues are likely to include complete access for energy agency inspectors and acceptance by iran of its obligation to give an early warning of its intention to build nuclear facilities iran denies that its nuclear program has any military aim , but the members of the united nations security council and the international energy agency , which is charged with inspecting nuclear programs , have expressed doubts iran is under four sets of united nations sanctions for refusing to stop uranium enrichment , which can be used both to make reactor fuel and the fissile core of nuclear warheads iranian officials said they had rejected an american suggestion that the two sides hold a bilateral meeting , which would be the first since october 2009
new delhi india s olympic association defied the international olympic committee this week and held elections whose results officials in switzerland said were not valid and would be ignored but while international officials remained adamant thursday that india needed to undertake fundamental reforms before being allowed back into the olympic fold , officials in india said that the entire controversy was the result of a misunderstanding that could be cleared up with a chat on tuesday , the international olympic committee suspended india from participating in the olympic movement because india s olympic leaders are too old , too longserving and too tainted the suspension has been widely seen as an enormous embarrassment to the world s second most populous nation vijay kumar malhotra , who was the acting president of the indian olympic association until wednesday and was in charge when relations with officials in switzerland reached the breaking point , said in an interview thursday that india s olympic leaders planned to gather friday to put together an easytounderstand explanation to mollify the international committee so we will go to the ioc and explain the situation , mr malhotra said , referring to the international committee we will ask them to withdraw the suspension international rules forbid olympic leaders from serving beyond the age of 70 or for longer than eight years mr malhotra , 81 , is one of many sports leaders in india who defies both restrictions and plans to continue doing so in the archery association where i am the president , we did not follow the government code and we told them that if you do not recognize us , do so , we are not worried , he said i am above 70 and i became the president and have been since 1975 \( the archery association was derecognized by india s ministry of sports on friday , because of mr malhotra s age \) in an email sent thursday , pere miro , a spokesman for the international olympic committee , said that the indian association is not entitled to hold any elections without express prior approval of the ioc we therefore do not recognize any elections the body may have held since being suspended as they are null and void this issue has been ongoing for more than two years and the ioc s position has been expressed to all parties concerned on numerous occasions , mr miro wrote in response , the indian olympic committee released a press statement thursday night defending its election the general body also discussed the international olympic council s sic statement that the elections were null and void and wish to clarify that the polls took place with a well laidout procedure and there is nothing to believe otherwise , the group stated boria majumdar , a history professor at monash university in melbourne , australia , said the government should remove the leaders of the indian olympic association they had the last two years to get their house in order and to prevent national shame , mr majumdar said but none of them have been willing to put the national interests over their own self interests on wednesday , the indian olympic association elected lalit bhanot as its secretary general even though mr bhanot is currently on bail and facing corruption charges related to his role in the scandalplagued 2010 commonwealth games mr bhanot became internationally famous for explaining the poor sanitation standards in the commonwealth games athletes village as the result of differing standards of cleanliness between india and the western world abhay singh chautala , the newly elected president of the indian olympic association , will meet friday with jitendra singh , the indian government s sports minister , to discuss his group s suspension , according to a press statement jitendra singh has publicly criticized the indian olympic association for failing to follow international guidelines he also offered to broker a compromise between the indian association and the international committee top sporting positions in india provide prestige , international travel benefits and some control over sports jobs , and indian officials have been loathe to surrender those privileges their oversight of india s sports scene has failed to deliver much glory to the country the 2012 olympics were its most successful ever , but india won only six medals and failed to win a single gold in its entire history , india has won 26 medals the american swimmer michael phelps alone has won 22 medals
on london s olympic stage , athletes , fans and volunteers created a memorable experience four new york times reporters reflect on their impressions covering their first olympicsthe footnotes tell a global story now it can be told there is a lot of wikipedia in the press section at the olympics for every reporter who can tell you that a wazaari was clearly just a glorified yuko or that the hungarian is the one to watch , there are quite a few more the feature writers , the curious onlookers who normally cover track and field , the poor souls who were assigned a dozen different sports , me typing judo rules into google an argument can be made that this is excusable there is just so much going on , so many different events in so many different places , all at the same time victory ceremonies are squeezed in between long jumps a fencer s dream is dashed while three other bouts are going on around her the javelins sail toward the high jumpers the olympics seem like a giant , ultraefficient sports factory , churning out triumph and disappointment on a stunning scale considered this way , they are still routinely electrifying it is hard to beat the thrill of being in a crowd of spectators , many of whom are there because it was the only ticket they could get , roaring for a weight lifter from guatemala as if the fate of humanity hinged on christian alberto lopez bobadilla s battle against the law of gravity but the onebighumanfamily element of the olympics is only a part of the event , as is the one big american \( or chinese or british or kenyan \) family or even all the examples of individuals overcoming adversity \( because , let s be honest , there is so much overcoming that it becomes difficult to recall which adversity was overcome , and by whom \) you really can get a lot of that from television , tapedelayed or not what you ca n't get from tv , and what i came to really love about the olympics , were the little shavings on the factory floor , the curious byproducts of an event that brings together so many people from so many places in such narrow quarters one night i attended a russian media function and sat next to a british tourism official who , between performances by a dagestanian folk dancing troupe , told me about the time he hid under a table during the arabisraeli war of 1967 alongside the anglican bishop of mexico a couple of days later , i was sitting at a cafe in the olympic village with the ugandan sprinter davis kamoga , who won a bronze in 1996 , discussing the dearth of decent running tracks in his home country and every morning at the bus stop for journalists traveling to the olympic park , i followed the continuing competition among the australians , britons and volunteers of various other nationalities to see who could click the mechanical counter the most times in 30 seconds by the end of the games , the record was 229 , though there was a debate about proper technique none of this was exactly of global historical importance , but neither was it mere trivia it is an essential part of the show after a day at the games , as you are contemplating the cruel joke that you , usain bolt and michael phelps are technically members of the same species , it is nice to come across a clicker competition and be reminded that for the most part people the world over are really not that different a full plate of inspiring competition first , hats off to the british all sorts of mucketymucks deserve credit for running so smooth an extravaganza but what impressed me most were the thousands of volunteers who cheerfully helped visitors navigate their way around people do n't suddenly become that nice for two summer weeks they had to have the advantage of a long head start i love the olympics but before the games , the question in the back of my mind was would n't i be better off watching it at home \? is n't this why i splurged on 60 inches of high def with surround sound \? the answer is no nothing provides the full thumpthumpthump heartbeat like being there , and the human eye is still the best camera for panoramic views at the same time , modern arenas supply closeup replays on ultrasharp screens the beads of sweat , the straining muscle and it was hard to beat the vip treatment proper credentials allowed journalists into virtually every event the excel center supplied an astonishing smorgasbord of sports under one roof boxing , fencing , judo , wrestling , table tennis , weight lifting , taekwondo sports that had made me reach for the remote at home were riveting in person that included table tennis , that relentless swatting around of tiny celluloid balls ariel hsing , 16 , the american who was ranked no 115 in the world , nearly upset the tournament s no 2 seed , li xiaoxia of china it was inspiring it was amazing good seats help reporters were squired to the socalled media tribune , which provided a good vantage point , a place to plug in a laptop and an individual tv screen ushers supplied detailed handouts with the results for a long time , i worked as a foreign correspondent no such conveniences came my way during wars , floods or earthquakes the media tribune areas are near the mixed zones , where the athletes who have just competed must pass a gantlet of reporters , some of them as combative as any competitor behdad salimikordasiabi of iran won gold in weight lifting , hoisting 545 pounds regarded as the world s strongest man , he chatted amiably with reporters
louisville , ky something stunning was about to happen as the two colts bounded into the deep stretch , the one in front hitting the ground with a wobble , the one giving chase gathering strength with every stride either bodemeister was going to give the trainer , fresh off a heart attack , his fourth victory , or i 'll have another was going to give an anonymous jockey , mario gutierrez , one of the most unlikely victories in the 138 runnings of america s greatest horse race for a mile and an eighth , bodemeister had been breathtaking he had come to churchill downs as the undisputed king of speed after leading every step of the way in the arkansas derby it was why bettors in a record crowd of more than 165 , 000 had made him the 41 favorite but the colt was taking on history he had not raced as a 2yearold , and the last late starter to win the derby was apollo in 1882 as soon as mike smith , his hall of fame rider , shot bodemeister out of the gate , it was clear the colt was dead set on running through that history smith gunned him , as he had been instructed by baffert , through an opening quartermile of 2232 seconds , making the sprinter trinniberg and last year s juvenile champion , hansen , give furious chase he was flying leaving there , smith said he s such a freerunning horse that i could n't take it away from him by the time bodemeister skipped into the backstretch , 19 of the most talented 3yearolds in recent derby memory were strung behind him , and many were having a world of trouble hansen , a swift white horse , was laboring before the race , the colt was sweating and rank , washing his translucent coat with a pink sheen it was clear he had left his energy in the paddock union rags had been made the 51 second choice by the bettors , but he was squeezed at the start of the race between take charge indy and dullahan union rags s rider , julien leparoux , did his best to get him relaxed and back in the race , but union rags ran smack into a wall of horses i had nowhere to go , leparoux said in the clubhouse , baffert tried not to be too keyed up in march , while in dubai for the world cup , he had a heart attack his recovery was going well he was working on living healthier and reducing his stress when you 're a horse trainer , a fast colt is soothing he was doing it easily , baffert said i did n't want to change his style i 'll have another and gutierrez , meanwhile , were in full flight , weaving through the field as if they had a map of secret passageways last year on the first saturday in may , gutierrez was in the jockeys' room of hastings park , a bullring of a racetrack in vancouver , british columbia he watched animal kingdom run away from the field that day and allowed himself to think that yes , maybe someday , he might have a mount in a derby last fall , he found himself in southern california at santa anita park as little more than a glorified exercise rider not many trainers knew who he was , and few would put him on horses in the afternoons gutierrez was homesick and about ready to head back to canada , which he had made his home since leaving mexico in 2006 but on a rare afternoon that he got a mount , i 'll have another s owner , paul reddam , happened to be watching i do n't know if he won or not , but he looked really good in the irons , reddam said we need to try some new blood in the barn of the trainer doug o'neill , reddam had i 'll have another , a colt that looked promising as a 2yearold before coming up with a shin injury after a dismal performance last august in the

it was an uneventful week 1 , in a good way , as the nfl replacement referees did not steal much attention from the players on the field there were the usual complaints and borderline calls , including a flag thrown on a textbook block in the back by green bay on randall cobb s touchdown return against san francisco on sunday instead , the referees picked up the flag , and the packers score counted in arizona , an inexcusable gaffe allowed seattle to have four timeouts as they frantically attempted to tie the game but both the cardinals and the 49ers won , muting any cries about the replacement officials it s difficult to test whether the replacement referees were any different than the regular crews tests work best with objective data , and the performance of referees is inherently subjective but we do have some numbers to go by some have argued that the officiating crews let defensive backs play more physically than the regular officials have allowed in recent years , thinking that the replacements were loath to throw huge flags in key situations but in that infamous final minute in seattle , the referees flagged arizona for defensive pass interference on two key plays in fact , there were 29 defensive passinterference penalties called by the referees in week 1 , the most during an opening week since at least 2000 over the last 10 years , there have been 130 such penalties called during the opening weeks of nfl seasons , or 13 per year despite the subjective arguments , replacement officials called defensive pass interferences more than twice as frequently as the regular crews have done in week 1 maybe coaches were instructing their defensive backs to play more physically , hoping that the referees would be afraid to throw the flag regardless , the evidence in no way supported the idea that the replacements were letting defensive backs get away with more what about penalties over all \? on average , over the last 10 years , 208 penalties have been called in week 1 with the replacement referees over the last week , there were 206 penalties , in line with historical averages penalty yardage was slightly up , most likely as a result of more defensive pass interference calls , but that metric was also in line with norms one area where i thought we might see an effect was in the percentage of penalties called on the road team would replacement officials be more likely to cave to the demands of the crowds \? from 2002 to 2011 , home teams in week 1 were called for an average of 100 penalties for 817 yards , and road teams saw 108 penalties for 877 yards this past weekend , home teams were penalized 90 times for 769 yards , and road teams were whistled for 116 penalties worth 968 yards so yes , home teams did appear to catch a few more breaks than normal but in both 2005 and 2011 , home teams were called for at least 25 fewer penalties and 185 fewer penalty yards than their road counterparts with such a small sample size , the week 1 results fit within the variation we would expect , although this might be a trend worth keeping an eye on there will always be bad calls , of course , and that fact provides little comfort to those teams that have been wronged but over all , it was a steady weekend for the men in stripes in quarterback news
in each of the last two seasons , hbo s 24 7 road to the nhl winter classic series has brought new viewers to the nhl , thanks to its storytelling , production values and access like many successful endeavors in the pro ranks from the tworeferee system to the leftwing lock the ripple effect of 24 7 is now being felt in amateur hockey at least a dozen of the 58 division i men s hockey programs , including several that will begin play in the ncaa tournament this weekend , have featured some sort of allaccess broadcast this season some have been produced inhouse , like north dakota s weekly web feature through these doors , while others have welcomed outsiders into their locker room , like miami university s college hockey confidential on cbs sports network in each case , for college programs , these initiatives are about more than attracting new fans they also serve as a recruiting tool we want to give a prospective studentathlete an idea of what the daytoday is like , especially for recruits who haven t seen the campus , said merrimack coach mark dennehy , whose team took part in merrimack allaccess , which had its debut in early march we re salespeople , and a big part of sales is differentiating ourselves from the competition giving recruits a behindthescenes look helps you do that the concept is not unique to college hockey espn , cbs and other outlets have produced documentarystyle programs in football , basketball , lacrosse and other sports the success of hbo s effort \( this season s rangersflyers series received six emmy award nominations \) , however , seems to have given allaccess programming greater popularity in hockey like most hockey fans who got a glimpse of 24 7 last year , we were captivated by it , dennehy said it s not anything we invented , that s for sure believe it or not it was coach hakstol s idea , jayson hajdu , assistant athletic director at north dakota and the supervising producer of through these doors , said , referring to david hakstol he is a fairly traditional , oldschool coach as far as access , so it caught me off guard he saw how popular 24 7 was and knew how rabid our fan base is and wanted to try it the college productions do not have breakout stars like the former capitals coach bruce boudreau or philadelphia flyers goaltender ilya bryzgalov they do have moments that transfix the viewer , however onward to victory , for example , a look at notre dame s program that aired on nbc sports network , featured coach jeff jackson s intermission speeches during his team s comeback win against boston college i m guilty , too , but we ve got to calm down , jackson said in the first intermission , after microphones on the bench captured him berating officials when we let our emotions get the best of us , that s when we broke down other moments , in bryzgalov fashion , are more lighthearted just as 24 7 inspired viewers to collect their favorite quotations , these shows have their share of great oneliners it s my understanding that you scored three goals , michigan state coach tom anastos tells defenseman chris sandmeyer during a skills competition on spartan hockey allaccess was there a goalie in there \? the miami university star reilly smith , a hobey baker candidate , showed viewers a different side of himself as cbs sports network s cameras followed him to dance class where he was significantly less graceful than he is on the ice other moments are more emotional , like the north dakota senior goaltender brad eidsness accepting the team s hard hat prize after posting a shutout on senior night from the junior who beat him out for the position last year these peeks behind the curtain can be especially beneficial in college hockey , where teams not only recruit against one another but can lose players to the canadian hockey league the chl or major junior hockey offers an alternate path to the nhl and drafts players as young as 14 with tv and the web , college hockey programs can reach those prospective players before coaches are even allowed to recruit them actively , per ncaa rules i think it would help get a view of the school and what it s really all about , give you a sense of whether you can see yourself enjoying the experience , said union forward wayne simpson , whose team welcomed cameras for its game against harvard at fenway park in january it s the inner workings , the things you don t get to see when you go on a recruiting trip those benefits may explain why college coaches might be more willing to open their locker rooms and offices than their nhl counterparts none , no reservations at all , dennehy said except for maybe the foul language but remember , we re not curing cancer here that s the kind of approach a prospective college hockey player might appreciate nate ewell , the former vice president for communications for the washington capitals , is the interim executive director for
back in 2010 , selfstyled deficit hawks better described as deficit scolds took over much of our political discourse at a time of mass unemployment and recordlow borrowing costs , a time when economic theory said we needed more , not less , deficit spending , the scolds convinced most of our political class that deficits rather than jobs should be our top economic priority and now that the election is over , they 're trying to pick up where they left off they should be told to go away it s not just the fact that the deficit scolds have been wrong about everything so far recent events have also demonstrated clearly what was already apparent to careful observers the deficitscold movement was never really about the deficit instead , it was about using deficit fears to shred the social safety net and letting that happen would n't just be bad policy it would be a betrayal of the americans who just reelected a healthreformer president and voted in some of the most progressive senators ever about the hypocrisy of the hawks as i said , it has been evident for years consider the early2011 award for fiscal responsibility that three of the leading deficitscold organizations gave to none other than paul ryan then as now , mr ryan s alleged plans to reduce the deficit were obvious flimflam , since he was proposing huge tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations while refusing to specify how these cuts would be offset but in the eyes of the deficit scolds , his plan to dismantle medicare and his savage cuts to medicaid apparently qualified him as a fiscal icon and how did the deficit scolds react when mitt romney served up similar flimflam , with mr ryan as his running mate \? well , the peter g peterson foundation is deficitscold central peterson funding lies behind much of the movement sure enough , david walker , the foundation s former ceo and arguably the most visible deficit scold in america , endorsed the romney ryan ticket and then there s the matter of the fiscal cliff contrary to the way it s often portrayed , the looming prospect of spending cuts and tax increases is n't a fiscal crisis it is , instead , a political crisis brought on by the gop s attempt to take the economy hostage and just to be clear , the danger for next year is not that the deficit will be too large but that it will be too small , and hence plunge america back into recession deficit scolds are having a hard time with this issue how can they warn us not to go over the fiscal cliff without seeming to contradict their own rhetoric about the evils of deficits \? this would n't be hard if they had been making a more honest case on the budget the truth is that deficits are actually a good thing when the economy is deeply depressed , so deficit reduction should wait until the economy is stronger as john maynard keynes said threequarters of a century ago , the boom , not the slump , is the right time for austerity but since the deficit scolds have in fact been demanding that we make deficits the priority even when the economy is depressed , they ca n't go there so what we get instead , for example in a white paper on the fiscal cliff from the committee for a responsible federal budget , is a garbled set of complaints the adjustment is too fast \( why \? \) , or it s the wrong kind of deficit reduction , for reasons not made clear or maybe they are made clear , after all for even as it rails against deficits , the white paper argues against raising tax rates and even suggests cutting them so the deficit scolds , while posing as the nation s noble fiscal defenders , have in practice shown themselves both hypocritical and incoherent they do n't deserve to have a central role in policy discussion they really do n't even deserve a seat at the table and they certainly do n't deserve to have one of their own appointed as treasury secretary i do n't know how seriously to take the buzz about appointing erskine bowles to replace timothy geithner but in case there s any reality to it , let s recall his record mr bowles , like others in the deficitscold community , has indulged in scare tactics , warning of an imminent fiscal crisis that keeps not coming meanwhile , the report he cowrote was supposed to be focused on deficit reduction yet , true to form , it called for lower rather than higher tax rates , and as a guiding principle no less appointing him , or anyone like him , would be both a bad idea and a slap in the face to the people who returned president obama to office look , we should be having a serious discussion about america s fiscal future but a serious discussion is exactly what we have n't been having these past couple years because the discourse was hijacked by the wrong people , with the wrong agenda let s show them the door
you knew the orioles and the athletics were going to make the playoffs this year , right \? sure you did in the internet era , sportswriters have no choice but to own up to their preseason prognostications because their selections live on on the web last season , we were unable to find a single baseball writer who predicted that one of baseball s final four the tigers , the rangers , the cardinals and the brewers would win the world series this year has been another challenging one an analysis of preseason picks from 133 baseball writers at 19 publications and sites espn , sports illustrated , yahoo , cbs sports , nbc sports , baseball prospectus , athlon sports , the sporting news , the new york times \( al , nl \) , baseball america , usa today , mlbcom , the new york post , the washington post , the chicago tribune , grantland , the boston globe , the los angeles times and the baltimore sun revealed that not a single writer predicted the a s or the orioles to make the playoffs not every outlet gave detailed predictions , but of those that did , the orioles were picked to finish fifth in the al east by every writer , publication and site and no one predicted the braves , nationals or reds to win the world series in fairness , it was yet another unpredictable year as a host of big spenders , including the angels , red sox , phillies and marlins , failed to meet expectations the tigers also foundered early on but were bailed out by a remarkable lateseason collapse by the white sox , who were in first place for 117 days before blowing it the reds and the nationals have exceeded expectations but the orioles and a s came out of nowhere to secure playoff berths not only did no one pick these teams to make the playoffs , they were both widely considered two of the worst teams in the league ken rosenthal of fox sports called the orioles a sorry franchise that was headed for its 15th straight losing season the washington post s dave sheinin wrote , the best thing this franchise could do is take its 100 lumps , trade some marketable players and start over and a scout quoted in sports illustrated , which picked the team to lose 99 games , said it was a potential 100loss team the sporting news said the a s had all but assured themselves of a lastplace season the washington post predicted they would occupy a warm , comfy spot in the cellar and a team preview in athlon sports concluded that they d be ecstatic to win 74 games most prognosticators also picked the a s to finish last in their division , although some predicted they d finish third , ahead of the mariners in usa today and espn s preseason mlb power rankings , the orioles ranked no 28 and the athletics were no 29 , behind teams like the cubs and the rockies fox sports had the teams flip flopped , with the a s no 28 and the orioles no 29 the daily news had the a s at no 15 , but placed the orioles at no 28 , and the reds at no 24 baseball experts were more sanguine regarding the chances of all the other playoff teams , although many had high expectations for the rays , marlins , diamondbacks , phillies and angels plenty of prognosticators picked the nationals to win a wild card , but very few thought they d win their division and none picked them to win the world series the washington post s sheinin , for example , had the phillies , marlins and diamondbacks in the playoffs , but not the nationals and none of this year s oddest picks panned out karl ravech of espn , who believed the red sox would beat the diamondbacks in the world series , mel antonen of sports illustrated , who picked the diamondbacks to win it all , and mike puma of the new york post , who saw a philliesroyals world series matchup , deserve points for chutzpah , if not accuracy of the teams that did qualify for the postseason , the rangers had the most preseason world series title picks , followed closely by the tigers and the yankees just a few writers picked the cardinals to win it all , none predicted the braves would take the title and only michael vega of the boston globe picked the giants it s too early to say what publication was the most accurate over all but kudos to adam rubin of espn new york , who had the nationals , reds , giants , yankees , tigers and rangers as division winners what media outlet had the least accurate predictions \? i d vote for yahoo sports all three of their writers had the rays winning the al east , the diamondbacks winning the nl west and the marlins or phillies winning the nl east baseball prospectus deserves honorable mention for having 27 writers pick the orioles to finish fifth and their weighted average division picks having the a s in last place , the nationals in fourth and the diamondbacks winning the nl west while i m here poking fun at everyone else , how did i do \? i didn t publish predictions , but if truth be told , i had the orioles and a s in last place , the nationals in third and the angels beating the phillies in the world series oops

the white and blue bus sat near the edge of downtown tampa , on a small plot that had recently been named romneyville as protesters from around the country gathered to pitch tents and unroll sleeping bags blue lettering spelled out the words mobile broadcast news on the side of the bus inside , the vehicle was outfitted with bunks , sconce lights and a ventilation fan working in the cramped interior were chappell howard and flux rostrum , who sat at wooden tables where three laptops displayed images that had been recorded on video earlier that day mr rostrum , who has traveled the country for years filming protests , said that the bus , a 1995 international bluebird that runs on recycled vegetable oil , would be a headquarters for people documenting rallies , marches and other street actions during both the republican and democratic conventions as protesters trickled into tampa before the convention , videographers were joined by another sort of documentarian , called livestreamers , who broadcast events on the web in real time that sort of immediate dissemination of raw footage , mr rostrum said , had provided a potent tool to show interactions between police and the public and to create a record of fleeting , sometimes chaotic moments that otherwise might be lost to conflicting memories they can t say you re editing it and twisting the story , he said on friday it s live , happening right in front of you during the convention , he said , he and others would be broadcasting their footage on the mobile broadcast web site  video has played a significant role during recent conventions and largescale protests mr rostrum was among a group of people who contributed footage from the 2004 convention in new york to a collective called iwitness video after the convention , video assembled by the group was used to refute testimony by police officers in a court case involving the mass arrests of hundreds of protesters four years later , during the republican gathering in st paul , officers surrounded a house where about a dozen iwitness members were staying , handcuffed them and held them for hours none of the collective members were arrested but they said that the authorities looked through their computers and cameras livestreaming was widely used by people connected to the occupy wall street protests that began in new york last fall and then spread to dozens of other cities mr rostrum said that he was running a 24hour livestream from the bus showing romneyville , which was organized by a group called the poor people s economic human rights campaign he said the stream showed the evolution of the encampment , which sprung up on aug 20 on a lot rented from an armynavy surplus store that stands about a mile from the tampa bay times forum where the republican delegates will gather mr rostrum said that before arriving in florida he had been in west virginia with his bus documenting conflicts between police officers , miners and people protesting strip mining others in the slowly growing camp had also arrived from farflung spots there were people who had hitchhiked from places like maryland , new york and north carolina there was a group that had traveled on a bus from gainesville and a woman who had ridden a motorcycle about 100 miles from orlando by friday night about 30 tents had been pitched between the armynavy store and a ramp leading onto interstate 275 as a breeze blew through the camp some of the inhabitants gathered under a black plastic tarp that stretched between mr rostrum s bus and a nearly identical bus that housed a mobile kitchen that had last been used at the rainbow gathering , an annual utopian assembly that was held this year at cherokee national forest in tennessee those beneath the tent said that they had traveled to tampa to exchange ideas , air opposition to the republican platform and to try to grapple with what they described as disturbing realities that gripped the nation i think a movement of ordinary people can mitigate some of the problems we have , said tom over , 44 , an independent journalist who had arrived from columbus , ohio there s so much money in politics it s undermining our democracy diamond dave whitaker , 74 , from san francisco , recited a short poem that he said came to me like a revelation , like a voice in my head some people ate rice and beans somebody scrubbed a kettle that had been used to prepare the meal people sitting at a small wooden table stacked with fliers for upcoming protest marches listened to a jazz radio station as cars whizzed past toward the interstate a helicopter with green and red lights made a few passes overhead surveying the scene , charlie meyers , from little rock , ark , said it reminded him of his first days at the occupy wall street encampment last fall in new york it s a lot like zuccotti park , mr meyers , 22 , said , except here we are allowed to have a kitchen an earlier version of this post misstated the first name of the man who recited a poem at the protest in tampa he is diamond dave whitaker , not diamond dan
there was a lot happening at the inaugural dealbook conference on wednesday and much of it was undeniably impressive here is what the invitationonly conference had going for it big wall street names , flashy graphics , edgy global chill music , weighty discussions of economic challenges , a few good laughs and even some news tidbits and , with the pricey tickets and the allplatformsblazing corporate sponsorships , the event brought in plenty of muchneeded revenue for the times here is what the conference did not have going for it a great deal of distance between sources and those who cover them something traditionally thought to be a bedrock journalistic idea i stopped in a couple of times at thetimescenter , and caught the dealbook editor at large andrew ross sorkin s interview with the goldman sachs chief executive lloyd c blankfein , as well as a session with the economist and columnist paul krugman mr krugman , of course , is not only a nobel laureate , but also a rock star among the wonkish set his presence lent the event gravitas and credibility \( one of his first questions from the audience came from a woman who thanked him effusively for his presence and gushed that she felt like a 13yearold at a justin bieber concert \) dealbook a blog and print section dedicated to coverage of mergers and acquisitions and other related subjects is something of an oddity at the times a rainmaker for the company , it has garnered its share of critics who see it as too soft on its sources matt taibbi at rolling stone is a particularly harsh critic , portraying mr sorkin as allowing those he sees as wall street villains to get off easy for wrecking america s economy over the past decade \( indeed , during his wednesday chat , mr blankfein spoke the inevitable words mistakes were made wall street s idea of a mea culpa \) more than anything , dealbook is one of those creatures of 21stcentury journalism as much about brand as anything else the conference did a great deal to burnish the dealbook brand at one point , looking at the stage from the audience , i saw seven dealbook logos staring back at me it also produced revenue blackberry was the conference s founding sponsor , and its advertising deal put it on every platform in sight interestingly , blackberry s participation suggested that it didn t hold a grudge for the article the times did just a couple of months ago , making fun of those who still use blackberry devices instead of hipper alternatives like the iphone such sponsorships are another creature of 21stcentury newspapering , eroding the sharp line between advertising and editorial content i talked on thursday with mr sorkin , who said he was pleased with the day i consider it live journalism , and i felt that some headlines came out of it , he said \( the event was liveblogged on the times s web site , which also offered a live webcast \) he mentioned , particularly , the optimism of mr blankfein and others about the likelihood of a resolution to the socalled fiscal cliff , and the ideas about a bond bubble from ray dalio , the bridgewater associates founder ultimately , though , it was more about the richness of the discussion , mr sorkin said was the event too chummy , too clubby , and is dealbook itself that way , too \? i don t think there s any truth to that , mr sorkin said we ask very pointed questions in its first event of this kind , the times put together a smooth , impressive and starstudded day , and it made none of the clumsy errors that the los angeles times did in its staples center debacle or the washington post in its aborted salongate plans but given the lunchtime rollout of a new blackberry device , the overall friendly questioning of prominent newsmakers , the reception afterward featuring wine , hors d oeuvres and the incessant rubbing of journalistic and corporate elbows the word adversarial did not come to mind nor did the word watchdog most audience members paid handsomely to be invited most tickets were 1 , 500 , others less given that they were coming to see people like mr blankfein other big names were the jpmorgan chase chairman jamie dimon and the google chairman eric schmidt the times s indebtedness to these sources lurks in the shadows \( the participants were not paid for their appearances \) i asked gerald marzorati , the editor who organized the event , about that i can understand that question , but i see no evidence of a problem , he said , other than one of the optics that is , the appearance as opposed to reality once on stage , he noted , the journalists did their part admirably and the times s news coverage of the participants has been toughminded in the end , what s in it for the audience is a great show and the chance to mingle with one another , mr marzorati said what s in it for the headliners is not about cozying up to times journalists , but the ability to talk about things other than their day jobs like matters of public policy mr marzorati noted that with every innovation in times history whether starting new features sections three decades ago , or bringing the statistics guru nate silver on board recently there are always people who say my god , you can t do that it s not us in time , the ventures are well accepted it s 2012 , and newspaper companies need radical change , including new ways of finding the revenue to support their journalism the old model is broken and the times is right to look for new solutions still , some aspects of this particular solution can t help but make me a little queasy
in the wake of the school massacre in newtown , conn , and the resulting renewed debate on gun control in the united states , the stone will publish a series of essays this week that examine the ethical , social and humanitarian implications of the use , possession and regulation of weapons other articles in the series can be found  americans are finally beginning to have a serious discussion about guns one argument we re hearing is the central pillar of the case for private gun ownership that we are all safer when more individuals have guns because armed citizens deter crime and can defend themselves and others against it when deterrence fails those who don t have guns , it s said , are free riders on those who do , as the criminally disposed are less likely to engage in crime the more likely it is that their victim will be armed there s some sense to this argument , for even criminals don t like being shot but the logic is faulty , and a close look at it leads to the conclusion that the united states should ban private gun ownership entirely , or almost entirely one would think that if widespread gun ownership had the robust deterrent effects that gun advocates claim it has , our country would be freer of crime than other developed societies but it s not when most citizens are armed , as they were in the wild west , crime doesn t cease instead , criminals work to be better armed , more efficient in their use of guns \( quicker on the draw \) , and readier to use them when this happens , those who get guns may be safer than they would be without them , but those without them become progressively more vulnerable gun advocates have a solution to this the unarmed must arm themselves but when more citizens get guns , further problems arise people who would once have got in a fistfight instead shoot the person who provoked them people are shot by mistake or by accident and with guns so plentiful , any lunatic or criminally disposed person who has a sudden and perhaps only temporary urge to kill people can simply help himself to the contents of mom s gun cabinet perhaps most important , the more people there are who have guns , the less effective the police become the power of the citizens and that of the police approach parity the police cease to have even a nearmonopoly on the use of force to many devotees of the second amendment , this is precisely the point as former congressman jay dickey , republican of arkansas , said in january 2011 , we have a right to bear arms because of the threat of government taking over the freedoms we have the more people there are with guns , the less able the government is to control them but if arming the citizenry limits the power of the government , it does so by limiting the power of its agents , such as the police domestic defense becomes more a matter of private selfhelp and vigilantism and less a matter of democraticallycontrolled , public law enforcement domestic security becomes increasingly privatized there is , of course , a large element of fantasy in dickey s claim individuals with handguns are no match for a modern army it s also a delusion to suppose that the government in a liberal democracy such as the united states could become so tyrannical that armed insurrection , rather than democratic procedures , would be the best means of constraining it this is not syria nor will it ever be shortly after dickey made his comment , people in egypt rose against a government that had suppressed their freedom in ways far more serious than requiring them to pay for health care although a tiny minority of egyptians do own guns , the protesters would not have succeeded if those guns had been brought to tahrir square if the assembled citizens had been brandishing glocks in accordance with the script favored by second amendment fantasists , the old regime would almost certainly still be in power and many egyptians who re now alive would be dead for the police to remain effective in a society in which most of those they must confront or arrest are armed , they must , like criminals , become better armed , more numerous , and readier to fire but if they do that , guns won t have produced a net reduction in the power of the government but will only have generated enormous private and public expenditures , leaving the balance of power between armed citizens and the state as it was before , the unarmed conspicuously worse off , and everyone poorer except the gun industry the alternative to maintaining the balance of power is to allow it to shift in favor of the armed citizenry and away from the police , again making unarmed citizens including those who refuse on principle to contribute to the erosion of collective security by getting a gun the greatest losers overall the logic is inexorable as more private individuals acquire guns , the power of the police declines , personal security becomes more a matter of selfhelp , and the unarmed have an increasing incentive to get guns , until everyone is armed when most citizens then have the ability to kill anyone in their vicinity in an instant , everyone is less secure than they would be if no one had guns other than the members of a democratically accountable police force the logic of private gun possession is thus similar to that of the nuclear arms race when only one state gets nuclear weapons , it enhances its own security but reduces that of others , which have become more vulnerable the other states then have an incentive to get nuclear weapons to try to restore their security as more states get them , the incentives for others increase if eventually all get them , the potential for catastrophe whether through irrationality , misperception , or accident is great each state s security is then much lower than it would be if none had nuclear weapons gun advocates and criminals are allies in demanding that guns remain in private hands they differ in how they want them distributed criminals want guns for themselves but not for their potential victims others want them for themselves but not for criminals but while gun control can do a little to restrict access to guns by potential criminals , it can t do much when guns are to be found in every other household either criminals and noncriminals will have them or neither will gun advocates prefer for both rather than neither to have them but , as with nuclear weapons , we would all be safer if no one had guns or , rather , no one other than trained and legally constrained police officers domestic defense would then be conducted the way we conduct national defense we no longer accept , as the authors of the now obsolete second amendment did , that a wellregulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state rather than leaving national defense to citizens militias , we now , for a variety of compelling reasons , cede the right of national defense to certain stateauthorized professional institutions the army , navy , and so on we rightly trust these forces to protect us from external threats and not to become instruments of domestic repression we could have the same trust in a police force designed to protect us from domestic threats a prohibition of private ownership would not mean that no one could shoot guns guns for target shooting could be rented under security arrangements at the range and there s perhaps scope for debate about private possession of single chamber shotguns for hunting gun advocates will object that a prohibition of private gun ownership is an impossibility in the united states but this is not an objection they can press in good faith , for the only reason that a legal prohibition could be impossible in a democratic state is that a majority oppose it if gun advocates ceased to oppose it , a prohibition would be possible they will next argue that even if there were a legal prohibition , it could not be enforced with anything approaching complete effectiveness this is true as long as some people somewhere have guns , some people here can get them similarly , the legal prohibition of murder cannot eliminate murder but the prohibition of murder is more effective than a policy of murder control would be guns are not like alcohol and drugs , both of which we have tried unsuccessfully to prohibit many people have an intense desire for alcohol or drugs that is independent of what other people may do but the need for a gun for selfdefense depends on whether other people have them and how effective the protection and deterrence provided by the state are thus , in other western countries in which there are fewer guns , there are correspondingly fewer instances in which people need guns for effective selfdefense gun advocates sometimes argue that a prohibition would violate individuals rights of selfdefense imposing a ban on guns , they argue , would be tantamount to taking a person s gun from her just as someone is about to kill her but this is a defective analogy although a prohibition would deprive people of one effective means of selfdefense , it would also ensure that there would be far fewer occasions on which a gun would be necessary or even useful for selfdefense for guns would be forbidden not just to those who would use them for defense but also to those who would use them for aggression guns are only one means of selfdefense and selfdefense is only one means of achieving security against attack it is the right to security against attack that is fundamental a policy that unavoidably deprives a person of one means of selfdefense but on balance substantially reduces her vulnerability to attack is therefore respectful of the more fundamental right from which the right of selfdefense is derived in other western countries , per capita homicide rates , as well as rates of violent crime involving guns , are a fraction of what they are in the united states the possible explanations of this are limited gun advocates claim it has nothing to do with our permissive gun laws or our customs and practices involving guns if they are right , should we conclude that americans are simply inherently more violent , more disposed to mental derangement , and less moral than people in other western countries \? if you resist that conclusion , you have little choice but to accept that our easy access to all manner of firearms is a large part of the explanation of why we kill each at a much higher rate than our counterparts elsewhere gun advocates must search their consciences to determine whether they really want to share responsibility for the perpetuation of policies that make our country the homicide capitol of the developed world jeff mcmahan is a professor of philosophy at rutgers university he is the author of and killing in war he has several books forthcoming , including the values of lives , a collection of essays
william hamilton was a tenured professor of church history at a small divinity school in rochester in april 1966 when magazine created a sensation with a cover article featuring some of the ideas he had been writing about for years in journals read mainly by ministers and theologians in large red type against a black background , time boiled those ideas down to three words is god dead \? it became one of the magazine s most famous covers , and it upended dr hamilton s quiet life as an academic theologian the article , appearing in the season of easter and , gave a primer on the history of the war between religious and secular ideas in western culture going back to copernicus it quoted billy graham and simone de beauvoir as exemplars of the two sides , and it introduced the world to dr hamilton as the leader of a new school of religious thinking it called the death of god movement dr hamilton became the target of death threats in the year after the article was published he left his job , feeling ostracized and he spent a good deal of the rest of his life he died on feb 28 at 87 adding air quotes with his fingers around the word god , which was what he had meant when he referred to the death of god , he said but the article was basically accurate about his views he believed that the concept of god had run its course in human history civilization now operated according to secular principles and churches should , too , by helping people learn to care for one another unconditionally , without illusions about heavenly rewards for better or worse , it was not something he would have said out loud at the third presbyterian church in rochester , where he and his family attended services for many years until he started meeting icy silences after the time article appeared to him it was a scholarly idea , written for scholarly journals , intended to address the big theological question of the postwar era how to reconcile the notion of an allpowerful god with an overwhelmingly secular and often brutal modern life the question was being explored from every angle by theologians , who were as likely to quote camus , nietzsche and kierkegaard as the bible the death of god thinking had attracted attention the year before , when dr hamilton and thomas j j altizer , a religion professor at emory university in atlanta , published radical theology and the death of god , a collection of their essays reviewing the book for the new york times , edward b fiske described it as an open challenge to the ideas of karl barth , the swiss theologian whose conservative neoorthodox ideas had dominated christian thinking in the 20th century a times article reported , many theologians who challenge the conclusions of the radical theologies nevertheless admit that they must be taken seriously time magazine ran an article about the subject on its religion page but there had been no big stir the cover article caused a big stir what does your dad mean , god is dead' \? dr hamilton s son donald recalled being asked in the schoolyard in the spring of 1966 , when he was 12 i do n't know was his reply , he said time s coverage was a complete surprise to these guys , said terrence w tilley , chairman of the theology department at fordham university , referring to dr hamilton , dr altizer and others identified in the article as members of the death of god group academic theologians , exploring radical ideas in uncharted territory , generally do not expect to see their ideas on the cover of time magazine dr hamilton contended that many people had misunderstood him he was not an , he said , in the way that the evolutionary biologist and author richard dawkins is he considered himself a follower of christ , but whether jesus was the son of god or not , he said , did not matter so much as whether people followed his teachings the death of god' is a metaphor , he told the newspaper the oregonian in 2007 we needed to redefine christianity as a possibility without the presence of god loretta lynn , the country music star , would have none of it she voiced her feelings in the title song of her 1968 album who says god is dead ! that s stupid and mighty low , she sang i like to meet 'em face to face and tell 'em it s not so though dr hamilton held a tenured professorship at colgaterochester divinity school , the intense displeasure he felt from trustees and fellow faculty members led him to accept a job offer in 1967 from new college , a nontraditional institution in sarasota , fla he was named dean of arts and letters at portland state university in oregon in 1970 and taught there until his retirement in 1986 he died of congestive heart failure at his home in portland , his son donald said traditionalists dismissed his ideas as blasphemous , and many liberal theologians criticized his work as inconsistent and confusing how could he say god was dead and call himself a christian \? but some theologians , including ellen t charry of princeton theological seminary , maintain that the call to action inherent in death of god ideas stirred an interest in social justice among liberal christians and influenced the liberation theology movement of the 1960s and '70s william hughes hamilton iii was born on march 9 , 1924 , in evanston , ill , one of two children of william hughes hamilton ii , a windmill engineer , and the former helen anderson he graduated from oberlin college in ohio and , after serving in the navy during , studied at union theological seminary in new york and received his phd at the university of st andrews in scotland besides his son donald , he is survived by his wife , the former mary jean golden two other sons , ross and patrick two daughters , catherine passo and jean hamilton and eight grandchildren dr hamilton s later writing remained below the radar of the press , focusing on the presence and absence of god in the works of herman melville , emily dickinson and shakespeare but in the end , he told the oregonian , he never regretted the hubbub his theological work had caused , however misunderstood his ideas might have been the death of god' enabled me to understand the world , he said looking back , i would n't have gone in any other direction i faced all my worries and questions about death long ago
christina mchale was one of the great stories of last year s united states open , knocking out the eighthseeded marion bartoli in the second round before losing to maria kirilenko mchale is one of a handful of young american players emerging as successors to the williams sisters , and at this point she might be the best of the bunch or at least the most consistent her game reminds some of chris evert s , a defensive , counterpunching style that has flustered and frustrated many opponents into beating themselves now , firmly entrenched in the top 25 , mchale is trying to break through to the next level many believe she can , including evert , who called her the most complete of the upandcoming american women kiki bertens is ranked near 100 , and she is the kind of player mchale should have no trouble beating the two played at roland garros , with mchale pulling out a threeset win but this match is on hard courts in front of a home crowd , so expect an easier time for mchale mirjana lucic vs mar a jos mart nez s nchez if you are looking for a cautionary tale , lucic s has it all she turned pro at 15 and reached the wimbledon semifinals two years later but the pressure of the tour and a domineering father as well as personal and financial troubles kept lucic out of the game for the better part of a decade when she returned in 2010 , lucic was not the player she once was , but given what she went through , it s hard to root against her her opponent on tuesday , s nchez , is a tour veteran whose serveandvolley game is a true aberration on the women s tour vania king vs yaroslava shvedova after reaching the quarterfinals of the french open in 2010 , shvedova looked like a player ready to join the top tier of the women s game then came a nearly twoyear drought , during which her ranking plummeted into the mid 100s in 2012 , it all came back , starting with another run to the quarterfinals of the french and a threeset loss to serena williams in the fourth round at wimbledon maybe it was the new prescription glasses she began wearing this year , or maybe it was a matter of regaining her confidence but no matter what , shvedova is perhaps the most dangerous unseeded player in the tournament , someone none of the top seeds wants to see across the net king is more accustomed to playing on shvedova s side of the court the pair has won two doubles grand slam titles together , and they were the runnersup here last year \( they are again paired in the doubles this year \) francesca schiavone vs sloane stephens at 19 , stephens is one of the rising young talents on the women s side , following up her thirdround run here last year by making the fourth round of the french and the third round at wimbledon her game is anchored by a huge serve , which can often hit 120 mph on the speed gun , and a big forehand she s also one of the quickest players on tour the bad news is she s playing the 22ndseeded and former french open champion schiavone , who brings both a ton of game and a ton of experience to boot stephens is capable of winning this match she s played well against top25 players on faster surfaces , ousting petra cetkovska and taking sabine lisick to three sets at wimbledon these two have only played once with schiavone winning in straights but that match was on clay in france this one will be on hard courts with the crowd firmly on the stephens s side it should be fun carlos berlocq vs bernard tomic tomic plays like no one else on the men s tour , winning with spin , placement and control more than godgiven power his second serve can sometimes look more like a club pro s , but somehow tomic can make it work as he did last year when he was a surprise quarterfinalist at wimbledon this year has been a little tougher as the 19yearold australian s rankings dipped down into the 40s tomic caught a bit of a break here playing the veteran claycourt specialist berlocq in the first round the argentine will keep balls in play , but won t be able to overpower tomic david goffin vs tomas berdych goffin is a talented young belgian with a lot of game , while berdych , the no 6 seed , has often underperformed here upset \? not likely but it could be closer than the rankings might indicate julien benneteau vs olivier rochus the graceful benneteau has the edge in this match , but at age 31 and just 5foot5 , rochus continues to play at a surprisingly high level santiago giraldo vs milos raonic raonic , the 15th seed , is one of the game s bright young talents a 21yearold canadian , he is coming of one of his best tournaments of the year , beating richard gasquet , marcos baghdatis and tomas berdych on his way to the quarterfinals outside cincinnati sergiy stakhovsky vs stanislas wawrinka a tough firstround match for the 18thseeded wawrinka stakhovsky has been ranked as high as 31 , and although he has had a down year , he s been playing better lately christian harrison ryan harrison vs mariusz fyrstenberg marcin matkowski ryan harrison is teaming with his little brother , christian , against the fourthseeded fyrstenberg and matkowski it ll be a tall order for team harrison the poles are an experienced doubles team , and they were last year s runnersup here olga puchkova vs irina falconi falconi surprised many by making it to the third round last year , beating the 14thseeded dominika cibulkova before losing to sabine lisicki her results have been down since then , but this is a winnable match in front of a hometown crowd
north charleston , sc angrily turned aside questions about his marital history at the outset of the final republican before the south carolina primary , and then aggressively took on and the other remaining candidates in a raucous confrontation on thursday night about , abortion , conservative credentials and electability with the field of candidates now down to four and saturday s primary fast approaching , the candidates engaged in intensely personal verbal combat fittingly set in a sports coliseum mr romney told mr gingrich that for all his talk aligning himself with ronald reagan during his days in congress , i looked at the reagan diary you 're mentioned once mr santorum questioned mr gingrich s grip on logic , at one point telling him , these are not cogent thoughts and more generally accusing him of grandiosity and instability mr gingrich gave it right back to both of them , pointedly raising mr romney s past position in favor of abortion rights a stance mr romney has since changed and implying that mr santorum s ideas were too small for the challenges of the times and mr gingrich delighted much of the audience at the debate with his attack on the moderator , john king , of cnn , who began the proceeding by asking the former house speaker about his exwife s allegations that mr gingrich asked to enter into an open marriage mr gingrich met the question with cold anger , winning roars of approval from the debate audience as he said through nearly clenched teeth , i am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that but he ultimately said of his exwife marianne s allegations , reported first on thursday by abc news , the story is false the new dynamic at play in the campaign was apparent on the stage , which looked starkly different from those of previous debates , with only four lecterns after the departures of gov rick perry of texas from the race earlier in the day and jon m huntsman jr on monday with mr gingrich gaining in polls against mr romney , mr santorum seeking momentum on news that he had the most votes in the iowa caucuses , and representative of texas fighting to get back into the mix after campaigning only lightly here , no candidate had a free pass to the extent that any of the other candidates were hoping to seriously knock mr romney off stride , none seemed to do so to any substantial degree , though they collectively pushed him hard on the similarities between his health care plan and the one championed by president obama , and on his previous support for abortion rights during his political career in massachusetts i'm not questioned on character and integrity very often , mr romney responded , adding , i do n't feel like standing here for that after mr santorum implied that mr romney was of the sort who would whisper into the microphone that they 're prolife as opposed to people like him who go out and fight the battle , mr romney said sternly , i did my very best to be a prolife governor i will be a prolife president mr gingrich , who released his tax returns as the debate was under way , smiled with satisfaction when mr king raised the question of whether mr romney would do the same mr romney joked about his new status as an alsoran in iowa , saying that he wished he could go back and win more votes there if there was a worst moment for mr romney , it was when he was asked by mr king whether he would follow the lead of his father , who released 12 years of tax returns when he was running for president in 1968 maybe , he said at first drawing some laughter but then boos from the crowd when he went on to say , i do n't know how many years i 'll release i 'll take a look at what our documents are but as much as anything , the campaign at this stage is about the competition to be the leading conservative alternative to mr romney , a scrum involving mr gingrich , mr santorum and mr paul some of whose supporters were in the crowd and let their displeasure be known when they believed he was being neglected by mr king mr santorum and mr gingrich went after each other with considerable vigor if not venom , at one point leaving mr romney to stand aside to watch , relaxed and smiling mr santorum delivered a detailed and blistering critique questioning mr gingrich s ability to serve in the oval office he pointedly accused his rival of grandiose views that would cloud his judgment and interfere with the leadership required of a chief executive he accused him of turning a blind eye to the checkwriting scandal in congress he accused mr gingrich of showing no discipline , no ability to be able to pull things together , in congress , and said he presented the frequent worrisome moment that something s going to pop by contrast , he said , i'm not the most flamboyant and i do n't get the biggest applause lines here , but i'm steady i'm solid i'm not going to go out and do things that you 're going to worry about mr gingrich sought to belittle his opponent and fired back dismissively , saying , long before rick came to congress , i was busy being a rebel he said that he would not apologize for proposing bold ideas and presenting big views i spent 16 years on a grandiose project called creating a republican majority in the house , mr gingrich said he added , you 're right , i think grandiose thoughts this is a grandiose country of big people doing big things on immigration , mr santorum also sought to paint two of his challengers as insufficiently conservative he accused mr romney of reversing himself from four years ago when he supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are already in the country he asserted that mr gingrich was even more unacceptable to conservatives , saying that he holds president obama s position on granting amnesty mr santorum at one point even accused both mr romney and mr gingrich of playing footsies with the left on health care for their previous support for health insurance mandates mr gingrich , who is closer in polls to mr romney than he has been at this point of any nominating contest yet , continued his criticism of mr romney s time at the investment firm bain capital he raised examples of companies that lost jobs under mr romney s time at the company , declaring that mr romney should explain himself mr romney received enthusiastic applause as he defended capitalism he said that he found it strange that the attacks were coming from the people on this stage i know we 're going to get hit hard from president obama , mr romney said , but we 're going to stuff it down his throat and point out it is capitalism and freedom that makes america strong while mr paul was often left out of the discussion during a debate that did not include questions about his premier issues of the deficit , or foreign policy , he asserted his strong opposition to abortion and did not hesitate to make an allusion to the pressure on mr gingrich about his marriages i'm very proud , mr paul said , that my wife of 54 years is with me tonight
jerusalem and israeli negotiators plan to meet for the first time in more than a year in jordan on tuesday , in an effort to revive moribund peace talks , although none of the sides involved suggested any reason to view the meeting as a sign of significant progress the jordanian foreign ministry said the chief palestinian negotiator , saeb erekat , and the chief israeli negotiator , yitzhak molho , would be joined by officials from jordan as well as the socalled quartet russia , the united states , the european union and the united nations and would later hold a separate meeting it would be the first oneonone meeting between the two sides since september 2010 when the palestinians ended the talks after did not renew a partial settlement freeze that was in place for 10 months in the west bank , and resumed construction the palestinians have insisted that the israelis must again stop settlement building in the west bank , as well as in east jerusalem , for negotiations to start again the israelis say peace talks should proceed without preconditions mr erekat said by telephone on sunday that the demand for a settlement freeze remained and that he was going to the meeting out of respect for the efforts of king abdullah ii of jordan he said he hoped that prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel would see the significance of jordan s role and stop settlements to give the king the chance he deserves he added , the king understands the complexities and dangers and has decided to step in a spokesman for mr netanyahu , mark regev , said the israelis had been calling for direct talks without preconditions for three years but he said that there would be no new freeze on settlements the quartet has been trying to bring the palestinians and israelis back to direct talks by asking each to submit proposals on borders and security the palestinians have submitted their ideas but the israelis say that if the goal is direct talks , the proposals should be given to the palestinians once they meet king abdullah has been taking an unusually active role in the israelipalestinian issue in recent months in november , he made a to see mahmoud abbas , the president of the palestinian authority a week later , to amman , the jordanian capital , for a meeting the higher profile the king has taken is partly an effort to fill a vacuum left by the overthrow of president hosni mubarak of egypt in february mr mubarak , who was a central backer of the fatahled palestinian authority and had good relations with israel , often acted as a mediator to spur the two sides to improve their relations king abdullah is also eager to send a message to hamas , the militant islamist group that governs the gaza strip , that despite the rise of islamism in the region , the palestinian authority remains , in his view , the leader of the palestinians mr abbas has started talks for a unity government with hamas , but they are proceeding slowly the king also has a very specific interest in a moderate palestinian state being established in the west bank and gaza he has tensions with islamists in his own country and in addition , he does not want to encourage any thoughts of a palestinian state being established in jordan instead , as some on the israeli right advocate more than half of the inhabitants of jordan are palestinian jordan and israel share a common interest in focusing palestinian nationalism on the west bank and gaza to prevent its being focused on either of their states mr netanyahu and his aides say they also worry that any palestinian state in the west bank would ultimately be overrun by islamists
when a batter strikes out four times in a game , it is known as the golden sombrero five times and the sombrero turns platinum to strike out six times is sometimes called a horn , named for the former baltimore orioles hitter sam horn , one of eight players to accomplish the feat unfortunately , there is no catchy name for drawing five walks in a game , an achievement that mike baxter of the mets accomplished saturday night against the san diego padres , becoming just the 100th player since 1918 to pull off the feat in terms of scarcity , drawing five walks or more in a game is less common than hitting three home runs or throwing a nohitter baxter drew his five walks in a nineinning game with no official atbats , narrowing the list to 29 batters it was just the 11th time since 1955 , when intentional walks started being tracked , that a batter walked unintentionally at least five times without recording an atbat the record is six walks in a game , last accomplished by jeff bagwell in 1999 in an extrainning affair in which he had eight plate appearances only three times since 1918 has a batter walked six times in a game , making it rarer than a perfect game or an unassisted triple play to find an accomplishment with the same scarcity , you would have to go to a 20strikeout game for a pitcher but nothing has beaten the game that jimmie foxx of the red sox had against the st louis browns on june 16 , 1938 stepping to the plate six times in a nineinning game , foxx walked each time it is not known for sure if any of the walks were intentional \( at least one news account at the time suggested one of the walks was \) , but foxx was batting 349 at the time and was on his way to 50 home runs and 175 runs batted in , making it likely that he was being pitched around in some fashion the strategy , intentional or not , did not prove effective for the browns , mostly because of the batter who followed foxx in the batting order , joe cronin cronin , like foxx a future hall of famer , was 4 for 6 and drove in four runs in the eventual 128 win for the red sox foxx , other than drawing at least 24 pitches from the browns pitching staff , scored two runs while none of baxter s walks were overtly intentional , it does not appear that the padres were very intent on throwing the outfielder a strike , either , although no one would confuse baxter with a hitter like foxx or bagwell just five of the 25 pitches thrown to baxter during the game went through the strike zone one factor might have been the 72point difference entering the game between baxter s 310 batting average and the 238 mark of andres torres , who followed baxter in the lineup if that was indeed a factor in all of the walks baxter drew , the strategy worked just fine , with torres going 0 for 4 , although it should be noted that the mets won the game  perhaps the most impressive part of the evening for baxter was that his onbase percentage increased by 35 points , to 425 from 390 , with the five walks accounting for 357 percent of his season total now the feat just needs a name
today , at war journeys into crowdsourcing to ask for readers help identifying a weapon found on the battlefields of libya last year followers of this blog know that we have spent considerable time identifying and sometimes tracing the tools of war in several recent conflicts back to their sources but this time , we are stumped the items in question are what ordnance professionals call submunitions , but are more widely known among lay readers as cluster bombs the photograph above shows one found in november at the ruins of an arms depot a few miles outside of mizdah , in the desert south of tripoli we post it here to bring into public view an ordinary and often frustrating process that has been happening , quietly and by fits and starts for several months , among nongovernmental organizations and arms specialists working in libya here is the background this submunition was in the arsenal of col muammar elqaddafi s military , and was fired at antiqaddafi rebels in the summer and perhaps again in the fall , part of the proqaddafi forces last gasps after the conflict ended , many more were found scattered near shattered bunkers in the depot near mizdah these apparently had been kicked out of storage when bunkers were struck by bombs from nato or allied warplanes \( more on that here \) you can see the disposition of some of them at the depot , below this is where you come in last year we saw a few examples of crowdsourcing working out identifications on munitions we did not participate in those efforts , though we applaud them so , after talking with david mcivor , chief of operations at the united nations joint mine action coordination team in libya , we decided to submit some of what we know of this unidentified weapon to public view , and see if the public might help our decision to go public had a simple root almost six months after first being spotted , no one , as far as we know , has managed to identify the precise model and origins of these submunitions that is not for lack of trying in the summer , nongovernmental organizations circulated images of the cluster bomb to specialists , and specialists in several countries could not pin down a solid identification after a few weeks , people stopped trying , at least actively , as other business diverted attention then , in the fall , contractors working for the state department and journalists working for the new york times found the bomblets again , and doctors and scrap collectors in mizdah reported people being wounded by them the pursuit resumed since then , this blog has put images of these submunitions in front of roughly two dozen specialists from the explosive ordnance disposal business , including people in and out of uniform so far there is no definitive identification can you help \? in case you come to this cold , let s talk ordnance and explain a few basic things what you are looking at is known as a dual purpose improved conventional munition , or dpicm it is a member of the cluster munitions family one of the socalled submunitions carried inside a larger canister that opens in flight , releases bomblets and distributes them to the ground below look closely and you will notice familiar features of the class , including the ribbon that helps prevent tumbling in flight and thereby stabilizes the weapon and orients its explosive charge \( the ribbon might also play a role , via inflight vibration , in arming the weapon s fuze \) you can also see that the weapon is configured to hold a small shaped charge this is designed so that if it lands on a vehicle , its explosion might penetrate light armor as for a dimensions , each of these submunitions is a roughly the size of a dcell battery for a more precise sense of dimension , look at the image below , showing one of the submunitions , rendered safe , and many of its components , against a measuring tape why has this been so hard to identify \? first , no canister that held these munitions has yet been found , at least not by any of the specialists , so it has not been clear if the submunitions had been scattered via rocket , mortar or artillery tube \( the canisters or packaging probably could have been found readily in mizdah , but scrap collectors had picked much of the place clean , and , for safety reasons , in november , after a times team made photographs of the submunitions on the ground , we backed out \) second , the markings on unexploded submunitions did not point clearly at a particular model third , many countries have developed and manufactured dpicms , and several nations have knocked off others designs the line s manufacturing history , coupled with the fact that opensource materials on which country made which models are limited , can make dpicm identification a bear last , there was the question of the risks in handling these items dpicm s , because they are lightweight and do not strike the earth with the same energy as other conventional groundtoground arms , can have extremely sensitive fuzes we did not touch the bomblets we found we did not handle or manipulate them in any way this meant we could not take precise measurements or thoroughly examine them for markings , factory stampings , etc there have been tentative identifications a retired american military explosive ordnance disposal technician working as a contractor in libya suggested that they might be type 81 dpicms from china , shown below the submunitions certainly resembled the type 81 but they did not quite seem a match \( there are several differences an obvious one is the presence in the unidentified munition of holes in the body , a feature that one specialist said was likely designed to impart spin on the weapon as it moves through the air \) after we concluded that type 81s might not be the answer , we circulated a fresh set of images to other ordnance disposal sources , including several who have helped at war in the past they , too , were stumped at that point we broadened the discussion , asking for help from mines advisory group , ihs janes , the cluster munition coalition , and the united nations mineabatement office in tripoli , led by mr mcivor mark hiznay , at human right watch , had said the initial finds had been reported in the mountains of libya s west mr mcivor had more information he believed they had been found at bani walid , too , and perhaps surt but said he , too , had been able to run down an exact identification that was in the late fall and so months after the initial discovery , we were only a little further along at war then went about things backward , beginning a process of elimination if we don t know what they there , can we say what they are not \? here the blog found some help so what aren t they \? we already covered type 81s \( though one source said they might be an updated version of the type 81 , which has not been seen before \) they do not appear to be americanmade m42s m46s or m77s and they seem not to be anything seen before from the former yugoslavia colin king , an analyst at ihs janes , was emphatic on this point i m intimately familiar with the yugoslav submunitions \( having disassembled them \) , and these are completely unlike any of the types i know of \( kb1 , kb2 and locally manufactured dpicm for the m93 mortar \) , also the markings wouldn t make sense for a yugoslav munition , he wrote in emails i can be pretty confident these are not from there there have been suggestions that they might be italian or german , but these have been suggestions only no one yet has presented evidence supporting such claims so today the blog asks for your help , and we will sweeten the pot we have a small prize for the person who provides solid identification with reference materials backing up the answer i will mail the prize the person who makes the first clear and substantiated identification and even greater satisfaction should come from knowing that you helped and that you beat the experts for those who decide to pitch in , we would also like to see photographs or descriptions \( the more technical the better \) of the cargo canister that delivers these rounds and lastly , any knowing interpretation of the stenciling visible on the submunitions would be similarly welcome take a look at the images below this first one bears stenciling that appears to read 4a09 and this one also end in 09 if these are batch markings indicating that these submunitions were manufactured in 2009 , it would mean that the weapons were manufactured after many of the world s nations signed the clustermunitions convention how to proceed \? the rules of this effort will have to be loose , balancing the openness of the internet with the need to protect some of your identities so we will accept input from multiple streams you can post your suggestions or answers in the comments section if you have a sound reason not to show your name or your hand publicly , you are welcome to skip the comments section and contact me directly on email at chivers nytimescom or thegunbook gmailcom i will recast your answer and update the at war blog with a distillation of your email , while protecting your name , position and all that as for competition from any other news organizations or web sites , well , in this case there is none this is about trying to get it right , so that the world will know more about who provided the qaddafi government its arms , and when , and so that those who have to clear these dpicm s will know more of their technical characteristics at war is collegial if another site takes on this job and figures this out , that is a very good thing let us know , and we will follow you and credit you here
i received news this week of the death of george whitmore jr , an occurrence noted , apparently , by no one in the public arena that whitmore could die without a single mention in the media is a commentary on a city and nation that would rather bury and forget the difficult aspects of our shared history fortyeight years ago , as a new york city teenager , whitmore was initiated into an ordeal at the hands of a racist criminal justice system for a time , his story rattled the news cycle he was chewed up and spit out an illprepared kid vilified as a murderer , then championed as an emblem of injustice and , finally , cast aside that he survived his tribulations and lived to the age of 68 was a miracle i first met whitmore in the spring of 2009 while doing research for a book that posited that his experiences constituted an important subnarrative to the racial turmoil of the 1960s and early 1970s finding him was not easy i eventually tracked him down in wildwood , nj , not far from where he 'd been born and raised i found a man who was broken but unbowed , humble , with glimmers of an innocence that had been snatched from him a long time ago for a time in his adolescence , he 'd been infamous by the time i found him , he was anonymous , and that was ok with him back in april 1964 , like a horrifying urbanjungle version of alice s adventures in wonderland , whitmore began a nearly decadelong ramble through the justice system that still boggles the mind it started on a misty morning when whitmore , 19 years old , africanamerican , raised in poverty and a gradeschool dropout , was taken by a handful of new york city detectives into the 73rd precinct station house in east new york , brooklyn after a 22hour interrogation by numerous detectives all of them white he was coerced into signing a 61page confession detailing a series of horrific crimes , including , most notably , a brutal double murder of two young white women on the upper east side of manhattan the case had become known in the media as the career girl murders the killings took place on the same day aug 28 , 1963 and perhaps at the exact time that the rev dr martin luther king jr delivered his i have a dream speech at the march on washington for jobs and freedom the confession was frontpage news the brooklyn cops who were involved congratulated themselves one was given a special award for exemplary work but the confession was a fraud to most objective observers , it did n't seem likely that whitmore could have committed the murders at his arraignment , he told the judge that he 'd been coerced into admitting guilt few cared he was a disposable negro who 'd been raised in a shack alongside a junkyard in wildwood a drifter , described in one account as possibly mentally retarded he was indicted , imprisoned and declared a monster america was just on the cusp of the civil rights revolution it was a time of pernicious institutional racism a black kid had been railroaded , and he was n't the first nor would he be the last but the detectives had made the mistake of pinning on him the city s most notorious open murder case , which brought about a higher level of scrutiny than the average homicide the case quickly began to fall apart the detectives claimed that they had found a photo of one of the career girls in whitmore s wallet when they arrested him he 'd told them he 'd found it at the murder scene and stolen it , they said none of it was true \( he did have a photo on him , but it was not of either of the victims \) on the day of the murders , witnesses had seen him sitting in an empty catering hall in wildwood , where he was working at the time , watching king s speech on television despite a mounting belief among some civil rights activists associated with the naacp , and a few intrepid journalists , that whitmore was innocent , he remained in prison , facing two death sentences depressed , frightened and alone , he pondered his imminent demise at the hands of the state he asked other inmates if you were going to be put to death , which would it be \? the chair \? lethal injection \? what s the least painful way to die \? a teenager , having committed no crime ever at that point in his life , pondering what means of execution he would choose this was his reality it would take nine years for whitmore to clear his name it would n't have happened without the help of many lawyers , a few newspaper reporters and the civil rights activists though the career girls murder charges were dropped early on and the actual killer , richard robles , was eventually tried and convicted whitmore had also been forced to confess to another murder charge , and the assault and attempted rape of a woman in brooklyn there followed a numbing cycle of trials , convictions , convictions overturned , retrials and appeals whitmore went from being a nobody to being a perceived murderer to being a terribly wronged man and back to being a nobody in prison , he learned to make rotgut hooch and , trying to dull the pain , became an alcoholic in april 1973 , he emerged triumphant a few weeks before all the charges against him were finally thrown out , cbs broadcast a highly promoted movieoftheweek based on his ordeal the movie , the marcusnelson murders , based on a book by the new york times reporter selwyn raab , was produced and written by abby mann , an academy awardwinning screenwriter whitmore was paid a pittance for his cooperation in the end , the movie is best remembered for having introduced a character named detective theo kojak , played by the actor telly savalas mr savalas and kojak would go down in the annals of tv history whitmore watched the movie from the medical ward at the green haven state prison in dutchess county nine years after his name was finally cleared and he 'd been released from prison , whitmore won a settlement of half a million dollars from the city of new york but it was too little , too late he 'd been crushed by the system , his selfworth obliterated in ways that could never fully be put back together he squandered the money he 'd been awarded through bad business ventures and at the hands of devious friends and relatives by the time i found whitmore , he was living in poverty similar to what he 'd known in those years before he was led into that police station in brooklyn back in 1964 meeting whitmore was eerie for me though he was 65 years old at the time , i could still see that 19yearold kid who had been so horribly wronged all those years ago you could see the pain in his face in one of our first meetings , in the backyard of his tiny rented house on route 9 , i took a photo of him you can look in his eyes and almost hear him asking the question , why me \? over the next two years , i frequently made the drive to wildwood from manhattan , a threeandahalfhour jaunt along the jersey shore i 'd take whitmore to the market to buy groceries to fill his empty kitchen cabinets and refrigerator then we 'd sit and talk going over the past was painful for him i tried to catch him early in the day after he had his first couple of drinks , he was lucid and charming he remembered his ordeal with such detail that it could send a chill up your spine and bring you to tears after a few more drinks , he would lose focus , get sloppy and sometimes become ornery and difficult when the book was finished , i delivered a couple of copies to whitmore he held it in his hands , felt its heft and smiled with pride since adolescence , he had had poor eyesight , and i'm not sure he ever learned to read but after he 'd taken a few minutes to look at the pictures in the book and flip through its pages , seeing the familiar names and descriptions of events , he wept at the memory of his lost youth in recent months , i 'd fallen out of touch with whitmore knowing him , and attempting to assume a measure of responsibility for his life , was often exhausting while i had come to love him , the drunken phone calls , the calls from hospital emergency rooms and flophouses , and the constant demands for money became overwhelming when people who claimed to be friends of his starting calling me and asking for favors , i decided to back off but when i received a cryptic email from one of his nephews , informing me that whitmore had died on monday , i was overcome with sadness and regret whitmore never saw himself as a race activist in the 1960s and 1970s , from prison and on the streets , he watched the civil rights movement and the black power movement at a wary distance he did not judge people by their skin color he knew he had been the victim of a grave injustice , but he did not assume that the detectives who framed him , or his slow torture at the hands of a rigged system , were motivated by racial prejudice by staying strong for all those years by not taking a plea deal , as he had been offered numerous times whitmore forced the justice system to come to terms with the injustice that had been done to him his ordeal was a key factor in the abolition of the death penalty \( except for cases involving the killing of a police officer \) by the state legislature and gov nelson a rockefeller , in 1965 , and in the united states supreme court s decision in the 1966 case miranda v arizona , which broadened the rights of criminal suspects under interrogation \( the death penalty was restored in new york in 1995 , but it was ruled unconstitutional by the state s highest court in 2004 \) whitmore s plight turned the wheels of justice , however painfully and incrementally yet there are no plaques in honor of george whitmore jr , no schools named after him , or any civic recognition of his humble fortitude his name should be known to every student in new york , especially kids of color , but it is not part of the curriculum this week , a flawed but beautiful man who offered up his innocence to new york city died with hardly any notice to those who benefited from his struggles or who believe the city is a fairer place for his having borne them , i ask who grieves for george whitmore \?
washington there have been many hundreds of varied rulings in the lower courts on when the use of stun guns by the police amounts to excessive force , and sooner or later the will have to bring order to this area of the law next week , the justices are scheduled to decide whether to hear an appeal from three seattle police officers who say they are worried about the future of what they call a useful pain technique the case involves malaika brooks , who was seven months pregnant and driving her 11yearold son to school in seattle when she was pulled over for speeding the police say she was going 32 miles per hour in a school zone the speed limit was 20 ms brooks said she would accept a ticket but drew the line at signing it , which state law required at the time ms brooks thought , wrongly , that signing was an acknowledgment of guilt refusing to sign was a crime , and the two officers on the scene summoned a sergeant , who instructed them to arrest ms brooks she would not get out of her car the situation plainly called for bold action , and officer juan m ornelas met the challenge by brandishing a taser and asking ms brooks if she knew what it was she did not , but she told officer ornelas what she did know i have to go to the bathroom , she said i am pregnant i'm less than 60 days from having my baby the three men assessed the situation and conferred well , do n't do it in her stomach , one said do it in her thigh officer ornelas twisted ms brooks s arm behind her back a colleague , officer donald m jones , applied the taser to ms brooks s left thigh , causing her to cry out and honk the car s horn a halfminute later , officer jones applied the taser again , now to ms brooks s left arm he waited six seconds before pressing it into her neck ms brooks fell over , and the officers dragged her into the street , laying her face down and cuffing her hands behind her back in the months that followed , ms brooks gave birth to a healthy baby girl was convicted of refusing to sign the ticket , a misdemeanor , but not of resisting arrest and sued the officers who three times caused her intense pain and left her with permanent scars the officers won in october from a 10member panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco the majority said the officers had used excessive force but nonetheless could not be sued because the law on the question was not clear in 2004 , when the incident took place while the ruling left the three officers in the clear , it did put them and their colleagues on notice that some future uses of tasers would cross a constitutional line and amount to excessive force chief judge alex kozinski dissented on the first point , saying ms brooks had been defiant and deaf to reason and so had brought the incident upon herself as for the officers , he said they deserve our praise , not the opprobrium of being declared constitutional violators the city of seattle should award them commendations for grace under fire another dissenter , judge barry g silverman , said tasing was a humane way to force brooks out of her car there are only so many ways a person can be extracted from a vehicle against her will , and none of them is pretty , he explained fists , batons , chokeholds , tear gas and chemical spray all carry their own risks to suspects and officers alike the bottom line , in any event , was that the officers had won they have nonetheless , in an effort to clear their names and preserve the freewheeling use of a useful pain technique their employer , the city of seattle , seems to think they have gone rogue in , seattle disavowed what it called the officers' sky is falling' interpretation of the ninth circuit s decision , which said only , as the city put it , that three applications of a taser in drivestun mode in less than a minute on a pregnant woman who does not pose a safety threat may give rise to a lawsuit for a jury to sort out seattle , which said it was liable for any damages in the case , urged the justices not to hear the officers' appeal , who lost in the ninth circuit but is still pursuing claims under state law but several police groups , including the los angeles county police chiefs' association , asked the supreme court to hear the officers' appeal because the ninth circuit s decision damages the rule of law it wo n't be long , , before the word spreads throughout society s criminal underground that the ninth circuit has n't simply given them a get out of jail free' card , but a never have to go to jail in the first place' card michael f williams , a lawyer at kirkland ellis , which represents ms brooks , said the criminal justice system would endure even if the police were barred from delivering thousands of volts of electricity into the body of a pregnant woman who refused to sign a piece of paper the officers are trying to defend inexcusable conduct , he said they inflicted enormous pain on a woman who was especially vulnerable over what was essentially a traffic violation
los angeles one of the great mysteries of the 2012 playoffs is how the kings suddenly transformed from a mediocre team that barely made the playoffs to the juggernaut they have been in the postseason even after losing two straight games for the first time this spring , courtesy of the revivified devils in the stanley cup finals , they are still 154 in the postseason contrast that impressive record with the kings regularseason mark 40 wins in regulation , overtime and shootouts and 42 defeats in regulation , overtime and shootouts that s an eyelash under 500 it has been widely observed that big things were predicted for the kings before the season started , with mike richards added to the team s cast alongside anze kopitar , dustin brown , drew doughty and others however , they underachieved so drastically that it cost the coach , terry murray , his job in december why , then , did the kings lose so often during the regular season , and why are they winning so often in the playoffs \? the answer , it turns out , is tied in part to their shooting efficiency and simple mathematical probability during the regular season , the kings scored on only 64 percent of their shots on goal while skating fiveonfive the lowest evenstrength shooting percentage in the nhl in comparison , the median teams , buffalo and edmonton , struck on 83 percent of their fiveonfive shots , and the best team in shooting percentage , tampa bay , scored on 99 percent \( see this chart at behindthenetca , which renders the kings shooting percentage at 936 under the heading 5v5 sh , which actually stands for opposition goalies save percentage \) what does 19 percentage points below the nhl median mean over the course of an 82game season \? quite a bit , as it happens 38 goals the kings were taking 307 shots per game while skating fiveonfive in the regular season scoring on 64 percent of them translated to an average of 20 evenstrength goals per 60 minutes had they been striking at the median rate , they would have scored not quite 25 goals per 60 minutes , or 38 additional goals over the course of the season that s a lot of goals , and probably a fair number of extra victories and regulation ties worth somewhere in the vicinity of 10 to 19 points that would have made the kings not a mediocre 95point eighth seed , but one of the top three teams in the western conference , somewhere next to the 111point canucks or the 109point blues their excellence in the playoffs would have come as no surprise and indeed , the kings are striking on 93 percent of their postseason shots while skating fiveonfive that s the thirdbest shooting percentage among the 16 playoff teams , and much better than the median evenstrength strike rate of 65 percent one might say that as unlucky as the kings were in their regularseason shooting , they have been quite lucky in their playoff shooting now , some will object that a low shooting percentage is itself a sign of incompetence , and a high shooting percentage a sign of extra competence but advanced hockey statisticians say no , that shooting percentage is mainly a matter of probability all teams , they say , eventually trend toward the median shooting percentage , which in recent seasons has hovered around 85 percent at fiveonfive and 9 percent for all manpower situations \( for detailed discussion from advancedhockeystat types , try this link and this one as well \) none of this , of course , can predict what will happen in game 6 of the kingsdevils championship series or , if necessary , game 7 but at least we ll have a little better idea why the kings are here
as the misguided war in iraq made clear , intelligence analysis is an uncertain game , all too vulnerable to error and politically motivated distortion that experience has done little to change the intelligence community s passion for secrets , whether or not they need to be kept three decades later , we still do not know for certain but have good reason to believe that flawed or distorted intelligence led the reagan administration to accuse the soviet union and vietnam of using chemical weapons , known as yellow rain a classified critique of the intelligence behind those charges , written several years ago for the central intelligence agency , could shed light on what happened last year , matthew meselson , a harvard expert on chemical and biological weapons , filed a freedom of information act request to get the report released he was turned down the report should be made public both for its historical value and its possible lessons on how to handle the challenge of divining an enemy s capabilities and intentions in 1981 and 1982 , the reagan administration charged that the soviet union had supplied toxins made from a poisonous fungus to its vietnamese and laotian allies to use as a weapon against hmong villagers who had sided with the united states during the vietnam war and against antivietnamese forces in cambodia the charge was based on circumstantial evidence , including reports from hmong refugees who claimed to have been sickened by the attacks , and by laboratory tests that purported to find traces of toxins in yellow spots scraped from foliage and in the blood or urine of supposed victims over the years , skeptics led by dr meselson have persuasively disputed most of the claims but left some loose ends they argued that the yellowish drops found on foliage were most likely produced by honeybees , which often leave their nests en masse and produce showers of pollenlaced feces that can cover an acre or more with hundreds of thousands of yellow spots they suspect but cannot prove that the traces of poison found in some samples were false positives caused by laboratory contamination defense laboratories in the united states , britain , france and sweden analyzed scores of samples and never found a trace of poison meanwhile , the testimony by hmong refugees usually fell apart in followup interviews their illnesses were repeatedly shown to be due to natural causes no chemical munitions have ever been found , and none of the hundreds of vietnamese soldiers who were debriefed provided a shred of information that suggested the use of a weapon remotely resembling yellow rain the internal report that dr meselson is seeking was done by a former covert operative and contract historian , and examined how the intelligence community came up with its finding that yellow rain was a chemical weapon the cia is claiming that releasing the report would reveal sensitive information about intelligence sources and methods , as well as the organization and function of the cia thirty years later , that is preposterous a better guess is that the agency is worried about being embarrassed by what the report says about how the intelligence community did its work
robert e diamond jr , the chief executive of barclays , told employees on monday that he was disappointed and angry about the bank s past attempts to manipulate key interest rates to bolster its bottom line but fresh details about the case show how mr diamond and other senior executives played a role in the questionable actions and failed to prevent them in 2007 and 2008 , mr diamond s top deputies told employees to report artificially low rates in line with its rivals , deflecting scrutiny about the health of barclays at the height of the financial crisis , according to several people close to the case the new revelations raise additional questions about the future of mr diamond and top management , just days after the bank agreed to pay 450 million to settle the rate manipulation case lawmakers will ratchet up the pressure on wednesday , when the chief executive is scheduled to testify before a british parliamentary committee david cameron , britain s prime minister , also announced monday a wideranging inquiry into the british banking sector , with the findings to be published by the end of the year we need to take action right across the board , he told parliament regulators in london and washington are broadly investigating whether big banks manipulated interest rates to their own advantage , aiming to increase profits and fend off questions about their health such benchmarks , including the london interbank offered rate , are essential to setting the lending rates for corporations and consumers at barclays , the problems started at the top during the period in question , the bank looked like a winner after lehman brothers collapsed in september 2008 , barclays picked up some of the pieces and unlike peers , the bank did not have to take government bailout money but in late 2008 , mr diamond , then head of the investment banking unit , informed his deputies that outside officials , including the bank of england , were concerned barclays was reporting high interest rates , a sign of poor health his top deputies relayed the message to lowerlevel employees , instructing them to depress the rates , according to people close to the case , who spoke on the condition of anonymity the actions masked the bank s true financial position jerry del missier , a rising star in the bank who is now the chief operating officer , was ensnared by the investigation as well , according to the people close to the case he was briefed on the actions but did not prevent the wrongdoing , the people close to the case said two other top executives , christopher lucas , the finance director , and rich ricci , the investment banking chief , were also involved in the case , the people said none of the executives has been accused of any wrongdoing mr del missier was promoted just last month to chief operating officer and people close to the case say mr diamond never told anyone to submit bogus rates instead , mr diamond s conversation led to a miscommunication , according to regulatory documents even so , the four executives forfeited their bonuses last week when barclays disclosed the settlement with british regulators , the justice department and the commodity futures trading commission , one of the largest regulatory sanctions tied to the crisis mr diamond , in a letter to employees on monday , accepted responsibility for the debacle , which has caused a firestorm in london i am disappointed because many of these behaviors happened on my watch , he wrote even as mr diamond moved to allay concerns , the case claimed its first casualty after marcus agius , the chairman of barclays , resigned on monday while mr agius was not directly involved in manipulating interest rates , he acknowledged responsibility for the problem last week s events have dealt a devastating blow to barclays' reputation , mr agius said in a statement as chairman , i am the ultimate guardian of the bank s reputation barclays announced on monday that it will conduct an independent audit of its business practices the review will center on what led to the rate manipulation , as well as other flawed practices , and how these issues will affect the bank s business units in the future the serious fraud office of britain also said on monday that it may pursue criminal prosecutions in connection to the manipulation of libor british authorities , who continue to work with counterparts overseas , will make a decision about the evidence gathered by the country s financial services authority regulators are continuing to investigate whether many other big banks tried to manipulate libor , a measure of how much banks charge each other for loans libor and the other interbank rates are published daily , based on surveys from banks about the rates at which they could borrow money regulators in the united states have issued subpoenas to several banks involved in libor , including bank of america , ubs and citigroup in the barclays case , regulators accused the bank of lowering its libor submissions to deflect concerns about its high borrowing costs the managers in the treasury department sought rates in line with rival banks and directed employees not to put your head above the parapet in november 2007 , one employee asked to take the issue upstairs , referring to higher firm officials , regulatory documents show mr lucas , the current finance director who had a role in overseeing the treasury department back then , was told of the dubious practice , a person briefed on the matter said but executives did not put a stop to the practice instead , a treasury manager later said that top executives instructed the group to continue to stick within the bounds , according to regulatory documents one concerned employee called the rates patently false , prompting a supervisor to relay the worries to a member of senior management again , the top executives failed to stop it as the crisis dragged on , concerns about barclays mounted even after trying to depress the rates , the bank s submissions were relatively high , prompting speculation about its health in the fall of 2008 , paul tucker , deputy governor of the bank of england , spoke with mr diamond about the high libor submissions , according to one of the people close to the case the conversation prompted mr diamond to relay the central bank s concerns to his top deputies while mr diamond never specifically told anyone to influence libor , at least one of the deputies acted on the discussion , regulatory records show after talking with mr diamond , the deputy then instructed employees that the libor submissions should be lowered to be within the pack barclays declined to comment on monday , mr diamond accepted responsibility without specifying his role in the inquiry in the letter to employees , he said , it does not matter if this was perpetrated by one individual or a handful it was wrong this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos robert e diamond jr , barclays' chief , is scheduled to testify before a british parliamentary committee on wednesday \( photograph by jerome favre bloomberg news \) \( b1 \) jerry del missier , who was appointed chief operating officer last month , was said to know of the actions and did n't stop them \( photograph by brendan mcdermid reuters \)

obama s performance on foreign policy issues , we get judgments so closely tied to party identification that they are hardly worth discussing but when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on america s role in the world , there are some surprising areas of agreement in fact , strong agreement , it turns out using data from the cooperative campaign analysis project on the appropriate use of military force , we find that we are not polarized over everything ensuring access to oil , destroying terrorist camps , intervening in a civil war , assisting the spread of democracy , and helping our allies are all actions on which most americans agree and sometimes profoundly so the only worthy uses of our military forces , the respondents say , are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies the rest are not helping the united nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties democrats think it is appropriate and republicans soundly disagree \( i ve presented the percentages separately on this line for democrats and republicans \) but lest you think the nation isn t polarized on foreign policy , consider this on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties on the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp , 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve on average , women s support for the use of force is less strong than men s , by about 10 points with women making up the larger share \( 60 percent \) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes , it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement and although there is no gender divide on whether romney says what he believes , there is a gender difference on whether obama is sincere women are 11 points more likely , on average , to think obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about obama relative to romney is an associate professor of political science and communication studies at ucla president obama said , referring to osama bin laden s killing , if we had asked pakistan permission , we would not have gotten him but if pakistan can t be trusted , the president owes the american people an explanation of how he d deal with a nucleararmed impoverished country over the next four years mr romney seems committed to changing pakistani behavior and although he claims he wouldn t divorce pakistan , mr romney s answer showed that he would downgrade pakistan s status as an american ally demanding policy changes from pakistan in return for american support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the united states might successfully deploy to that end the discussion over afghanistan and pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing islamist extremism mr obama defines success against al qaeda very narrowly , glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the afghanistanpakistan region after the withdrawal of american combat forces in 2014 mr obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge killing bin laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the united states and its allies safe from terrorists al qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of yemen , afghanistan and pakistan has not been completely disrupted little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young muslims into terrorist training camps and the withdrawal from iraq and afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that america simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from muslim regions at very little cost in afghanistan , the taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table it is unrealistic to assume that a professional afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame the taliban s ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy the united states could have withdrawn from afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn t announced a deadline for its withdrawal that deadline also took away any incentive for pakistan s military to work with the united states against the taliban , thinking that it could instead sit the americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a postamerican afghanistan the obama administration didn t succeed in persuading or coercing pakistan into acting against the taliban , and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few proamerican elements in pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists it s fine to say , we do not want or like war , but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy , such as al qaeda and its affiliates , are wars of necessity such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war s aims and its strategy husain haqqani served as pakistan s ambassador to the united states from 2008 to 2011 and is a professor of international relations at boston university and a senior fellow at the hudson institute pity poor egypt after suffering through 30 years of the mubarak kleptocracy , the people of egypt rose up , deposed the dictator and elected a new president , mohammed morsi to be sure , the victory of morsi and the muslim brotherhood may not have been the first choice of american policy makers , but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes the new egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the mubarak regime , which was reliable , but at the expense of human rights , economic development , transparency and hope for the egyptian people yet morsi promptly reaffirmed what president obama called in tonight s debate a red line , the peace treaty with israel , which has permitted israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region none of these developments appear to satisfy mitt romney , who characterized egypt as part of the chaos and extremism of syria and mali while hailing the progress in libya as wonderful , he warns that next door is egypt , where the election of a muslim brotherhood president constitutes a reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region romney said he would not have supported retaining mubarak , but he views the outcome of a free election indeed , a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution as a failure of the arab spring it is way too early to declare egypt a success it is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for 60 years it is a country of 80 million people , many of whom live in terrible poverty it exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them its coptic christian minority is uneasy , to say the least the business community has largely remained on the sidelines and many in its new government have spent the last 30 years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state but romney s suggestion that the election of a muslim brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of muslim ruling parties with jihadists and terrorists syria and iraq were baathist governments , nominally socialist secular states the assad clan and saddam hussein did not kill in the name of jihad prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in turkey governs as a moderate islamist , sharing some ideological roots with the muslim brotherhood rejected for membership in the european union , turkey under erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral european nations and assumed a leadership role in the region to be sure , hamas also has roots in the muslim brotherhood whether egypt moves toward the turkish model or the hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of american policy the romney approach lumping egypt with mali , baathists with islamists , the muslim brotherhood with jihadists retains the ahistorical arrogance of the bush years we need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence and we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism mitt romney s apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past eric l lewis is a partner at lewis baach pllc in washington listening to tonight s debate , one would be hardpressed to identify a clear difference between what president obama and mitt romney would do in dealing with iran both made it clear that prevention , not containment , of a nucleararmed iran is their objective the president was particularly blunt , saying that as long as he is president , iran will not become a nucleararmed state while mr romney made it clear that america could not accept iran becoming nuclearweaponscapable , the president went further and said that we could not allow iran to develop a breakout capacity by this he meant that america could not allow iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium , the level of enrichment , and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either mr obama or mr romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war both were clear that the use of force is the last resort both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter iranian behavior the president took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the iranian economy mr romney agreed on their effect , and the need to do more we can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013 to be sure , mr romney went further in one respect he is prepared to indict the president of iran under the genocide convention and treat iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid south africa were treated both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible my expectation is that regardless of who is elected , there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability i say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails i don t see either mr obama or mr romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first the bottom line their basic approach to iran seems very similar but the president , having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years , is more equipped to move more quickly on iran than mr romney if elected , mr romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options president obama has already done that dennis ross , a former state department and national security council official , was a special assistant to president obama for the middle east and south asia from 2009 to 2011 he is now a counselor at the washington institute for near east policy on syria , mitt romney won but only on points , certainly not with a knockout blow mr romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision he framed the civil war in syria as an opportunity , a chance to strike at iran syria , mr romney said , is iran s only ally in the arab world , stressing the role the regime of bashar alassad plays as iran s base for extending its influence in the eastern mediterranean toppling mr assad , mr romney correctly explained , would deal a blow to hezbollah and roll back iranian influence throughout the region by contrast , president obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken , but failed to place them in a wider context he did not even mention iran in the course of the discussion syria represents a very rare thing in international politics a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment at least 30 , 000 have died , and millions have been made refugees as the greatest power in the middle east , the united states is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity yet in fact , the obama administration has been relatively passive , as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan of turkey recently complained right now , mr erdogan said , there are certain things being expected from the united states , but america has not yet catered to those expectations in the debate tonight , mr romney struck a similar note , stressing that america should be playing the leadership role but mr romney did not define a clear path forward the president claimed that romney doesn t have different ideas , and that s because we re doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate , syrian leadership there was truth in the statement at a moment when there is no appetite among americans for a new foreign adventure , mr romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the american military in syria he even rejected the idea of enforcing a nofly zone yet an americanimplemented nofly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the romney strategic vision into a practical reality mr romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in syria , but when it came to specifics , his policy differed little from the president s michael s doran , a senior fellow at the brookings institution , served on the national security council and at the defense department official from 2005 to 2008 many people believe that mitt romney won the first debate because of barack obama s somnambulant performance that overlooked romney s deft pivot to the center , which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation this is consistent with a truism in political science in an election , candidates try to target the median voter in presidential politics , candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party s ideological base , but in general elections , they target the moderates , because those are the voters decide the election romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate after a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric , the governor sounded different tonight he argued that we can t kill our way out of the problems in the middle east he averred that we want a peaceful planet he explicitly stated he didn t want to get involved militarily in syria romney said the sanctions in iran were working he praised the president on numerous fronts afghanistan and pakistan in particular he even talked about china as a partner before bashing its trade policies to be fair , the governor has said some of this before , but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace , not brute force in doing all this , romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas romney s sotto voce message was that he would not be a hotheaded , triggerhappy cowboy like the last republican president who shall not be named for undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars , this could be very soothing indeed will it work \? one difference between this debate and the one in denver is that president obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time the president was ready , willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in romney s previous statements and claims he accused romney of being all over the map on numerous issues he also ridiculed romney s proposed naval buildup , pointing out that foreign policy wasn t a game of battleship it seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments , as opposed to simply treading water on the economy for the past month , mitt romney had been chipping away at obama s foreign policy record tonight he seemed to want to emulate it his clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander in chief that way , they can ignore obama s critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years we ll find out over the next few days if he succeeded daniel w drezner is a professor of international politics at tufts and blogs at foreign policy magazine the muchheralded foreign policy debate wasn t really a debate , as barack obama and mitt romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues and it was barely about foreign policy , as education reform \( we all love teachers \) , detroit , nation building at home , and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the middle east , north africa , afghanistan and pakistan , and china mr romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme america must promote principles of peace mr obama looked and sounded every inch the commander in chief but the lasting impression of the debate , certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world , is just how narrowly americans define foreign policy neither candidate mentioned nato indeed , neither candidate mentioned the european union or the eurozzone crisis , other than mr romney s dire predictions that the united states will soon be greece unless he is elected moving east , the candidates barely mentioned a single country in east asia other than china there was only the briefest reference to japan \( our closest ally in asia \) by the moderator and a single mention of north korea \( another very dangerous nuclear power \) indonesia , the largest muslim country in the world , didn t come up for that matter , there was no reference to india \( a mere billion people \) this silence is all the more striking given mr obama s reference at the end of the debate to his administration s purported pivot to asia , a pivot that was supposed to be away from the middle east yet when mr obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the united states , he said terrorist networks mr romney said a nuclear iran beyond individual countries , consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world neither candidate ever uttered the word climate or drug violence or poverty , disease , food , water , or even energy this really wasn t a debate about foreign policy or world affairs it was the projection of the american electoral map onto the globe all discussion of israel and islam was targeted at florida all discussion of china was targeted at ohio from a real foreign policy perspective , a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems , we can only hope the rest of the world wasn t listening annemarie slaughter , a professor of politics and international affairs at princeton , was director of policy planning at the state department from 2009 to 2011 tonight s debate was expected to reveal the candidates thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the american foreign policy however , this debate offered very little syria is a case in point both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards syria they both want to make friends with the syrian people , but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to israel mitt romney was simply advocating president obama s foreign policy in syria , which is inaction there are simply no meaningful differences both want to let the syrian people determine their own fate , which so far has been a very bloody and dark one power comes with responsibility , and the syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world on both twitter and facebook , syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates they saw america s power implemented in libya and wanted the same treatment however , it seems that both mr romney and mr obama have washed their hands of the syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat the policy of inaction in syria , which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins , has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented , and also to the rise of islamists because of inaction in syria , the united states is losing the opportunity to lead america s inaction in syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries , such as turkey , jordan , and last but not least lebanon , where a car bomb killed a senior lebanese security official , gen wissam alhassan , and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country more inaction will mean more sectarian violence , not only in syria , but throughout the region the united states and its allies surely do not wish to see that for the syrian people , intervention never meant boots on the ground they have specifically asked for safe havens and antiaircraft missiles , not more that s all they need to defeat the assad regime both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail the syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the united states to offer instead , all they heard was , we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won t use it against us without trust , there can be no friendship the only difference between the two was that romney seemed to see the middle east as one big space of terror he repeatedly referred to the developments in the past two years in the region as chaos and tumult this is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives , and still are , in order to topple their dictators that s also a bad way to make friends the syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins , they are on their own , and that the big winner of this debate is bashar alassad is the editor of now lebanon if what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight , you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by barack obama s rather robotic insistence on nation building here at home if you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration \( the plan that would likely cut 500 billion from the defense budget in january \) , the president s blithe assertion that it won t happen no proof , no policy , just i m barack obama and i approve this message may not have convinced you on the other hand , mitt romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that by the end of this decade , americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt than they will on national security mr romney recycled the oftused sentiment that the president s request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917 mr obama quoted mr romney s talking points back to him , citing the actual year 1916 and ridiculed mr romney s failure to understand that the military doesn t fight with bayonets and horses anymore but the reality is that mr obama s request is for a navy unseen since 1916 and for an air force little improved from the one our fathers knew and for a tanker fleet so ancient , all operations are analog and for a bomber fleet conceived during the carter years in that context , cute horse comments are a lame comeback if your aim is to win in virginia , it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet \( note to the obama team \) defense workers in ohio and virginia are game for more investment if you want to score points on national defense , it s probably best not to be snide \( though hipsters love it \) truth be told , many who believe in america s national mission are comfortable with the peace through strength message mr romney sought to convey fundamentally , the question is less about the score that twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession rather , it s about who sends a message of american resolve , belief in american power , and commitment to american investment in defense if that s what matters to you be you american voter , adversary , or terrorist then it s likely that mr romney s message , on principle and politics , hit home a little harder than mr obama s and that , folks , is what the debates are all about danielle pletka is the vice president for foreign and defense studies at the american enterprise institute when mitt romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of mali a reference obscure to almost every viewer , except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our libyan intervention i had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time i thought , hey , he s talking to me that sense persisted for much of the night as a conservative who s grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn t turn up in iraq , i ve been critical of romney throughout this campaign for trying to outhawk president obama at every turn , and for trying to sell a warweary public on the largely implausible idea that obama is a weakkneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas but tonight , given the chance to throw that argument in the president s face , the republican nominee mostly softpedaled it , shying away from sharp contrasts , emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace romney s turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on afghanistan , where he basically endorsed the white house s plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats but the same differenceblurring thread ran through almost all his answers yes , he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on obama s supposed apology tour in the middle east , but otherwise this debate felt like a 90minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out strip away the no apologies rhetoric , and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest this isn t necessarily a good thing for the country , which probably deserves a more robust debate over american strategy than the one we just watched and by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president s , romney almost guaranteed that obama would win the debate on points which the president pretty clearly did , deploying the advantages of incumbency \( not to mention the execution of a certain al qaeda leader \) effectively in an arena where americans are still inclined to trust him the question is what the audience was looking for if they were looking for evidence that a romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas , then they probably came away disappointed , and obama s win will boost him in the polls but if they were just looking \( as i ll admit that i was looking \) to be reassured that romney is something other than a wildeyed warmonger , then the republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat ross douthat is an oped columnist mitt romney and barack obama had some sharp rhetorical exchanges , but on substance there were few discernible differences if mr obama was expecting mr romney to distinguish himself by supporting military policies that would be unpopular with americans \( whether in syria , iraq , afghanistan or iran \) , he was probably disappointed mr romney went out of his way to argue that killing bad guys would not be enough to fight radical forces economic development , education and civil society are key ingredients to future stability mr obama couldn t agree more mr obama said his aim was to get iran to stop its nuclear program , while mr romney spoke about preventing a nuclearcapable iran but neither candidate defined the point in iran s nuclear enrichment that would trigger military action both agreed that military action would be the last resort and mr romney even credited mr obama for applying crippling sanctions , criticizing him only for not doing it earlier \( which of course mr obama denied \) and suggesting that he would find ways to strengthen them but on the iran file , a consequential distinction emerged for mr obama , the intent of crippling sanctions is to bring iran to the negotiating table to agree to give up its nuclear program and abide by united nations resolutions , arguing that there s a deal to be had in contrast , mr romney called for diplomatic isolation of iran , arguing that iran s diplomats should be treated like pariahs around the world diplomatic pressure , as mr romney advocates , is not the same as negotiations the dilemma is how sanctions and pressure would dissuade iran s leaders from pursuing their nuclear program \( as mr romney recommended \) if a president romney wouldn t agree to sit down and talk with them mr obama did not appear to pick up on this disconnect , most likely because he wanted to emphasize the tough aspects of his iran policy and not the offramp strategy that will inevitably involve bilateral negotiations with iran but if a romney administration were to pursue a policy shunning diplomacy , it is hard to see how the current sanctions policies , and more covert actions like sabotage , would lead to a resolution the more likely scenario if diplomacy is rejected or fails is continued escalation and potentially war dalia dassa kaye is director of the center for middle east public policy at the rand corporation tonight both presidential candidates acknowledged the centrality of asia to america s interests the obama administration offers its asia pivot as a foreign policy success story mitt romney wants a bigger navy to keep america s commitments in the region credible and robust according to secretary of defense leon panetta , 60 percent of the navy s warships will be located in the pacific by 2020 not once tonight did anyone talk about what those ships are going to do when they get there tonight s foreign policy debate allotted less than 15 of its 90 minutes to asia , a region with the world s fastest economic growth rates and over half of its population the only country receiving more than a passing mention was china , and even china was discussed only in economic terms how to handle the security relationship between the two countries with the world s largest military budgets went unmentioned , as did the united states broader strategy in a region critical to american security interests , where the next president will have to make a series of tough choices and may well face multiple foreign policy crises there was no discussion of american policy on the korean peninsula , where 28 , 500 american forces stand watch in a war that has not ended , and where our allies this weekend evacuated residents along the dmz after north korea threatened to retaliate against an activist group s balloon launch with artillery fire there was no discussion of the recently announced plan to rotate more american planes , ships , and personnel through the philippines , which in april sailed an americanmade cutter into confrontation with china in disputed waters , and then suggested that america was obligated to assist in that confrontation under the terms of a 1951 mutual defense treaty there was no discussion of taiwan , which asked the united states for over 60 new f16 fighters and last year got a 58 billion upgrade to its old ones instead a decision that the official chinese press called a despicable breach of faith or of the american airsea battle concept , generally perceived to be a template for future conflict with china there was no discussion of whether america s commitment to those who call for democracy and human rights a commitment both candidates affirmed can or should extend past tunisia and tahrir to tibet , where over 50 people have set themselves on fire without producing the political change that a single selfimmolation sparked in the arab world today the world s attention is riveted on crises in the middle east tomorrow s flash points lie in asia unfortunately , tonight s debate did little to clarify how either candidate would handle a 3 am phone call that comes not from benghazi , but from beijing sheena chestnut greitens is a doctoral candidate in government at harvard and a fellow at the united states institute of peace and at the miller center , university of virginia monday s debate in boca raton offered another venue for president obama and mitt romney to compete over who can appear closer to israel mr obama trumpeted his administration s unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation with israel , while mr romney advertised his close relationship with prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel mr obama contrasted mr romney s decision to use his recent trip to israel to take donors and attend fundraisers with the president s own visits to israel s holocaust memorial and the town of sderot , which had experienced missiles raining down from hamas mr romney countered by asserting that the president had generated turmoil with israel , noting that 38 democratic senators had signed a letter urging him to repair the damage mr romney also repeated his earlier criticism of the president having reportedly stated that there should be daylight between the united states and israel when negotiating a settlement between israel and the palestinians yet by definition , some distance must exist between a mediator and the parties to a negotiation if that mediator is to live up to its claim of being an honest broker if wishing to eliminate any daylight between america and one party to the conflict is mr romney s desire , it is one at odds with his professed goal to help israelis and palestinians reach a peace agreement a goal he did not seem to possess when , at a closeddoor fundraiser in florida earlier this year , he said the palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace , and , the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish mr romney went on you hope for some degree of stability , but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately , somehow , something will happen and resolve it kicking the ball down the field while professing an interest in an israelipalestinian settlement is precisely what president obama has been doing for the last several years the policy of the next administration , whether mr romney s first or mr obama s second , will be to uphold this status quo supporting an unelected palestinian prime minister and a palestinian president whose term long ago expired continuing to prevent the exercise of power by the victors in the last palestinian national election negotiating with a set of unelected plo leaders who cannot credibly claim to represent most palestinians prioritizing the funding of palestinian security forces who arrest their political opponents and prevent peaceful protests against israeli settlements and military installations and meekly criticizing israel s expanding settlement construction while exercising no leverage in order to thwart it these policies will eventually backfire , as they have in other parts of the region where the united states stood against popular aspirations and supported authoritarian regimes but on these issues , there is precious little daylight between the candidates nathan thrall is a jerusalembased middle east analyst with the international crisis group at least game 7 of the national league championship series was a blowout but if you chose to watch tonight s debate instead of baseball hoping , like many of us , for clarity on the next four years of american foreign policy you were sorely disappointed what did we hear \? not a lot not a single mention of looming cyberthreats , despite the fact that secretary of defense leon panetta recently sounded an alarm about america s vulnerability to a possible cyber pearl harbor no mention of yemen and the growing influence of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , which many consider the most significant terrorist threat in the world nor was there any discussion of guant namo or the future of american detention operations , leaving major questions unanswered about how the united states would handle captured terrorists in the future how would each candidate face the considerable challenges of the afghanistan transition like propping up the afghan security forces , trying to negotiate a settlement with the taliban , or forestalling a fullscale civil war after american and nato forces depart \? apparently , it s not a concern for mr romney , it was simple as saying the afghans will be ready by the end of 2014 full stop while president obama acknowledged in passing that the transition in afghanistan has to take place in a responsible fashion , he quickly changed course and began talking about veterans and jobs in america both are critical issues , to be sure but neither is particularly helpful for those wondering if thousands of american lives lost and billions of dollars spent in afghanistan will be wasted by a poorly executed transition those concerned with the future of american engagement in the middle east were likewise frustrated regarding the ongoing threat of extremism in the arab world , mr romney simply suggested a shopping list of grand objectives economic development , better education , gender equality and rule of law a plan that sounds an awful lot like nation building what remained entirely unclear is how mr romney would actually make progress on any of these fronts , particularly in countries of critical concern meanwhile , mr obama pointed out that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily and quickly mentioned religious minorities and women and encouraging economic development before neatly sidestepping to nation building here at home ultimately , tonight s debate didn t change many \( any \? \) voters opinions about either candidate and it left national security wonks i know banging their heads against the table , still wondering how the election will affect america s foreign policies in the years ahead but at least we re now certain that the military has fewer bayonets than it did in 1916 marisa l porges , a former counterterrorism adviser in the departments of defense and treasury , is a fellow at the belfer center for science and

too big to hedge that may be the lesson of the debacle at jpmorgan chase and if regulators take the lesson to heart , they could close a gaping loophole in the volcker rule , which is supposed to ban speculative trading by banks that take insured deposits when he disclosed a 2 billion trading loss last week , jamie dimon , the chief executive of jpmorgan , said the trades were intended to hedge the firm s credit exposure that is , reduce the risk of investments it had made this week , speaking to shareholders , he modified that , saying what this hedge morphed into violates our own principles we still do n't know exactly what the trades were , other than that they were complicated , very large and apparently difficult to unwind it appears the loss is growing rapidly a former top

big banks are just too big to be able to safely hedge huge investment positions the jpmorgan debacle is reminiscent in some ways of the first big disaster of the supposedly sophisticated era of derivatives , that of the long term capital management hedge fund in 1998 the trades that firm did were supposed to be all but riskfree , since they were simply bets that longterm relationships in prices of various securities would hold , even if there were temporary gyrations that created opportunities for traders who understood the relationships it helps to understand what was in many ways the simplest and seemingly among the surest trades that got long term capital into trouble it was a bet that yields on the newly issued 30year treasury bond would converge with those of the 30year bond issued three months earlier when the bonds' interest rates diverged , for what were surely temporary market reasons , the obvious trade was to buy the higheryielding treasury and short the loweryielding one when they came together , that strategy would produce a certain but small profit but the profit would be large if the fund borrowed a lot of money to take a large position what happened then was that so many people put on the trade that even the large and liquid market in treasury securities was strained the divergence grew larger if you could be sure the yields would eventually converge , the obvious course was to increase your bet , which is what long term did in the long run , that trade would have worked but the margin calls mounted and it ran out of capital it seems likely that something similar if far more complicated happened at jpmorgan at first , when prices diverged in unexpected ways , jpmorgan raised its bet managers accepted assurances that the market had to turn around but it did not perhaps market rumors spread about the risks the bank was taking , and others sought to take advantage of it , increasing the divergences eventually , jpmorgan blinked immediately after the losses were disclosed , officials of the comptroller of the currency , jpmorgan s principal regulator , assured a republican senator that all was fine they were adamant that hedges like these are there to make the bank safer , senator bob corker of tennessee told my colleague , ben protess the officials were said to have opined that the volcker rule , whose details are still being debated by regulators , would not have prohibited the trade it appears that the unnamed officials were right about the rule , but very wrong about the wisdom of the trading as proposed by a panel of regulators , the volcker rule contains two provisions that are quite reasonable on their own , but that together can create a toxic mix the first provision , which is in the doddfrank law , specifies that banks can maintain investment portfolios the second says it is acceptable to trade securities for the purpose of hedging other holdings , even if it would not be ok to buy the same security as a speculative investment for market makers , who may buy unwanted securities that customers want to sell , hedging may be wise and prudent but it will also be short term , until the bank trades out of whatever position it took on in the course of making the market but if banks hedge longterm investments , as jpmorgan evidently did , the hedge is also likely to be long term it will consist of buying something that , in normal times , should move in the opposite direction of their investment the result is that they will be making convergence trades that are indistinguishable from what long term capital management did given the size of the big banks , they will have to do so in huge volumes that can come back to haunt them if markets move the wrong way this could have been much worse , said the former risk manager imagine what would have happened if three big banks had pursued the same strategy , either because they figured out how jpmorgan was making money or because they thought it up on their own then the losses would not have been three times as great , he said , but maybe 10 times that is because the market used to hedge the position would become completely illiquid , with opportunistic hedge funds trading against the big banks and causing the divergence to grow larger than ever before
on tuesday richard grenell , an openly gay spokesman for the romney campaign , resigned or , more accurately , was hounded out of town by social conservatives and the religious right isn t taking this victory sitting down bryan fischer of the american family association , who previously said that hiring mr grenell was like telling the profamily community to drop dead , gleefully relayed the news on his radio broadcast tuesday  especially noteworthy is how mr fischer explained the big picture to his audience he didn t just claim responsibility for the huge win he claimed to have taught mitt romney a lesson mitt romney has been forced to say , look , i overstepped my bounds here i went outside the parameters here i went off the reservation with this hire the profamily community has called me back to the table here called me back inside the borders of the reservation that s actually a pretty stunning boast mr fischer s asserting that the profamily community not mr romney , not his advisers , not the republican national committee , and certainly not the electorate at large , is setting the parameters of the campaign mr romney can t just bring whoever he wants into the gop s big tent he has to ask permission first if i were mr romney , i d be none too pleased i don t think his experience at bain prepared him to cede so much responsibility to outside interest groups
san francisco by my calculation , mark zuckerberg , facebook s founder and chief executive , owes me about 50 without me , and the other 844 , 999 , 999 people poking , liking and sharing on the site , facebook would look like a scene from the postapocalyptic movie the day after tomorrow bleak , desolate and really quite sad \( or myspace , if that is easier to imagine \) facebook surely would never be valued at anything close to 100 billion , which it very well could be in its coming initial public offering in the company s s1 filing , submitted to the securities and exchange commission this week , facebook boasts about its statistics annually , people like one trillion things 91 billion photos are uploaded half a billion people use facebook on mobile phones and hundreds of millions are annoyingly poked so all this leaves me with a question where s my cut \? i helped build this thing , too facebook laid the foundation of the house and put in the plumbing , but we put up the walls , picked out the furniture , painted and hung photos , and invited everyone over for dinner parties so why am i asking for money from facebook and not google \? although there have been hundreds of technologyrelated ipo s over the last decade , facebook is the first real socialmedia public offering , where the content on the site is entirely created by its users \( the closest , linkedin , had additional business models , including premium payment subscriptions \) the idea that a business benefits from social interaction is not so strange or new a lot of cafes and small restaurants will let people hang out because they attract other people , said yannis m ioannides , a professor of economics at tufts university what is unusual and new is that facebook takes access to information about these people to make its business more powerful he added the proprietor of a cafe does n't use personal information about me and my friends to make money mr ioannides suggests that facebook and other social web sites could create a twoway financial street facebook , for example , could pay the people who create content on the site the company could then make money by matching the content with advertising , as it does now as an alternative for more private individuals , people could pay to use facebook if it promised not to sift through their personal information this way , everyone wins i for one would feel more comfortable with facebook looking through my phonebook , wallet and underwear drawer if i knew i was going to get paid for it jaron lanier , one of the deepest thinkers on the impacts of technology on society and an innovator in residence at the annenberg school at the university of southern california , worries about companies like facebook and twitter not paying their users while the people lucky enough to work for them become rich from free usergenerated content mr lanier says that as more money flows to those who build these networks , society distorts and divides those without the skills needed in this new economy other than to tweet and post pictures can fall further behind economically the value comes from the people none of it is selfcreated , mr lanier said in an interview he warns that if society does n't devise economic solutions to social networks , there could be serious social blowback sure , 50 might not seem like a lot of money right now , but if facebook continues to grow as it has in the past , its 4 billion in annual revenue could be in the tens of billions of dollars in a few years if that happens , i should be expecting a dividend so , mr zuckerberg , feel free to message me on facebook , and i 'll give you my address so you can send me a check unless , as i suspect , you already know where i live this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
istanbul emad addin alrashid , a former assistant dean at the islamic law college of , opened his macbook air laptop and flipped through spreadsheets detailing the unmet needs of seemingly every besieged neighborhood across  from his spare office in a fifthfloor walkup on a drab istanbul street , mr rashid spends eight hours a day calling into syria , mostly to lobby hundreds of his former theology students to join his new syria national movement , patiently building a network that he hopes will one day become the islamist movement s power base while opposition groups are mostly concentrating on ending the brutish rule of president , they are also positioning themselves for the longerterm question of who will rule in a postassad era for that , they know from watching what happened in other arab countries like tunisia and egypt that they need a good ground game the syrian people do n't want to hear about politics right now , they want to focus on toppling the regime , said mr rashid , 47 , an amiable man with a neatly trimmed , saltandpepper beard but you have to be present politically before the system falls a broad spectrum of political organizations outside the country are jockeying for position , anticipating a new , democratic government in syria for the first time since a 1963 military coup established the supremacy of the baath party and emasculated the rest the jockeying has alienated many syrians , particularly those inside , who complain that members of the fractious opposition exile group , the syrian national council , are fixated more on grabbing appointments that they can leverage into domestic influence later than on forging the unity needed to defeat the government the wrestling continues nonetheless it remains unclear which group , if any , will emerge the dominant player given the triumphant sweep of islamist parties across north africa , syria s islamist leaders itch with anticipation that this is their moment , too the is the dominant actor , but two other islamist organizations , the national action group and mr rashid s syria national movement , are vying for influence all are based abroad the syrian branch of the brotherhood faces obstacles that its counterpart in egypt , for one , never encountered , while technically illegal , was tolerated by the government of hosni mubarak in syria , by contrast , the brotherhood has almost no presence , thanks to a 1980 law stipulating the death penalty for membership in the group as well as long years of bloody repression most of its current leaders were young men when they fled the country 30 years ago after the government of hafez alassad , the president s father , massacred at least 10 , 000 people in the central city of hama we do n't have an organization , but we have a constituency , said ali sadreddin albayanouni , the head of the syrian brotherhood from 1996 to 2010 its impact may be further diluted by internal divisions rivalry within the muslim brotherhood has long pitted its more tolerant aleppo branch against the more conservative hama branch exile widened those differences because many aleppans went to the west , while the hamawis moved to the persian gulf none of this has stopped the group from trying to build a cohesive network mr bayanouni , the former leader , estimated the brotherhood sent between 1 million to 2 million monthly into syria for humanitarian needs abu anas , a 45yearold mosque imam in a small village between hama and homs , said senior brotherhood figures called from abroad to ask him to resurrect a network that his father once led they want me to rebuild the muslim brotherhood s group through a charity network by helping poor families , jailed activists and by paying for medical aid , he said , estimating that the organization spent millions of dollars in his region alone in the last year , adding if we could present good services and policies to all syrians , we will be elected all the islamist groups agree this is not the time for pushing divisive social issues like banning alcohol or veiling women , and they acknowledge that internal squabbling only serves mr assad s interests the longer and more militarized the fight , they and others worry , the greater chance that radical jihadists will become the face and power of the resistance the opposition has a plan to avoid that , said obeida nahas , 36 , a marketing executive and founding member of both the syrian national council and the national action group he described it as the four ds demonstrations , defense , defections and diplomacy yet , with chances of success murky , so is the future direction of syrian politics mr nahas and his allies say they are religious conservatives rather than islamists , not unlike turkey s governing party , which they call an inspiration but not a model the age of ideology is dead , mr nahas said in an interview in the lobby of a modest istanbul hotel instead , he said , the generation that fomented the arab spring wants a limited , nonideological state that treats all its citizens equally we are trying to find common ground , something that would create a national identity that would include all political groups , mr nahas said mr nahas did not sound terribly distant from mr rashid , who described wanting to create a country for muslims , instead of a muslim country , implying that the former is more welcoming of syria s sectarian patchwork political islam ruins the nature of religion , he said religion becomes a political card but secular syrian politicians mocked their professed differences as blowing smoke many syrians , they said , blame the brotherhood in tandem with the government for the violence that rocked the country starting in 1979 , after a brotherhood offshoot massacred military cadets from the same alawite sect as the assad family the bloodshed left a legacy of mistrust and bitterness that lingers to this day the muslim brotherhood monopolizes everything the money , the weapons , the snc , said kamal lebwany , a dissident physician released last november from nearly a decade in jail in syria he quit the syrian national council in february , labeling it a stalkinghorse for islamic rule the snc has a liberal peel covering a totalitarian , nondemocratic core , he said , adding that long exile meant the islamists were out of touch even liberals still within the council worry that the islamists are dissembling , not so much divided as playing different roles for different constituencies while waiting to grab power in most arab revolutions , the islamists seemed to accept to remain in the second row , said samir nachar , a member of the syrian national council s executive committee but after the revolution was over , they became its leaders the brotherhood s supporters argue that syria s diversity , with large minorities of alawites , christians and druze , will defeat any effort to impose islamic law they argue as well that democracy is a natural fit because syria has long adhered to the sufi school of islam , which fosters a more individual , ecstatic relationship between a believer and god experts countered that sufism should not be confused with liberalism syrian brotherhood leaders winced when asked about islamist parties dominating postrevolutionary egypt , acknowledging that it hurt their credibility among syrian minorities and some foreign supporters , particularly the united states i wish that they had taken a more inclusive stance , said molham aldrobi , 48 , who serves on the executive boards of both the syrian national council and the brotherhood he and others cited the brotherhood s accommodating record in parliament before 1963 as their future blueprint brotherhood leaders said that they had spoken with officials from the obama administration in the past year , but that washington remained wary about who might triumph in syria , including the radical jihadis but analysts say that fears of an organized jihadi network are overblown , for now at least there is a tremendous amount of rhetorical smoke , said brian fishman , an expert on extremist islam at the new america foundation in washington but it is hard to figure out their strength some experts say that washington is selling the syrian brotherhood short as well even a cursory analysis should lead them to the realization that the syrian brotherhood is the most closely aligned with their objectives in the region , said shadi hamid of the brookings doha center in qatar it is as antiiran and antihezbollah as you can get for an islamist movement ultimately , the battle for syria s future boils down to identity , whether syrian society is by nature religious or secular , and how either identity might be represented by whatever replaces the stifling baath party will syria s diversity tear it apart , or can a pluralistic , democratic nation that respects equal rights emerge from its jumble of rival religious sects , ethnic groups and ageold tribes \? it is plausible that the syrian muslim brotherhood will come to the fore , said cengiz candar , an eminent turkish analyst of arab affairs but it is too early to deduce anything significant they are in an incubation period who knows who will be around eventually \?

whatever your perspective on how likely mitt romney was to lose the republican nomination race before tuesday evening , it should be acknowledged that he had about the worst results conceivable in minnesota , a state that mr romney carried easily in 2008 , he has so far failed to win a single county and got just 17 percent of the vote that put him 27 points behind rick santorum , and 10 points behind ron paul , who finished second missouri is a less important result since its beauty contest primary did not count for delegate selection and since turnout was understandably low there but mr romney lost all 114 counties in missouri and the state as a whole by 30 points , far more than polls projected then there was colorado , a state that has reasonably similar demographics to nevada , which mr romney carried easily on saturday colorado has somewhat fewer mormon voters than nevada , which hurts mr romney but it has somewhat more wealthy ones , which favors him the betting market intrade gave mr romney about a 97 percent chance of winning colorado entering the evening but he lost the state by five points to mr santorum what s more , the victor in all three states was mr santorum , who is probably much more dangerous to mr romney than newt gingrich mr gingrich had an awful evening , finishing a distant third in colorado and last in minnesota but that may only work against mr romney in the end mr romney clearly has a lot of advantages in the nomination race , and mr santorum will need to scale his campaign up to the national level , something he had failed to do successfully after iowa however , i would advise our readers to be good bayesian thinkers and consider how easily wednesday night s evidence fits in to the perspective they had on the race going into tuesday evening after florida , i proposed five paths forward for the republican nomination most of these paths resulted in mr romney s nomination but some implied a much longer and more difficult race , and some put him at a tangible risk of defeat the evidence from tuesday night was much more consistent with those scenarios , and much less so with those in which mr romney wraps up the nomination easily mr romney has had deep problems so far with the republican base , going oneforfour in caucus states where turnout is dominated by highly conservative voters mr romney is zeroforthree so far in the midwest , a region that is often decisive in the general election he had tepid support among major blocks of republican voters like evangelicals and tea party supporters , those voters making under 50 , 000 per year , and those in rural areas instead , much of his support has come from the wealthy areas that charles murray calls super zips few of which are in swing states in the general election meanwhile , polls show that a large number of republicans have tepid enthusiasm for their field and this has been reflected in the turnout so far , which is down about 10 percent from 2008 among republican registrants and identifiers these are not the hallmarks of a race with a dominant candidate nor , even , of a race with a candidate like john kerry , the best of a somewhat weak lot of democrats in 2004 , but one whom the party settled upon fairly quickly instead , this race bears more of a resemblance to something like the 1984 democratic contest or the 1976 republican race there was a favorite in each of those contests walter mondale in 1984 and gerald ford in 1976 and they were ahead in the delegate count more or less from start to finish but both contests progressed through all 50 states and were not that far from going to the convention a few more missteps for mr mondale or mr ford , and the outcome might have been different the most generous interpretation of tuesday night s results is that mr romney s campaign failed to make much of an effort in the contests he did not make many personal appearances in the states , nor did he run a significant amount of advertising and his campaign worked to diminish expectations in the day or two before the voting a practice that can annoy voters who are undecided in the race if they feel as if they are being told their vote doesn t matter why mr romney s campaign made these decisions is hard to say one of the advantages of having a resourcerich campaign , as mr romney does , is precisely that you are able to leave less to chance mr romney would have had the luxury of running commercials in colorado or minnesota , or of establishing a set of field offices in those states instead , his strategy was complacent he gambled and paid the price , as hillary rodham clinton did in the caucus states in 2008 fortunately for mr romney , none of his rivals are in the same ballpark as mrs clinton s opponent , barack obama , as measured by metrics like fundraising , organizational strength or oratorical skill but mr romney is not a strong enough candidate that he can afford more nights as bad as tuesday
in what officials called one of the most sweeping and unusual enforcement actions in the history of horse racing , new york state accused a prominent horse trainer on thursday of illegally drugging horses in 675 harness races over a 28month period in the state the trainer , luis pena , was suspended pending a hearing later this month and faces fines of up to 25 , 000 per violation for administering 14 different drugs , including pain medicine and antiinflammatory drugs , in the hours before races when those drugs cannot be used the investigation , which is continuing , could lead to the recovery of 25 million in prize money won with horses that regulators say were illegally drugged this is one of , if not the most , unique and significant cases undertaken by a racing regulator , simply by the sheer number of violations uncovered , said ron ochyrm , executive director of the new york state racing and wagering board beyond its scope , the enforcement action is noteworthy because the drug violations were not uncovered in postrace laboratory tests as is customary but rather through veterinary records in fact , none of the cases resulted in a positive postrace test because the drug levels were not high enough we 've been looking at ways to ratchet up fines and deal with habitual offenders , and new york may have just given us the answer we have been looking for , said edward j martin , president of racing commissioners international , a trade association for racing regulators even though the allegations involve harness racing , not its higherprofile cousin , thoroughbred racing , they come as the entire horse racing industry is in turmoil over rising calls for tougher regulation of drugs and other safety issues pena , who was second in earnings among trainers nationally in 2011 , said in an interview that he was singled out for two reasons , his success and his ethnicity i 've never had a positive test ever , said pena , who is of mexican heritage i'm the token brown boy who everyone and their mother wants to talk about this is not the first time pena has attracted controversy empire city casino at yonkers raceway once barred him , then readmitted him he came in with his lawyer and really assured us that he was clean and was willing to do whatever he had to do to prove that , said tim rooney jr , the track s general counsel even before thursday s action , pena could not race at three tracks the meadowlands in new jersey and vernon downs and tioga downs in upstate new york he was the meadowlands' leading trainer in 2010 and 2011 , but was barred this year i have zero tolerance , said the tracks' operator , jeffrey gural it s private property i'm running a business gural said he considered pena the rick dutrow of harness racing dutrow , who trained the 2008 winner , , has been cited for nearly 70 violations at 15 tracks in nine states , including for using powerful painkillers on horses he raced he is contesting new york s decision to revoke his racing license pena kept his horses in new jersey and also raced in new york the states jointly reviewed the veterinary records the investigation determined that pena amassed 1 , 719 drug violations in connection with 675 races pena s veterinarian , eric kates , did not return a phone message seeking his comment pena said his monthly veterinary bill was about 25 , 000 for 60 to 100 horses because kates treated pena s horses on private property , regulators said , they did not have authority over him using veterinary records alone to discipline a trainer is unusual it s been something that has n't been common practice , said paul estok , executive vice president for harness tracks of america , a trade association i 've talked to a couple of people i 've known in racing for 50 years , and nobody can remember anything that involved this many violations at one time pena said the charges were partly a result of jealousy i'm the no 1 trainer in the united states , he said it s racism , dude
charlotte , nc , seeking to quell a storm of criticism from republicans and proisrael groups , directed the democratic party on wednesday to amend its platform to restore language declaring jerusalem the israeli capital the change , approved in a voice vote that had to be taken three times because of a chorus of noes in the arena , reinstated the line jerusalem is and will remain the capital of israel in a section that describes mr obama s policy toward the country that sentence was in the 2008 platform , but the democrats removed it this year , saying that they wanted to spotlight other elements of mr obama s policy and that the platform should reflect a sitting president rather than a candidate for office after a day of protests , however , and the prospect of an onslaught of republican attack ads , the president and the democrats abruptly reversed course the chairwoman of the , representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida , said in a statement that the change was made to maintain consistency with the personal views expressed by the president and in the democratic party platform in 2008 a senior administration official emphasized that the president had intervened to bring the platform in line with his own views the president expressed his view in 2008 , and it has n't changed , the official said the party platform has not changed from 2008 and the position of the united states government has n't changed in decades as it relates to israel s capital and peace negotiations delegates also voted to put god back in the platform , amending a section about the government s role in helping people reach their godgiven potential the removal of godgiven had left the platform without any references to god , giving republicans a target to paint the party as out of touch with family values the changes were meant to be a routine bit of business , conducted by the convention s chairman , mayor antonio villaraigosa of los angeles but they turned into a minor spectacle after the hall seemed balanced between yes and no votes , providing an unruly start to an evening meant to showcase attacks on mitt romney by former president bill clinton and others the romney campaign pounced , saying that mitt romney has consistently stated his belief that jerusalem is the capital of israel claiming that mr obama had refused to state his position , andrea saul , a romney spokeswoman , said , now is the time for president obama to state in unequivocal terms whether or not he believes jerusalem is israel s capital the restoration of jerusalem puts the platform , a largely symbolic document , at odds with the official position of the government , which is that the city s status should be determined in a negotiation between israelis and palestinians the american israel public affairs committee , the nation s most powerful proisrael lobbying group , proposed including language about jerusalem s status as the israeli capital in written testimony to the platform drafting committee people close to the group said it was troubled by the omission of jerusalem we welcome reinstatement to the democratic platform of the language reaffirming jerusalem as israel s capital , the group said in a statement after the vote the political status of jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues in any potential peace settlement between the israelis and the , with both the israelis and the palestinian authority asserting that the holy city is their capital among those shouting no on the convention floor was a delegate from washington state , majid albahadli , who said , jerusalem is arab and jewish and christian it cannot be for one country mr bahadli , an iraqiamerican who said he had been in a prisoner of war camp under saddam hussein , said the vote process was undemocratic the drafting committee held two public hearings on the text , a democratic official said , and none of the jewish advocacy groups in attendance , including aipac , proposed inserting language on jerusalem people close to the advocacy groups said that the committee shared only flashes of the language with them the democrats have accused republicans of making israel a political football by painting mr obama as an unreliable partner but it is the democrats who have tripped up on israel at their convention this week on tuesday , ms wasserman schultz got into a dispute with israel s ambassador to the united states , michael b oren , when she told a democratic training group that mr oren had accused republicans of endangering israel by criticizing mr obama s record on it mr oren issued a statement saying i categorically deny that i ever characterized republican policies as harmful to israel bipartisan support is a paramount national interest for israel , and we have great friends on both sides of the aisle
the upheld the seasonlong suspension of coach on monday , and the shorter suspensions of two other team executives , as the league continued to grapple with the bounty scandal that has overshadowed much of the offseason by keeping in place the original suspensions he handed down nearly three weeks ago , commissioner rejected a defense that gregg williams , the former defensive coordinator who oversaw the bounty system , was a rogue coach , as the lawyer for one of the saints officials called him payton s suspension without pay , originally scheduled to begin april 1 , will now start april 16 , meaning the appeal gave him two extra weeks to prepare the saints for the draft and beyond he will not be allowed footballrelated contact with players or team officials during his suspension the eightgame suspension of general manager mickey loomis and the sixgame suspension of the assistant head coach , joe vitt , will begin at the end of the preseason the nfl said in a statement that if everyone cooperated going forward , goodell would consider reducing the financial penalties on payton , loomis and vitt and altering the forfeiture of the saints' secondround draft choice in 2013 to a pick in a lower round if the team has a bad season in 2012 and the 2013 draft pick is high in the second round , the league would consider changing the punishment to several lowerround picks instead the team has also been fined 500 , 000 and will lose a secondround pick in 2012 goodell will consider reinstating payton after the next february loomis and vitt will serve their suspensions and then be considered for reinstatement williams , now the defensive coordinator for the st louis rams , did not appeal his indefinite suspension the saints declined comment on goodell s decision the club and the individuals will be expected to cooperate in any further proceedings and to assist in the development and implementation of programs to instruct players and coaches at all levels on principles of player safety , fair play , and sportsmanship , the nfl said in its statement the conclusion of the discipline process for the saints officials means the team will shortly have to decide on who will be payton s interim replacement while the saints have considered elevating several internal candidates including the offensive coordinator pete carmichael jr and the defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo payton has also discussed the job with his mentor , bill parcells parcells , the former coach of the giants , the new england patriots , the jets and the dallas cowboys , has not coached since 2006 , but he has made clear over the last few weeks that he was giving serious consideration to taking over the saints , in large part because of his relationship with payton parcells played golf with payton and loomis two weeks ago , but said at the time that there were still issues to be resolved and that he was still not sure he would take the job the saints would have to interview at least one minority candidate to be in compliance with the rooney rule as of late last week , the team had not done so while awaiting the outcome of the appeals process when asked monday afternoon if he had any further talks with the saints about the job , parcells replied in a text message , absolutely none whoever replaces payton will take over with less than two weeks until the draft and on the same day that players are allowed to report to the team facility to begin voluntary offseason workouts it is unclear whether quarterback drew brees , the team leader who is unhappy that he has not received a longterm contract and that the team placed the franchise tag on him , will report for those workouts brees s presence will be a critical issue for a team that still is waiting to hear how some players that the nfl said were involved in the bounties will be disciplined the nfl investigation said 22 to 27 players were involved , but the league is expected to discipline only a few of the defensive leaders , among them linebacker jonathan vilma , who , according to the league s investigation , offered 10 , 000 of his own money if a teammate knocked brett favre , then minnesota s quarterback , out of the nfc championship game the players union has hired outside counsel , richard smith of fulbright jaworski , to advise it on the bounty case and to provide representation if criminal charges are brought , although that is extremely unlikely representatives of the union and the league met last week to review the nfl s investigation in the meeting , the league showed the union representatives some of the evidence it gathered , including a powerpoint presentation the saints had that tracked the payforperformance scheme according to a person briefed on the meeting , the union representatives , who included smith , were also told about other pieces of evidence , but were not shown anything or given copies of possible additional evidence the union also did not believe it was shown proof that vilma offered his own money or that the league had firmly established that saints players went into games intending to injure their opponents we did meet with the league , and the information provided to us has not matched up with the leaks and the evidence in the public domain , the union spokesman george atallah said
brad delong does a lot of work meeting a challenge from kantoos , who insists that neither brad or i have done justice to john cochrane s arguments and what brad finds is nothing that makes a bit of sense this indicates , i think , a key problem in these debates people like kantoos or tyler cowen start from the presumption that when people with the right credentials , like cochrane , or jeanclaude trichet , or robert lucas make strong statements , that they must have a defensible model behind their assertions and so if someone like me or brad says that there is no such defensible model , we must be engaged in a rant , treating these people unfairly but sometimes people with impressive credentials do talk complete nonsense and on fiscal policy in the lesser depression , that has been more the rule than the exception so what purports to be a demand for fairminded argument ends up , in practice , being a demand that we pretend to find a coherent position where none exists , that we basically invent a highminded debate out of thin air i understand that many people find the notion of a world in which nobel laureates and ecb presidents declare that 2 2 5 very unappealing , and that they wish we lived in a different and better world but we don t and it s not my job to create the illusion that we do update i realized that i also wanted to say something in response to the concern trolling , the if you were more moderate you d have more influence stuff again , this amounts to wishing that we lived in a different world first , there is no such thing in modern america as a pundit respected by both sides second , there are people writing about economic issues who are a lot less confrontational than i am how often do you hear about them \? this is not a game , and it is also not a dinner party you have to be clear and forceful to get heard at all

almost no matter the place or the year , whenever analysts and arms researchers scrutinize infantry weapons circulating through a conflict , they encounter predictable finds time and again , the same items turn up ak assault rifles , pk machine guns , rpg7 shoulderfired antiarmor weapons , and , depending on the region , a smattering of m16 variants , fabrique nationale and heckler koch weapons , and boltaction or leveraction rifles from yesteryear there are oddities , including homemade jobs often there are also stray vestigial arms from previous wars in the same region or from particular arms transfers to a government on the same soil but most of these are outliers usually a researcher can write up a list of likely candidates , then check them off while working the beat and then there are the surprises , like the weapon in the photograph above what are you looking at \? this weapon , formerly in local afghan hands , is held by task force bobcat , an infantry unit in the first armored division at combat outpost sayed abad in afghanistan s wardak province a previous unit confiscated it some time ago , and it has been passed to successive american military tenants rotating through it caught the eye of the task force s assistant intelligence officer , first lt corey young , who emailed photographs of it to us this summer with a note indicating that this weapon is chambered for 762 39millimeter cartridges the standard ammunition of the kalashnikov assaultrifle line lieutenant young wanted to know what it is he knew one thing for sure it s not a kalashnikov so what is it \? let s look past that question for a moment , as a precise identification will require substantial explanation instead , take note of a few practical and stylistic points , as these are clues to this weapon s lineage and say something about its previous owner s choices , as well as about the nature and the effects of the seemingly perennial demand in afghanistan for infantry arms the final point of this post so , then , a deconstruction as for this weapon s practical points for a guerrilla fighter in the afghan war , its minimal barrel length and short sliding stock make it very concealable , in the manner of the weapon at the bottom of this post \( concealment has been an important consideration for an afghan carrying a weapon in recent years , as the western forces rules of engagement typically require restraint against suspected foes unless a weapon is clearly seen \) lieutenant young s email also noted that this weapon s magazine well accepts the familiar magazines of the original kalashnikov , also making this firearm a practical choice in afghanistan , where such magazines and the associated cartridges are abundant because of its compatibility with the available supply , this is a weapon that could readily be kept fed perhaps it is no wonder , then , that whatever this weapon is , it has been touched up and was apparently looked after by its previous owner the hand guard has been painted in olive drab , a gesture toward camouflage and the makeshift sling is a brighter green , a shade commonly associated with islam and a bit of dressing up often seen in weapons confiscated from the taliban but back to the question what is it \? to get closer to the answer , let s look within lieutenant young sent a photograph of the weapons guts , seen below , which tell us much the operating system is based on a gas piston and bolt assembly strongly resembling that of a kalashnikov \( though naturally shorter \) and a return spring of the same clear parentage but the weapon is otherwise not a match its external features borrow from other arms lieutenant young noted that the selector switch \( the device that lets a shooter put the weapon in its safe , semiautomatic or automatic fire modes \) resembles a czech vz 58 , another weapon that fires kalashnikov ammunition but is not a kalashnikov at all at war had its suspicions about what these indicators might mean , so we sent the images around for confirmation some of this blog s sources prefer to remain off the record , but one of the blog s most reliable friends , jonathan ferguson , a curator at the royal armouries museum in leeds , england , came through with an answer that can be reproduced here the quick version is that this weapon , a cross between an assault rifle and a submachine gun , appears to be a product of the gun shops of western pakistan s tribal borderlands , where gunsmiths have a long tradition of churning out idiosyncratic firearms that appropriate design elements from mainstream infantry arms for those who don t know about this regional industry , one old but instructive post here includes a reprint of a 1962 article in guns magazine by william b edwards , a prominent firearms writer of his time a bbc update from 2006 is here , with a telling opening quote there is nothing we cannot copy mr ferguson s fuller explanation of task force bobcat s unusual weapon is below \( those not interested in the finer points of origin may skip a few paragraphs you ll come to the armstrade point \) your mystery piece \( which reminds me of the postapocalyptic video game fallout \) is a pakistani khyber pass design whilst there are several shortbarreled russian and chinese ak variants of this basic form factor , none resemble this in detail , and all \( save the iconic aks74u and subvariants \) are chambered for pistol cartridges this would be a bit of a handful instead , this is clearly inspired by the 556mm hk53 \( essentially an mp5 in an assault rifle calibre \) they ve copied the sliding stock , barrel length , pistol grip , even the basic style of flashhider for comparison s sake , the video of an hk53 below shows many of the features that mr ferguson described mr ferguson added as an aside , i note that the ak is of course gasoperated , the hk53 is rollerdelayed blowback the channels for the sliding stock are the rails that the rollers run on inside the gun so with this frankenstein s monster ak53 , they ve had to mill file solid metal channels and attach them to the outside far simpler would have been to utilise an existing aks underfolder or aks74 sidefolder stock , or to replicate either of those as we know they do what i m getting at is that they are aping the hk53 for style points , basically ! i can t speak to how effective the finished product might be if they ve spent time on getting the gas system right , there s every chance it s functional and that leads to a question will this weapon work \? and if so , how well \? because of its barrel length and relatively small mass over all , this weapon would certainly be expected to be inaccurate beyond a very short range , and would be difficult to handle \( the weight of its apparently solidsteel receiver might offset some of its kick , to a degree \) nonetheless , it could be a menacing enough hybrid for many insurgent uses , though not of much value in the longerrange firefights common in afghanistan showing up with this for that kind of fight , against a welltrained conventional unit , would be a very good way to get dead but in a discussion about the arms trade , this weapon serves as a means for making a point about the intensity of the arms demand in afghanistan , and the multiple sources for satisfying it firearms are like any other product of the industrial age with the right machines , the right work force and the right raw materials , they can be manufactured locally these days , most people imagine military small arms as the output of specialized factories and modern bureaucracies that is certainly true in most cases but before the cold war divided the planet into a pair of militarized blocs , east and west , with small arms organized around standardized cartridges and standardized firearms to fire them , arms production often rested on the work of local gunsmiths and local gun works pick your nation of yesteryear , and this was often how it kitted out soldiers for war the tradition has endured here and there , though its output is less recognized and less often remarked upon than the output of the sprawling gun works and the bureaucracies that support them , right down to the brochures \( there are many curious examples of the coexistence of these two very different manufacturing processes even east germany , under communist rule and soviet occupation , allowed some of its formerly private gunsmiths to make components for standard arms made in the centralized factory in wiesa \) pakistan s tribal frontier has retained this once international tradition , and continues to produce an array of sometimes cannily reconsidered weapons to satisfy regional demand , even as other nations import firearms in conventional patterns by the tens of thousands for distribution throughout afghanistan and so task force bobcat s weapon is a reminder even if the arms trade into afghanistan was more closely regulated , and excess arms were gathered up , and the inventories of state arms were more controlled , there would still be weapons moving through afghanistan demand is that high local ingenuity is that persistent thus , this frankengun an endnote task force bobcat s holdings include other interesting arms as well , returning the conversation to the predictable and the familiar below is a solidsteel receiver kalashnikov an original ak47 , or a convincing reproduction with a date stamp of 1951 if this arm is authentic \( and this blog and mr ferguson both thought it looked legit \) , it is the oldest verified kalashnikov at war has seen in the afghan war given that mass production of ak47s did not begin until 1949 , they don t get much older or more rare than this below is another staple of afghan wars , a reworked british infantry arm from a few eras back in this case , mr ferguson said , it appears to be a martinimetford cavalry carbine , which would make it , if authentic , a product manufactured before world war i the weapon is missing its forward stock , rendering it difficult to fire , much less to fire repeatedly but perhaps it was once wrapped in leather or cloth , which was removed before mounting note the makeshift sling , another testament to local scrounging and ingenuity the bicycle chain , mr ferguson wrote , is a nice touch ! the makeshift front sight \? less so as persistent as weapons are in afghanistan , there are still behaviors , and decisions , that are grounds for shaking your head not that that matters this rifle was captured , lieutenant young said , from an afghan who applied it to the task of trying to waylay a convoy some things do not change
grover norquist on monday found a new way of dismissing a handful of republican lawmakers including the house majority leader who are now publicly wavering about the pledge they signed to never vote for a tax increase mr norquist , the antitax crusader who urges every new lawmaker to sign his pledge , joked on cnn s starting point that we ve got some people discussing impure thoughts on national television but he insisted that the vast majority of republicans will not pay attention to them they all said this two years ago , when we were arguing over the debt ceiling limit , mr norquist said in the interview we cut spending we didn t raise taxes so other republicans did not listen mr norquist s position as the chief enforcer of the republican party s no tax increase stance is under fire in washington as president obama pressures republicans in congress to reach a compromise that increases taxes on wealthy americans not wanting to be boxed in by mr norquist s pledge , some key lawmakers are saying publicly that they might be willing to raise taxes in certain circumstances the latest to express some doubt about the pledge is representative eric cantor of virginia , the majority leader in the house and a staunch antitax crusader himself in an appearance on msnbc s morning joe program on monday , mr cantor repeated his insistence that republicans in the house weren t elected to raise taxes but he also played down the pledge as something that wouldn t necessarily bind his caucus in the house a lot has been said about this pledge and i will tell you when i go to the constituents that reelected me , it is not about that pledge , it really is about trying to solve problems , mr cantor said that s not quite as far some other lawmakers have been willing to go senator lindsey graham of south carolina said flatout that he d break the pledge if democrats agreed to cuts in entitlement programs and representative peter king of new york said he doesn t feel bound by the pledge any more than he d insist on attacking japan now because of a pledge made during world war ii the world has changed , mr king said on nbc s meet the press program on sunday a smiling mr norquist dismissed the comments by mr king , mr graham and others as not reflective of the broader republican party and he said that lawmakers who break the tax pledge do so at the risk of angering the voters who sent them to washington you can either reform government so that it spends less and works better , or you can raise taxes to keep doing all the things we have been doing that haven t worked very well , mr norquist said on cnn if mr norquist seemed confident , the numbers are so far on his side his web site lists 258 members of the 113th congress who have signed his pledge , including 219 in the house and 39 in the senate so far , only about a halfdozen have expressed doubts about the pledge , and none have yet proved that they are willing to break the pledge with a vote to increase taxes that test could come in the next six weeks the pressure to reach a compromise may work on them and on others but republican lawmakers also face real risks that voters in their states will be angry and many could face serious challenges from a conservative , tea party activist if they vote for a compromise that includes a tax increase mr norquist offered his own warning to those members if you want to go to your voters and say i promised you this , and i m breaking my promise , you can have that conversation , he said you re not having an argument with me you ve made a commitment to your voters

absolutely the battle for virginia between mr obama and mr romney has held significant pitfalls for mr kaine animus toward the president in the western coal country and in parts of the militarydominated southeast has done mr kaine no favors but by piggybacking on the president s turnout operation , mr kaine may turn the presidential campaign into a lastminute advantage the obama campaign maintains 47 offices in virginia to mr romney s 29 the state democratic party runs a coordinated campaign to augment the obama team s efforts and promote mr kaine and other democratic candidates , with hubs in alexandria , a washington suburb richmond , the capital the hampton roads area , a military center and charlottesville , a student bastion on the periphery are separate getoutthevote , rallythefaithful efforts motivated by mr obama but carrying along mr kaine s message canvassing has been going on for months , financed by at least three unions , planned parenthood and virginia new majority , the group ms abdulle was working for , which is aimed at an expanding immigrant community that has helped turn virginia from reliably republican to a battleground republicans boast of similar operations the state republican party s victory campaign claimed its one millionth door knocked on last week , and says its canvassers and phone bank workers have contacted nearly 45 million voters , more than twothirds of the state s votingage population democrats scoff at the figure no matter , pete snyder , the victory chairman , said the ground game this year was nothing like the moribund ground effort of 2008 , when a democrat took the state in the presidential race for the first time since 1964 , or of 2006 , when mr allen lost his reelection bid by 9 , 000 votes if you had gone to mccain headquarters in 2008 and said , i'm really worried about virginia , ' they would have laughed you out of the place , said mr snyder , a professed groundgame convert next to nothing went on in 2008 the surge of republican support that swept gov bob mcdonnell to power in 2009 and three republicans into the house in 2010 has presented a tricky task for democrats finding the voters who were with them in 2008 but did not show up in the next two elections , and the ones new to the state in a close race , the persontoperson matters more than anything else , mr kaine told canvassers crammed into an office in dale city before heading out one recent weekend into prince william county look , they 've already seen millions of ads , but it s still close they 've already seen millions of ads , and there are still undecided voters it is a voting universe that requires a lot of coaxing they may be reliably democratic , but the women , immigrants and minorities targeted by virginia new majority are unreliable voters we are focused almost exclusively on the voters who would n't come out to vote without the attention , said rishi awatramani , the communications director for virginia new majority if we hit that 2 percent vote share , then we 've done a good job two weeks ago , organizers sent out about 15 canvassers , white , black , asian and hispanic , some in knit caps , others in head scarves what s our chant \? ben byron , an assistant field director , asked at the meeting hall of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers virginia new majority , 40 , 000 doors , the group responded let s do it , mr byron concluded the sophistication of the operation was evident in the palm of ms abdulle s hand her ipod took her on a meandering path on some streets , she knocked on only one door on another , she hit two doors in a row , skipped five houses , crossed the street and approached another , before doubling back to a missed one far up the block she encountered a skunk on east lee street , a lot of empty houses and many doorbells ignored darkness fell quickly in neighborhoods with no streetlights but it was better than the previous week , her first canvass , when she braved a rainstorm the canvas coordinators who load the maps onto the ipods use publicly available voter files , identifying women and minorities who have voted no more than once in the last four virginia general elections for more frequent voters who vacillate between republicans and democrats , the group s political advocacy arm assigns persuasion teams infrequent but reliable democrats are more likely to get people like ms abdulle , a novice , shy and sweet and not a hard seller i could never do sales , said ms abdulle , a somali immigrant who came to ashburn , va , 10 years ago by way of the netherlands for all the sophistication of the group s back office , its utility could be in question in the hands of such young , inexperienced canvassers mr komlan , one of the voters she contacted , was unpersuasive in his promise to vote after ms abdulle informed him that election day was nov 6 bob bechara , 72 , a greeklebanese retiree , was happy to chat , but he said the door knock had not made a difference she s here , not here , i'm going to do it , he said with a shrug , speaking of voting ms abdulle made no effort to press william echevarria , 51 , when he said he was undecided she was happy he promised her that he would vote but mr echevarria , a military contractor , seemed an easy target he had two children with health issues whom he had been able to keep on his insurance because of mr obama s , a change he clearly appreciated on the other hand , he said he had at least the impression that high gasoline prices stemmed from the democrats' emphasis on alternative energy , a hunch that may well have been disputed with a little effort none was made still , he said , ms abdulle s visit was helpful as the race draws to a close it makes me think , you know what \? i probably should pay attention and make a decision , ' he said
the nhl players association recently turned down the league s realignment proposal there are two major issues that the players have concerns about the first is the unbalanced conferences , which gives certain teams a better percent chance of making the playoffs than others the second is the unknowns surrounding the schedule and the changes in travel throughout the season most guys overwhelmingly feel that there is a big disadvantage being in a division with eight teams compared to a division with seven teams , detroit defenseman niklas kronwall told reporters the other concern is that we really don t know what the travel would be like would there be longer road trips or more backtoback games \? the unbalanced conference issue is a nobrainer it simply is not fair when you have an even number of teams in your league , there is no reason to have the percentages of making the playoffs be more or less for individual teams there is a major difference in seven teams fighting for four playoff spots and eight teams battling for another four berths even major league baseball , which many would say has the most oldschool mentality when it comes to rules , is making the change in 2013 when it moves the houston astros to the american league , leaving each league with 15 teams the way i see it , the players union had no choice but to turn down this proposal on that issue alone when it comes to the subject of travel , and the question marks that surround that issue , it gets into a bit of a gray area the players want more information about it they want to see a template of what a schedule would look like with these changes , which was not provided by the league the issue is that we asked for some documentation to figure out if they had done any travel projections , the pittsburgh penguins player representative craig adams told reporters we wanted to see how it would change the current setup , and if it would change financials up to this point , they haven t given us any information that sentiment has been echoed by many players , and their frustration has been made known but do the players have a gripe on the issue of travel \? and are all the players on the same page \? it has to be difficult for all the players to be pulling on the same rope when some feel their travel would increase while others feel it would lighten they went around and asked are you in favor , are you not in favor , adam burish of the dallas stars told reporters for the stars , it would have been great our division games , none of them are in the same time zone realignment would have been good for the stars , but would it have been good for the philadelphia flyers or the st louis blues \? probably not as much it would seem that putting dallas in a division with at least a few teams in its time zone would be fair how about for a team like the devils , who boast one of the better travel schedules in the league \? it seems as if they would be comfortable with the status quo i was surprised to hear that it didn t go through , the devils captain zach parise told reporters i didn t like the change in the playoff format , so it s not bad for us but i know some teams are going to be upset with the travel i personally like it the way it is and didn t want any changes above you have three different perspectives , from three different teams one player wants change , another wants things to stay the same and the other just wants more information therein lies the tricky subject of travel and the different perspectives players from different cities have the stars don t have a team in their division playing in the same time zone is that fair \? the columbus blue jackets and the detroit red wings are in the eastern time zone , yet they play in the western conference does that make sense \? the reality is that you are an nhl player first and part of one of the teams second at any time you can get traded or released , but you are always part of the nhlpa having as many players as possible educated on all the information is important , so that when changes come , the players are aware why it is being done and how it benefits the league as a whole the nhl had the right idea when it came out with a template for realignment but more communication from both sides will be needed if the two want to make this idea a reality
he was not the star , just a wellregarded young man who seemed to try to do the right thing that was , our bobby , friends said he was a busy , popular kid , but he made time for the autistic man down the block other neighborhood boys admired him as a high school linebacker , he was good enough to be captain , but also gracious enough to help a more talented player take over his starting position it was good for the team , he said that solidguy reputation followed him into the army infantry he joined at the relatively seasoned age of 27 , just a few weeks after the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , and became respected for his maturity and calm , including in battle he was a damn good leader and a damn good soldier , said zachary parsons , who served with staff sergeant bales in iraq in 2007 so when many of his old neighbors from norwood , ohio , and former battalion mates from joint base lewismcchord in washington state heard the news that sergeant bales had been accused of coldbloodedly shooting to death 16 afghan civilians on march 11 , nine of them children , they were not simply shocked they grieved michelle caddell , 48 , who knew sergeant bales when he was growing up , watched a video clip of the news over and over and over again , mesmerized by disbelief i wanted to see , maybe , a different face , she said , fighting back tears because that s not our bobby something horrible , horrible had to happen to him friends , relatives and his lawyer say they have an idea of what that horrible thing was war three deployments in iraq , where he saw heavy fighting , and a fourth in afghanistan , where he went reluctantly , left him struggling financially , in danger of losing his home and there were more direct impacts during his deployments , sergeant bales , 38 , lost part of a foot and injured his head , saw fellow soldiers badly wounded , picked up the bodies of dead iraqis , was treated for mild and possibly developed posttraumatic stress disorder , his lawyer and military officials said but there are also glimpses of a darkness in his personal life sergeant bales s past includes an arrest on a misdemeanor charge of assault on a woman , which was dropped after he completed angermanagement counseling an accident in which he overturned his car , something he attributed to falling asleep at the wheel and an accumulation of rejections and disappointments a year ago , according to a blog written by his wife , he was denied a promotion to sergeant first class , a rank that would have brought not just added responsibility and respect but also money at a time when his finances seemed stretched neighbors remember him , in between earlier deployments , as a gungho solider , eager to get back to the fight but that seemed to have changed he trained to become a recruiter , a job that would have allowed him to skip afghanistan , but the army kept him in the infantry and though he felt that his injuries were significant enough to keep him out of combat , his lawyer said , army doctors said he was fit to deploy weeks later , he arrived in one of the roughest precincts of afghanistan a long legal process starting with the formal filing of charges in the coming weeks and ending , most likely , in a courtmartial will sort out whether sergeant bales was guilty of atrocities and may shed light on which , if any , of these factors played a role from dozens of interviews with lawyers , friends and military officials , competing legal narratives are already starting to emerge a military official , speaking anonymously , has said sergeant bales had marital problems , felt stressed by the afghanistan deployment and snapped after drinking alcohol before the shootings sergeant bales s lawyers contend that he had a solid marriage and no drinking problems if he cracked , they said , it was because he probably had ptsd that the army failed to diagnose , had been dispatched to a war he did not want to fight and had seen a friend gravely wounded just before the killings dr stephen xenakis , a psychiatrist and retired brigadier general who was an adviser to the joint chiefs of staff , said that after a decade of combat , where hundreds of thousands of troops have sustained traumatic brain injury and ptsd , those syndromes by themselves seem inadequate to explain how a seemingly normal and widely admired sergeant might have singlehandedly committed one of the worst war crimes of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts with his multiple deployments and wounds , dr xenakis said , sergeant bales seems emblematic of bigger problems an overstretched military battered by 11 years of combat failures by the military to properly identify and treat its weary , suffering troops and the thin line dividing normal behavior in war from what later is deemed snapping this is equivalent to what my lai did to reveal all the problems with the conduct of the vietnam war , dr xenakis said the army will want to say that soldiers who commit crimes are rogues , that they are individual , isolated cases but they are not sergeant bales grew up in norwood , a modest suburb of cincinnati , the youngest of five boys who lived in a twostory brick home still known as the bales house , though no baleses live in it anymore the family was that well known , and that well liked they 're downhome country , ms caddell said mr bales was a gregarious , chatty , engaged teenager who played football and threw himself into an array of clubs and activities , including theater in his yearbook , he signed the football team photo with a nickname , doom , and is listed on the senior superlatives page as one of the best dancers in his class he s one of those kids you remember , said david c griffel , the principal of norwood high school when mr bales attended a real extrovert mr bales was a leader on the football team , a feisty middle linebacker who was not big but strong , able to bench press 300 pounds but in his junior year , a freshman star named marc edwards arrived , and the coach wanted the newcomer to be the starting middle linebacker there might have been an unpleasant rivalry , but instead mr bales shared tips on the position he got the idea in that situation that marc was going to be better for the team , said aaron m smith , the author of a book about mr edwards mr edwards was surprised by mr bales s generosity he credited bob bales with teaching him what leadership meant , and how to handle a situation that does n't favor you , mr smith said mr edwards went on to be named ohio s mr football for 1992 and to play for notre dame , the san francisco 49ers , the cleveland browns , the new england patriots , the jacksonville jaguars and the chicago bears mr bales was enrolled in the college of mount st joseph in 1991 and 1992 he attended ohio state university from 1993 until 1996 , declaring an economics major , according to jim lynch , a university spokesman it is not clear why he left , mr lynch said details about mr bales s life during the next several years are sketchy friends and his lawyer said he had worked in financial services in columbus , ohio , then started an investment business with his brother mark no sign remains of their spartina investments at the modest office building where they leased space in doral , fla , a few blocks west of miami international airport and south of the doral golf resort and spa by november 2001 , he had joined the army it was n't really anger when he joined , said michael blevins , 35 , a childhood friend it was they had hurt something , he added , referring to the sept 11 terrorists ms caddell said that she had worried about his decision , but that he had assured her , nothing s going to happen to me the decision made sense to ms caddell s son mark , who had idolized mr bales since he was a toddler he has to join , ms caddell recalled her son saying he takes care of everybody after basic training , sergeant bales was assigned to what was then known as fort lewis , near tacoma , which would become the army s western deployment hub for the wars for the next 11 years , he would spend his career with the second battalion , third infantry regiment in a stryker brigade in 2002 , the criminal assault occurred in a tacomaarea hotel room , but he paid his fine and completed courtmandated angermanagement counseling , court records show not long after , he married karilyn primeau , a woman he had met online , his lawyer said , and they went on to have two children , a daughter named quincy and a son named bobby the third brigade deployed to northern iraq from november 2003 to november 2004 , a time when the country was quickly devolving into looting , insurgency and chaos but it was sergeant bales s second tour , from june 2006 into september 2007 , that was particularly eventful by then , iraq was in the throes of sectarian civil war , and american troops were dying at a rate of about 80 a month david hardt , a third brigade soldier who wrote a blog about the deployment , said that the enemy had almost always been invisible and that soldiers had grown bitterly frustrated at their inability to fight back you sort of got used to seeing dead bodies , seeing things blow up in front of you , said mr hardt , who did not know sergeant bales but was in iraq at the same time we wanted to get insurgents , but it s so rare that we succeeded in one extraordinary battle in january 2007 , however , sergeant bales s battalion encountered as many as 600 shiite militia fighters while trying to recover a downed apache helicopter in najaf in a pitched twoday battle that included airstrikes and mortar exchanges , the american forces claimed to have killed 250 enemy fighters while losing none of their own the cool part about this was , style , you dug in , sergeant bales , then a team leader , was quoted as saying in a recounting of the battle by the fort lewis newspaper you 're taking a shovel and digging as fast as you can i 've never been more proud to be a part of this unit than that day , he added somewhere during that deployment , sergeant bales injured his foot , though his lawyer said he did not know how the army has declined to provide details about the sergeant s record but the injury did not seem significant enough to remove him from iraq , and he seems to have finished the tour , which was extended to 15 months from 12 in what became known as the surge mr hardt said most soldiers he knew were angry about the extension because they were exhausted by the continuous fighting and the threats of roadside bombs but if sergeant bales was upset , he did not seem to complain when he returned to the tacoma area , he was limping , neighbors said , but also working hard to rehabilitate his foot because he wanted to return to full duty he was a gungho army guy , said tim burgess , 59 , a retired trucker and warehouse worker who lived next door to sergeant bales at the time he still wanted to see action even though he had been wounded neighbors remembered his wife as an avid bicyclist but not particularly sociable records show that she worked as a project manager at nowdefunct washington mutual , then became an associate technical project manager at amaxra , a business communications company in redmond sergeant bales was home for nearly two years after his second deployment mrs bales , also an avid blogger , cheerfully recounted baking cookies , reading books and visiting her parents in bellingham with their daughter by august 2009 , he was gone again it was a quieter tour , with more nation building than combat in a facebook exchange with a childhood friend , steven berling , sergeant bales called the deployment boring and pretty dumb , then lamented the lack of fighting giving money to hagji instead of bullets just do n't seem right , he wrote , apparently misspelling hajji , a term used by soldiers , often pejoratively , in referring to arab people about the time sergeant bales was preparing to deploy in 2009 , the baleses were having financial problems , records show early in their relationship , they had lived in a house in auburn , between seattle and tacoma , that mrs bales had owned before they were together according to records , they received a notice of a trustee sale in mid2009 the couple , who had moved out by then , had missed 17 , 000 in payments and owed a total of 195 , 000 to the bank a trustee auction was scheduled for october 2009 , while sergeant bales was in iraq , but the auction was postponed three times and then called off in early 2010 for reasons that are unclear robert baggett , president of the neighborhood s riverpark estates homeowners association , said the baleses had stopped paying their annual association dues of about 120 at least two years ago the house , which for a while was occupied by renters whose noise drew complaints from neighbors , has been vacant for about 18 months and is now filthy and in disrepair we are parking cars there to keep it looking like it is occupied so no homeless move in , mr baggett said the baleses bought their twostory house in lake tapps , east of tacoma , in 2005 , records show but just three days before the shootings in afghanistan , mrs bales told a real estate agent , phillip rodocker , that she wanted to sell the house because they were financially stretched the house is listed for sale at 229 , 000 , about 50 , 000 less than what the family paid for it asked about the mortgage problems , sergeant bales s lawyer , john henry browne , said , there are no financial pressures on the family right now other than the normal ones that are experienced by the 99 percenters last march , mrs bales wrote on her blog that her husband had not gotten the hopedfor promotion to sergeant first class , which would have raised his pay by about 370 a month and made him eligible to be the senior noncommissioned officer for a platoon \( he was also paid an extra 400 a month during his deployments \) the promotion probably would have also given him some peace of mind about his army career , which was nearly halfway to the 20 years needed for retirement with pay though sad and disappointed by the news , mrs bales said she was also relieved we can finally move on to the next phase of our lives , she wrote that next phase , the baleses hoped , would take them to germany , italy or hawaii but the army did not move sergeant bales from joint base lewismcchord nor did it allow him to become a recruiter , though he was in training for the job instead , he was told he would go with the third brigade to afghanistan in december he was not happy about it , mr browne said , but took his orders like a professional soldier before deploying , sergeant bales would have undergone physical exams , including on his foot , and a computerbased survey for traumatic brain injury intended to measure attention , memory and thinking ability the survey is not well regarded among many specialists , but it remains the army s chief screening tool for traumatic brain injury sergeant bales was declared fit to deploy little is known about his time in afghanistan , other than that he and others in his battalion were assigned to work alongside army special forces soldiers in the panjwai district of kandahar province , a longtime hotbed of taliban activity that has grown more secure in recent years sergeant bales would probably have provided security for the green berets while they carried out night raids , built relations with village leaders and organized local militias a green beret who has spent time in panjwai in the past year said the combat outpost would have been relatively small , protected by dirtfilled containers known as hesco barriers , with guard towers and perhaps a blimp with a highpowered camera capable of capturing images more than a mile away it would have been difficult , but not impossible , for sergeant bales to slip away at night unnoticed , as the army says he did supervision in the outpost might also have been more lax than at larger bases , which could explain the presence of alcohol sergeant bales might have even been among the more senior noncommissioned officers on his team special forces teams typically have 12 members , sometimes fewer , and sergeant bales s unit might have been as small as a platoon of two dozen soldiers many younger soldiers consider such assignments exciting and more fulfilling , though they are also potentially more dangerous but mr browne said sergeant bales had considered the posting grueling , noting that the soldiers lived in metal cargo containers it was very tough and rustic , the lawyer said about a week ago , mr browne said , sergeant bales saw a friend lose a leg to a buried mine soon after , according to mr browne , he sent his wife a short message hard day for the good guys about a day later , army officials said , sergeant bales walked out of the outpost and headed toward the nearby village
london russia has pushed itself to the forefront of efforts to resolve the syrian crisis with an endofyear diplomatic flurry aimed at bringing the damascus regime and the mainstream opposition to the negotiating table a day after urging the government of president bashar alassad to embark on a dialog with opponents , officials in moscow said friday that they had invited the head of the opposition syria national coalition for talks at which a similar message will be delivered as the regime s most powerful remaining ally , russia has been accused of propping up mr assad by blocking international measures to undermine his rule the latest diplomatic offensive , however , appears to underline moscow s fears of a disorderly collapse that could damage russian interests in the region for the initiative to succeed , the russian government has indicated it will seek washington s cooperation , although the foreign ministry in moscow has denied there is a joint russianus road map on syria sergey v lavrov , the russian foreign minister , said on friday that he had actively encouraged the syrian leadership to maximally put into action its declared readiness for dialogue with the opposition he was referring to talks he had on thursday with faisal almeqdad , the syrian deputy foreign minister mikhail bogdanov , mr lavrov s deputy , said friday that the government had sent an invitation to ahmed moaz alkhatib , the head of an opposition coalition which seeks to overthrow mr assad rather than negotiate with him mr lavrov said that moscow hoped the syrian opposition would size up the situation in the country and search for ways to begin a political dialogue with the assad government the diplomatic activity will continue on saturday with a visit to moscow by lakhdar brahimi , the united nationsarab league peace envoy , who on thursday supported the establishment of a transitional government in damascus , perhaps within months he did not say what role if any mr assad would play in the transitional period but , as kareem fahim and ellen barry reported , his comments suggested that if mr assad remained in the country , he would retain none of his authority moscow has adamantly refused to use its influence in damascus to urge mr assad to step down mr lavrov has said he is not prepared to act as a messenger for those governments that want the syrian leader to go we are not in the business of regime change , mr lavrov said in an interview this week  those who wanted mr assad to go should tell him directly why shall they use us as a postman \? he said if president assad is interested , this must be discussed directly with him however , russia has been distancing itself from mr assad in recent months as his hold on power has grown ever more precarious moscow hopes to continue its diplomatic offensive into the new year with a possible threeway meeting that would involve mr ibrahimi , the russians and the us state department s william burns the extent and pace of the russian initiative appears to indicate moscow is involved in more than diplomatic grandstanding but does it stand a better chance of succeeding than earlier peace moves \? that may depend in part on whether moscow can resolve its differences with an opposition that according to the broadcaster russia today , stands for the overthrow of the assad regime and the dismantling of all the institutions of power russia s main concern is that such a scenario would only lead to nonstop violence in the arab republic , russia today said on friday the only solution is to reach a mutuallyacceptable compromise between the rivalry parties
in a sharp answer to amazon and its expanding publishing efforts , barnes noble said on tuesday that it would not sell books released by amazon publishing in its bookstores the ban includes books released by new harvest , a new imprint of houghton mifflin harcourt that recently struck a deal to publish and distribute books released by amazon publishing s unit based in new york barnes noble has made a decision not to stock amazon published titles in our store showrooms , jaime carey , the company s chief merchandising officer , said in a statement our decision is based on amazon s continued push for exclusivity with publishers , agents and the authors they represent these exclusives have prohibited us from offering certain ebooks to our customers their actions have undermined the industry as a whole and have prevented millions of customers from having access to content it s clear to us that amazon has proven they would not be a good publishing partner to barnes noble as they continue to pull content off the market for their own self interest the decision is the latest in a series of skirmishes between the nation s largest bookstore chain and amazon , the powerful online retailer that has moved aggressively into the publishing arena and it signals clearly that barnes noble has no intention of helping its largest competitor sell books a representative for amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment the move could undermine amazon s efforts to sign authors who expect their books to be sold in barnes noble s 703 stores across the country , crucial real estate for sales of many titles barnes noble will sell amazonpublished books on bncom , though exclusive deals mean that some will not be available barnes noble has chafed at deals that prevent it from selling the digital versions of books even as it is expected to market the books by displaying the print versions in stores in august , the company said it would not sell print books published by amazon unless it could also sell the ebook versions , in an objection to amazon s deals to publish authors' work exclusively in october , it removed from its stores all the physical copies of graphic novels from dc comics because of a deal that allowed amazon exclusive digital rights to them amazon publishing s new york unit , headed by the longtime publishing executive laurence kirshbaum , has made a string of acquisitions since last summer , including a book by the selfhelp author timothy ferriss , and a memoir by the actress and director penny marshall amazon , based in seattle , has a number of imprints in a range of genres and published dozens of books last year the deal with houghton mifflin harcourt , announced last week , was intended to broaden the distribution of amazon print books barnes noble s decision on tuesday could change the equation for authors who are deciding between amazon and a traditional publisher there are still many consumers who prefer to buy their books in person , whether at barnes noble or at other brickandmortar retailers like walmart i ca n't see that most authors who want a print publication would welcome the idea of not being carried in barnes noble and depend on amazon for their sales , said elyse cheney , a literary agent if you 're doing a print book , you kind of have to be in barnes noble it also seemed unlikely that many of the 1 , 900 independent bookstores in the united states would be willing to stock amazon books there are no circumstances under which we would do that , none , said vivien jennings , owner of rainy day books in fairway , kan if amazon wants to publish books , let amazon sell them and i think that s what they 're going to have to do this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

des moines sought to convert his tentative standing atop the polls into a firstplace finish in the caucuses here , telling iowans on sunday that he had the capability to go the full distance against president obama , as his rivals beseeched voters not to settle on a candidate lacking full commitment to their conservative values just as confidence had been rising among mr romney and his aides that they could pull off a win here on tuesday night , they were faced with a new challenge from , who emerged as the latest in a rotating cast of surging alternatives , ebullient about his rising standing in the polls and support from excited crowds on sunday in sioux city and rock rapids do n't put forward somebody who is n't good enough to do what s necessary to change this country , mr santorum , a former pennsylvania senator , said at a townhallstyle meeting in sioux city , feeding off his new status as a real contender here put forward someone that you know has the vision , the trust , the authenticity , the background , the record to make that happen still decidedly in the mix was , a libertarianleaning congressman from texas , whose dedicated followers could still propel him into the lead on tuesday night and in the nominating contests that will unfold in the coming months even though the republican race remained fluid , the democratic party stepped up its involvement in the opposing contest , and several aides to the president s reelection team arrived here to open a war room at a downtown hotel the prime target was mr romney they held a news conference to highlight mr romney s record as chief executive of the private equity firm bain capital , introducing an indiana worker who was laid off in the early 1990s when his company was bought by bain iowa s caucuses do not have an especially good record of predicting republican nominees but the result here could be an indicator of whether mr romney , a former governor of massachusetts , is succeeding in rallying conservatives behind him or whether he faces months of struggle to win delegates and resolve the rifts within the party after months of campaigning , a long series of debates and the rise and fall of one challenger after another , no one has yet shown that they can knock off mr romney despite running a largely mistakefree campaign , mr romney has yet to prove that he can break through the ceiling of support of about 25 percent in many polls that has defined his candidacy in a fractured field mr romney s campaign aides were watching mr santorum s new strength carefully they said that while they were satisfied that mr santorum s rise was further fracturing the antiromney vote among him , mr paul , newt gingrich and gov rick perry of texas , they could take nothing for granted when only half of likely iowa caucusgoers say they have committed to a candidate and on a day when all but the most politically involved iowans were at home celebrating the new year and watching football , mr romney s campaign workers were calling the homes of potentially supportive caucusgoers they have been recruiting for months , wishing a happy new year to their families and offering a gentle reminder to attend the caucuses mr romney s campaign had been optimistic enough about a possible victory here that it decided over the weekend to keep him in iowa through tuesday night to be in place for nationally televised interviews from des moines on wednesday morning a sign that they expected him to be talking about good news here but a senior aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity , played down the importance of a firstplace showing , saying that our strategy was never based on a win in iowa and that the campaign would be happily surprised if he were to secure one preparing for a potentially longer fight , mr romney s strategists in boston were increasingly turning their focus on new hampshire , south carolina and the biggest january primary state , florida , where voters are receiving absentee ballots this week the campaign has been aggressively working to get out the early vote there , and mr romney s advertising team has begun to inquire about ad rates across the state senator charles e grassley , republican of iowa , said the competing messages in the campaign had left fiscal and social conservatives terribly split here most campaigns were in agreement that a win by mr romney would put him in an enviable position to capture his party s nomination none of the campaigns are prepared to count out a strong showing from mr paul , who remains a wild card with toptier if eroding poll numbers and a large war chest less certain is the longterm strength of mr santorum , who has struggled to raise money much of last year and ran his first television commercial only at the very end of the campaign here but nothing fills a bank account like the word surge in headlines , and mr santorum s communications director , hogan gidley , said sunday that his daily donations have increased by 300 percent in the last few days he said the campaign has bought advertising time in new hampshire and is working to put up an ad buy in south carolina , as well mr gidley , who worked for the political action committee of mike huckabee , the winner of the republican caucuses in iowa four years ago , said some of mr huckabee s supporters in the state were now getting behind mr santorum many of those supporters were evangelical christians and several potential caucusgoers said in interviews at churches that they had warmed to mr santorum s candidacy recently and saw him as a viable contender speaking at cornerstone family church , michael stofer , 21 , said his vote would largely turn on opposition to abortion and as he saw it , mr santorum s views line up very well with the biblical understanding of those issues but other republicans said that even though they liked mr santorum best and had problems with mr romney s past positions on abortion , and gun rights , they were supporting mr romney because they viewed him as a stronger challenger to mr obama at the family table restaurant in atlantic , where mr romney spoke with voters on sunday , betty placzek , 79 , said she preferred mr santorum but would caucus for mr romney i think romney can win , she said i like santorum , but he has zilch chance the opposing views went to the central question hanging over the campaign as it enters this crucial first phase of caucusing and voting a series of polls , concluding with a released saturday night , has shown mr romney and mr paul bunched at the top of the pack the poll had mr romney at 24 percent and mr paul at 22 percent it was conducted tuesday through friday and has a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points but the polls have also suggested that mr paul s support has been fading as rivals raise questions about his noninterventionist foreign policy views , and that mr santorum s support has been building in the final days at the restaurant , mr romney took a gentle swipe at mr santorum when asked about him by reporters he began with a smile , saying senator santorum was kind enough to endorse me last time around i appreciate that a few moments later , he added like speaker gingrich , senator santorum has spent his career in government , in washington nothing wrong with that , but it s a very different background than i have still , mr romney mostly ignored his republican rivals and trained his gaze on mr obama this is a failed presidency , mr romney said these have been a tough three years , and he is trying to find someone to blame mr gingrich , who has dropped precipitously in polls while under attack by a super pac supporting mr romney , told reporters traveling with him that romney called himself a moderate as governor complaining of being romneyboated a reference to the group that attacked senator john kerry of massachusetts in 2004 , swift boat veterans for truth mr gingrich said that by damaging him , the ads had only guaranteed that some other conservative emerged , an apparent reference to mr santorum
it would be so much easier , maj ben richards says , if he had just lost a leg in iraq instead , he finds himself losing his mind , or at least a part of it and if you want to understand how america is failing its soldiers and veterans , honoring them with lip service and ceremonies but breaking faith with them on all that matters most , listen to the story of major richards for starters , he s brilliant \( or at least he was \) he speaks chinese and taught at west point , and his medical evaluations suggest that until his recent problems he had an iq of about 148 after he graduated from west point , in 2000 , he received glowing reviews ben richards is one of the best military officers i have worked with in 13 years of service , noted an evaluation , one of many military and medical documents he shared with me yet richards s intellect almost exacerbates his suffering , for it better equips him to monitor his mental deterioration and the failings of the army that he has revered since he was a young boy military suicides are the starkest gauge of our nation s failure to care adequately for those who served in uniform with america s wars winding down , the united states is now than to the enemy include veterans , and the tragedy is even more sweeping for every this year , about 25 veterans now take their own lives president obama said recently that it was an outrage that some service members and veterans we 've got to do better this has to be all hands on deck admirable words , but so far they 've neither made much impact nor offered consolation to those who call the suicide prevention hot line and end up on hold the military s problems with mental health services go far beyond suicide or the occasional murders committed by soldiers and veterans far more common are people like richards , who does not contemplate violence of any kind but is still profoundly disabled an astonishing 45 percent of those who served in iraq or afghanistan are now , in many cases psychological ones it s unclear how many are exaggerated or even fraudulent , but what is clear is this the financial cost of these disabilities will be huge , yet it is dwarfed by the human cost richards s finest hour , and in retrospect his worst , came in iraq in 2007 he was then a captain assigned to the city of baquba , a hotly contested area where he was welcomed on his first day by a 12hour firefight in baquba , richards pioneered an initiative to who had previously attacked americans to defeat the local branch of al qaeda this was ferociously controversial at first and richards was bitterly criticized by other officers for collaborating with the enemy but the strategy worked and was broadly adopted by the military in iraq the new york times wrote that year about richards s leadership the army promoted him , and he seemed destined for greatness then one day a car bomb destroyed his stryker vehicle , giving richards a severe concussion that left him nauseated and dazed for a week three weeks later , a roadside bomb knocked him out again , and he suffered a second concussion , with similar results richards , now 36 , struggled for months with headaches , fatigue , insomnia and fainting spells once he passed out in the middle of a firefight still , he did n't seek medical care he figured he was n't injured , and that has been a widespread problem the military value system is such that warriors disdain medical care as long as they are physically capable of fighting coming from an army ethos , he says wryly , you 're not even entitled to complain unless you 've lost all four limbs yet there s growing evidence that concussions are every bit as damaging as far bloodier wounds when someone suffers blows to the head , the result can be a , or tbi this , eventually , was richards s diagnosis richards s wife , farrah , was thrilled when he returned safely from iraq in the fall of 2007 , and she counted them both very , very lucky but almost immediately , farrah says , she noticed that the man who came home wore her husband s skin but was different inside there were obvious changes in his personality , she recalls he was extremely withdrawn he would go into the bedroom for hours a once boisterous dad who loved to roughhouse with his children now there are four , ages 1 to 14 ben no longer seemed to know how to play with them he often suffered incapacitating headaches , overwhelming fatigue and constant insomnia especially when dozing , he was on a hair trigger if farrah rose at night , she sometimes did n't return to bed for fear that her husband might think she was an enemy and attack her instead , she 'd spend the rest of the night on the couch for a woman who had been functioning as a single mom and was now eager to resume her former married life , all this was devastating and it got worse farrah would tell her husband things , and then he would repeatedly forget and reproach her for not telling him he was distracted , withdrawn and unhelpful , and he repeatedly let her down our marriage was at real risk at this point , richards says we got to a point where we thought about separating yet it became increasingly apparent that the problem was n't that richards was a jerk it was that he had a war injury , an invisible one it s often said that traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder , which richards s doctors also diagnosed , are the signature wounds of the iraq and afghan wars that s partly because of the strains of repeated combat tours and partly because the enemy now relies more on bombs than bullets these factors suggest an answer to a continuing mystery why is suicide among soldiers and veterans more common now \? data collection has been poor , but several studies suggest that suicides among vietnam veterans were not elevated and traditionally , suicide rates among military personnel were lower than among civilians in the last decade , perhaps because of the increased time that today s troops have spent in combat and how common explosions and resulting concussions have become in war zones of the 100 soldiers under richards , about 90 were hit by at least one bomb blast , and one stryker crew was hit five times , richards says yet few received significant medical treatment or were pulled out of harm s way to protect them from a repeat concussion richards himself did n't receive any thorough examination or prompt diagnosis , even though he sought help from a series of doctors and counselors he and farrah just knew that something was wrong with his mind and the intellectual toll became clearer when the army sent him to georgetown university to earn a graduate degree the once brilliant scholar found that his brain just did n't function properly the paper is disappointing , professor nancy bernkopf tucker commented on one of his term papers , on china parts are not coherent and overall it is not effective it is not well written and it is sloppy of greatest significance is the lack of analysis tucker told me that she recalled richards well i remember him partly because i liked him so much , she said he never told me about his background , and all i saw was someone not living up to his potential richards agreed with her comments on his work his pure reasoning capacity is unimpaired , but his memory and ability to concentrate are faulty in effect , he is a brilliant man tracking his cognitive deterioration after stumbling along to complete his georgetown degree , richards moved to west point two years ago to take up a teaching position he was elated to be teaching there but he found himself losing his train of thought in class he could n't read more than a few pages at a time richards saw that students were looking at him questioningly , trying to figure out what was wrong it hurts , it s humiliating , he said i was always thinking maybe this is just something psychological i'm an army guy , i can get over this it was at this time , three years after the concussions in iraq , that military physicians finally gave richards a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury meanwhile , the headaches , the insomnia , the fatigue and the concentration problems grew worse , and he was embarrassed that medication for the headaches led him to put on 45 pounds realizing that he was n't cutting it as an instructor , richards asked in march to be relieved of his teaching duties after a battery of physical and psychiatric tests , including a scan that found eight lesions in his brain tissue , the army confirmed that he was disabled he is retiring this month leaving the army is the hardest thing i ever did , he told me , and he seemed near tears sometimes richards is optimistic and imagines that he can find a new career if i get smart again , as he puts it but then reality sets in , often in the form of an agonizing headache as we sat together in their living room , farrah gently dismissed the idea of ben s working and said that she ca n't even trust him to look after the toddler ben bit his lip and nodded slowly i'm basically unemployable , he said ben and farrah found that they could no longer afford to live near west point , so they have just moved to iowa to be near farrah s parents the couple s marital strains seem mended , and farrah says that now that she understands that her husband is suffering from a war wound , she is committed to seeing him through farrah is an amazing lady to stick through this , ben told me i am not sure who is having a harder time with tbi , me or my wife in many ways , i am different from the man she married countless spouses , parents and children of returning troops are struggling with similar challenges spouses often complain that the military treats them particularly poorly , and rarely communicates adequately they 'll be like , your husband was briefed on that' farrah said and i say , well , my husband ca n't remember that briefing' compounding the stress , the military and the department of veterans affairs are vastly overburdened by the mental health demands of returning soldiers and that s not just the view of the troops but also of secretary of defense leon panetta this system is going to be overwhelmed , he said at a let s not kid anybody we 're looking at a system it s already overwhelmed panetta said that the epidemic of military suicide was one of the most frustrating problems he has faced as defense secretary obama talked about the challenge of military suicides , and his administration deserves modest credit for \( inadequate \) steps to improve mental health care , assistant secretary of defense for health affairs , told me that the military had made progress in screening and treating traumatic brain injury and mental health , so that a soldier would be more likely to get help today than five years ago , when richards suffered his blast injuries we 're lightyears more advanced now in terms of how we approach these problems and what we teach troops about getting help , he said in particular , blast injuries are tracked and treated more rigorously , he said , but he acknowledged that more work needed to be done grim experiences like the one richards endured might create an opening for mitt romney , but he is n't taking it as a governor and candidate , he has had a weak record on veterans , and he has n't shown leadership on the issue he managed to speak to the veterans of foreign wars last month without addressing veterans' issues in a substantive way in any case , my take is that whatever political leaders say in washington , and whatever directives emerge from the pentagon , not nearly enough is changing on the ground mental health still is n't the priority it should be just about every soldier or veteran i 've talked to finds that in practice the mental health system is clogged with demands , and soldiers and veterans are falling through the cracks returning soldiers are n't adequately screened , diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury are still haphazard , and there has n't been nearly enough effort to change the warrior culture so that getting help is smart rather than sissy the national alliance on mental illness recently offered an idea to help change this culture the armed forces should for invisible , psychological wounds that might help ease the stigma and would underscore that medical problems are real even if they are inside the head the alliance also recommended that commanders be held accountable for preventable suicides while the challenges are acute for those on active duty , they often become even greater when troops take off their uniforms and become veterans seeking services from the hugely overburdened veterans affairs department ben and farrah have found it immensely difficult to get reliable information from the va about what benefits they can count on richards says that in 11 phone calls , he has heard different stories every time the va is an abomination , he said you see that hole in the wall \? he pointed at what looked like a rat hole that s when i threw the phone after someone at va hung up on me none of this is a surprise the va says that veterans wait an average of eight months to get an initial decision on the claims they file when service members seek to retire for medical reasons , the process takes an average of 396 days eric shinseki , the secretary of veterans affairs , notes that the va processes more claims each year than it did before , but that the number of new claims surges by an even greater amount the upshot is that the va steps up its game but still gets further behind shinseki notes some areas of progress the number of homeless veterans seems to have fallen significantly and he points to new systems and hiring intended to make the system function better the number of va mental health staff members has risen from 13 , 000 in 2005 to more than 20 , 000 today , he said at a time when nearly half of veterans returning from battle file disability claims , it s fair to wonder whether word has n't spread that service members can claim some vague mental health ailment , like posttraumatic stress disorder , and get a paycheck from the government the va approves roughly half of claims , but the difficulty of diagnosis of mental health ailments means that they may not always be the legitimate ones we may be getting the worst of all worlds fraudulent claims approved , while legitimate ones are unrecognized or unconscionably delayed the va certainly does n't care , says jim strickland , who runs the web site the very institution that should be at the forefront of caring for vets is dead last the web site declares this country is capable of drafting you , putting you in boot camp , teaching you to kill someone , and then putting you in a war zone within six months so why ca n't they process a claim that fast \? the same military that lavishes attention on its drones and aircraft carriers seems to take its people for granted stryker vehicles are refurbished , but not the men who operate them the military health insurance wo n't cover some of the treatments that doctors recommended for richards all this is unforgivable , but it s also shortsighted the military s most valuable assets are n't its strykers or tanks , but the highly trained troops inside them when a soldier is harmed by repeat concussions , hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in training are squandered and shoddy treatment of returning soldiers will undermine recruitment and retention in the future i asked ben and farrah why they agreed to tell their story and share medical and personal files , some of which detail ben s deterioration to a degree that is almost humiliating i regard this as my residual duty , he replied he thinks that he let his soldiers down by letting them return to action after suffering concussions , and he wants to atone by helping to call attention to a system that fails so many soldiers and veterans farrah is scathing about what she sees as the failure of the army and va to support the troops she adds , our leaders , political and military , have not been honest with people about the cost of the war as for ben , he s not nearly as harsh it s clear that he still adores the army , and he is less bitter than wistful i'm extremely proud of what i did in iraq , he told me i recognize that this was a risk that i voluntarily accepted many others have suffered far worse injuries , he notes , or are suffering alone without the soul mate he has in farrah both farrah and ben wish that his injury were more obvious if he were in a wheelchair , neighbors would think of him as a hero , instead of as perhaps a malingering crackpot i 'd trade a leg for this in a heartbeat , ben said if all i was missing was a leg , i 'd be a stud and if i 'd lost a leg , i 'd be able to stay in the army that s all i want to do he summed up his future it comes to failure but that s flat wrong in speaking out with brutal candor about his injury and decline , maj ben richards exemplifies courage and leadership he s not damaged goods , but a hero maybe , if our leaders are listening , one of his last remaining dreams is still achievable that his story will help win better treatment for so many others like him

have relegated the a s to a wildcard playin game instead , it s now texas that will face baltimore for the right to advance to a firstround series the a s , meanwhile , will move on to detroit , where their unlikely journey will continue in a game 1 on saturday night it s always good for the underdogs to come out on top , said closer grant balfour , who was called upon to close out texas in the ninth despite his team s sevenrun lead that s something i 'll take every time in their underdog role , the a s pulled off one of baseball s great surprises in recent decades this was a team picked to finish last in its division , even before trading its three best pitchers for youngsters during the offseason in what seemed a move designed for the 2015 season , and certainly not this one it is also a team speckled with castoffs , a team that was 13 games behind texas on june 30 , and five games back with only nine to play a team with a 595 million payroll , baseball s lowest a team that , in the end , is a little bit hard to believe it was easy to think wednesday afternoon that the magic had finally cracked the rangers put together a fiverun third inning , aided by two dropped popups , which knocked oakland starter a j griffin from the game trailing , 51 , the a s looked , for the first time in recent weeks , like the very young ball club that they are and then , suddenly , they did n't wearing their gold alternate jerseys , the a s came right back in the bottom of the fourth with a big inning of their own , scoring six runs to take a 75 lead from there , the oakland bullpen shut texas down , making the seasoned rangers look like the team unaccustomed to such pressure the rangers made three errors in the game , none more prominent than the easy fly ball dropped by josh hamilton in the fourth it allowed the a s to score the final two runs of their big rally three innings later , with rangers on second and third , nobody out and texas down by three , the rookie reliever ryan cook oakland s lone allstar representative this season shut the door for good with a groundout and two strikeouts oakland s stadium still had tarps over all but three sections of the third deck wednesday , but every other seat , all 35 , 067 of them \( plus another 1 , 000 standingroomonly tickets \) was sold chants of let s go , oakland serenaded the team from the first pitch onward every twostrike count against the rangers set off a minor roar that oakland started a rookie pitcher in its biggest game of the season should not be surprising its rotation is currently made up of nothing but rookies the starting five griffin , tommy milone , jarrod parker , travis blackley and dan straily had 14 games of major league experience between them coming into the 2012 season , and have now started 14 games in a row then again , as the season began , oakland s rotation included the veterans brandon mccarthy and bartolo colon , who were knocked out of action by a line drive to the head and a flunked drug test , respectively even brett anderson , who returned from tommy john surgery in august to go 42 with a 257 earned run average in six starts , has been shelved recently with an oblique strain with the victory going to evan scribner , who held the rangers to two hits over three shutout innings , rookie pitchers have now accounted for 54 of oakland s 94 victories the highest such number in major league history , according to the elias sports bureau experience is one thing , but when you trust yourself and you 're good at baseball , you win games , mccarthy , a sevenyear veteran , said these young guys are so together , they 're almost too mature as oakland general manager billy beane held one of his 4yearold twins , brayden , in the celebratory clubhouse , he said that it was n't until a couple of weeks ago that he was convinced his club had what it took i thought our debutante ball , so to speak our comingout party was the series against the , he said , referring to three games at yankee stadium in midseptember to beane , it hardly mattered that the a s won only one of them the yankees are the barometer for success in this league , and when we went toetotoe with them , that really told me something about this team , he said now his team is a division winner , with a couple of days to rest and contemplate its next miracle

the last time the knicks won a playoff game , iman shumpert was 10 since then , as the knicks have compiled the longest postseason losing streak in nba history 13 games every team other than the charlotte bobcats has won at least one playoff game but knicks fans can look back fondly on that 9789 firstround win over the toronto raptors on april 29 , 2001 in that game , allan houston led the knicks with 24 points and kurt thomas led them with 9 rebounds it was not all that long ago thomas is still active , even if he is the secondoldest player in the league vince carter , who is also active , was toronto s secondleading scorer , with 20 points he is now with the dallas mavericks , averaging 83 points in their first three playoff games thomas and carter are the exceptions in all , 14 of the 16 players who took part in the game are retired , including mark jackson , the current coach of the golden state warriors to get a better idea of how long ago that was , consider that george w bush was in his fourth month as the president barack obama was a state senator in illinois facebook did not exist , and neither did myspace now that the knicks trail , three games to none , in their bestofseven series against a starstudded team like the miami heat , their chances of a firstround upset are nearly nonexistent heading into game 4 on sunday at madison square garden but with the nets moving to brooklyn next season , perhaps some of their playoff success will rub off on the knicks since the knicks last postseason victory , the nets have won 43 playoff games

the day has not yet arrived where people can have microchips installed in their bodies that connect them to the internet , then go haywire and nearly annihilate the human race but bryan singer is happy to hasten that future along , even if it poses risks to the media in which he customarily operates mr singer , the director of films including the usual suspects , xmen and valkyrie , is the producer of the new web series h , which will make its debut aug 8 on youtube created by john cabrera and cosimo de tommaso , h tells a notsofarfetched story in which millions of people have communications chips installed in their bodies , and are then wiped out by a virus attacking the chips shuttling back and forth in time , h follows the survivors of that devastation while exploring the origins of the technology that caused it while viewers contemplate the amalgamation of man and machine anticipated in h , mr singer said he had been thinking about the blending of serialized drama and the web at some point these mediums are going to merge and there s going to be some kind of sea change in the way we observe content , he said in a telephone interview with a laugh , he added i just hope it doesn t make people not want to go to movie theaters because that s my day job mr singer , who was also a producer of the fox medical drama house , said h originally had been submitted to his bad hat harry production company as a traditional television series but its emphasis on technology , he said , and a pivotal event where all these implants malfunction and create massive , almost apocalyptic death , made it a natural fit for an online format by moving backwards and forwards in these smaller webisodes , the audience can piece together the mystery surrounding the event , mr singer said as opposed to a series where you might get lost , here they re in short , three to sixminute bursts , so each episode becomes kind of a cliffhanger or a piece in the greater puzzle that takes shape mr singer said his goal with h , directed by stewart hendler \( sorority row \) and with a cast including alexis denisof \( buffy the vampire slayer \) and hannah simone \( new girl \) , was to present an extremely cinematic series that would look and sound like real highquality television , but was presented online not that mr singer is moving away from film or television he is in postproduction on jack the giant killer , a fantasy adventure being released next year and he is directing an nbc pilot for mockingbird lane , which promises an updated take on the 1960s horrorcomedy the munsters it s not a remake of the munsters , mr singer said of the pilot , which stars jerry o connell as herman , portia de rossi as lily and eddie izzard as grandpa it s based on that universe it s got all the fun that those characters bring to it , and yet a very contemporary feel none of the campy makeup and all that stuff if the series goes forward , he added , we have access to all the universal monsters we ve already commissioned scripts so there are other characters being introduced it has a great potential to be a mixture of modern family with monsters while online video naturally competes with the movies and tv shows he creates , mr singer described it as another option for presenting material if anything , it s cannibalizing less time than a reality show , he said still , he expects that web content will become increasingly dominant , even if internettobrain interfaces will not whether you like it or not , people are going to live more and more on their pads , mr singer said eventually your entire content library literature , movies , television all of it s going to be sitting there on your phone if you want a bigger screen you might carry a pad otherwise you ll just plug it into something thank god people still need a place to take their date and hopefully the movie theaters will still be there but just in case , he added , i want to make sure i ve got my bases covered

susan cain \( , sunday review , jan 15 \) writes that creative people are more likely to be introverts that students learn better when alone and that solitary computer programmers write better code in each of these cases , research shows just the opposite decades of scientific research have revealed that great creativity is almost always based in collaboration , conversation and social networks just the opposite of our mythical image of the isolated genius and educational research has found that deeper learning results when students participate in thoughtful argumentation and discuss reasons and concepts the increasing use of collaboration , in classrooms and in the workplace , is not a shortlived fad it is solidly based in research , and it works keith sawyer st louis , jan 16 , 2012 susan cain jumbles teamwork , innovation , creativity , brainstorming and public school learning methods into what she calls collaboration , and thereby confuses the point in the best sense , collaboration is none of the above , and ms cain is wrong to equate it with groupthink as early as the 1970s , kenneth w thomas and ralph h kilmann at the university of pittsburgh identified collaboration as a problemsolving and conflictresolution technique in which both parties own the issue and seek to fulfill not only their own needs but also those of the other side it s the truest of the winwin models authentic collaboration has proved to be a powerful means of achieving more than either party might have accomplished solo the collaborative process may benefit from the input of individuals who are creative high achievers , but it s not dependent on them what s required are the actual stakeholders whose concerns are threatened by a conflict or a problem collaboration is at a far end of the problemsolving spectrum from mindnumbing , creativitysuppressing groupthink ed donovan pittsburgh , jan 17 , 2012 susan cain states , in one fourthgrade classroom i visited in new york city , students engaged in group work were forbidden to ask a question unless every member of the group had the very same question , suggesting that learning in groups is an obviously bad idea not only are there many ways to learn in groups \( are n't class discussions group learning \? \) , but i would also be very surprised if the students in that class were actually instructed in the manner that she contends it is a common practice , however , to instruct students learning in groups not to ask the teacher a question until that question has been asked to the other members of that group first if the teacher did instruct as presented , then that indeed would appear to be poor practice , but this does not mean that people ca n't learn effectively in groups larry satcowitz randolph , vt , jan 15 , 2012 the creative balance that susan cain seeks between individual and group thinking was sought \( and found \) almost 25 centuries ago by the ancient greeks treasuring personal introspection , they nurtured the life of the individual human mind that gave birth to the rational quest for truth known as philosophy but , as the symposiums presided over by socrates show , the greeks also recognized the synergistic power of multiple minds working together toward a common goal later , the library of alexandria became the world s first think tank as inventive scientists gathered and inspired one another to produce mechanical marvels as dazzling in their own way as the electronic wonders of today in the dynamic tension between the individual and the group , the greeks found the intellectual engine that powered their civilization and can power ours , if we choose to use it stephen bertman west bloomfield , mich , jan 16 , 2012
every so often someone asks me what s your favorite country , other than your own \? i 've always had the same answer taiwan taiwan \? why taiwan \? people ask very simple because taiwan is a barren rock in a typhoonladen sea with no natural resources to live off of it even has to import sand and gravel from china for construction yet it has the fourthlargest financial reserves in the world because rather than digging in the ground and mining whatever comes up , taiwan has mined its 23 million people , their talent , energy and intelligence men and women i always tell my friends in taiwan you 're the luckiest people in the world how did you get so lucky \? you have no oil , no iron ore , no forests , no diamonds , no gold , just a few small deposits of coal and natural gas and because of that you developed the habits and culture of honing your people s skills , which turns out to be the most valuable and only truly renewable resource in the world today that , at least , was my gut instinct but now we have proof a team from the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , has just come out with a fascinating little study mapping the correlation between performance on the program for international student assessment , or pisa , exam which every two years tests math , science and reading comprehension skills of 15yearolds in 65 countries and the total earnings on natural resources as a percentage of gdp for each participating country in short , how well do your high school kids do on math compared with how much oil you pump or how many diamonds you dig \? the results indicated that there was a a significant negative relationship between the money countries extract from national resources and the knowledge and skills of their high school population , said andreas schleicher , who oversees the pisa exams for the oecd this is a global pattern that holds across 65 countries that took part in the latest pisa assessment oil and pisa do n't mix \( see the data map at \) as the bible notes , added schleicher , moses arduously led the jews for 40 years through the desert just to bring them to the only country in the middle east that had no oil but moses may have gotten it right , after all today , israel has one of the most innovative economies , and its population enjoys a standard of living most of the oilrich countries in the region are not able to offer so hold the oil , and pass the books according to schleicher , in the latest pisa results , students in singapore , finland , south korea , hong kong and japan stand out as having high pisa scores and few natural resources , while qatar and kazakhstan stand out as having the highest oil rents and the lowest pisa scores \( saudi arabia , kuwait , oman , algeria , bahrain , iran and syria stood out the same way in a similar 2007 trends in international mathematics and science study , or timss , test , while , interestingly , students from lebanon , jordan and turkey also middle east states with few natural resources scored better \) also lagging in recent pisa scores , though , were students in many of the resourcerich countries of latin america , like brazil , mexico and argentina africa was not tested canada , australia and norway , also countries with high levels of natural resources , still score well on pisa , in large part , argues schleicher , because all three countries have established deliberate policies of saving and investing these resource rents , and not just consuming them add it all up and the numbers say that if you really want to know how a country is going to do in the 21st century , do n't count its oil reserves or gold mines , count its highly effective teachers , involved parents and committed students today s learning outcomes at school , says schleicher , are a powerful predictor for the wealth and social outcomes that countries will reap in the long run economists have long known about dutch disease , which happens when a country becomes so dependent on exporting natural resources that its currency soars in value and , as a result , its domestic manufacturing gets crushed as cheap imports flood in and exports become too expensive what the pisa team is revealing is a related disease societies that get addicted to their natural resources seem to develop parents and young people who lose some of the instincts , habits and incentives for doing homework and honing skills by , contrast , says schleicher , in countries with little in the way of natural resources finland , singapore or japan education has strong outcomes and a high status , at least in part because the public at large has understood that the country must live by its knowledge and skills and that these depend on the quality of education every parent and child in these countries knows that skills will decide the life chances of the child and nothing else is going to rescue them , so they build a whole culture and education system around it or as my indianamerican friend k r sridhar , the founder of the silicon valley fuelcell company bloom energy , likes to say , when you do n't have resources , you become resourceful that s why the foreign countries with the most companies listed on the nasdaq are israel , china hong kong , taiwan , india , south korea and singapore none of which can live off natural resources but there is an important message for the industrialized world in this study , too in these difficult economic times , it is tempting to buttress our own standards of living today by incurring even greater financial liabilities for the future to be sure , there is a role for stimulus in a prolonged recession , but the only sustainable way is to grow our way out by giving more people the knowledge and skills to compete , collaborate and connect in a way that drives our countries forward , argues schleicher in sum , says schleicher , knowledge and skills have become the global currency of 21stcentury economies , but there is no central bank that prints this currency everyone has to decide on their own how much they will print sure , it s great to have oil , gas and diamonds they can buy jobs but they 'll weaken your society in the long run unless they 're used to build schools and a culture of lifelong learning the thing that will keep you moving forward , says schleicher , is always what you bring to the table yourself
it took just one play on sept 15 to suggest the game between the southbridge pop warner pee wees and their rivals , the tantasqua braves , could mean trouble two tantasqua players were hit so hard that their coach pulled them off the field an emergency medical technician on the sidelines evaluated the boys , grew worried that they might have concussions , and had them take their pads off the boys on the teams were as young as 10 , and , because of rules about safety , none could weigh more than 120 pounds shortly after 3 pm at mcmahon field in southbridge , though , things quickly became worse six plays into the game , another brave was removed after a hard hit an official with the tantasqua team said the eyes of one of the boys were rolling back in his head but the game , an obvious mismatch between teams from neighboring towns in central massachusetts , went on , with southbridge building a 280 lead in the first quarter the game went on without the officials intervening it went on despite the fact that the braves , with three of their players already knocked out of the game , no longer had the required number of players to participate even with what are known as mercy rules regulations designed to limit a dominant team s ability to run up scores the touchdowns kept coming , and so did the concussions when the game ended , the final score was 520 , and five preadolescent boys had head injuries , the last hurt on the final play of the game the coaches , at the game s conclusion , shook hands , and then the southbridge team , with a military flourish , marched off the field in pairs like almost all pop warner games , this one played a little more than an hour s drive west of boston gained little attention but since then , it has emerged as one of the more disturbing episodes in the ever more controversial world of youth football in the days after the game , the injured boys were determined to have sustained concussions some parents accused southbridge s players of deliberately trying to hurt their sons scott lazo , southbridge s coach , accused the tantasqua coach of not properly training his team and jeopardizing them by not forfeiting if you lost that many players , you should have called a timeout and come seen me , lazo said in an interview this week my team is not dirty all the issues were on their side of the field this is a football game , not a hallmark moment late last week , league officials suspended the coaches for both teams for the rest of the season the referees who oversaw the game were barred from officiating any more contests in the central massachusetts pop warner league , and the presidents of both programs were put on probation but the debate the game has further fueled is not likely to calm any time soon head injuries in the national football league remain the league s greatest safety concern , and the league s greatest legal liability ivy league universities have ordered limits on contact in practice , to reduce the risk of brain injuries and pop warner , the national organization made up of hundreds of thousands of children , some as young as 5 , has adopted its own safety guidelines , based in part on the medical wisdom that the brains of young boys are particularly vulnerable still , as the massachusetts game suggests , rules are only as effective as the adults charged with enforcing them four of the five injured boys have resumed playing football for tantasqua the football programs in southbridge and tantasqua are from neighboring communities , and in rivalries , passion and pride can interfere with common sense a banner on southbridge s web site asks , are you tough enough \? lazo has coached in southbridge for 18 years , and says he idolizes vince lombardi , the hall of fame pro coach who was once said to declare , winning is n't everything it s the only thing yet even as the southbridge team pummeled tantasqua that day , parents on the losing side of the field wanted their sons to soldier on we were trying to play a football game , one parent of a tantasqua player wrote in an email every kid who was out there wanted to play and not give up pop warner has done more than perhaps any other organization to try to protect young players from head injuries in 2010 , the league told its coaches that if there was any doubt about a child s health , the player was to be removed from play coaches receive training in how to recognize concussions , and once a player is removed because of a concussion , he needs a doctor s note to return to games in june , pop warner told its coaches to limit player contact in practices and to eliminate fullspeed headon blocking and tackling drills yet on any given saturday , the rules may be bent or ignored , even by referees under pressure from parents and coaches having been there and coached , the game officials should have been more cognizant with this many kids going down and seeing the sidelines and the same kids going out there , said kevin guskiewicz , the founding director of the matthew gfeller sportrelated traumatic brain injury research center at the university of north carolina , who advises the ncaa and nfl what in the world was the coach thinking \? erik iller , tantasqua s coach , could not be reached for comment guskiewicz , whose three sons played pop warner football , said that it is often difficult to diagnose concussions in younger players because the injuries are invisible and the player must describe how he feels because teams are coached and organized by volunteers , the quality of care on the sidelines varies widely few leagues require that a physician be present , he said officials with the central massachusetts pop warner league did not seek to inquire into the southbridgetantasqua game until parents began to complain a week later even then , it took several weeks to hear from the coaches and officials the hearing took place last thursday at a hotel in worcester the coaches and the team presidents were there , and parents milled around outside the hearing room the meeting lasted about four hours and ended around midnight in a statement after the meeting , patrick inderwish , the president of the central massachusetts pop warner league , said , nothing is more important to pop warner than the safety and wellbeing of our players lazo , the southbridge coach , said the league committee that conducted the hearing told him he should have taken his team off the field he insisted , though , that he was not aware of the accumulating injuries on the other sideline he said the coach of tantasqua , iller , told the committee he had his team continue because he wanted the boys to score , and thus leave with something it s shocking there were five concussions diagnosed because it means there were probably many more , said chris nowinski , president of the sports legacy institute , a nonprofit organization involved in research on brain trauma among athletes and members of the military and with a roster that small , the kids might have felt pressure to keep playing speaking generally about youth coaches , he said , if you consider the coach is a fool , there are no rules that are foolproof
german soccer is abuzz after a professional player in the country s topflight league , the bundesliga , gave an interview earlier this week in which he recounted his life as a homosexual the player , who conducted the interview on the condition that he would not be identified , painted a mixed picture of the state of gay players at the top level of germany s dominant sport he said he felt compelled to put on an act and deny his true self to square his public image with the expectations of fans , who seek a stereotype of masculinity he also said the news media circus all but certain to ensue in the first few weeks after the first coming out of an active player was a major deterrent to going public at the same time , the player said his sexuality was an open secret among his fellow professionals , and that none of them had a problem with it he even said teammates asked him about his love life , and every so often , its technical details reaction to the interview , which was published on fluter , an otherwise littleread web magazine sponsored by a governmentfinanced ngo aimed at increasing civic participation , was immense extracts were splashed across the sports section of bild , the country s bestselling newspaper , and the interview spurred thinkpieces in the more highbrow zeit and spiegel the german association president wolfgang niersbach said that while he respected the decision of any player who wanted to keep his private life private , the dfb would offer any help it could to anyone wishing to come out publicly as gay by thursday , even chancellor angela merkel had offered her thoughts in a news conference after an event at the chancellery promoting intercultural integration through soccer , she was asked her opinion on footballers coming out i m of the opinion that anyone who has the strength and bravery to do it we in politics have been down this road should know that he lives in a country were he should not have to be afraid , she said that there is still fear out there , because of the particular context , is something we have to take into account , but we can give a signal you don t need to be afraid all this official support has been building for years niersbach s predecessor theo zwanziger was a highprofile supporter of antihomophobia efforts at all levels of german soccer a number of current and former national team players , including mario gomez , arne friedrich and thomas hitzlsperger , have also spoken out in support of acceptance of gays in the sport at the same time , all of those players have at various times been accused of being gay it is an assertion that has been floated frequently in recent years , and one which some players have taken in stride , while others have struggled philipp lahm wrote of his distress at rumors of his sexuality in his 2011 memoir the subtle difference , and told a story of encountering a male fan at his doorstep whose admiration ran deeper than the bayern munich defender was comfortable with in 2010 , meanwhile , michael ballack s lawyer and agent michael becker was reported to have groused to journalists that the german national team was in the grip of a gay combo becker suggested that journalists knew which players or coaches he meant , but that they were unwilling to publish names he said a certain explayer would make the names public soon enough that outing has not happened , and this week s anonymous interview may bring a full coming out , on the player s terms , a few steps closer in the interview he said he knew of many gay players in the league and hoped that one day there might be an avalanche of disclosures while he was not yet ready to take that step , he said , he told the interviewer they could meet again in a year , when maybe i can put my name to what s been said matt hermann is a journalist based in berlin and london he is a sports anchor on the journal on dw television and cohosts the bundesliga show podcast at follow him on

more than two decades ago , when alberto perez , a dance instructor , forgot music for his aerobics class forced to wing it , he used tapes from his personal collection , a hodgepodge of salsa and merengue songs and created dance moves to the rhythms the workout was a local hit , gaining popularity in cali , colombia , before mr perez decamped to miami in 1999 in 2001 , he met alberto perlman , then an unemployed technology entrepreneur still reeling from the dotcom bust mr perlman s mother , who was taking a class with mr perez , prodded her son to meet with her magical instructor at first , mr perlman was n't sure what to make of the dancer , who could not speak english and showed up to the meeting in a brokendown 1983 pontiac but after watching a class , mr perlman imagined the fitness program , which resembled an ad hoc dance party with catchy music , as the next infomercial hit he immediately called his longtime friend and business partner , alberto aghion , who had heard about mr perez through his sister i felt like i was looking into the window of a nightclub , said mr perlman , now the chief executive of zumba fitness this guy had taken the experience of saturday night and turned it into a fitness class on monday night later that year , the three men founded zumba fitness the company s initial goal was to make money by selling instructional videos via lowbudget infomercials but zumba s popularity skyrocketed when it began building a network of instructors a few years later over the last four years , the number of weekly zumba students has surged to 12 million from 1 million , according to data from the company zumba fitness derives a large amount of revenue from the membership fees it charges fitness instructors edmee cherdieu d'alexis , a former equinox fitness manager , built an entire business based on zumba s brand her startup , z club ny , connects manhattanites with zumba classes and instructors through an online portal the company rents locations , manages an elite group of vetted instructors and charges students 19 a class , offering discounts for larger packages to build the business , ms d'alexis , who received 100 , 000 in seed capital , has relied mainly on wordofmouth marketing and online offers at sites like groupon started in 2011 , the club now attracts 1 , 400 people a month eight months ago , we were not covering expenses , but now we are , ms d'alexis said but the exercise trend shows signs of saturation in some markets in new york alone , there are more than 500 licensed instructors , according to zumba s web site the competency of the instructors can also vary widely while many of z club ny s teachers have years of formal dance training , zumba fitness requires instructors only to attend an eighthour training session to obtain a license zumba s meteoric rise has also created considerable challenges for the company counterfeiters have been selling zumba apparel and pirated dvds not licensed by zumba fitness in one raid in britain last year , the company discovered thousands of counterfeit goods worth roughly 15 million zumba fitness now has a legal department of 10 people , roughly 5 percent of its total staff , focused on stamping out copyright violations and pursuing instructors who are using the brand without official licenses if zumba becomes more than a fad , it will be in the minority many fitness programs flame out after a few years tae bo , a workout that combines tae kwon do and boxing , was huge in the 1990s now you can buy the workout tapes for as little as 199 on amazon zumba fitness hopes to avoid the same fate by exploring new lines of business it is creating a concert program , which will pair live music and zumba instruction it has already organized onetime fitness events featuring contemporary artists like pit bull and wyclef jean for now , momentum is on zumba s side its official facebook page has attracted more than 34 million likes and fans include michelle obama and the singer jennifer lopez zumba is more than a fitness program it s representative of a whole lifestyle and attitude , mr ravitch said zumba is for dance fitness

8 56 pm updated washington the frontline regulator charged with overseeing jpmorgan chase conceded on wednesday that his agency stumbled when it overlooked a multibilliondollar trading loss that has damaged the bank s image and stock price at a senate banking committee hearing , the comptroller of the currency , thomas j curry , faced the brunt of the scrutiny , including a fiery round of questions from senator sherrod brown the ohio democrat asked whether the agency met a broad standard that it set for itself mr curry replied , no , not in this particular case we would expect to be aware of significant risks , he said in his first congressional testimony since taking the helm of the comptroller s office in april mr curry disclosed that the agency was conducting a critical selfreview , which he said he hoped would be completed in the next several weeks the hearing on wednesday was the second in a string of inquiries planned to examine jpmorgan s loss the hearing included testimony from officials at four other federal agencies the federal reserve , treasury department , consumer financial protection bureau and federal deposit insurance corporation in may , the committee called the leaders of the commodity futures trading commission and securities and exchange commission , which also regulate jpmorgan , to testify after the company disclosed that it lost at least 2 billion on dubious derivatives trading lawmakers are building to the muchawaited appearance next week of jpmorgan s chief executive , jamie dimon , who is expected to shed new light on the bank s trading blunder mr dimon is also scheduled to testify before the house financial services committee later in june while the jpmorgan trading loss does not appear to have caused systemic problems , it is a clear reminder that wall street continues to need better risk management , vigorous oversight and , if the rules are broken , unyielding enforcement , said senator tim johnson , the south dakota democrat who leads the banking committee the hearing on wednesday gave lawmakers a fresh opportunity to inveigh against wall street risktaking several democrats have seized on the news of the bank s loss , saying the case underscores a need to enforce a strict volcker rule the rule , named for paul a volcker , the former chairman of the federal reserve , would ban banks from trading with their own money , a practice known as proprietary trading support for the new regulations gained momentum after jpmorgan s loss disclosure last month but the scope of the rule , which regulators plan to complete in the coming months , is unclear for one , it allows banks to use hedges to offset risk regulators have yet to decide how broad to make that hedging exemption , prompting some democrats to push for clarity are you going to support closing the loopholes \? asked senator jeff merkley , an oregon democrat and a member of the senate banking committee who has championed the volcker rule regulators would not be pinned down , saying it was too soon to tell exactly what went wrong at jpmorgan but they did acknowledge that the jpmorgan loss would weigh on their deliberations when shaping the volcker rule i would think our experience here with jpmorgan chase would inform our views in the final rulemaking , mr curry said lawmakers also questioned regulators on the nuances of jpmorgan s trading , asking whether the volcker rule would have outlawed jpmorgan s positions with the line still blurred between hedging and proprietary trading , there was no clear answer at the outset , bank officials said they were hedging their broad exposure to the markets but as jpmorgan s position shifted and grew , the trades apparently turned into a risky proprietary bet neal s wolin , deputy secretary of the treasury , called the jpmorgan incident an important input in creating a strong volcker rule republicans , however , warned against overzealous regulation some have used jpmorgan s loss as an opportunity to argue for a stronger implementation of the volcker rule , said senator richard shelby of alabama , the ranking republican on the banking committee that position , he said , was a bit premature lawmakers , who occasionally digressed to express concern about the european debt crisis , saved the fireworks for mr curry senator robert menendez , democrat of new jersey , offered a broader critique of the office of the comptroller of the currency s oversight of wall street the occ has a welldeserved reputation for being too cozy with the banks , he said what i do n't want to see is a repeat of 2008 , when wall street risktaking led to a taxpayerfinanced bailout in the case of jpmorgan , some democrats said that of the 65 examiners from the comptroller s office assigned to the bank s manhattan headquarters , none kept a daily watch over the chief investment office , which was responsible for the trades and the agency has only five officials stationed in london , where the trades were executed those examiners must keep an eye on a halfdozen banks , mr curry said on wednesday we are assessing the adequacy of risk management throughout the bank , mr curry said he added that the agency was examining whether jpmorgan provided regulators with sufficient information about the trades despite lawmakers' attacks on wednesday , some noted that no one could remove all risk from wall street it s a fool s errand to think regulators are going to be ahead of bankers , said senator bob corker , republican of tennessee8 51 pm updated this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo thomas j curry , comptroller of the currency , right , said his agency was conducting a critical selfreview \( photograph by joshua roberts bloomberg news \)
washington the supreme court on tuesday ruled that small population variations among a state s congressional districts do not run afoul of the principle of one person , one vote , even though advances in computer mapping technology have made it possible to achieve nearperfect equality in representation the court also for the coming term , including one concerning whether the police need a warrant to draw blood from someone arrested on suspicion of drunken driving who refuses to consent , which was unanimous and unsigned , involved west virginia s three house districts it reversed from a threejudge panel of a federal court in charleston , wva , that had rejected house districts with slightly varying populations the supreme court in january , and it issued its ruling in time for the elections in november tuesday s ruling , like from the justices in january concerning electoral maps in texas , called for deference to judgments made by state legislators west virginia lawmakers had considered nine plans and had settled on one where the gap between the most populous and least populous districts was about 4 , 900 people , or 079 percent the legislature rejected what it called the perfect plan , which contemplated a population difference of a single person that appears , however , tuesday s decision said , to have been the only perfect aspect of the perfect plan the plan split counties , put the homes of two incumbents in the same district and moved a third of the state s population from one district to another the plan the legislature adopted did none of that , the decision said , and it moved just one county , representing 15 percent of the state s population , from one district to another the decision , tennant v jefferson county commission , no 111184 , noted that the leading supreme court decision in this area , in 1983 , had seemed to endorse a variance of 078 percent , which was almost the same as the one under review technological advances , tuesday s ruling said , altered neither the applicable legal standards nor how much dilution of the one person , one vote principle is tolerable the justices also agreed to decide a question that has divided the lower courts when do the police need a warrant to obtain blood in a drunkendriving investigation \? the case arose from the arrest of tyler g mcneely , who was pulled over for speeding on a missouri highway and exhibited , , the telltale signs of intoxication bloodshot eyes , slurred speech and the smell of alcohol on his breath he performed poorly on a field sobriety test and was arrested mr mcneely refused to take a breath test or , after being taken to a hospital , to consent to a blood test one was performed anyway , about 25 minutes after mr mcneely was pulled over , and it showed a blood alcohol level of 015 percent , almost twice the legal limit the state court suppressed the evidence , saying there had been no exigent circumstances that excused the failure to obtain a warrant warrantless intrusions of the body are not to be undertaken lightly , the court said in an unsigned opinion in 1966 , in , the supreme court said no warrant was required to take blood without the driver s consent after an accident where the driver and a passenger were injured the fact that alcohol levels diminish over time figured in the court s analysis , as did the time it took to investigate the scene of the accident and move the injured people to the hospital the question in the new case , missouri v mcneely , no 111425 , is whether the natural dissipation of blood alcohol by itself justifies taking blood without warrant in a routine case where , as the state court put it , there was no accident to investigate and no injuries to attend to
baltimore in a fall art season distinguished , so far , largely by a bland , nobrainer diet served up by manhattan s major museums , you have to hit the road for grittier fare and the walters art museum here is not too far to go to find it in a highfiber , conventionrattling show with the unglamorous title of  visually the exhibition is a gift , with marvelous things by artists familiar and revered d rer , rubens , veronese along with images most of us never knew existed together they map a history of art , politics and race that scholars have begun to pay attention to notably through the image of the black in western art , a multivolume book project edited by david bindman and henry louis gates jr but that few museums have addressed in fulldress style like the best scholarship , the walters show , organized by joaneath spicer , the museum s curator of renaissance and baroque art , is as much about questions as answers , and makes no bones about that many wall labels begin with an interrogative , suggesting that a museum visitor s reading of a particular image carries as much weight as the curator s and , like most ambitious but risky undertakings , it has flaws there is evidence of budget limitations although no corners were cut in getting crucial european loans , the catalog a good one has come in a third smaller in size than planned and with signs of changesatthelastminute production the presence of a chatty resource center midway through the show , with gamelike audienceparticipation activities on offer , will rile museum purists \( i have no problem with it \) and , in a show that tackles the issue of race headon , the line between an objective view of the past taken on its own terms and interpretation of it in light of the present can sometimes feel precariously drawn but in the end none of this matters the show is so interesting to look at and so fresh with historical news as to override reservations it does what few museum shows ever do it takes a prized piece of art history , one polished to a glow by generations of attention , and turns it in an unexpected direction , so it catches the searching , scouring rays of new investigative light europe s ties to africa were ancient but sporadic particularly strong bonds were forged during the heyday of the roman empire and in the 15th and 16th centuries , the period covered by the walters show , they were renewed true , as early the eighth century a pocket of intercontinental culture had sprung up in muslimoccupied southern spain but it was n't until that occupation was coming to a close that a broader exchange began by the mid1400s an expansionist europe was hungry for new materials and markets , and a globally minded roman catholic church sought new members well before vasco da gama first sailed around africa , portuguese merchants had opened trading depots along its west coast and enterprising africans were coming to europe in 1484 a congolese delegation visited lisbon on a diplomatic mission , and ethiopian christian pilgrims were establishing permanent communities in rome superficially africa and europe had embarked on an age of cosmopolitan rapport , an idea promoted in art it was during this period that the convention was introduced of including a black african as one of the three foreign kings in images of the adoration of the magi a beautiful early16thcentury flemish example and one with , exceptionally , two black figures , tenderly particularized , opens the walters show on a utopian note , with a vision of multicultural harmony in reality harmony was rarely associated with africa in the european mind known primarily secondhand from sensationalizing ancient texts , the african continent was often depicted in the renaissance as a place of freakish beasts and bestial , violenceprone , naturally subject peoples the attitude found its place in renaissance decorative objects like oil lamps and door pulls cast in the shape of african heads , and in paintings that routinely included darkskinned figures as servants or slaves slavery had a long institutional history in europe , and for centuries most slaves were white , from the eastern mediterranean and russia the source changed with the beginnings of an african slave trade in europe in the mid1400s and the complexion of european art , subtly but surely , changed with it we find a hint of this in a minutely detailed late16thcentury painting of a city square in lisbon bustling with black and whiteskinned figures from across the social spectrum we find it again in an exquisite drawing by d rer of a demure 20yearold black woman named katharina , a slave in the household of a portuguese patron the artist visited in antwerp in 1521 and we find it once more in a fragmentary painting by annibale carracci the original picture seems to have been a portrait of an aristocratic woman accompanied by her female slave but only the likeness of the slave survives , and her face , with its simmering , leveleyed gaze , is unforgettable being a domestic slave in urban europe was not necessarily a lifelong condition \( the situation was very different on new world plantations \) slaves could be freed by owners and take up independent professions the two black men , one young , one older , in a pair of fleet chalk drawings from around 1580 by paolo veronese might have worked as his assistants or apprentices , much as the former slave and mixedrace painter juan de pareja did in vel zquez s studio in madrid de pareja went on to have a painting career of his own , though he is largely remembered as the subject of one of vel zquez s most magnificent portraits but in general the names of black sitters in renaissance paintings and , no doubt , of black artists are lost who is , or was , the slightly stunnedlooking man wearing drop earrings , a gold chain and pearlencrusted cap in portrait of a wealthy african , by an unknown 16thcentury german or flemish artist \? or the regallooking personage , head swathed in a milkwhite turban , in an oil sketch whipped up on a sheet of repurposed accounting paper by peter paul rubens \? rubens s sitter is so attractive , we 'd love to know his story and we 'd especially love to know the story the true , gossipfree story behind the sitter in an agnolo bronzino portrait whose name has survived he s alessandro de' medici , who ruled florence for seven years before being assassinated in 1537 , and who is thought by historians to have been the illegitimate child of a popetobe , clement vii , and a black or biracial woman alessandro s dark skin was remarked on by contemporaries , who nicknamed him il moro \( the moor \) , a generic term for african in 16thcentury italy in bronzino s painting the subject s complexion is inconclusively ruddy but another portrait , this one of the ruler s young daughter giulia , has been cited by some scholars , who point to the child s black facial features , as confirmation of alessandro s ethnic heritage together these portraits probably attest to the reality of african dna flowing through medici blood , and through the very center of the european high renaissance but they are at least as interesting for the reactions they have provoked until recently art history has ignored , denied or at best tiptoed around their racial content , just as it has skimmed over the black presence in europe as a whole the walters exhibition not only asserts that presence , but positions it as a contributing factor to a crucial moment in the forming of european cultural identity by the early 17th century that moment seemed to have passed europe s attention turned to the americas and to asia africa became what it had started out being for europe a supply center for natural resources and cheap labor old attitudes of fear and disdain toward africa still the dominant view in the west returned and hardened so renaissance followed by regression is the show s bottomline theme or is it \? one of the saving graces of art what keeps you coming back to it is that it is n't a bottomline business you think you 've come to an end , a conclusion , and there s always more the exception , the extension and so it is in this case african europe lived on , in new places , and in new guises toward the end of the show , in a 1599 painting called the three mulattoes of esmereldas , we see three darkskinned men in european court attire but also wearing large gold nose ornaments and holding spears the painting , now in the prado , was done in spanish colonial ecuador it depicts a father and his two sons , descendants of african plantation slaves and new world natives , who were leaders of an afroindian community in this painting , commissioned from an ecuadorean artist as a gift to philip iii of spain , they present to europe as what they are related , different , equal african europe also continued to flourish on home turf in , among other places , popular religion the exhibition s final image is a resplendent 18thcentury carved wood sculpture of a roman catholic saint , benedict of palermo \( 152689 \) , who was born into a family of african slaves in sicily , led an exemplary life as a franciscan monk there , and was canonized in 1807 this saint is sometimes referred to as benedict the moor or benedict the african , and in the sculpture his racial identity is emphatically conveyed his grave face and extended hand are a rich ebony black , their darkness framed and amplified by the brilliant gilding of his robe by the time this sculpture was carved around 1734 , benedict had long since attracted an ardent following , in europe , in the colonial americas and in africa today he s the official patron saint of africanamerica , with churches in his honor from bahia to the bronx and images of him , no matter how stylistically varied , continue to combine traces of renaissance europe and of africa in him the two are inseparable , are one
the lamentations over the slow death of commercial off broadway theater have subsided , at least for a while it s true that over the past decade the city has lost at least a halfdozen spaces once devoted to presenting new work unsuitable for broadway , including the variety arts in the east village , the promenade theater on the upper west side \( now a sephora \) and the century center off union square i suppose we can consider it a happy coincidence that none has become a duane reade the result has sometimes been a stampede to broadway by shows that by all rights should remain off broadway witness the recent quick flop of the musical lysistrata jones at the same time the established notforprofit institutions that have long been the mainstay of the off broadway movement have not only survived but thrived in a tough economic environment between fullscale renovations and major building projects , most of the city s major off broadway companies have been in the process of regeneration and major fundraising over the past halfdozen years or more , resulting in some major changes in the landscape manhattan theater club , one of the standardbearers of off broadway since its founding in 1970 , acquired its own broadway venue , formerly the biltmore and now the samuel j friedman theater the second stage theater is now housed in a former bank sleekly redesigned by rem koolhaas , and it has signed an agreement to establish its own foothold on broadway , the helen hayes theater fundraising is under way theater for a new audience , a vital resource for smallscale but often excellent classical theater , broke ground on its 475 million theater complex near the brooklyn academy of music in june designed by another noted architect , hugh hardy , the new complex will feature a 299seat main stage this spring one of the city s most plush notforprofit theaters , lincoln center theater , will open a second off broadway space in a new structure plopped right on top of the vivian beaumont theater and the venerable public theater is in the process of getting a fullscale makeover of its multiple theater spaces perhaps most spectacular of all is the opening this spring of the 66 million pershing square signature center , the inviting new home of the signature theater company , designed by yet another alist architectural name , frank gehry as those who have had a chance to visit by now know , the signature center is a major upgrade from the signature s functional but modest previous home down the street it boasts three spaces , with seating capacities ranging from just under 200 to just under 300 you can enter the second floor lobby and caf area via elevators or an impressive twisting wooden staircase once there you can have coffee or a cocktail after collecting your tickets the lightfilled , open space reminds me of the national theater in london in the way it opens up theatergoing as a fluid social experience with three shows going up nightly at the moment , there is an inviting sense of hubbub just before curtain time at the performance of the lady from dubuque i saw on saturday night i happened to run into friends who were coming to see blood knot when i went to see blood knot a few weeks ago i had a chance to say hello to edward albee \( a small complaint with so much thought having gone into the creation of the space these days all renovations of performance spaces expand the bathroom facilities it was a bit dismaying that my knees were grinding into the back of the seat in front of me \) all this impressive building does bring with it potential pitfalls , however since it has moved to broadway , manhattan theater club has sometimes been less judicious in its selection of plays for its off broadway space at city center the first two plays it presented there this season zoe kazan s we live here and molly smith metzler s close up space were outright duds although the public theater has revived its dedication to shakespeare in recent seasons , this year the company s new play slate is on the thin side , with the season dominated by double engagements of the solo show the agony and the ecstasy of steve jobs and the return of gatz the danger is that these companies , with elaborate new theaters to fill , will lose sight of their missions the new york theater economy is already unhealthily broadwaycentric , and the idea that bigger is necessarily better is a dangerous one the development and creation of innovative new work , no matter how great its potential for popular appeal , is the bedrock of the off broadway mission , and with new theaters requiring more overhead to keep up , the impulse to go for the safe choice , the name playwright , may be even greater i also worry that this mania for building new lavish off broadway spaces will spread indiscriminately there is something to be said for sitting still and maintaining a historic home , after all i would be dismayed to hear that new york theater workshop , for instance , was embarking on a fundraising drive to build a new theater the company s current home on east 4th street has its logistical inconveniences there s no lobby to speak of , and the bathroom are puny but it remains one of the most appealing theaters in the city , in part because it has the kind of scruffy , repurposedbutungentrified feeling that new theater spaces inevitably lack there s nothing antiseptic about new york theater workshop s auditorium , and what it lacks in all mod cons it more than makes up for in funky , authentic east village charm and an element in the appeal of the grander broadway theaters , after all , is the history of prior performances that you feel has seeped into the spaces themselves there s no reason the same shouldn t hold true for off broadway theaters new york theater workshop has long been one of the city s more adventurous notforprofit houses , and its rawlooking but at the same time majestic auditorium has hosted some of the best new work the city has seen during its tenure , from the musical rent to new plays by caryl churchill and the experimental revivals of the flemish director ivo van hove it s

the republican candidates for president on friday condemned the shooting of an africanamerican teenager in florida that occurred several weeks ago , calling it a tragedy that demanded further investigation none of the republican hopefuls had made mention of the case as it played out on television during the past week but three of them ended their silence shortly after president obama weighed in from the white house friday morning two of them newt gingrich and rick santorum said they believed the state s selfdefense law does not apply in the case , in which a neighborhood watch captain named george zimmerman shot the youth , trayvon martin , as he was walking home as i understand florida law , what he was doing had nothing to do with the law that people are talking about , mr gingrich told reporters the law involved somebody who s coming at you as i understand it , he was trailing the young man the young man wasn t trailing him i suspect justice will be done mr santorum echoed that sentiment , saying that the law called stand your ground in florida should not be used to excuse the killing there s a difference between stand your ground and doing what he did , mr santorum said friday it s a horrible case , i mean it s chilling to hear what happened , and of course the fact that law enforcement didn t immediately go after and prosecute this case is another chilling example of horrible decisions made by people in this process mitt romney issued a statement from his campaign saying that what happened to trayvon martin is a tragedy there needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity the case could potentially put the candidates in a delicate position with some elements of the republican base selfdefense laws like the one in florida are strongly backed by the national rifle association  the statements from the candidates suggested they wanted to express outrage about the shooting without directly criticizing those laws mr gingrich offered the most detailed reaction to the case , saying that while he had not investigated it personally , the details of the case as reported in the media were tragic he said that reports that mr zimmerman had made many previous calls to police about suspicious people in his neighborhood makes it pretty clear that this is a guy who found a hobby that s very dangerous mr gingrich added that , having local citizens concerned about their safety is reasonable , having some kind of neighborhood watch is reasonable , but you had somebody who was clearly overreaching
the college of the holy cross s graduating class of 1972 included a number of particularly distinctive alumni a national football league running back who won a super bowl with the miami dolphins in 1973 , then established a successful legal career a writer who received the pulitzer prize even a justice of the supreme court none of them would have attended holy cross without the efforts of the rev john brooks , a theology professor the men eddie jenkins jr , edward p jones and clarence thomas , respectively are all africanamerican father brooks , who is white , recruited them in 1968 , when holy cross was a predominately white campus \( nowadays , roughly a quarter of the student body is made up of racial minorities \) he served as a confidant and guide , a sympathetic ear and a liaison to the school s management during their time at holy cross the businessweek editor diane brady chronicles the story of father brooks and these students in her book fraternity ms brady describes father brooks s sense of responsibility to his recruits it wasn t a responsibility for their success the choice to study and do the work was theirs alone , as it was for every student it was a responsibility to acknowledge that the college experience might not be as comfortable for the black students , that they didn t have the role models in the classroom or the easy comfort of being in the majority we at the choice thought that the story of father brooks , the alumni and their thoughts on the experience would be helpful for prospective students father brooks said he thought that the economic demands of a college education outweighed racial concerns , even more now than in the 1960s though there may be a bias , he said , if i identify a bright high school student , africanamerican , the biggest challenge is gathering the scholarships and the assistance to enable them to attend mr jenkins and stanley grayson , an alumnus who is now the chief operating officer of mr beal company , an investment bank , agreed that economic concerns were crucial , and that holy cross s intense academic program was a major challenge but the two men thought social pressures were a problem even students who did not face overt acts of racism were under extra scrutiny , as if people were waiting to see them fail , ms brady writes it was a culture shock at first , mr jenkins said of going to worcester , mass , which had a negligible black population , from queens , ny the hardest part probably was the isolation , he continued you had to create a home in a foreign land one of the hard parts was the music , joked mr grayson i think for a lot of people , when i got there in 68 , i and my colleagues represented the first real contact they had with people of color the two men spoke of tension underlying everyday interactions the black students formed their own ties on campus they created a black student union , which staged a successful walkout in 1969 when its members were disproportionately disciplined following a protest against general electric recruiters later , they successfully lobbied for a black corridor , a residence area dedicated to black students \( students of other racial backgrounds were allowed to live there , and some did \) mr grayson called the corridor one of the things that allowed me to survive at holy cross back in 1969 and 70 the corridor drew accusations of hypocrisy from students who felt their black classmates were avoiding integration mr jenkins defended the hall we wanted the refreshing feeling of coming home and sharing stories , he said mr grayson said a black corridor would probably be less important on a campus now , even though many schools offer lodgings for students with shared backgrounds the two men thought that engaging with the environment and classmates was crucial in making the most of college get involved and get engaged with the college , mr grayson said i think when you ve done that the adjustment becomes easier mr jenkins thought current students might lack a common cause , like the civil rights struggle , to draw them together students today say what is our purpose , and you have to find that purpose , he said today , you have to identify what is the major obstacle you have to overcome , and i think it s economics both were thankful for the friends they made at holy cross , black and white , and for father brooks , who stayed close even after graduation but perhaps another alumnus , quoted by ms brady , said it best i wasn t part of some program to father brooks , justice clarence thomas said i was a kid what are your thoughts about the minority experience on college campuses \? do you think the experience is similar now to that in 1968 \? if you have advice or experience to share about being a minority on campus , please let us know in the comment box below
berlin a tour bus carrying beachbound israeli vacationers exploded in a fireball on wednesday outside an airport in the bulgarian city of burgas , killing at least six people and wounding dozens more in what , and the united states called a terrorist bomb attack israel quickly blamed and promised a firm response photographs and video taken at the airport showed billowing black smoke from the explosion that left the bus a blackened skeleton , scorched several buses nearby , shattered windows and forced the airport to temporarily close witnesses quoted by israeli news media said some victims were on fire as they tried to escape the bus they said that many suffered severe burns and that body parts were flung around the parking lot iran had no immediate comment on israel s accusations , and no group claimed responsibility for the blast , which the bulgarian foreign minister said had been caused by a bomb placed in the bus s luggage compartment but if the israeli accusations are confirmed , the bulgarian blast would be the first successful attempt by iranian operatives to kill israelis in attacks abroad after a string of failed bomb plots targeting israeli diplomats in georgia , india and thailand this year even without such confirmation , the bulgarian explosion escalated the tensions between israel and iran that are already high because of the iranian , which israel has called a guise for iran to develop nuclear weapons despite tehran s repeated denials the explosion came only a few days after a suspected operative of hezbollah , the lebanese militant group with close ties to iran , was arrested in cyprus on suspicion of plotting to kill israeli tourists there that was big news in israel and reinforced the sense of suspicion that israelis vacationing abroad might be targets still , the deputy foreign minister of israel , danny ayalon , was quoted on israel s channel 2 television as saying there was no warning of the bulgaria attack the bulgarian foreign ministry said on its web site that the country s president , foreign minister and interior minister rushed to the scene and that the authorities were working on the theory that the explosion was a terrorist attack but did not specify who might be responsible in the capital , sofia , home to most of the 5 , 000 bulgarian jews in the overwhelmingly christian country of more than seven million , the mayor ordered police deployments in all public places linked to the jewish community , the associated press reported in washington , president obama said in a statement that he strongly condemned today s barbaric terrorist attack on israelis in bulgaria , but he did not specifically accuse iran in what appeared to be an obama administration effort to reinforce his support for israel , which mr obama s republican adversary , mitt romney , has called into question , the white house also said in a separate statement that mr obama had called prime minister benjamin netanyahu to offer his condolences , and had pledged to stand with israel in this difficult time , and provide whatever assistance is necessary to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators the bulgarian foreign ministry said at least six people had died and 30 had been wounded at least four victims suffered burns and shrapnel wounds , a local hospital official said all the victims were israeli except for the bulgarian tour operator mr netanyahu convened security consultations after the bus explosion , which he called a terror attack in bulgaria all signs point to iran , mr netanyahu said in a statement he and other israeli officials noted that the explosion came on the 18th anniversary of a bombing of an argentine jewish center in buenos aires that killed 85 people and wounded hundreds , an attack for which argentine prosecutors have blamed iran bellicose adversaries , israel and iran have a long history of accusing each other of terrorist attacks iran , which does not recognize israel s right to exist and has sometimes referred to israel as a zionist plague on the middle east , has blamed israeli agents for a string of assassinations of iranian nuclear scientists over the past five years , for which iran has vowed revenge israel has never confirmed or denied responsibility for those assassinations mr netanyahu s statement recalled what israel has described as iranian plots to target israelis in thailand , india , georgia , kenya , cyprus and other countries he called such a pattern a global iranian terror onslaught , and israel will react firmly to it burgas , on the black sea , is a popular destination for israelis the explosion occurred outside the terminal shortly after the victims arrived via a charter flight from tel aviv with 154 people , including eight children we were just getting on the bus when suddenly someone came near the bus s front door and exploded , gal malka told an israeli television station we heard a boom and next thing we saw were body parts scattered on the ground there were wounded people also on the ground i could see a burned hole in the side of the bus oren katz described tamping down the flames of a woman who had caught fire it was strange that there were so many security people around but none of them seemed to be focused on actually helping the wounded people , and could n't believe that i of all people was the one taking care of this burning woman and stopping her from burning up a spokesman for israel s private search and rescue organization , zaka , said it was preparing to send a team to bulgaria to collect body parts for identification and proper jewish burial burgas is 250 miles east of sofia in recent years burgas has become popular as an inexpensive destination for groups of israeli teenagers taking trips after finishing high school and before their military service some iran analysts in israel counseled caution about assigning responsibility for the bulgaria blast until more evidence was presented it s far too early to conclude who was behind the bombing in bulgaria today , said meir javedanfar , an iran expert at the interdisciplinary center in herzliya , israel for now all we have to go on are assumptions , and a list of credible suspects he did not rule out al qaeda , recalling the deadly attack on israeli tourists at a hotel in mombasa , kenya , in 2002 but others gave credence to mr netanyahu s suspicions , including some iranian experts who have criticized his policies toward iran though no evidence has been presented , he may not be wrong the government in tehran is a very likely suspect , said trita parsi , founder and president of the national iranian american council , in a column published by having failed to carry out bombings of harder israeli targets like diplomats , mr parsi wrote , it appears that tehran has shifted its focus to softer targets targeting unwitting tourists is much easier than securityconscious officials if this is the case , the ongoing dirty war between israel and iran may be getting out of control
albany declaring that government has failed to do what government should be doing , gov andrew m cuomo moved on monday to assert his influence over new york state s education policy , appointing a former citigroup chairman to lead a new commission charged with improving student performance the leader of the new panel , richard d parsons , had also been the chairman and chief executive of time warner mr cuomo , seated in his ceremonial office behind a placard that read putting students first , called for a souptonuts review of the state s education system among the topics he asked the panel to consider were teacher recruitment , school financing and the consolidation of school bureaucracies i want a blueprint , mr cuomo said i want a report that can be translated into legislation , which can be translated and enacted into an action plan to make this state s education system the best on the globe period that s what we 're looking for mr cuomo has made education an increasing priority this year , he negotiated the creation of a more rigorous evaluation system for teachers , and he is currently trying to broker a dispute over whether the evaluations should be released publicly he asked the commission to submit preliminary recommendations by dec 1 on monday , mr parsons declined to answer questions about specific ideas the panel might pursue , saying the commission needed time to get its footing none of us are here today to sort of beat up on the public school system , mr parsons said he noted that the state had many excellent public schools , adding , we 're going to be trying to figure out how do you make excellence systemic reality across the board , as opposed to the exception \? other commission members include randi weingarten , the president of the american federation of teachers , and geoffrey canada , the leader of the harlem children s zone the chancellors of the state and city universities of new york are also members , as is john b king jr , the state education commissioner but the panel does not include anyone from a parent advocacy group , an omission that some education advocates were quick to point out , nor any members of the board of regents , which is charged with overseeing the state s education policy leonie haimson , founder and executive director of class size matters , made up largely of new york city parents , sent a twitter message expressing her disappointment i'm upset and sure other parents are as well , she said in an email he seems so eager to say that he speaks for the students , by ignoring what parents have to say instead he selected the same bunch of corporate reformers , out to impose their large scale experiments on our kids asked whether his commission had stepped on the turf of the board of regents , mr cuomo said that dr king would represent the board on the panel the news release from the governor s office includes the list of commission members and their affiliations an administration official said part of its work would involve holding public hearings around the state the formation of the commission came as mr cuomo s office disclosed that david wakelyn , an education adviser , was leaving the administration mr cuomo appointed mr wakelyn , an official at the national governors association , in september to serve as his deputy secretary for education a spokesman for mr cuomo said mr wakelyn had submitted his resignation to take a consulting position thomas kaplan covers albany for the new york times follow him on twitter thomaskaplan this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo gov andrew m cuomo with richard d parsons , a former chairman of citigroup , on monday in albany mr cuomo appointed him to lead a group charged with improving student performance \( photograph by nathaniel brooks for the new york times \)
if you wanted to reproduce the conditions that led to the great recession in 2007 , the easiest way would be the plan gut the regulators who are supposed to keep the worst business practices in check at a time when the economy is still reeling from the downturn , house republicans released a spending bill that would severely cut the budget of the commodity futures trading commission , which would keep it from regulating potentially toxic swaps and other derivatives it refused to give the securities and exchange commission the extra money it needs to carry out the doddfrank financial reform bill and the bill would cripple the internal revenue service , limiting its ability to detect tax avoidance , particularly by businesses and the wealthy \( the irs cut , designed to impede the agency s role in health care reform , will inevitably increase the deficit \) the proposed cuts are the latest in a long series of efforts by republicans to keep the government from tempering even the most economically dangerous desires of business having failed to prevent the enactment of doddfrank and the new consumer financial protection bureau , they are imposing their will with what may be their most effective weapon choking off the air supply of regulators by limiting the money they can spend these agencies had already been hesitant to impose a real crackdown the cuts will make the situation worse the appropriations bills will have to be negotiated with the senate , but house leaders have often shown a willingness to let agencies and even the entire government shut down if such negotiations do not go their way with 710 employees , the cftc staff is barely big enough for its current responsibilities , let alone under doddfrank to oversee the huge overthecounter swaps market its budget is 205 million , which president obama proposed increasing to 308 million for 2013 to deal with swaps the house appropriations committee has proposed slashing next year s budget to 180 million the agency s chairman , gary gensler , the result of the house bill is to effectively put the interests of wall street ahead of those of the american public , by significantly underfunding the agency congress tasked to oversee derivatives the same complex financial instruments that helped contribute to the most significant economic downturn since the great depression as mr gensler pointed out , the market in swaps , at 300 trillion , is eight times larger than the futures market his agency has been regulating , and yet the house wants to cut the agency s budget significantly the house committee chairman , harold rogers , said the agency should return to its core duties , a statement that brazenly ignores a new set of duties congress put on the books the securities industry has already to prevent the cftc from imposing limits on commodities trading that can lead to excessive speculation , which can drive up the price of oil and other goods with good friends on the appropriations committee , however , the industry may not even need a favorable court ruling for the securities and exchange commission , whose role protecting investors was also enhanced by the reform law , the house provided only an extra 50 million \( far less than the 245 million increase requested by the president \) but limited the money to technology expenses none of it can pay for new watchdog employees the committee is clearly listening to wall street lobbyists who do not want the agency to enforce planned new regulations on moneymarket mutual funds the irs said it needed 945 million more in 2013 to make sure people have health insurance beginning in 2014 , and to keep up with tax cheats \( it already cut its staff by 5 , 000 last year \) the house provided none of that increase it is hard to believe that republicans are serious about reducing the deficit if they will not let the government s revenue agency do its job a few weeks ago , jpmorgan chase , a toobigtofail bank , lost at least 3 billion trading in derivatives regulators might have halted that if doddfrank were fully in place the republican response is to hobble the regulators even further an invitation to another financial disaster
sunday evening is the 64th annual writers guild awards , held simultaneously in los angeles and new york , where i will attend as a nominee modern family is up for best comedy series , homeland is up for best new series and my show , all my children , is up for best daytime drama , despite the fact that , last april , we were canceled after 41 years and around 11 , 000 episodes , we were replaced by a cooking show called the chew it s a bit like receiving a valentine right after you ve been dumped we re thrilled to be acknowledged for our work yet stung by the reminder that we never got to finish it if you had asked me back in high school what i thought i d end up doing for a living , writing for a soap opera would have ranked just below trapeze artist and slightly above wizard but lives take unexpected turns , and mine detoured to a fictional pennsylvania town called pine valley , where i met a collection of cads and divas , business tycoons and cosmetics queens , cops and con artists , and an evil twin , who unexpectedly crept into my heart my first job out of college was as a reporter for sports illustrated it was a dream come true , but i arrived just after the sun started going down on print journalism i was soon working for sicom , sitting in a windowless cubicle learning html coding i knew my future was not in cyberspace so i got permission to scale back to part time and enrolled in the mfa program at columbia , where an elective course in screenwriting led to a new ambition writing for television at the time i was obsessed with shows like sex and the city , six feet under , once and again and homicide shows with complicated , imperfect characters who weren t afraid to tell the truth , even if it meant going to emotionally uncomfortable places the process was different from journalism , but the pursuit was similar and i realized that was the kind of storytelling i wanted to do when i graduated i was in my mid20s with more than 40 , 000 in student loans i had zero experience or connections and i wanted to stay in my native new york city , despite the fact that nearly all scripted television was created in los angeles for months i spent nights and weekends writing spec scripts samples of existing shows an aspiring tv writer uses to try to get an agent but the query letters i sent out led to nothing that s when i turned to televisionwriting contests get your script read and evaluated by industry insiders ! more than 50 , 000 in cash and prizes ! it had to be a scam , i told myself but i couldn t turn down the chance that one of my scripts might be read by an actual human being even one laughing as he deposited my hardearned money into his offshore bank account at random i picked a contest and mailed off my script a couple of months later i received an email informing me i had won the top prize 500 and possible consideration by established production companies and agencies five months later i got another email , from the assistant to the director of talent development at abc , asking if i had any interest in doing a sample script for the abc daytime writer development program i was thinking , i ve never watched a soap opera in my life but what i typed was , i d love to take this opportunity i was assigned to all my children and received the same material as the show s writers outlines and scripts in gray envelopes marked confidential material , handdelivered three times a week i was to learn the characters histories and connections to everyone else on the canvas , as well as the rhythm of the dialogue , the pacing of the day and the scriptwriting vernacular at the end of three months , i was expected to be able to imagine what some of the most iconic characters in television history would say to one another the chandlers the martins erica kane and then i would write a script of my own for a chance at a job on the show my first script aired in july 2006 i wrote my last almost exactly five years later i got quite an education during that time on a typical soap opera there are three tiers of writers the head writer , the outline or breakdown writers and the scriptwriters head writers are responsible for coming up with longterm story breakdown writers take a week s worth of story and turn it into five outlines , one for each day scriptwriters take these outlines and turn them into scripts that was my job i collected a list of soapisms , the peculiar and hilarious terms we use in stage direction no one is ever shocked at the end of a scene they are klonged , gutpunched or poleaxed no one has an epiphany they are hit by a mazda there is lots of eyelock and liplock it would not be unusual to get an email from the editor saying something like , josh will no longer be buried alive in trunk we are going with a wooden coffin please track accordingly if i wasn t writing , i was reading if i wasn t reading , i was watching if i wasn t watching , i was revising i wrote scripts on airport floors and park benches , took conference calls on the beach and at the gym i was prepared to rewrite entire story lines in a matter of hours after the writers guild strike of 200708 , i cranked out three scripts in 10 days i turned in a script eight days before my daughter was born and was back at the keyboard nine weeks later and i knew people who d done this work for 30 years to put this productivity in perspective , seinfeld ran 180 episodes in nine years all my children produced that many episodes in nine months the first season of lost had 25 episodes in our last full year , i wrote 44 episodes roughly one per week and that was only onefifth of our annual total i was proud of the quantity of the work , but also of the content yes , soaps are overthetop and campy , but they can also be bold and socially relevant i wrote the funeral of a woman who wasn t really dead , but i also wrote the christening of a lesbian couple s child and although our scripts had their share of catfights and male posturing , they always served the story when i see women going at one another on reality shows about rich housewives or dlist celebrities , i don t know what that s serving in soaps , as at sports illustrated , i d missed the glory days when 30 million viewers tuned in to watch luke and laura tie the knot on general hospital in 1981 when the streak was over and susan lucci finally won her emmy award after 19 nominations when there weren t a thousand channels fragmenting us , but a dozen that brought us together when , in 1988 , there were seven soap operas taped in new york city and now there are none the last days of all my children turned out to be a soap opera within a soap opera we wrote the final week of scripts , five hours that sent the citizens of pine valley off into the sunset with the dignity they deserved but at the very last moment , we got a stay of execution a company swept in declaring they were going to continue our show on the internet so instead of a conclusion , we rewrote those precious last episodes to create a cliffhanger in the final scene , a troubled young man fires a gunshot into a room full of people who lives \? who dies \? find out when all my children returns on the world wide web ! just as my radar had gone off all those years back at sicom , when new media promised to take old media to unprecedented creative and financial heights , i wasn t buying it and i was right we didn t return the plan fell apart and now our characters are suspended , frozen in time , perhaps forever and we writers are left trying to figure out how to mourn people who never really existed but who had come to feel like family townies welcomes submissions at  joanna cohen , who has been nominated for three writers guild awards and two daytime emmys , is writing her first featurelength screenplay
chapel hill , nc finally it arrived on tuesday night stravinsky s rite of spring , performed at memorial hall on the campus of the university of north carolina here by the mariinsky orchestra , conducted by it had been a long , hard road longest for those who attended the academic conference from thursday through sunday , leading up to mariinsky concerts on monday and tuesday hardest for mr gergiev and the orchestra members , who had to compress their itinerary to outpace hurricane sandy after a concert in ann arbor , mich , on saturday night , they flew from detroit to newark on sunday morning , held a rehearsal and presented a concert there at the new jersey performing arts center , then flew here that night copious vodka greeted their arrival , according to emil j kang , the founder and director of carolina performing arts , which has presented the conference and concerts as part of a seasonlong series , , celebrating that stravinsky ballet s boisterous premiere in paris on may 29 , 1913 , an event now laden with myth on monday evening , in works by , shostakovich and strauss , the players sounded none the worse for their scramble on tuesday they sounded even better , in works by shostakovich and , and yes ! the rite of spring throughout the conference the rite had been heard only in snippets , many of which were fascinating in particular , early recordings by stravinsky and others put the word messy into circulation no question , performers in those days had to struggle with the work s innovations and difficulties , especially the rhythmic ones is struggle part of the work s aesthetic , in some ways intentionally built in \? and if so , does the work lose something at a time when a much higher technical level of performance prevails , making it sound almost easy for orchestras today \? the music historian richard taruskin stated his own preference for a modicum of messiness , or at least a willingness to put up with it his longtime friend and adversary pieter van den toorn argued that stravinsky s signature rhythmic and metric disruptions and displacements respond better to precision than to sloppiness there is certainly nothing messy about mr gergiev s performances , but neither does he make a fetish of smoothness or precision his rite delved deep into the character of the often strange sonorities , and in this orchestra from st petersburg \( perhaps more than in the london symphony orchestra , which he also directs \) he has the wherewithal to make them sound truly distinctive the orchestra s woodwinds , in particular , have a slightly untamed quality , which occasionally extends to rawness or harshness but reveals a world of colors nor does mr gergiev seek virtuosic display through sheer speed some of the most powerful effects in this performance came when he pulled the tempo back a notch the brasses provided the needed might , and the timpanist andrey khotin had a sensational night , between the rite and shostakovich s sixth symphony but no less impressive were wondrous moments of quiet , from the muted trumpets and in string tremolos the shostakovich performance was also a model the work s progress is sort of the opposite of inexorable , from a weighty , brooding largo through a highly charged allegro to a sometimes ditsy presto , and mr gergiev traced its dissipating moods in masterly fashion carolina performing arts commissioned no fewer than 12 works for its rite celebration , and the mariinsky presented two of them in their american premieres on tuesday ekaterina goncharova sang mr shchedrin s minimonodrama cleopatra and the snake , and sold it beautifully there is a lot of keening and moaning over shifting orchestral textures as cleopatra faces death , but ms goncharova never made an ugly sound her swells and retreats on longheld high notes were remarkable , and her few moments of pure , untortured singing were lovely as wideranging as it is concise , this work should have a big future with those flexible , adventurous sopranos who possess a fine sense of drama the commissioned work on monday was mr pintscher s chute d' toiles \( falling stars \) , part 1 a tribute to the artist anselm kiefer , titled for he created , it takes off particularly from what mr pintscher calls the sound' of lead in mr kiefer s sculptures , which involves melting motifs and clanging a lot of clanging the heavymetal opening made its point loud and long , and memorial hall , relatively small \( 1 , 400 seats \) and with dry acoustics , may not have been the best place to hear it in any case , it eventually spent its energy and melted perhaps too convincingly into a static and uninvolving central section before regaining it there was more shostakovich on monday the piano concerto no 1 in c minor , with as soloist and timur martynov in the elaborate trumpet part mr matsuev s pummeling virtuosity sat heavily on a work whose charm lies more in its fleetness and sardonicism , but the audience seemed to love it the monday program ended with strauss s grandiloquent heldenleben \( hero s life \) , which mr gergiev presented straightforwardly , not getting too wrapped up in the heroic aspect the concertmaster , roman simovic , was an excellent soloist in the hero s companion here , in strauss s luxuriant orchestration , you might have wanted more homogeneity in sound and style from the woodwinds but that tendency toward rawness certainly made vivid the section depicting strauss s er , the hero s carping adversaries
a federal judge in nebraska made the right call on tuesday when filed by seven state attorneys general against the requirement in the new health care law that most employers provide insurance coverage for contraception judge warren urbom did not rule on the bogus claim that president obama s contraception mandate , which specifically exempts houses of worship , violates the constitution he did not have to the judge said none of the plaintiffs , including the several religious groups that joined the lawsuit , could make the requisite showing that they faced direct and immediate harm for the simple reason that enforcement of the rule has been delayed until august 2013 the details of the obama administration s plan to give churchaffiliated hospitals , schools and other entities a way around having to pay for their employees' contraception by having insurance companies do so are still being worked out the judge did not buy the flimsy claim that the mandate would cause the states serious financial harm if it did go into effect this case clearly involves contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated , or indeed may not occur at all , the judge wrote in his opinion this fight is far from over the ruling may be appealed , and there are close to two dozen similar filings awaiting resolution by the courts shortly after the judge s decision , house republicans unveiled a labor , health and education spending bill that would allow employers to refuse to provide contraception coverage based on religious beliefs or moral convictions the months ago opponents of the mandate have heedlessly rushed into court to try to stop an important advance for women s health without even waiting to see the generous \( though legally unnecessary revisions \) the administration has promised to further accommodate religious employers
a centaur , a werewolf , a dragon , a giant turtle , two sphinxes , a mammoth spider and enough new mythological species to populate a second middleearth those characters would make many playwrights hesitate before trying to adapt the german author s 1979 novel , not to mention that the book is over 400 pages , features a story within a story and was turned into a in 1984 but none of this

runs it closes on sunday , which mr craig wrote and directed , focuses on roughly the novel s first third , which is a narrative unto itself i'm able to touch on every scene and do it quickly and cinematically , mr craig said in a phone interview but not with hollywood razzledazzle he added , it s a play about the imagination that s being told through the imagination imagination , rather than brute force or magic , actually saves fantastica , the setting of the complicated tale that bastian , the schoolboy protagonist , is reading a pudgy , bullied child , bastian \( natasha greenblatt \)

trials atreyu \( adamo ruggiero , above , flanked by walter borden , left , and billy merasty \) learns that only a human from the real world can bestow a new name on the empress and renew her kingdom

nearly four years after hurricanes ike and dolly wreaked havoc on the texas coast , thousands of texans are still waiting for housing assistance the longterm disaster recovery effort financed by the federal government has made little headway but where two state agencies faltered , another is stepping in according to a state report to the united states at the end of june , none of the 4 , 100 homes that were expected to be rebuilt or reconstructed with federal money were completed and by october , the state had spent only 10 percent of the federal money for longterm recovery i ca n't even let anyone in the house , said orison bolden of houston , whose home was damaged by ike it s just too shameful a blue tarp still covers her house in the third ward , a historically black neighborhood south of downtown although discouraged , she still hopes to receive assistance just fix my roof , she said i will try to go and find a job and fix the rest of my house piece by piece in the wake of the 2008 storms , the state estimated that 34 billion was needed to repair or replace housing for thousands of uninsured texans it was also estimated that local governments would need 19 billion to fix damage to infrastructure like streets , water and sewage systems , and emergency equipment after emergency crews had rolled out , congress appropriated 3 billion for texas to help finance the infrastructure and housing recovery texas received the first round of money , 13 billion , in march 2009 what followed , however , was a different kind of disaster , with long delays in money going out for housing texas was the worstperforming state in the country on expenditure of funds and disaster money , said mercedes m rquez , an assistant secretary of hud , which administers the program on the federal level she said the way the money was managed was a mistake gov s office said the federal government had caused the delay in allocating funds by not doling out the second round quickly mr perry wanted communities under the direction of local governments to control how federal money was used , so the state devised a financing allocation process that turned over decisionmaking to regional councils of local government officials the state s role was to oversee the process more than 200 local governments and nonprofits , still dealing with the emotions of the disaster , became responsible for executing recovery projects and complying with complex federal requirements on spending the money if they did not get it right , they risked not receiving reimbursements mr perry divided the administration of the program between two state agencies the nowdissolved texas department of rural affairs , which usually oversaw federal grants for rural development , was in charge of nonhousing projects the texas department of housing and community affairs , which had been criticized over the disaster recovery program it administered after hurricane rita in 2005 , oversaw the housing projects as hud noted in monitoring reports , the state did not enact standard procedures for how local governments should process applications and write contracts for projects the result was bureaucratic chaos mr perry s office fired back at hud the primary reasons that texas' expenditure rate is not faster are due to hud s delayed guidelines and bureaucratic micromanaging of the state s recovery efforts , kathy walt , mr perry s deputy chief of staff , said in a letter to ms m rquez in november in late 2009 , hud rejected texas' initial proposal for the second round of financing , 17 billion ms walt wrote that hud had demanded texas reach an agreement with advocates for lowincome housing who had filed complaints against the state before it would release the money i honestly believe the state was headed off a cliff with round 1 that they were not compliant with federal law , said john henneberger , codirector of the texas low income housing information service , which was involved in the talks many communities had skewed financing toward infrastructure repairs and away from the housing needs of individual families that lacked insurance or the financial means to rebuild after the storms , mr henneberger said , despite federal laws requiring that the state direct a certain amount of money toward housing assistance the poorest people were often left without help , and the state created a real problem in terms of not fairly serving people of color and persons with disabilities , he said an agreement in may 2010 between the governor s office and the housing advocates required the state to devote the majority of financing to housing in the second round , put performance measures and benchmarks in the state and local governments' contracts , and update the analysis the state used to identify poor and damaged areas needing aid hud refused to release the second round of financing until the updated analysis was completed and when hud accepted the state s new analysis in may , it again held the funds until local governments completed training on how to interpret and use the document in june , mr perry shifted the administration of the entire program to the general land office we determined that putting this function , the responsibility for recovery , under one single agency that s headed by a statewide elected official would lead to efficiencies that the other two agencies had n't really been able to achieve , said lucy nashed , a spokeswoman for mr perry only 236 houses had been rebuilt with the federal funds when the land office took over , said gary hagood , the office s deputy commissioner of financial management in eight months , the general land office helped increase the number of singlefamily homes rebuilt to 1 , 455 , and 932 homes are under construction this should have taken three or four years , but it just did n't happen , mr hagood said although he is a proponent of local control , he said that running the program at the state level would have been faster , but that the delays do not fall solely on the state hud can take up to 60 days to respond to submissions , and you have to work within their process , which is review , after review , after review , he said when he was brought in to revamp the program in early 2011 , mr hagood said , many of the contracts approved by state officials lacked performance measures and benchmarks for completion that s just something we ca n't have in a program that really has a limited timeline , he said mr hagood ensured aggressive timelines were put in the state s contracts the program is now scheduled to be complete by the end of 2015 , hud has released the remaining money , and the state is awarding grants to local governments under the rules of the conciliation agreement in total , 16 billion has been budgeted for housing needs , with 238 million \( 14 percent \) spent for nonhousing projects , 14 billion is budgeted , with 262 million \( 186 percent \) spent the state is going to have to belly up and take some responsibility here and put in place a better way to do it next time , mr henneberger said , or god forbid , the next hurricane or other major disaster , we 're going to pay once again to learn all these lessons all over again
boston imagine if the stock market were hijacked by computers that executed trades in a fraction of the time that it takes to blink since no mere mortal could understand the thinking behind such nanosecond trading , ordinary investors even longtime institutional traders would have little clue as to why any company s share price was moving up or down in any moment the values of wellestablished corporations would sometimes swing wildly from one second to the next and we slowreacting , human investors would n't know why you do n't really have to imagine this this is how our stock markets function today some 50 percent to 70 percent of all trading is done by traders who live in server parks , are nourished by direct current and speak only in binary pulses several other are starting to regulate this , or hft but in the united states , the deepseated bias toward liquidity the notion that more volume will always make it easier for investors to buy and sell shares has discouraged regulators from taking action lately , though , after several wellpublicized market blowups traced to hft , officials are having second thoughts in late september , the senate banking committee held a on the issue , and the securities and exchange commission is getting into the act with a panel discussion even wall street have whether a market flooded with speed demons is good for society the purpose of financial markets , remember , is not to provide a forum for splitsecond trading if you want to gamble , go to las vegas markets exist to provide some minimal level of liquidity , so that longterm investors have the confidence to invest and they exist so that companies and investors can discover how much an ownership position in , say , apple is worth when apple stock goes up , it sends a signal to other firms to invest in the same or similar technologies thus does a capitalist society allocate resources a wellfunctioning market can accommodate some hyperactive turnstile traders as long as it has enough legitimate investors people who are thinking about the outlook for companies down the road the reason that market squares like me harp on the long term is n't because we 're technologically illiterate it s because , again , society relies on the market to allocate capital if market signals are based on algorithms that become outmoded in a nanosecond , we end up with empty factories and useless investment how much effort do highspeed traders devote to analyzing the future prospects of apple \?

results and historical precedents to consider five different scenarios for the republican race going forward interpretation no 1 it s all over but the concession speeches what happens next the short version mr romney gets some real and sustainable momentum from florida and wraps up the nomination quickly and easily what happens next the long version mr romney gets a lift in national polls and takes a considerable lead in most surveys he easily wins next week s caucuses , building further momentum he begins to roll out more endorsements , including some important and surprising ones from conservative leaders who are trusted by the republican base rick santorum drops out and either endorses mr romney outright or otherwise makes clear that he considers mr romney the most acceptable choice newt gingrich either drops out or reverts to running a halfhearted campaign popular attention to the nomination race dwindles , and the news media s focus shifts to the general election the outcome of super tuesday is a foregone conclusion any further losses that mr romney takes are a result of special circumstances for instance , to mr gingrich in mr gingrich s home state of georgia precedent the 2000 republican race is the best example of a contest in which the frontrunner , george w bush , lost a couple of early states but was perhaps never in any real danger of losing the nomination the evidence for this is a fairly common path , historically speaking nominations are generally not won without at least a few twists and turns in the modern primary era , al gore was the only nonincumbent to sweep all 50 states there is also theoretical evidence for this scenario in the political science scholarship a nomination race is a delegatecounting contest in theory , but if at all possible , the nominee is picked by consensus , with influential party leaders nudging the process along if it seems to go astray mr romney is the clear choice of party leaders , having far more endorsements than any other candidate he was also the only candidate deemed to be acceptable by a majority of republicans in a january gallup survey the evidence against if there is evidence for this case in past nomination races , this cycle has not followed the pattern the polling has been much more volatile than in the past , and primary and caucus wins have produced fleeting momentum at best  in addition , republican voters already passed on one opportunity to wrap up the race early , turning against mr romney after his win in new hampshire in contrast to candidates like mr bush , mr romney lost his national polling lead after new hampshire , something that is usually the hallmark of a prolonged nomination campaign moreover , mr romney is potentially a flawed standardbearer for his party , having once held a number of positions that republican voters now regard as unacceptable and if republican opinion leaders are clearly against mr gingrich , their embrace of mr romney has been lukewarm  evaluation this scenario is plausible , but the evidence for it is more theoretical than empirical if it is to occur , we should begin to see some clear sign of it almost immediately , especially in national polls however , it should be noted that a candidate does not necessarily need to be a worldbeater to take advantage of this pathway to the nomination john kerry did so in 2004 he just has to be better than the alternatives interpretation no 2 florida is the new normal what happens next the short version florida is the best benchmark for the republican race going forward mr romney has a clear but not overwhelming advantage the race may continue for some time , particularly depending on the preferences of mr gingrich , but in such a way that the ultimate outcome is not seriously in doubt what happens next the long version mr romney endures a few more losses along the way , including in some midsize states , especially in the south however , he wins the clear majority of contests his advantages are accentuated by his performance in caucus states and his support among automatic delegates \( the republican equivalent of super delegates \) volatility in the race decreases mr romney holds a stable if not overwhelming lead in national polls there may be a point or two at which mr romney loses a state unexpectedly , but this is not accompanied by a pronounced decline in his national poll ratings meanwhile , some swing voters grow impatient with mr gingrich , especially as his path to the nomination becomes more mathematically implausible some of them begin to support mr romney just to get the contest over with precedent the 1992 democratic race featured a gadfly candidate , jerry brown , who was never any real threat to win the nomination bill clinton , the frontrunner that year , did endure a handful of losses to mr brown , but he never lost his lead in national polls and was able to place most of his focus on november the evidence for mr romney s 14point win in florida a large and diverse state bodes well for his chances going forward his win was fairly sweeping demographically somewhat less so geographically \( he actually lost a majority of counties \) but overall about at the level of a candidate who might expect to win about 40 of the 50 states there is some evidence based on my research into state and national polling that volatility tends to decrease as the race progresses and as candidate preferences solidify finally , this is arguably the path of least resistance the republican party has some real differences to work out if the tea party has had less presence in the republican race than might be expected , the underlying sentiments behind it have not necessarily eroded and it can be hard for a party to settle on a nominee quickly when a better one might be imagined at the same time , mr romney is probably the party s most rational choice he may have the best chance of defeating president obama , and in this campaign he has been careful not to stray from the party s general policy positions the evidence against although florida may be more populous than the other earlyvoting states , it does not necessarily follow that it has more predictive power and some of mr romney s advantage came from groups like cubanamericans that do not have a large presence in other states also , this scenario implies reduced volatility in the rest of the nomination contest but volatility has been so high that you could cut it in half and it would still be well aboveaverage evaluation this inbetween path tends to occur when a candidate who has little mathematical chance to win the race nevertheless refuses to drop out arguably , that could be true for mr gingrich , as it was for mr brown mr gingrich is disliked enough by party elites that he probably has little to lose by staying in the race and he may feel aggrieved enough by mr romney s campaign that he will continue on even if the odds are against him in addition , ron paul is likely to stay in the race for some time regardless of mr gingrich s decision in other words , this scenario is highly plausible but mr romney would only be in danger if he committed some gamechanging gaffe , with the risk diminishing as his mathematical advantage mounted interpretation no 3 anybody but romney \? certainly not newt what happens next the short version support for mr gingrich erodes more than support for mr romney builds there is a limited window of opportunity for mr santorum , but he needs considerable luck to take advantage of it mr romney probably wins , perhaps fairly easily , but there is some drama along the way what happens next the long version mr gingrich experiences a significant decline in national polls and does poorly in the caucus states he gets no more support from his super pac , and his campaign becomes increasingly unfocused however , republicans are not necessarily ready to gravitate to mr romney instead , they give mr santorum another look , and he is buoyed by some modest success like a strong finish in the minnesota caucus or a win in the missouri beauty contest primary  mr santorum is competitive in several super tuesday states , including ohio , and proves to be a reasonably strong match for mr romney in the debates mr gingrich is not eager to drop out , but some of his supporters gravitate toward mr santorum as he comes to be seen as more viable , perhaps forcing the issue still , mr santorum faces some considerable disadvantages he lacks resources , and is always running from behind in the delegate count he has a chance to win if everything breaks just right , but more likely concedes after a failed last stand in a state like texas or wisconsin on april 3 mr romney takes some limited damage for the general election , but of the kind that would make a difference only in an extremely close race precedent in recent nomination races , there has not been a good example of a third wheel candidate coming from behind to emerge with the nomination instead , this scenario bears more resemblance to the period between about 1968 and 1976 , when the nomination process was in a transitional phase jimmy carter in 1976 , for instance , was not an ideal democratic nominee , but prevailed after anybody but carter efforts fizzled the closest thing to an exception is probably 1972 , when george mcgovern came from behind to win the democratic nomination , but mr mcgovern took considerable advantage of the party s new delegate allocation rules , which he had helped to design the evidence for mr santorum s favorability ratings are fairly good , and in some ways he could complicate mr romney s calculus on the electability front , for instance , mr santorum has the best net favorability rating among general election voters , although it is still in netnegative territory and mr santorum is a reasonably good debater who has less baggage than mr gingrich meanwhile , mr gingrich has a number of clear flaws as a candidate \( one reason that mr romney has been able to limit mr gingrich s momentum is because of his monetary advantages , but another is because things like mr gingrich s associations with freddie mac are inherently hard to defend \) mr gingrich s campaign is not terribly wellorganized and is unlikely to do well in the caucus states , perhaps creating an opening for mr santorum the evidence against this scenario depends on the notion that there is a strong desire for an anybody but romney candidate and the evidence for that is mixed some polls suggest , for instance , that supporters of mr santorum prefer mr romney to mr gingrich , and that supporters of mr gingrich prefer mr romney to mr santorum in the florida exit polls , 65 percent of voters said that they would be satisfied with mr romney as their nominee , and 77 percent said that they liked mr romney personally mr santorum , meanwhile , was unable to take advantage of his momentum after a strong showing in iowa , despite some concerted effort by some key republican constituencies to get behind him one issue that mr santorum faces is that he is not of the tea party generation of republicans , instead having won his senate seat in 1994 and having taken a position in the party leadership another is that his emphasis , more conservative on social policy than on fiscal policy , cuts somewhat against the mood of the republican base right now finally , this scenario would be much more plausible if mr gingrich were to drop out and endorse mr santorum , but for the aforementioned reasons , mr gingrich may be unlikely to do so evaluation this scenario relies on a number of things coming together for mr santorum none of the individual elements are entirely implausible , but the odds are strongly against his pulling everything together and during the time that voters might be flipping to mr santorum from mr gingrich , mr romney would be expanding his delegate advantage , making mr santorum s path harder interpretation no 4 rinse , lather , repeat what happens next the short version there continues to be considerable volatility in the republican race and any advantage that mr romney has is tenuous but he retains a slight edge in national polls and a clearer one in the delegate math mr gingrich remains his main rival what happens next the long version mr romney gets little bounce in national polls from florida or if he does , it fades quickly he loses a couple of states in february , and a number of them on super tuesday still , mr romney also wins his share of states and remains reasonably wellprepared for a war of attrition the race remains volatile , and mr romney endures some potential general election damage but he is something like a 75 percent or 80 percent favorite to emerge with the nomination , with the victory probably occurring well before the convention precedent the 1984 democratic race was reasonably close between walter mondale and gary hart that race bears some resemblance to this one , in that mr mondale was an establishmentbacked nominee whom rankandfile voters had limited enthusiasm for still , mr mondale had a reasonably clear edge throughout the race in the delegate count , benefiting from this organizational advantages in caucus states , and he wrapped the nomination up before the convention the evidence for this is arguably the least assumptiondriven scenario it posits that the volatility so far in the republican race implies continued volatility it does not ignore the data from florida but it also does not ignore the evidence from south carolina instead , it suggests that the former was something of a highwater mark for mr romney and the latter a lowwater mark , and that the race will continue to oscillate between these two poles the news media could assist this outcome the news media tends to root for volatility , which can produce better storylines and mr gingrich might be able to exploit free media coverage in such a way that mitigates his disadvantage in paid media to mr romney the evidence against even if you take the first four earlyvoting states as a whole , they look reasonably good for mr romney he has received 40 percent of republican votes so far , versus 31 percent for mr gingrich , his nextclosest competitor one can argue that this analysis puts too much weight on florida , which was more populous than the other earlyvoting states but if you instead just average the vote share from the first four states , mr romney is not really any worse off he received 34 percent of the vote , on average , between iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and florida , versus 24 percent for mr gingrich therefore this scenario , like no 3 , tends to default the notion that there is a desire for an anybody but romney candidate , something for which the evidence is mixed and even if there is such a desire , mr romney s advantage in delegates is nontrivial , especially considering his likely win in virginia , where mr gingrich failed to qualify for the ballot evaluation highly plausible but this scenario does not necessarily result in mr romney being defeated instead , he could win ugly but probably by a clear enough margin to spare himself the spectacle of a brokered convention still , this interpretation would imply that there was some genuine doubt about the outcome and that it is early enough that the wrong sequence of events could put mr romney in a lot of danger interpretation no 5 florida was a fluke what happens next the short version a fight to the finish mr romney s win in florida resulted from idiosyncratic circumstances and has little predictive power for future states he might win the nomination nevertheless , but he and mr gingrich have assets and liabilities that roughly balance each other out what happens next the long version national polls continue to point toward a highly ambiguous result mr romney takes some hardtoexcuse losses in february perhaps he wins nevada because of his advantage among mormon voters , but he loses either arizona or michigan on feb 28 then his performance on super tuesday is underwhelming , and he loses ohio mr romney has a number of opportunities to rebound but may or may not take advantage of them mr santorum drops out of the race and although he might not endorse mr gingrich , most of his voters wind up in mr gingrich s camp there is some chance of a brokered convention under this scenario , and an outside chance of a compromise candidate who is not running for president currently precedent evenly matched fights to the finish have been rare the closest thing to an exception was the 2008 democratic nomination race the evidence for a large number of republican voters are unhappy with their field of candidates and in contrast to years like 2008 , the numbers have been worsening rather than improving the nominal frontrunner , mr romney , has arguably not had his vulnerabilities tested but in a prolonged race voters will come to weigh things like his health care bill against him national polls continue to show an even race , with mr romney struggling in some important states like missouri and ohio meanwhile , it can be argued that mr romney won florida because of his advantage in advertising dollars there is some suggestion that the regions in which mr romney performed the most strongly in florida are those where he ran an especially large percentage of advertisements in most states , the argument goes , mr gingrich would be able to overcome mr romney s advantage with a strong performance in the debates , but mr gingrich was uncharacteristically off his game in the two debates in florida the evidence against it is not as though mr romney s edge in advertising dollars is likely to evaporate instead , he should have the resources to counter any potential surge by mr gingrich , as he successfully did in both iowa and florida the national polls are a lagging indicator and reflect voters that have not been exposed to the campaign , but there is reasonably clear evidence for what happens once they are and there is no reason to simply ignore florida , which gave mr romney a decisive win and which is far more representative of the republican primary electorate than the other states which have voted so far evaluation this is essentially the progingrich spin on the outcome in florida , and its flaw is that it tends to assume that mr romney s advantages are transient when in fact they are more robust moreover , even if mr romney s flaws cut quite deeply , mr gingrich has an equal number of vulnerabilities and the math so far suggests that a race that goes backandforth in public sentiment may still leave mr romney with a considerable advantage in the delegate count

phoenix it started as a joke about 10 years ago chris bliss , a juggler and standup comedian of had been scanning the headlines for inspiration and discovered the controversy over a granite monument to the ten commandments in the rotunda of alabama s state judicial building instead of arguing over whether to leave up or take down these displays of the ten commandments , he said in a comedy routine , my suggestion is to put up displays of the bill of rights next to them and let people comparison shop funny or not , the idea intrigued him , so mr bliss set out to search for bill of rights monuments , only to find there were none he decided to try to build one , and to do it in arizona , a place that s known as contentious , a backwater , even , he said as he spoke last week , was beginning to take shape on a knoll overlooking the state capitol , in a plaza full of other monuments and memorials honoring women , veterans and , yes , the ten commandments before it could happen , though , mr bliss , who left phoenix for austin , tex , three years ago , had to figure out a way to get the legislature to approve the monument on a slice of public land in 2005 , he was a guest on a radio show hosted by kyrsten sinema , then a freshman state representative , and asked if she would sponsor a bill i'm a democrat , and this is arizona , ms sinema recalled telling him you need a republican to push this legislation for you \( republicans have been the majority in the legislature for at least 40 years \) i do n't like nos' for answers , mr bliss said ms sinema , who was elected to congress last month , devised a strategy for the legislation to be approved , she said in an interview , it would need the support of a staunch republican , preferably in the senate , where many bills sponsored by democrats implode she zeroed in on karen s johnson , whom she described as before there was a tea party \( ms johnson , who left the legislature in 2008 , prefers the conservative label \) hey , for heaven s sake , how could anybody not be supportive of this \? said ms johnson , who is perhaps better known for sponsoring a bill that would have allowed people with concealedweapon permits to carry guns at public colleges and universities she had no qualms about putting her name next to ms sinema s , who at 28 was the legislature s youngest member as well as an openly bisexual lawmaker whom a lot of people liked to pick on , as ms sinema put it the bill stipulated that the project had to be paid through private donations on mother s day , mr bliss raised more than 100 , 000 through a benefit concert here , out of 375 , 000 he has raised so far \( he said there is still about 10 , 000 to go \) the concert brought together some big names in both comedy and civil rights one of them , dick gregory , 80 , had marched alongside the rev dr martin luther king jr and staged hunger strikes in the name of racial equality another , tom smothers , 75 , was a star of the smothers brothers comedy hour , a toprated show on cbs from 1967 to 1969 before it was canceled over the provocative tone of its political commentary , particularly on the vietnam war the bill passed unanimously in the arizona house and senate in 2006 , which was unusual for a legislative body that remains politically divided it was an encouraging moment for mr bliss , who said it confirmed it was a mission worth committing to since then , he has gotten a commemorative bill of rights display unveiled outside the poweshiek county courthouse in montezuma , iowa , and another has been approved in everett , wash mr bliss has also begun raising money for a monument outside the texas supreme court building in austin the lead sculptor for the monument here , , has carved 10 slabs of limestone , one for each amendment they are planted outside the capitol and on saturday each slab is undulating and unique the first amendment resembles the tip of a key the second amendment , a pregnant woman s profile mr kincannon trained at the stoneyard at the cathedral church of st john the divine in manhattan he worked there for 27 years , carving and building its ornate south tower he said he wanted the monument s pieces to have movement when they were next to each other so they would become inviting to the eye the blocks of limestone came from a quarry near austin , where they were milled and carved over the summer the heaviest , at about 7 , 000 pounds , carries the imprint of the fifth amendment , which protects against abuse of government authority in a legal procedure the lightest , at 2 , 500 pounds , offers the third amendment , which prohibits quartering soldiers in private homes without the homeowner s consent mr kincannon has read the material over and over , and from many angles to him , the project was never about the significance behind the words , but about making them comfortable to read , he said for mr bliss , however , it is all about the words' meaning he envisions the monument as a place for learning and reflection , our bedrock principles broken up in 10 digestible bites , he said
in his first group photo with world leaders , at the g20 summit in london in april 2009 , president obama was all smiles but as he faces reelection in six months , a quick glance back at the photograph might not be reassuring most of the people who were leading the world s major economies when the photo was snapped are no longer in office , primarily the political victims of the global economic recession and voter anger that has been directed at incumbents in countries around the world gone from the photo are gordon brown of britain , kevin rudd of australia , jos luis rodr guez zapatero of spain , taro aso of japan and silvio berlusconi of italy nicolas sarkozy , who stood a few feet from mr obama in the photo , was defeated in the french presidential election on sunday only two people still leading major western powers angela merkel of germany and stephen harper of canada were at the london meeting \( mr harper missed the photo , however \) the question for mr obama as his campaign battles mitt romney is whether the forces that swept so many of his contemporaries out of office are also building in the united states and if so , what he can do about it after mr sarkozy s defeat over the weekend , many political observers in the united states tried to find a lesson in it for mr obama some have suggested that voters across europe and elsewhere are rejecting tough austerity measures that appears to have been the message in france , where voters embraced fran ois hollande s criticism of mr sarkozy s policies and in greece , where george a papandreou , the prime minister , stepped down late last year to clear the way for a debt deal with other european nations , voters again punished leaders who advocated austerity if american voters follow suit , that could favor mr obama in his faceoff with mr romney , who is calling for tougher cuts to address the nation s debt and deficit mr obama , like mr hollande , has been arguing for a mix of cuts and stimulus to deal with the global economic crisis but the message from voters across the globe may be more about registering their anger with incumbents whatever their policies than a rejection of specific policies in the wake of the economic recession in australia , mr rudd lost an internal power struggle amid declining public support for his stimulus policies and climate change legislation similar to a capandtrade program favored by some democrats in the united states he stepped down as prime minister in june 2010 in italy , mr berlusconi resigned as prime minister late last year after growing concern about his country s fiscal problems during the european debt crisis \( he also faced inquiries into sex scandals that had plagued him for years \) british voters rejected mr brown as prime minister in 2010 , after he presided over the country during the global financial collapse they turned to the more conservative david cameron to lead the country into a recovery an outcome that mr romney would like to repeat in the united states campaign aides for mr obama and mr romney declined to comment on they lessons they have drawn from mr sarkozy s defeat at the white house on monday , jay carney , the president s spokesman , noted that each country has its own circumstances and emphasized mr obama s efforts to balance the interests at stake in the economic recovery a balanced approach towards fiscal consolidation and growth is what he believes is appropriate , mr carney said that s the approach he s taken here will that be enough to keep mr obama from the same fate that has befallen so many of his fellow leaders \? mr romney s campaign is focused on convincing american voters that the president s approach to the economic recession was misguided and insufficient americans are disappointed in president obama s liberal policies that haven t made their lives any better , amanda henneberg , a spokeswoman for mr romney , said in an email monday morning president obama just hasn t lived up to his promises mr obama s political advisers are determined to defend his record and to describe mr romney s proposals as nothing more than a return to the era of george w bush the president has faced a combination of crises that few others have had to deal with , all at the same time , starting on day 1 , jim messina , the president s campaign manager , said on a conference call monday morning he has made bold and brave decisions to help get his economy back on its feet we re proud of that record , mr messina said the outcome of that fundamental debate will likely determine whether mr obama joins mr sarkozy and the other world leaders in an early , postrecession retirement that none of them hoped to take quite so soon
charlie rose and his production company have agreed to pay as much as 250 , 000 to settle a classaction lawsuit brought by a former unpaid intern who claimed minimumwage violations under the settlement , which was announced on thursday , mr rose and his production company , charlie rose inc , will pay back wages to a potential class of 189 interns the settlement calls for many of the interns to receive about 1 , 100 each 110 a week in back pay , up to a maximum of 10 weeks , the approximate length of a school semester the main plaintiff , lucy bickerton , said she was not paid when she worked 25 hours a week for the charlie rose show from june through august 2007 ms bickerton said her responsibilities at the show , which appears on pbs stations , included providing background research for mr rose about interview guests , putting together press packets , escorting guests through the studio and cleaning up the green room ms bickerton said in an interview that the settlement was a really important moment for this movement against unpaid internships this is the first settlement in a series of lawsuits brought by unpaid interns who asserted that they had suffered minimumwage violations other such lawsuits have been filed against the hearst corporation and fox entertainment both companies deny that they failed to comply with wage and hour laws regarding their interns workplace experts say hundreds of thousands of young americans work as unpaid interns each year as they seek to gain experience in desired industries but some interns and labor advocates assert that many employers are violating federal and state laws by using unpaid interns essentially to do the jobs of other workers and by not providing a true educational experience this settlement agreement states that mr rose and his production company do not admit any liability or wrongdoing and that they agreed solely for the purpose of avoiding the costs and disruption of ongoing litigation and to settle all claims a statement issued on behalf of mr rose and his production company said , our interns are not employees they did not perform work for the program and none of them ever expected to be paid for their internship rachel bien , a lawyer for ms bickerton , said , we are very pleased with this settlement , and hope that many former interns will come forward to claim the amounts they are due for their work the settlement also calls for 50 , 000 in fees for ms bickerton s lawyers the agreement covers interns who worked for the rose show between march 14 , 2006 , and oct 1 , 2012 under the agreement , individual interns will need to file a claim to be part of the settlement the 110aweek settlement payment is based on an average internship day of six hours and an average internship week of 25 days the 10week maximum will not apply to those who interned for the show for more than one semester ms bickerton s lawsuit was brought under new york state law , which allows plaintiffs to seek back wages going back six years , and not under federal law , which sets a threeyear limit the lawsuit noted that unpaid internships have proliferated among many whitecollar professions , including film , journalism , fashion and book publishing as more interns have complained and the labor department has threatened taking action , some companies have changed their compensation policy fox entertainment started paying its interns in july 2010 most were unpaid before that and cond nast adopted a policy of giving its interns a 550 stipend per semester
earlier this week , a wellknown company went public in a complicated transaction that involved a handful of wall street sharpies and a mysterious investment vehicle called a spac the company was burger king seriously if you are surprised to learn that the home of the whopper not to mention would find itself the subject of , you should n't be burger king has long been an enrichment scheme for clever financiers , who have sucked hundreds of millions of dollars out of it over the years maybe it will be different this time or maybe not financial engineering has been part of the burger king story for so long that it s hard to believe there is still anything worth plucking from its carcass it s been run as a cash cow for wall street , said bob goldin , an executive vice president of technomic , a food service consulting firm along the way , numerous strategy shifts and marketing campaigns and has been constantly starved for cash but , hey , the guys got theirs and is n't that what really matters \? burger king first became financial fodder in 1967 when it was bought by pillsbury , which did n't have a clue about how to run a restaurant chain then in 1988 , a british company , grand metropolitan , initiated a hostile takeover and won pillsbury the new owners vowed to turn burger king around it did n't happen nine years later , , by which time burger king s role was well established it shipped cash to headquarters , even as it lagged ever further behind mcdonald s enter tada ! private equity in 2002 , , along with two private equity firms , tgp and hmmm , teamed up to buy burger king this is exactly the kind of situation private equity firms like to trumpet taking over a downtrodden company and nursing it back to health and to get them their due , burger king s new owners did some good , stabilizing both the company and the franchisees , many of whom were in worse shape than burger king itself but the private equity investors also cut themselves an incredibly sweet deal their 15 billion purchase price of their own money the rest was borrowed they immediately began taking out tens of millions of dollars in fees four years later , they took burger king public but , first , they rewarded themselves with a 448 million dividend in all , , the firms received 511 million in dividend , fees , expense reimbursements and interest while still retaining a 76 percent stake does it need to be said that burger king was soon back to its old struggling self \? or that the solution , once again , was to sell to another private equity firm \? of course not ! in 2010 , bain , goldman and tpg cashed out , , for 33 billion in sum , the original private equity troika reaped a fortune by selling a company that was in nearly as much trouble as it had been when they first bought it surely this represents the apotheosis of financial engineering what has 3g done \? according to howard penney , the managing director at hedgeye , it has prettied up the pig by laying off a large percentage of the staff in burger king s miami headquarters burger king s owners grew earnings , he said , by cutting expenses they have not improved the business one iota and , of course , 3g pulled out fees and dividends , too in all , , private equity firms have taken for themselves 1 billion or more in capital that could have been used to improve the company s relative standing versus its competitors , many of whom burger king struggles to keep up with this latest deal is just as complicated as the ones that have come before three financiers , including william ackman , the wellknown shareholder activist , put together a special purpose acquisition company , a vehicle that allows them to raise money , buy a company and take it public without the hassle of an ipo the spac then bought a stake in burger king , though 3g is still in charge on its first day of trading , burger king had a market value of 33 billion when you include its fees and dividends , 3g has already made a tidy sum on its original investment ackman told me that the 3g guys are the best operators around , bar none he sent me a presentation for investors that suggests that the owners are prepared to modernize the stores , expand abroad and make other moves that are necessary for burger king to remain competitive for the sake of all the people whose livelihoods depend on burger king , let s hope that happens and if it does n't \? the financiers will still make money they always do
\( moshi moshi cooperative music \) the joy of s the 2009 collaboration by the malawian singer esau mwamwaya and the production team radioclit , was the way it turned a gimmick african singer meets electronic music programmers and indierock into a sleek affirmation of global technology that still sounded human the afroeuro balance was far trickier than it sounded , and on the followup studio album , mtmtmk , the partnership is more complicated and less satisfying during the past three years club beats have thumped their way into pop meanwhile , half of radioclit , the producer etienne tron , has left the very best , which is now the duo of mr mwamwaya and johan hugo karlberg a free mixtape they released last year , mingled ebullient new songs of their own , like miracle with the senegalese singer baaba maal , with throwaway variations on familiar songs by , among others , billy idol and kanye west with mtmtmk the very best has chosen to pull many of its new songs out of the previous album s sunny cyberafrican utopia and into clubhand , with au courant synthesizer tones , autotune vocal effects and input from pop hitmakers bruno mars and k'naan , who collaborated on writing we ok k'naan also sings on the track picked up on the optimistic bounce of the previous album so did the nigerian singer , who joins the very best on but mtmtmk opens new territory for the duo , often darker yet more garish , like a club pierced by strobe lights adani , with lyrics in chichewa , a bantu language , advising love your enemies more than friends , starts with the majorchord vocal harmonies that filled warm heart of africa , but swerves toward minor keys and antsy synthesizer blips , as if those enemies are widespread despite a jokey video clip and a synthetic , houseflavored beat warns that moses has misled god s chosen children , and that god is angry the album holds some promising experiments bantu , which features the malian couple amadou et mariam , floats mostly without an explicit beat in a psychedelic african haze with sitartoned electric guitar nkango puts watery splashes and twangy string tones behind its choral harmonies unfortunately , it just fades out after a minute and a half moto , with ricocheting vocal harmonies , finds a way to africanize trance triumphalism and i wanna go away tootles like a merry electronic calliope , although its lyrics beg , soldier do n't come to kill my family and friends but too often on this album the very best accepts established genres reggae , electro , house instead of making its own instead of making its own style , it just sounds fashionable \( 4ad \) george lewis jr sings as if he ca n't be touched cool , slick , distant all over confess , his second album as he gives off the air of impenetrability , a man too fast to follow , too oily to grab tight the words tell a different story , though turns out that standoffishness is just a defense mechanism inside he s torn to shreds you wanna meet in misery park by the moon so low and lovely with the gloom that s above me , he sings on run my heart , over taut mid80s guitars accenting his loneliness on this album mr lewis s time capsule dates to a very specific moment , the one when the cure was at its most vibrant and poppy , and when depeche mode was finding its dark center while there are hints of steel drum on golden light and patient that signal something more than mere mimicry at play here , mr lewis is still full of fealty for that time you call me on sits atop a clangor of guitars and synths and drums , all cold and speedy , and the multitracked vocals on beg for the night are appropriately ethereal sometimes his remove is too much , as on the one he can sound uninterested in the person who s breaking his heart but most of the time he s bleeding , which is to say alive which has the bubbly density of early erasure , is the emotional centerpiece of the album you are adored but you say you 're alone like i'm nothing at all that s how you punish me , mr lewis sings dryly but a bit later he finally turns the tables maybe you do n't want no one to find out that i was the one taking love from you then the song crescendos into some princelike guitars while mr lewis , presumably , stands there smugly , feeling redeemed \( warner brothers \) the nashville garagerock band jeff the brotherhood , made up of jake and jamin orrall , started 11 years ago during the orralls' preadolescence they had made two albums before either brother had turned 20 they wrote feckless , shortorder , hardrocking slacker songs , casual or mockmystical or jokey and they became almost proudly derivative , particularly of the big , distorted riffs and melodic phrasing of early weezer since they started , a lot of other guitaranddrum duos the white stripes , the black keys , japandroids appeared or expanded or exhausted their experiment but the orralls , displaying lower aesthetic ambitions and sticking to more basic pleasures than any of those , remain superachievers committed to making underachieved music hypnotic nights , the band s seventh album , is its first on a label other than its own , , and its first with outside production help , from dan auerbach of the black keys it s not brain surgery perhaps not even middleschool science \( the first two songs are about cooling off on a hot day \) but it s more even and settled than anything the band has done better arranged , better constructed , better mixed , more precise in the details and it has a certain power , in the way that any music heavily practiced and felt in the bones often does , perhaps even more so from a family band the orralls have a good fasttempo feel \( hypnotic mind \) and a good slowtempo feel \( leave me out \) that s a lot and they 've got an interest in a some other rock dispositions and subcultures psychedelia , german artrock , sonic youthlike noise breakdowns but none of that is particularly special it s the simpler stuff that s special projecting dimness is not easy it demands rigorous mental energy keep your expectations low , and this record makes a kind of sense

newark , ohio one of the most secretive rituals of the presidential race unfolded in plain sight over the weekend as stood a few paces behind , watching and smiling , while a procession of prospective running mates delivered their best arguments against president obama s reelection he said everything is fine do you think it s fine \? senator of ohio asked a crowd gathered here in the town square on sunday , reminding them of the president s recent on the condition of the private sector several hundred people roared back no ! a day earlier , former gov of minnesota fired up a pennsylvania audience as he shouted , have you had enough of obamacare \? as the republicans loudly replied yes , mr romney clapped his hands and joined in the revelry a growing sense of optimism surrounded mr romney as he campaigned on a fiveday bus tour through a halfdozen states that mr obama carried in 2008 , at least some of which seem to be within the republican s grasp his caravan doubled as a series of rolling auditions , a chance for mr romney and his family to measure their comfort level with a potential partner on the ticket representative of wisconsin , the chairman of the house budget committee and a favorite of many fiscal conservatives , takes his turn on monday when he welcomes mr romney to his hometown , janesville the list is also thought to include at least two governors , of new jersey and of louisiana , and two senators , of south dakota and of florida with some advisers pushing for an announcement as early as july , the roster of potential running mates is being whittled down by mr romney , who has said that one quality rises above all his vicepresidential nominee must be unquestionably prepared to be president , not simply to grow into the job and , mr romney has told his aides , he must feel that the candidate s ambitions are directed at getting him elected in november the selection is still done with intense secrecy , but the romney campaign has intentionally sought to eliminate at least some of the mystery about who might run the backtoback tryouts , first with mr pawlenty , and then with mr portman flipping pancakes with mr romney on sunday and standing alongside him for much of the day , provided a chance for the campaign to assess how mr romney and either of the two would look as a ticket in the privacy of mr romney s bus , the two chatted about politics and policy as they chugged across ohio mr portman even helped clean up some of mr romney s grandchildren , who were out on the road for the day and messy from blueberry pie mr portman , who was elected to the senate in 2010 after representing the cincinnati area in congress for 12 years , is seen as a leading prospect he fits mr romney s strategic imperative for governing , after serving in both bush administrations yet he has told friends he is unsure whether his work for president george w bush , particularly as the budget director , would be a drawback and provide an opening for mr obama to argue that he inherited a growing deficit mr portman , 56 , endorsed mr romney early and campaigned at his side during difficult days in his republican primary race the two men have had long conservations about governing he declines to discuss the possibility of being named , perfecting another requisite acting uninterested i'm happy where i am , you know \? mr portman told one voter on sunday mr romney , who has been thinking about a running mate since well before he locked up the republican nomination , has been studying the dossiers on potential candidates for weeks , lawyers have pored over votes in congress , records in office , family histories , college dissertations and other published works the search process , which is being overseen by one of mr romney s longtime confidantes , beth myers , is entirely isolated from the rest of his boston campaign headquarters the methodology , which ms myers has declined to discuss , has been streamlined from the extensive 80part questionnaire that mr romney and other republicans received four years ago when senator john mccain was selecting a running mate mr romney is weighing the advantages of making an announcement well before the party s nominating convention in florida at the end of august , several republicans said the benefits include having a second candidate to send to fundraising events and to respond to the obama administration , leaving mr romney more time to prepare for debates and to pace himself for the grueling fight ahead a team is planning how a selection would be announced , but none of the people involved know who is on the short list the bonding time with these potential running mates has given mr romney a strong sense of their strengths , weaknesses and quirks during an appearance on the tonight show , jay leno cajoled mr romney into a game of word association with his possible vicepresidential choices , and mr romney hardly hesitated before coming up with a single adjective to describe each name mr leno threw at him indomitable \( mr christie \) american dream \( mr rubio \) creative \( mr ryan \) and energetic \( gov of south carolina \) a belowtheradar lobbying campaign has broken out among top contributors , who often whisper to mr romney as they shake hands at fundraising events some of the names most frequently mentioned , according to several top donors , are mr rubio and mr portman both men , along with others , have been invited to join calls and events on behalf of mr romney , which provides a way to gauge the excitement of a candidate and his ability to raise money mr rubio , who does not know mr romney well , is increasingly being dispatched by the campaign to appear at fundraisers across the country he is embarking on a tour of his own this week to promote his new book , an american son mr romney and his aides have carefully studied other vicepresidential selections democratic and republican ones and concluded that a donoharm approach best fits this election his aides do not expect him to engage in a surprise pick , as mr mccain did four years ago with gov sarah palin of alaska in addition to a running mate being prepared to serve as president , aides said , mr romney has expressed a strong desire for the candidate to be familiar with the rigors of the national campaign spotlight mr pawlenty , who quickly endorsed mr romney after ending his own presidential bid last year , is one of the few prospective running mates without a fulltime day job he has made himself more available than nearly anyone else , often traveling across the country several times a week for the campaign in pennsylvania on saturday , he was bouncing along on the campaign bus in bluejeans and keeping up an easy , casual rapport with mr romney and by sunday morning , mr pawlenty turned up in new york on the set of this week with george stephanopoulos on abc , aggressively deflecting criticism about mr romney s policies on and other issues mr romney has formed some early impressions , according to several republicans who spoke on the condition of anonymity mr christie is often late , as he was during a 5 million fundraising dinner in new york city last month after a few uncomfortable moments , mr romney finally had to take the stage and speak first when mr christie did arrive , it was left to mr romney to introduce him to the crowd
my column on confronting the prospect of a nucleararmed iran seems to have caught a lot of readers by surprise the surprise ranges from approving \( thank heavens , at last a voice of sanity ! \) to indignant \( are you out of your expletive mind \? ! \? \) briefly , i wrote that if faced with a choice between two terrible options , a preventive war to set back iran s nuclear program or living with a nuclear iran the way we live with other nuclear states , i would grit my teeth and choose the latter as less dangerous after summing up the risks of each course , though , i concluded that a serious look at the alternatives should redouble our determination to find a third way a negotiated deal however difficult and unappetizing it might be to offer any concessions to the brutal , meddlesome and mendacious regime in iran , it s the way to avoid two worse choices first , credit where credit is due while the idea of containing a nuclear iran is is far from being the mainstream view among experts who study iran , the mideast , foreign policy generally , or nuclear proliferation issues , i m hardly the first to reach it in march , fareed zakaria made a somewhat similar argument in the washington post in the march april issue of the washington monthly , paul pillar , a former intelligence official in the bush administration , offered a more extensive case for containment robert wright chimed in in support of pillar in the atlantic barry posen , a professor of political science at mit , has been making the case for at least six years , including in a 2006 oped for the times a veteran diplomat , kenneth waltz , goes beyond leastbadoption case and argues in a recent issue of foreign affairs that iran should get the bomb , to balance israel s nuclear arsenal and make the region more stable a point of view i do not share a number of authoritative israeli voices , including at least two former heads of the intelligence agency mossad and a former head of the security agency shin bet , have publicly opposed attacking iran though most of them have not followed that logic to the notion of accepting a nucleararmed iran the conviction that a nuclear iran is simply intolerable surfaced pretty vehemently in comments and emails , and i thought i d use this space to address a few of them just to reiterate i do not welcome the idea of a nuclear iran iran with that kind of weapon would quite likely be an even more menacing pest to its neighbors there would be some danger of further proliferation in the region and the hostility between iran and \( already nucleararmed \) israel is so visceral that i would worry about some crisis between them escalating to a nuclear exchange on balance , i came away from my reporting convinced that these dangers were more tolerable than the consequences of a preventive war especially given that a military attack would only postpone iran s nuclear ambitions here are a few of the contrary arguments that surfaced in the reader response whether ahmadinejad is an actual genocidal madman or just plays one for popular consumption \( and to give iran a little street cred among the disaffected muslims beyond iran \) is a question none of us can answer with certainty but judging by their behavior , he and the others in the religiousmilitarypolitical conglomerate that rules iran have a powerful instinct for selfpreservation religious pronouncements of foreign leaders are worth study , but it would be folly to take them at face value the same mullahs who denounce israel as satanic including supreme leader ali khamenei have issued fatwas declaring that the production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden in islam i don t know about you , but i don t take much reassurance from that by the way , some american evangelicals also believe the apocalypse means the end of israel with jews either falling at the feet of christ or suffering a painful death prophecy is not the same as a summons to action first of all , iran was attacked by iraq , over border disputes and concerns that iran was encouraging unrest among iraq s shia minority it was a horrible slugfest featuring trench warfare , human wave attacks \( by the iranians , though the notion that they sent droves of children at the enemy is largely myth \) , the use \( by iraq \) of chemical weapons and horrendous slaughter on both sides it was a horrible affair but a long , punishing war in defense of your own country think world war i is hardly the same as initiating a nuclear exchange iran has few territorial claims on its neighbors and its only outright war under the current regime \( the iraniraq war of 19801988 \) was instigated by iraq iran s mo has been subversion , mostly through proxies and were iran to undertake something truly inimical to western interests shutting the strait of hormuz , attacking the gulf states oil facilities i don t think an iranian nuke would deter the us from intervening i have no doubt the remaining arab monarchs would love to see iran brought down among the gems in the wikileaks disclosure of state department cables was a report of king abdullah imploring washington to cut off the head of the snake , meaning iran but iran s leaders have pandered aggressively to the arab rank and file , posing as champions of the wide islamic world in support of the palestinian cause and opposition to israeli occupation the kind of jihadi , antisemitic bluster cited earlier in this post is reportedly popular with the islamic masses the iranians purpose in this is at least partly subversive to unsettle those hostile arab monarchs who give iran an uneasy feeling of encirclement in any case , an attack on an islamic state by israel , or by americans presumed to be serving israel s interests , would override a lot of sectarian and nationalistic divisions the prospects of an al qaeda or similar group with nuclear material is genuinely alarming \( in a magazine piece after 9 11 i surveyed the possible horrors \) but i think most experts regard it as unlikely that a nuclear state would entrust its most powerful source of security and prestige to a bunch of stateless fanatics first , if iran s favorite clients hezbollah , hamas suddenly demonstrated possession of nuclear weapons , everyone would know where they came from , and iran would be held accountable second , one distinguishing characteristic of terrorist groups is that they owe no allegiances to anything but their own warped dogmas to surrender its most potent weapons to thugs it could not control would put the iranian regime itself at risk for a case in point , consider pakistan , a country whose security forces have tolerated and at times supported terrorist groups working in afghanistan and india moreover , pakistan is the home of aq khan , the infamous peddler of nuclear secrets to north korea and other customers but even khan did not offer his wares to those terror groups first , iran s multiple facilities , well fortified \( especially the centrifuges buried deep in the rock at fordow , near qom \) present a much tougher target than the reactors in iraq and syria second , and more important , the osirak attack , far from stopping iraq s nuclear ambitions , hastened them after israel bombed the reactor , saddam hussein launched an accelerated , covert program to manufacture nuclear weapons when the first gulf war ended his ambitions in 1991 , that program was well underway experts disagree how far saddam was from having a weapon \( estimates ranged from six months to three years \) but the israeli strike in iraq accomplished what many fear a strike in iran would accomplish it gave the nuclear weapons program new life third , israel s attack on the \( suspected \) nuclear reactor in syria was kept secret for a long time , so that syria did not feel obliged to undertake reprisals against the superior israeli military it s inconceivable that iran and the world would not know whom to hold responsible for an attack on its facilities , and iranian leaders would have to lash back , if only to save face fourth , what ended iraq s nuclear ambitions was a fullscale military invasion in 1991 followed by an \( unnecessary and botched \) occupation in 2003 no doubt , occupying iran would solve the problem of its nuclear program anybody up for that \?
after the in newtown , conn , earlier this month , the stone published that examined the philosophical implications of the use , possession and regulation of weapons readers responded with thousands of thoughtful comments below is a selection of their writing responses to by firmin debrabander good luck trying to address the subject of gun restrictions from a logical , philosophical basis much of the industry \( the gun makers , the sellers , and the lobbyists \) prospers by stoking irrational fears fears of armed home invasion , fears of government conspiracies , fears of mob violence , fears of invaders from other countries , fears of doomsday scenarios , etc , and by providing a false sense of security and control through their products perhaps the problem is that a fearful society has no chance of being a civil society  mr debrabander fails to understand the tenor of the phase an armed society is a polite society the meaning of the phrase is not you will be polite , because i have a gun the intention is actually that i will be polite , for i hold the responsibility for the power of lethal force , and must conduct myself rationally , judiciously and , well politely mr debrabander s ignorance of this is commensurate with his ignorance of the law regarding the use of lethal force law abiding , armed citizens \( of whom there are many \) understand that one cannot use a firearm , nor even threaten to use one , as a response to a perceived insult persons who provide the sort of professional training required for many concealed weapons permits universally teach that the first rule of armed combat is to studiously avoid conflict whenever possible if conflict is unavoidable , these people teach to deescalate it they further teach that if conflict cannot be defused , one should retreat the use of deadly force is viewed as an absolute last resort  i find it very difficult to carry on a debate against an armed person the risk to my life outweighs the will to express a contrary opinion a gun silences discourse  isn t there always the threat of violence \? even an unarmed protester has fists , or a large sign , to hit someone else with violence is checked by our sensibilities , and usually the degree of violence increases in relation to how incensed we become guns are surely more dangerous than fists or signs , but the underlying principle is the same an effective civil society functions on a basic trust of strangers  i was held up at gunpoint many years ago \( as a 29 year old woman \) by two men they took my jewelry money and car , and ordered me to get in the car and go with them i told them that what they had taken was valuable but that i would not go with them i then walked away if i had been carrying a weapon , it is a lot more likely that someone \( probably me \) would have been hurt i was antiguns progun control before this incident , and it did not change my mind one iota  a universally armed citizenry is a form of tragedy of the commons when all are autonomous and armed to defend themselves , the common community security is destroyed  responses to by christy wampole many young men and teenage boys have no real sense of purpose in this generation and why \? i am not sure , but i think it has a lot to do with a lack of any responsibility and a lack of roles growing up in the sixties and seventies , we had roles and responsibilities boys did jobs such as mowing grass , shoveling snow , helping with the garbage girls helped mom in the kitchen , did laundry and this was finally all seen as sexist and wrong why couldn t girls mow the lawn \? why couldn t boys do the dishes \? they could and they should so things changed and that was good but the problem i have is that now no one is doing those things kids do not have chores to do kids today are not out shoveling snow after a storm i see plow after plow , but no kids they are inside playing video games or checking facebook updates i see adults delivering papers , i see foreign workers doing yard work i see grown men and women working at mcdonald s i think this is a problem and it begins young and at home no work ethic and no work ethic means no pride in one s self and no pride can quickly turn inward to self hate and anger so next time there is a big winter storm , send your kids out to help the neighbors clear their walk have them feel a sense of pride in helping others a connection to the community empower them with a feeling of empathy for others you cannot have empathy for others without human connection  really \? the problem is that women are earning equal pay \? \( we re still not \) and that other racial groups are making advances \? \( the average wealth of whites is 20 times that of african americans \) women have more control over their bodies than before \? \( hah , except for those pesky vaginal ultrasounds if you want an abortion \) so , white men are feeling threatened and they go killing people \? hmm and , the implications are we all stop being so pushy so they can calm down \? i don t believe it s a zerosum game where advances of one group necessarily losses for another the pot grows bigger when we all participate moreover , i think this sort of thinking comes perilously close to backlash against the still inadequate advances we re slowly and painfully making  responses to by michael boylan the discussion of the minimal force dictum ignores outcomes where brandishing a gun may actually result in a more peaceful resolution for example , in a situation where one is being assailed by fists , violence could be wholly avoided by displaying a gun guns as deterrents are peaceful and effective  the author identified several of the critical , real world issues , like the difference between ease of use and effectiveness there is a reason why swat teams and olympic target shooters use rifles and not handguns when i was choosing my first profession i considered becoming a police officer i knew i didn t want to be in a situation where i might kill someone , so i decided that i needed to be so accurate with a gun that i could shoot the perpetrator in the shoulder , or hand , or leg turns out that type of accuracy exists in videogames and tv shows , but not for me i became a teacher instead it would have been quite ironic if i had to give up becoming a teacher for the same reason i decided i couldn t become a cop  responses to by jeff mcmahan prof mcmahan an articulate , persuasive and wellgrounded argument , but none of it makes any sense to advocates of gun rights for many , those rights have become ends in themselves that need no justification for others more willing to put their trust in the rule of law and procedural democracy , a movement to repeal the second amendment makes perfect sense , but seems destined for collision with a political brick wall your essay is an essential starting point , but where is the political road map for making it happen \? how do we get around , over or through that brick wall \?  i respect mr mcmahan s argument , but i do not agree with it as an le armorer , i do not believe the possession of firearms by good , lawabiding citizenry , diminishes the power or effectiveness of the police whatsoever on more than one occasion , we have been assisted by good citizens with arms and , honestly , i have never seen or heard of an instance when a lawful gun owner has impeded or challenged the authority of our department criminals , yes lawful gun owners , no the 2nd amendment is foundational to this country we are not canada , or australia or britain what mr mcmahan is suggesting would require an abridgment and ratification of a fundamental right we can increase background checks we can ban certain types of weapons but then , again , we cannot seize those that are currently , lawfully , owned we can require more training prior to ownership we can make penalties for gunrelated crime much more severe but the right still exists one of the great problems with 2a is the lack of dialogue between the two camps there is none on both sides , it is either all or nothing no one will give an inch this has to change but it has to change reasonably there has to be an effort to understand on both sides for the common good sandy hook was horrible every mass murder is they pull tears out of me but i cannot , with clear conscience , punish good , lawabiding gun owners for the crime of a madman  responses to by gary gutting there is no need to prove in advance that gun control will work we don t pass laws in the belief that they will eradicate the crime murder is a crime we have murders likewise rape , robbery , and genocide we criminalize behavior we believe is unacceptable and we marshal the legal and judicial system to try and stem it laws are in part aspirational and pragmatic  in some research regarding public health risk us scientists and most of europe have adopted the precautionary principle which states \( per wikipedia \) if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment , in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful , the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking the action in other words assume harm , and it is the burden of those wanting more access to more guns to prove otherwise given the thousands of gun homicides per year in the us , adoption of a precautionary principle for guns is an obvious choice  you are taking instances that are very visible and assuming that is the end of the data you don t consider how many people avoid getting killed , raped or maimed because they have a firearm that is not loud data you don t consider how many criminals do not commit violent crimes in areas where they may get shot you do not consider that other causes can be at work here , such as copycat crimes , media incitement or some other hidden cause
saints \( 143 \) at 49ers \( 133 \) saturday , 4 30 pm line saints by 35 the heavily favored saints traveled to the west coast in last year s playoffs to face the seahawks , the easytooverlook champions of the league s weakest conference seattle s passing game was a donkey cart compared to the drew brees lamborghini , but the seahawks made the most of their few assets a bruising running back , a defense full of sure tacklers and a fiery coach , fresh from the college ranks , who provided an extra jolt of rahrah motivation seattle stunned the defendingchampion saints , proving that discipline , determination and homefield advantage can still defeat one of the nfl s nextgen passing games once in a while , anyway the saints face a similar , but better , opponent in this year s 49ers frank gore is the hardtostop rusher , patrick willis leads the best front seven in the nfl and jim harbaugh has infused the team with collegestyle spirit while installing a complex running game that keeps defenders guessing on the other hand , the 49ers have real redzone problems , their quarterback is less a game manager than a game filing clerk and the saints are better and healthier than they were when they lost to the seahawks last year and homefield advantage only goes so far despite their hothouseflower reputation , the saints are 186 on the road over the last three years when the saints have the ball the saints rushed for 167 yards last week , most of it before they built a safe lead the saints' rushing game is easy to overlook because brees breaks a record every time he buckles his chinstrap , and because they split carries so evenly among pierre thomas \( eight last week , 110 on the season \) , darren sproles \( 10 and 87 \) and chris ivory \( 13 and 79 \) , that none of them compile eyeopening totals last season , a rash of injuries forced the saints to use the benchfillers julius jones and deshawn wynn in key situations in the playoffs if the saints need two tough yards against the 49ers , they will not be forced to hand off to the likes of wynn , who was signed just days before the seahawks game willis is the leader and signal caller for the 49ers' defense , but his fellow inside linebacker navorro bowman led the team in tackles \( 136 \) and tackles for a loss \( 13 \) the top pass rushers aldon smith , justin smith and ahmad brooks combined for 285 sacks and 61 quarterback hits aldon smith , a rookie , led the team in sacks but leaves the game on rushing downs in favor of parys haralson , who averages 17 yards per stop against the run , according to the web site football outsiders the front seven makes life easier for the secondary , which lacks depth behind the top cornerback carlos rogers when the 49ers have the ball with the exception of the broncos , no team approaches the running game with as much creativity as the 49ers offensive linemen cross , fold and pull tight ends and fullbacks line up in unexpected places endarounds are common receivers and tight ends carried the ball 15 times for the 49ers this year , as harbaugh makes sure opponents do not key too heavily on gore defensive tackle isaac sopoaga lines up at fullback in shortyardage situations , and the fact that he caught an 18yard pass demonstrates just how offthewall the niners' offense can sometimes appear quarterback alex smith lacks the arm to throw deep and can be rattled by pressure , so the offensive shell game is used to create big running plays and prevent defenders from blitzing with confidence the 49ers scored just 22 touchdowns on their 54 trips into the red zone david akers set nfl records for field goals \( 44 \) and attempts \( 52 \) while settling for field goals is an acceptable practice against the rams or the cardinals , it is a great way to wind up trailing , 219 , at halftime against the saints pick history repeats itself for the saints not 2010 history , but 2009 history , when they cruised past their firstround opponent saints broncos \( 98 \) at patriots \( 133 \) saturday , 8 pm line patriots by 135 it has been 1 , 454 days since the patriots last won a playoff game with their three super bowl rings and a decade of ubiquity atop the afc east standings , we forget how long ago the patriots' last championship was seven years since losing to the giants in super bowl xlii , the patriots have fallen to the ravens , 3314 , in the first round of the 2008 playoffs , and last year to the jets , 2821 , a loss that was not nearly as close as the score in both cases , tom brady could not get his aerial show out of the hangar he threw three interceptions against the ravens and endured five sacks at the hands of the jets the championshipera patriots could beat opponents in multiple ways , but the latterday patriots live and die by the offensive pyrotechnics that hide the many weaknesses of their defense by now , you have no doubt formed your own opinion about tim tebow , whose exploits have been transferred from the sports department to the front page and whose face may soon replace andrew jackson s on the 20 bill tebow s reputation continues to grow exponentially as a function of his accomplishments but the latest development in his saga his sudden ability to beat the steelers with several deep throws , including but not limited to one lategame miracle makes this game anything but a certainty for the patriots tebow threw and ran well while helping the broncos take a 167 lead in a week 15 game that ended in a 4123 patriots rout if the patriots' offense slips out of fourth gear the way it did in the 2008 and 2010 playoffs , all broadcasting may be preempted next week for a loop of tebow s earnest face in front of a majestic sunrise
chicago the joint meeting of the and the drew 10 , 700 scholars , professors , publishers and clergy members last weekend to the mccormick place convention center , where for four days they established their alternate universe it was reminiscent of the mos eisley cantina in star wars , filled with polyglot eccentrics dead languages lived \( he speaks latin ! she reads akkadian ! \) one saw robed buddhist monks priests and friars , collared or cassocked nuns , in habit or not imams in kufis the occasional yarmulked jew and thousands more in rumpled khakis , name tag on lanyard like an officer s medals they clutched biblical concordances , hebrew lexicons , gospel commentaries the scholarly jargon may have been hard to decipher , but the topics of the panel discussions were often earthy and real theological responses to aids or poverty , for example or the problem of evil , why bad things happen to good people religious questions are never just academic they are what scared children ask their parents doing her own kind of religious work , carolyn roncolato , a graduate student at , was in the hallway near the registration booths , handing out buttons that said i support the hyatt to hear ms roncolato explain it , astral theorizing and scholarly jargon are meaningless if they ca n't touch down on the hard turf of workers' rights at two of the hotels booked for these conventioneers , the hyatt mccormick and the hyatt regency , unionized housekeepers have been working without a contract since 2009 unite here , their union , wants hyatt to give its housekeepers the same contract several other hotels in chicago have already signed , but hyatt has refused ms roncolato , 29 , in her third year as a volunteer for the union local , handed boycott buttons to arriving scholars the hyatt does routinely unjust things , she said they do n't give their housekeepers mops , so they have to scrub the floor on hands and knees they wo n't give them fitted sheets for the bed , so they have to lift the 100pound mattresses up and fold sheets under i understand it to be an ethical issue , an issue of justice , an issue of civic engagement so it was both convenient and troubling that the american academy of religion , of which ms roncolato is a member , was planning to use two hyatts in chicago ms roncolato was to present two papers , including mimetic conception infertility treatment as deconstruction and reinscription of western maternality and heteronormativity she and other scholars fought , successfully , to get all sessions moved from the boycotted hyatt mccormick the hyatt regency was used just for lodging we write papers and present papers on systemic injustice , racism , classism , sexism , ms roncolato said so the idea that we would stay at the hyatt totally undermines what we do doug patrick , a spokesman for hyatt , contested ms roncolato s claims our housekeepers have access to longhandled brooms , mops , sanitizing products the things they need to do their jobs every day , mr patrick said we looked into the fitted sheets request , and to be honest , it actually requires more work on the housekeeper s part than a regular sheet mr patrick said one sticking point in the contract negotiations was the company s policy of outsourcing some catering jobs and other tasks he added that in his view unite here was preventing a settlement , to keep attention on its national campaign of organizing hyatt hotels ms roncolato s mother is a methodist minister in meadville , pa her father , dave , was here , helping his daughter publicize the boycott they suggested that academy members attend an american academy of religion business meeting on sunday morning , where ms roncolato would propose a prolabor resolution at the meeting , only about 70 of thousands of members showed up the resolution , a nonbinding recommendation to the board , passed by acclamation it proposed that clauses in future hotel and convention contracts provide that if there is a boycott , strike , lockout , picketing or other labor dispute , the organization will be released from all contractual obligations without charge or penalty one of the three nays , , of in atlanta , worried that the resolution might empower mischiefmakers who did not really represent workers if any group wanted to carry picket signs , that would trigger the resolution , mr matthews said asked if he generally supported labor unions , he said , that s none of your business and a second nay , , of in nebraska , worried that the resolution could imperil the alliance between the two scholarly organizations the american academy of religion includes people of all faiths , researching all faiths many of its members are not themselves religious society of biblical literature members focus on christian and jewish scripture and are somewhat more likely to be believers from 2008 to 2010 , the societies met separately , after a controversial split , before reuniting last year i'm sensitive to the reintegration of the smaller group , mr o'keefe said the sbl in general is less inclined to move from scholarship to activism john kutsko , the executive director of the society of biblical literature , is part of a joint task force charged with agreeing on a labor policy because it and the american academy of religion sign hotel contracts together , they would have to agree on any prolabor language he was optimistic about finding common ground with the academy , but said he also wanted to honor the diversity of his society s membership we understand a principle of a learned society is to provide an open forum for intellectual exchange of ideas , mr kutsko said within that there are going to be differences of opinion , including on labor issues ms roncolato , the boycott organizer , said that the bible compels her to support the boycott the gospels are very clear that the christian call is to stand on the side of the marginalized , and in that case it s very clear that s the hotel workers , she said so the idea that as academics we would ignore the people around us while we talk is hypocritical
the texas rangers are spending a lot of money on yu darvish , and they have to hope he is a lot better than the other japanese players who have already pitched in the major leagues according to baseballreferencecom , 38 japanese natives have pitched in the major leagues \( a few were sons of american servicemen \) only six of them have made as many as 100 major league starts , roughly three full seasons in a rotation only one , hideo nomo , has won 100 games , and only one , hiroki kuroda , has posted an earned run average below 400 none have cost quite as much as darvish \( 517 million for the posting fee and 60 million for the sixyear contract he agreed to wednesday \) but darvish may have some advantages over his japanese predecessors at 25 , he is younger than any of the six 100game starters were when they made their debuts daisuke matsuzaka \( 4930 , 425 era \) and nomo \( 123109 , 424 \) were 26 kazuhishi ishii \( 3934 , 444 \) was 28 and kuroda \( 4146 , 345 \) , tomo ohka \( 5168 , 426 \) and masato yoshii \( 3247 , 405 \) were 33 the 6foot5 , 216pound darvish is also bigger and perhaps stronger \( nomo and yoshii were 62 okha and kuroda , 61 and ishii , 60 \) and darvish has already pitched in a major league stadium , during the 2009 world baseball classic in los angeles
when the financially struggling decided to sell its collection of nearly 38 , 000 rare coins last year , that upper manhattan museum sought to allay fears that its cultural treasure would become inaccessible to scholars and the public by striving to find a public institution to buy it none , however , was found to purchase the collection , valued at more than 25 million the coins landed in private hands and some of those scholars' concerns are now being realized about 1 , 000 of the coins will be auctioned in madrid next week , likely to scatter them even more but an unidentified american coin buff who bought 10 , 000 pieces from the collection recently arranged a longterm loan with the american numismatic society , making them publicly available , said ute wartenberg kagan , the executive director of the , whose headquarters are at hudson square in the south village though ms wartenberg kagan said she was saddened by the dismantling of the collection , the loan softens the blow the hispanic society got the money , and we got 10 , 000 of the really good coins , she said it s good for new york , having this material back , because who knows where it will end up this type of collection disappears and is never seen again the hispanic society , a museum and research library that focuses primarily on the old world cultures of spain and portugal , has some impressive holdings , including major paintings by goya and el greco and important manuscripts and prints but it has long struggled to attract visitors and donors to its stately beauxarts building in washington heights , and faced with a shrinking endowment and trust assets , it put the coins up for a sealedbid auction at sotheby s new york to finance acquisitions the hispanic society s collection was considered one of the world s most important related to the sweep of spanish history it included the a gold coin weighing nearly five ounces that sotheby s described as the largest gold coin from the 15th century that survives today it also had more than 400 roman gold coins that span the full history of rome , including examples struck under julius caesar nine thousand of the coins arrived at the numismatic society late last week , joining 1 , 000 that had arrived earlier ms wartenberg kagan said the batch included more than 1 , 000 coins of the visigoths \( arguably the most important visigothic collection in the world , she said \) other earlymedieval coins more than 3 , 000 bronze and silver roman coins and about 4 , 000 spanish coins of medieval and later periods the greatest concern about any dispersal of the collection focused largely on the coins now back at the numismatic society , mitchell a codding , the hispanic society s executive director , said they have been heavily researched , and there is constant utilization by scholars it s good they 'll be available to scholars the sale in madrid by the dealer and the loan to the numismatic society were reported last week in the which reports on a variety of cultural affairs the arrival of the coins at the numismatic society represents a homecoming of sorts archer milton huntington , a railroad magnate s heir who founded the hispanic society , had donated the coin collection to the numismatic society more than half a century ago in 2007 the hispanic society asked for the coins back , and after numismatic society officials protested , won a court order in 2008 for their return ms wartenberg kagan has in the past argued that it was her belief that huntington intended the coins to remain at the numismatic society and that selling material integral to the hispanic society s mission should not be allowed the deaccessioning , or sale , of museum artworks has increasingly been under sharp focus , as some opponents of the practice worry that institutions are jettisoning artistically valuable works because of economic pressures the new york state board of regents last year made permanent a set of regulations enjoining museums from selling art to cover operating costs mr codding contended that the coins were never formally a part of the hispanic society s collection or mission despite the current easing of tension between the numismatic society and the hispanic society , scholars are concerned that the collection has been split alan stahl , the curator of numismatics at princeton university , said he hoped that at least the coins lent to the numismatic society would eventually be donated outright i want it all , mr stahl said , with all the information possible , with the history of each piece to be available for study , for exhibition , for illustrations
each nfl playoff game brings about its own sense of history , and the coming slate for this weekend is no different let s take a look at some of the unique features of the four games of the wildcard playoffs detroitnew orleans detroit may have one of the best passing games in the nfl , but winning a shootout in new orleans is a dicey proposition the lions are 105point underdogs against the saints , making them the biggest underdog of the weekend since 1990 , teams that are a touchdownorgreater underdogs are 314 in this round the 1998 cardinals shocked the cowboys in dallas , 207 , two years after the '96 jaguars won at buffalo despite being 85point underdogs but the biggest upset during wildcard weekend \? that happened with the saints just last season new orleans lost as a 10point road favorite against seattle there is some evidence that homefield advantage is minimized when the road team is familiar with the home team s stadium as you may recall , the lions have already played in new orleans this season although detroit did not fare well against the saints in that game , it may have gained some experience just from being there or maybe not since 1990 , there have been 56 times when a team has played a team from another division in the regular season and then played that team again in the same location in the playoffs the road teams were just 2531 against the spread in those situations making matters worse for detroit of those 56 road teams , 15 of them lost by at least two touchdowns the first time around only three won the rematch the 2005 steelers against the colts , the 2004 patriots against the steelers and the '93 chiefs against the oilers that s not a particularly large sample , and detroit is more used to playing in a dome than most saints opponents one thing that is certain when drew brees and matthew stafford start , the game will feature the most combined passing yardage in postseason history from 1970 to 2010 , 27 playoff games featured two quarterbacks who threw for a combined 8 , 000 yards but stafford \( 5 , 038 \) and brees \( 5 , 476 \) have combined for a mindboggling 10 , 514 yards no other postseason duel has ever come close to featuring such firepower yearqb yardsqb yardstotal2009drew brees 4388peyton manning 450088882004daunte culpepper 4717brett favre 408888051984dave krieg 3671dan marino 508487552001kurt warner 4830brett favre 392187511984joe montana 3630dan marino 508487142009brett favre 4202tony romo 448386852004jake plummer 4089peyton manning 455786462004donovan mcnabb 3875daunte culpepper 471785922009drew brees 4388brett favre 420285901981dan fouts 4802ken anderson 375485561995brett favre 4413jeff george 414385562008donovan mcnabb 3916kurt warner 458384991996drew bledsoe 4086mark brunell 436784531998steve young 4170brett favre 421283822003trent green 4039peyton manning 426783062004tom brady 3692peyton manning 455782492009aaron rodgers 4434kurt warner 375381872007eli manning 3336tom brady 480681422009drew brees 4388kurt warner 375381412007matt hasselbeck 3966brett favre 415581212009joe flacco 3613peyton manning 450081132002rich gannon 4689steve mcnair 338780762001kurt warner 4830donovan mcnabb 323380632009donovan mcnabb 3553tony romo 448380362008kurt warner 4583matt ryan 344080232008philip rivers 4009peyton manning 400280112009joe flacco 3613tom brady 43988011 pittsburghdenver the broncos have rushed for 2 , 632 yards this season in a year where the average team gained only 1 , 874 yards on the ground but not only did denver outrush the average team by over 750 yards , but the broncos also passed for 1 , 241 fewer yards than the average team in recent history , only one team has passed for so few yards relative to league average as this year s broncos the 2005 chicago bears since 1978 , 12 teams have made the playoffs while rushing for more than 500 yards than average but also failing to come within 500 passing yards of league average in fact , last year s afc west champion was just one such team year team run passpwpl2010kan796577012009nyj889 1115212008bal521573212004atl806957112004pit598649112003bal788952011990chi614572111986ram558 1093011986chi801530011984ram882 1152011984chi992831111983pit53487001 the table above shows the number of playoff wins and losses for each team as you can see , none of them won the super bowl can denver buck that trend \?

as the nba s lockoutshortened regular season winds down , the league s postseason awards have prompted some discussion and for the first time in decades , new york fans may actually have something to be excited about this season marks the 30 th anniversary of the defensive player of the year award , which has never been won by a knicks player as keith schlosser , wrote on this month , tyson chandler may bring an end to the knicks drought chandler , now in his 11 th season , has been even better than advertised according to basketballreferencecom , the knicks allow the 11 th fewest pointspergame in the nba this season \( a vast improvement over their 27 th ranking last year \) the more useful metric , defensive rating the number of pointsallowedper100possessions suggests that new york is actually the fourthbest defensive team in the league and according to teamrankingscom , the value of chandler s defensive presence in the middle can be measured by his team s pointsinthepaintallowed defense , which ranks ninth in the league \( new york s 26 th ranked interior defense was abysmal last year \) in addition to the numbers , chandler s presence and leadership have also helped the play of his teammates the rookie iman shumpert , currently fifth in the league in steals per game , is an aggressive onball defender who says that he can afford to take risks when chandler is on the floor carmelo anthony has repeatedly praised chandler for holding him accountable on the defensive end opposing players often credit chandler for changing the culture of knicks basketball , and his defense is one of the primary reasons new york is being described as a team that no one wants to face in the playoffs espn s john hollinger recently said that chandler has been the key to the knicks season none of this takes into account how impressive he has been as a twoway player chandler , whose durability was once questioned , has the secondhighest minutesplayed of his career \( 333 mpg \) and he is averaging a doubledouble \( 113 ppg and 10 rpg \) he also leads the nba in shooting percentage \( 68 percent \) in fact , if the season ended today , chandler s rate would be the thirdbest season field goal percentage of alltime \( behind only wilt chamberlain s 727 percent in 197273 and 682 percent in 196667 \) that chandler ranks 44 th of 55 centers in usage rate \( an estimate of the percentage of teamplays used by a player \) indicates that he is actually being underused on offense of the six annual regularseason player awards , defensive player of the year remains the most subjective , mostly because of the inherent nature of team defense and the lack of widely accepted individual defensive metrics history suggests the honor is typically given to the player whose efforts have had the greatest impact on his team s record , but the nba s voting process is opaque in chandler s case , the measure of his worthiness is probably best ascertained by answering the question many new york fans have asked themselves all season where would the knicks be without him \? jamie o grady writes about the knicks for the journal news you can find him on twitter \( \)
tel aviv since wednesday , when hamas s military chief , ahmed aljabari , in the , hamas had fired rockets and mortars only into southern israel so on thursday evening , when i heard an airraid siren sound in tel aviv , i assumed it was a test but just for a moment then i snapped to my senses , grabbed my phone and ran to my apartment building s stairs i began to make my way down , running at first , thinking only of my three young sons two were in a judo lesson one was with his grandmother i could not get to them on the secondfloor landing , i paused my heart was racing , but my legs would n't i was weighing my options , and none seemed good and eight steps above the lobby of my building i came to a very somber conclusion this is how life is going to be here , and i ca n't change it hope for a peaceful israel is diminishing we have no one to make peace with , says the voice on the street that may be true , but so is this in israel , too , our leaders on all sides have failed to move toward peace yes , peace negotiations with hamas are questionable but just a few weeks ago , the president , , said that he would not allow a third intifada to break out , and that although he is a refugee from safed , a city in northern israel , he there as anything but a tourist palestine for me , he said , is the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as the capital this is palestine , i am a refugee , i live in ramallah the west bank and gaza is palestine , everything else is israel the office of israel s prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , responded by saying , there is no connection between the palestinian authority chairman s statement and his actual actions mr netanyahu has been ignoring the peace process for most of his current fouryear term for the first time since yitzhak rabin and yasir arafat shook hands in 1993 , and as israel prepares to elect a new knesset in january , its political leaders are not talking about a twostate solution when i moved to israel 15 years ago , the picture was very different there was never a question of whether israel and the palestinians would make peace , only of when the dream of peace inspired me , and even after an intifada , scores of suicide bombings and a war , i stayed in israel i remained hopeful but today , as the missiles get closer to tel aviv , i think of leaving it s not the missiles that are breaking me it s the lack of an alternative to them mr netanyahu has avoided the palestinian issue while enabling and encouraging settlement building he has ignored the arab initiative and focused solely on the threat of iran late last month he with his ultranationalist foreign minister , avigdor lieberman , to have their two parties run one slate in the next elections in january it signaled that mr netanyahu would have no plans to make peace if he were reelected now mr netanyahu has chosen to enter into a conflict that ensures that the vote in the upcoming elections will be about security something he says he can provide there is no great surprise in that the surprise is that there is no opposition to mr netanyahu s policies a signal that israelis are resigned to living indefinitely with the threat of war israel s labor party yitzhak rabin s party which has traditionally stood for peace , has , instead , been quiet on the israelipalestinian issue under the leadership of a journalist turned politician , shelly yacimovich , labor has reshaped itself into a social democratic party focused on social justice , the cost of living and the middle class last year , demonstrations touched off by the rising cost of cottage cheese drew half a million israelis to the streets to protest the high cost of living ms yachimovich seized social justice as an issue and became its political face but she skirted the palestinian issue she has not promised to stop settlement building and has never acknowledged the hypocrisy of calling for social justice within the , which marks the limits of israel proper , while ignoring the lack of it in the palestinian territories beyond if you were to define today s labor , you might say it s the party that represents israelis' right to fairly priced cheese some labor figures still press for peace negotiations , of course , but their voices do n't get through and as israel pummels the gaza strip , there is no israeli political leader saying , as rabin did , enough of blood and tears ms yachimovich has , in fact , supported the government s actions as just , without questioning whether they are wise how the situation in gaza plays out is likely to determine the outcome of israel s election i feel safe in saying that this january , israelis will be casting a vote for peace or war will israel bury the twostate solution once and for all , or can it somehow retain a hope of being a jewish democratic state living in peace with its neighbors \? last night as i said good night to my older sons , i set their flipflops in front of their beds if you hear a siren , i said , slide your feet into your shoes and run downstairs i would grab our 3yearold , i said , and be right behind them do n't wait for me just go there are n't too many years before today s flipflops become tomorrow s army boots , and i do not want my sons to grow up to a neverending conflict that israel accepts as immutable i do agree that israel has the right to protect its citizens but i condemn israel s current leaders for failing to recognize that the best defense is peace
rangers slugger josh hamilton has collected experiences over the past year like a rolling ball of tape collects everything in its path there was the horrifying moment last july when he tossed a ball to a fan , who over a tooshort railing trying to catch it the world series then delivered a crushing competitive blow as the rangers blew an allbutcertain victory in game 6 the offseason brought into alcoholism all of which makes hamilton s on tuesday night that much more mesmerizing because hamilton is a living , breathing poster for the full range of human emotion if he were n't real , you get the feeling maurice sendak might have made him up he is definitely a wild thing of course , you know none of that if you as he launched all four balls over the fence his effort might be among the best of the 16 fourhomer games in history , , and it had writers like and , reaching for their thesauruses for different ways to say wow when you take into account all of who hamilton is , as , the combination of incredibly talented , likeable player and troubled alcoholic makes him fascinating as , hamilton inspires people with both sides of his story add on the tidbit about him becoming a free agent after this season and the rangers needing to decide which half of hamilton will prevail in his career , and you 've got enough plot twists for a network miniseries that the rangers have no choice but to sign him , after having suspended negotiations after his alcohol relapse in february if they wait until he hits the market , his price tag will sober them up in a hurry there were plenty of sobering moments in the nba tuesday night , judging by all the teams that seemed to expect to polish off their firstround playoff series and did n't , which would be the lakers , celtics and 76ers only the pacers night , which served to remind us that they 're playing in the playoffs the lakers , as usual , made the biggest show of their flop , , thanks to that finishing off the nuggets would be easy denver coach made the most of that , , and did n't have to reach that deep into his bag of coaching tricks for motivation that the game highlighted the lakers' lack of outside shooters not named kobe bryant meanwhile , the hawks are still flapping with and the bulls salvaged a bit of ego by holding on against the sixers , although that philadelphia will still prevail because coach doug collins has added wisdom to his repertoire the nhl produced the third of its four conference finalists tuesday night when the devils closed out their series over the reeling flyers the devils preferred to act like this was no big deal , , even if this was the first time in nine years they 'd advanced out of the second round of the playoffs the series made them look like the devils of old and the flyers of , well , every year , , but that as easy as this would be to blame this all on the flyers , it was the devils that made them look bad that every time goalie ilya bryzgalov was good , the team was awful and vice versa with no actual games to offset the jurisprudence news , college basketball is left to contemplate what means and the nfl keeps roiling over bountygate players association president dominique foxworth defends the union s defense of the players involved in , which criticized the players and condemns a system in which commissioner roger goodell is judge , jury and appeals court in such situations but for all his power , he still ca n't do anything about on the dr phil show \? fortunately , josh hamilton s brand of human drama is so much more appealing , if only because it s so much more human
at just before 2 am on wednesday , matt strawn , the iowa republican party chairman , addressed reporters who had spent the night following the historically close republican caucus race between mitt romney and rick santorum the margin separating the candidates was small eight votes but he was prepared to declare a victor congratulations to governor mitt romney , the winner of the 2012 iowa caucuses , mr strawn said mr romney s victory is unofficial the counties have up to two weeks from the caucuses to send their final certified results to the state party however , there is no provision for a recount in the caucuses , and the campaign that might have the most interest in pursuing one mr santorum s is making no effort to challenge the results still , given mr romney s exceptionally small margin of victory , a single discrepancy could potentially reverse the outcome on wednesday , a voter in the town of moulton in appanoose county claimed to have found one the voter , edward true , signed an affidavit stating that he had helped count the vote after the caucus at the garrett memorial library in moulton mr true claims that the results listed on the google spreadsheet maintained by the iowa republican party differed substantially from the count that had been taken at the caucus site mr romney had received only 2 votes in his precinct , mr true s affidavit said , but had been given credit for 22 by the state that would be enough to flip mr romney s 8vote victory into a 12vote win for mr santorum in an interview friday , mr true said that he is a ron paul supporter mr strawn issued a statement late on thursday night on behalf of the iowa gop , which said that the party would not respond in detail to reports of irregularities , but that it had no reason to believe that mr true s allegation would change the outcome one reason for mr strawn s confidence may be that there is a verification process set up during the caucuses each candidate has the option of assigning a representative to each precinct who must sign off on the results before they are reported to the state whether mr santorum s campaign had such a representative at mr true s precinct , designated by the state as washington wells , is unclear , but the betterorganized campaigns typically have representatives at most of the state s 1 , 774 precincts i spoke with mr santorum late on thursday evening when i encountered him in the lobby of the manchester , nh , hotel where he is staying mr santorum was in a jovial mood , joking about his sweater vests and the lack of sleep he had been getting i stayed up until cnn was on the morning show , he recalled of the caucus night mr santorum expressed a cheery indifference as to whether he had technically won the caucuses i always said in iowa that i had to beat perry and bachmann , he said i didn t really ever think i was going to win , given where i was two weeks out it just was fun watching it going up and down mr santorum said that his campaign had not put any significant effort into looking at the precinctbyprecinct results in detail , nor was it interested in doing so jesse benton , mr paul s national campaign chairman , said on friday that he did not know anything about mr true s allegation but he noted that mr paul s campaign had ample representation at both the state and precinct levels during the votecounting process we ve always been very satisfied that they are playing aboveboard , mr benton said earlier on thursday , mr santorum conducted an interview with greta van susteren of fox news during which he noted that discrepancies had run both ways during the iowa caucuses in the interview , mr santorum said that although there may have been a 20vote mistake in mr romney s favor in one precinct , there was a 21vote mistake in his favor in another precinct , essentially canceling it out when i asked him about the 21vote discrepancy , mr santorum told me that he was not aware of which specific precinct it had occurred in instead , he said , he was recalling information from prior conversations he had with iowa republican officials in fact , there were several discrepancies during the votecounting on tuesday night , some of which had favored mr santorum however , these discrepancies were resolved and corrected before mr strawn declared mr romney the winner i had been downloading versions of the state s vote tally at various points on tuesday evening and early wednesday morning the first version i downloaded reflected the state s count as of 11 14 pm iowa time on tuesday , at which point results from 1 , 723 of 1 , 774 precincts had been tabulated in 10 of these 1 , 723 precincts , the results in the spreadsheet changed between 11 14 pm and 2 am , reflecting additional verification and validation efforts these changes added a net of 11 votes to mr romney s total while subtracting a net of 33 votes from mr santorum s count if not for these changes , mr santorum would still have led the vote count on wednesday morning however , it is not clear that there are additional known discrepancies in mr santorum s favor , above and beyond the ones that have already been detected and fixed thus , the potential discrepancy described by mr true could in fact be enough to reverse the result it is possible to apply some statistical scrutiny to mr true s claim how plausible is it , for instance , that mr romney would have received just two votes out of 53 in the precinct , as mr true reported \? in fact , mr romney performed very weakly in the other precincts in appanoose county , which is rural and conservative in the centerville w1 precinct , for instance , mr romney received just two of 39 votes he got just four of 43 votes in the caldwell precinct , and none of the 40 voters in the union precinct cast a ballot for him another unusual facet of the vote count in the washington wells precinct is that the state recorded six votes for an obscure candidate , buddy roemer , even though mr true s affidavit claimed that there had been no votes for him there \( mr roemer received just 31 votes statewide \) over all , mr true s statement said , 53 caucusgoers had cast votes in his precinct , rather than 79 as reported by the state the 26vote difference reflects what he says were 20 excess votes for mr romney and six for mr roemer is there any way to tell whether either 53 votes or 79 votes is an inherently more believable turnout in the washington wells precinct \? neither voter registration statistics nor the results of the 2008 caucuses are available on a precinctbyprecinct basis however , precinctlevel results of the 2008 general election are provided on the iowa secretary of state s web site , and the number of votes for john mccain can be used as a proxy for the number of republicans in the 2008 general election , 212 voters cast ballots for mr mccain in the washington wells precinct a 79voter republican caucus turnout in washington wells would represent 37 percent of this total statewide , by comparison , republican caucus turnout was equal to 18 percent of mr mccain s vote total the 53voter turnout as instead claimed by mr true would represent 25 percent of mr mccain s vote total that would be somewhat more in line with statewide averages , as well as the 23 percent turnout reported elsewhere in appanoose county still , caucus turnout can be highly variable from precinct to precinct , so this evidence is far from definitive there is also another , more striking oddity in the turnout estimates in appanoose county one precinct there , pleasant franklin , is still being reported by the iowa republican party as having had no turnout at all for the caucus this is despite the fact that pleasant franklin was listed as a valid caucus site on the republican party s web site , and that 132 voters cast ballots for john mccain there in the general election of 2008 in addition to pleasant franklin , there are seven other precincts throughout iowa that are still being reported as having had no republican turnout these precincts are listed in the state party s spreadsheet , but contain no votes it is important to note that apparent oddities and anomalies are common whenever votes are counted some prove to be benign , while others are genuine mistakes , but they rarely make much difference either way eight votes , however , is not a lot of ground for mr santorum to make up , so the outcome could easily change before the vote is certified for now , the caucuses are probably best thought of as still being too close to call this post has been updated the reflect the fact that mr true is a supporter of mr paul

salt lake city when marguerite driessen , a professor here , entered brigham young university in the early 1980s , she was the first black person many mormon students had ever met , and she spent a good bit of her college time debunking stereotypes about africanamericans then she converted to mormonism herself , and went on to spend a good deal of her adult life correcting assumptions about mormons so the matchup in this year s presidential election comes as a watershed moment for her , symbolizing the hardwon acceptance of racial and religious minorities a mormon candidate and a black candidate \? who would have thunk \? ms driessen said i think 30 years ago , we would not have had this choice after examining the dual and sometimes conflicting identities , she has decided that she will cast her vote for president obama over , the presumptive republican nominee ms driessen believes that there is plenty in the book of mormon to support mr obama s candidacy , and she likes to cite chapter and verse , like mosiah 29 39 and 23 13 it says it is your job , people , to elect people who will protect your liberties , said ms driessen , a constitutional lawyer that is my standard being black , liberal and mormon , ms driessen represents a small but emerging point of view that is in stark contrast to the traditional profile of american latterday saints , who tend to be conservative , republican and white while many within the church community are rooting for mr romney , the minority mormon voices are becoming more assertive , perhaps because of the strength of their growing numbers the church of jesus christ of latterday saints has experienced explosive worldwide growth through its missionary work , particularly in countries with large black populations in the united states , it is the secondfastest growing religion , according to a recently released while the church does not track members by race , there are thriving mormon churches with hundreds of black members today in many urban areas , including washington , chicago and new york , although africanamericans represent only a tiny fraction of the six million mormons in the united states the conversion of blacks in this country has been a challenge , given the church s turbulent history of excluding people of black african descent until 1978 , black men were not allowed to become priests or bishops dark skin was considered a biblical curse during the 1960s , when mitt romney s father , george , made civil rights a personal priority during his time as a republican governor of michigan , his progressive views put him at odds with church doctrine over the last decades , however , there has been an aggressive campaign to diversify , and racism in the church which was itself once powerless and persecuted as a cult has been repeatedly denounced i feel a definite sense of pride in the usa that we have a mormon candidate and black candidate , said catherine spruill , who lives in a suburb of salt lake and is mixedrace like mr obama and mormon like mr romney i feel pride for my people , because america picked that there is even a black mormon congressional candidate , mia love , who will soon be on the ballot in utah she is running as a conservative republican for the newly created fourth district , which includes part of salt lake county a campaign video describes her in these terms , among others mother , mayor , leader , gun owner with the larger tent has come a more diverse array of political ideologies and expressions in a church culture that has been known for its strict hierarchy and members' adherence to authority and rules , for instance the prohibitions on caffeine and alcohol of more than a dozen black mormons interviewed for this article across the country , eight were democraticleaning obama supporters , two were undecided , and two others said they were committed to voting for mr romney with respect to romney being a mormon , bless his heart , said tracie j walker , 48 , of washington i think he s a strange character he got confused by money , i think so he does n't understand reality today none of the black mormons who spoke to a reporter said he or she would vote strictly based on race or religion , only conscience even after earlier this month , invoking christianity and the golden rule treat others the way you would want to be treated , he said mormon supporters of mr obama did not waver , saying they made a distinction between their own private religious beliefs and what they think is right for secular society to my way of thinking the secular government has no business messing in these private affairs among individuals , ms driessen said what other people choose to do is not a problem for me , as long as it does n't harm me ms spruill , 31 , who converted to mormonism while serving in the navy 13 years ago , said the decision did not matter to her , either , adding , i applaud the president s fortitude religion is always on her mind , however , and she particularly enjoys a certain political punch line that is making the rounds among some black mormons here it goes like this mr obama calls mr romney to say he thinks it is time the country had a mormon president but just as mr romney is thanking the president for the apparent concession , mr obama interrupts him to say , my baptism is on saturday undoubtedly , some black mormons are still wrestling with the decision of whom to vote for it s tough because you 've got the first black president , but he s running against a candidate who has the values i believe in , said eddie gist , 43 , a black mormon who lives in salt lake city mr gist said he may end up leaning more toward mr romney , but added , i really ca n't go wrong either way in 1971 , the church founded the genesis group , a support organization for black mormons in salt lake city today , it counts nearly 500 members , according to don harwell , the group s president , who converted in 1983 mr harwell , who is black and originally from los angeles , said that church members kept politics out of genesis activities and temple life , so he could not speak to their presidential preferences as for himself , he is a registered republican mr harwell and his wife , jerri harwell , a professor who supports mr obama , are frequent political sparring partners i 've met romney , i 've talked to romney , and i feel good about romney , he said over dinner one night this month with ms harwell in salt lake my biggest thing is getting somebody in there with integrity and business sense , and that s what he brings ms harwell disagreed he has n't even worked in years asked whether she felt compelled to bend to peer pressure in conservative utah , where religion and culture are so thoroughly intertwined , ms harwell said no the religion is very much a part of me , but i was born black and i will die black beyond that , she feels that mr obama is the better candidate my problem with romney , politically , is that he cannot relate to the common man , she said i'm afraid of what would happen to the economy given his frame of reference paul sleet , a black computer systems engineer and photographer in st louis , joined the mormon church in 1989 he has five children , one of whom is serving as a missionary everything the church represents seems to be more clearly represented by michelle and barack obama , he said i'm 100 percent mormon and committed to my religion , he said , but i 've never really thought about whether i 'd have the same pride in a mormon being elected president i do n't know if i 'd have the same tears in my eyes
political racists and soccer revolutionaries haunt the clash between hungary and the netherlands as the dutch team arrives in budapest on tuesday ready to decide who will top the fledgling group d table in world cup qualifying both teams won on friday hungary demolished tiny andorra , 50 , and the netherlands limped to a slightly fortuitous 20 victory over the other main threat in the group , turkey and are tied on points with romania , which beat estonia in tallinn in last year s euro 2012 qualifiers , the dutch visited budapest and beat a young hungary team , 40 as intriguing , though , is the match s cultural backdrop while hungary has a terrible reputation for racism , a new book by simon kuper , ajax , the dutch , the war the strange tale of soccer during europe s darkest hour , was released on tuesday , questioning the dutch s sterling reputation hungary s reputation has been well earned after joining the axis powers in world war ii , the hungarian arrow cross party slaughtered 90 percent of budapest s jews in the last year of the war in contemporary politics , jobbik , the third largest party in hungary , promulgates an intolerant and racist platform and , at a recent friendly match against israel , haaretz reported that hungarian fans chanted , palestine , palestine , stinking jews , buchenwald and heil benito mussolini but the notoriously tolerant image of the dutch takes a hit in kuper s book in it , he links the closeknit club atmosphere of dutch society to both its soccer strength it is the country with the highest proportion of registered soccer players and its wartime shame unlike the heroic public resistance in denmark , where fewer than 500 jews were captured by the nazis , 100 , 000 dutch jews were killed that s a highest proportion of the jewish population than any other european country other than poland , where the death camps were located even anne frank and her family , kuper notes , were probably betrayed by a dutch person and seized from their hiding place by a german and three dutch policemen , one of whom was still working for the amsterdam force in 1980 kuper cowrote soccernomics soccer s version of moneyball and is one of the few writers \( along with , most notably , franklin foer \) who interprets soccer as a global , social phenomenon closely interwoven with politics kuper , who is jewish , grew up in holland and the original book was first issued in dutch , so he has close knowledge of his subject he peers deep inside the clubs to see what happened in wartime and , in a more recently written chapter , what that means for contemporary society kuper notes that no dutch prime minister was voted out of office between 1973 and 2010 , but the postwar consensus has been radically disturbed by the murdered pim fortuyn and his de facto heir in antiimmigrant populism , geert wilders as well as politics , there s also soccer posterity at stake soccer fans hope that worldclass players like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie can put the ignominy of their euro 2012 performance behind them and that hungarians like d m szalai and tam s priskin can make names for themselves after all , both countries produced decadedefining paradigmshifting teams hungary s mighty magyars of the 1950s , headed by ferenc pusk s , changed the face of soccer after world war ii they won the olympics , were the first team to defeat the english in england , and were only denied a world cup triumph by a west german team aided by the weather and poor refereeing \( and , allegedly , doping \) politics ended that era when the soviet union invaded hungary in 1956 the dutch were also beaten by a german team in a world cup final in 1974 the magyars unstoppable front line of puskas , n ndor hidegkuti and s ndor kocsis was an inspiration for dutch coach rinus michels though underachievers as measured in trophies , michels s dutch team of the 1970s was truly the first modern soccer team michels s total football philosophy was built around ajax s johan cruijff and a team of highly skilled players whose fluid positional play seemed to capture the new political freedom of the age these deft orangeclad missionaries won over a generation of neutrals and , as with today s barcelona team , the famously tolerant dutch became global favorites but the myth of world war ii tolerance , and the politics of contemporary liberalism , have both begun to unravel apace , according to kuper in holland , ajax are known as the jews , for a variety of reasons none of which are related to a sizable jewish fan base or jews on the roster kuper tells how fans of their main rivals , feyenoord , hiss at ajax fans as a gesture toward the gas of auschwitz kuper paints this as part of a larger picture in which the insular and rulebound dutch clubs no longer provide stability \( or a way of turning a blind eye to the plight of others \) but rather a base from which to fear immigrants and others , perverting michels s famous axiom that football is war kuper moves from his critique of dutch failings during the war to what he calls a national lurch away from liberalism to show how profoundly the racist bleacher chants have pervaded the national conversation , he discusses the lack of apology offered by officials of major clubs whose fans sing antisemitic songs he notes the flagrant antisemitism of a feyenoordsupporting member of the press and he cites a match between ajax and feyenoord s reserve teams in 2004 where ajax fans invaded the field and started attacking the feyenoord players the one happy image of that night was ajax s daniel de ridder , son of an israeli mother , using his body to shield his friend , the feyenoord player van persie that same van persie , now a star striker for manchester united , will head out onto the field of the ferenc puskas stadium on tuesday night to play against the home nation and for 90 minutes , even the ghosts and shadows of history and politics will step aside to see which team can begin the long march to brazil 2014 dan friedman is the managing editor of the forward he is currently at work on a book about tears for fears
washington mitt romney , who presents his business background as his chief credential to be president , doesn t cite any models for a good reason there aren t any with almost no exceptions , successful us presidents have come from politics or the military none of the presidents generally considered great or near great by historians had primarily a business background other characteristics than business acumen seem to be more associated with what people expect of a president , says david rothkopf , who runs an international business advisory company and just published a book , power , inc the epic rivalry between big business and government and the reckoning that lies ahead president barack obama s campaign is appealing to this attitude by reminding voters of romney s career as a privateequity executive but , as i explain in my latest page two column , the attacks have been less vitriolic than in the past the big three on practically every list of great presidents are abraham lincoln , george washington and franklin d roosevelt fdr had no business background lincoln failed in his venture as a store owner and washington , who belonged to the landed gentry , had a mixed record with his agriculture business at mount vernon the most successful business executive to reach the white house was probably herbert hoover , a wealthy mining executive he was president when the great depression hit , and is usually rated one of the weakest chief executives more recently , jimmy carter and both presidents bush had business backgrounds on a smaller scale than hoover none is generally considered among the better leaders conversely , ronald reagan and harry truman are given good grades by many historians reagan was an actor truman , after a failed business career , including bankrupting his haberdashery , was a politician for decades before ascending to the white house
cairo someday i 'd love to create a journalism course based on covering the uprising in egypt , now approaching its first anniversary lesson no 1 would be the following whenever you see elephants flying , shut up and take notes the egyptian uprising is the equivalent of elephants flying no one predicted it , and no one had seen this before if you did n't see it coming , what makes you think you know where it s going \? that s why the smartest thing now is to just shut up and take notes if you do , the first thing you 'll write is that the islamist parties the muslim brotherhood and the salafist al nour party just crushed the secular liberals , who actually sparked the rebellion here , in the free egyptian parliamentary elections , winning some 65 percent of the seats to not be worried about the theocratic , antipluralistic , antiwomen srights , xenophobic strands in these islamist parties is to be recklessly na ve but to assume that the islamists will not be impacted , or moderated , by the responsibilities of power , by the contending new power centers here and by the priority of the public for jobs and clean government is to miss the dynamism of egyptian politics today come with me to cairo s dirtpoor shubra elkhema neighborhood and the dilapidated omar abdel aziz school , where i watched the last round of voting on wednesday at a womenonly voting center we were guided by amr hassan , a 22yearold commerce student from the 'hood a secular youth , who fought to topple the hosni mubarak regime in tahrir square last year here is what was so striking virtually all the women we interviewed after the voting all of whom were veiled , some with only slits for their eyes said that they had voted for either the muslim brotherhood or the salafists but almost none said they had voted that way for religious reasons many said they voted for islamists because they were neighbors , people they knew , while secular liberal candidates had never once visited some illiterate elderly women confided that they could not read the ballot and just voted where their kids told them to but practically all of them said they had voted for the muslim brotherhood or salafist candidates because they expected them to deliver better , more honest government not more mosques or liquor bans here are some quotes from egyptian women on why they voted islamist i love the muslim brotherhood they are the only honest ones i want good education and clean air to breathe we need proper medical care i want my kids to be properly educated they ca n't find any jobs the muslim brotherhood is not just an islamist party it is going to help solve all the problems of the country we have to get the youth working and to raise salaries education here is only getting worse my biggest fear is lack of security we sit in our homes afraid you are afraid your son wo n't be able to go back and forth to school without being kidnapped meanwhile , when i asked our young guide hassan , the revolutionary , whom he had voted for , he said that he wrote on his ballot down with the scaf the acronym for the egyptian military council now running the country he spat out his disgust with the fact that while secular youth like him toppled mubarak , the islamist parties were winning the elections and the army generals who abandoned mubarak to save themselves were still in power ! and there you have egypt today a fourway power struggle between the army , the rising islamist parties , the smaller liberal parties and the secular youth of tahrir square of them will have a say in how this story plays out we want to see a new egyptian government with new thoughts , said hassan i am ready to go back into tahrir square if i have to indeed , everyone feels more empowered now the army has its guns and now runs the country both the islamists and the liberals have won electoral mandates and the secular youth from tahrir feel empowered by the street by their now proven ability to mobilize and to fight whenever they see things going awry even the silent majority here , called the party of the couch , feels more empowered , having just voted in high numbers in an election where the votes actually got counted my favorite election story was told to me by an international observer , who asked not to be identified his voting station had just closed and as the polling workers were loading up the box filled with votes onto a bus to be taken to a central counting station , an egyptian woman , who had just voted , ran over to them and shouted please , never leave that box alone this is our future go and make sure they put it in the right place that box and all the hopes stuffed into it by so many average egyptians is surely necessary for a new beginning here but it is not sufficient the country needs a leader there is still a huge vacuum at the top who can take all those votes , all those hopes , and meld them into a strategy to create the jobs , schooling , justice and security that all egyptians clearly crave if that happens , those ballot boxes really will have delivered a different future for egypt until then , i am just taking notes
eugene , ore where better to hold the men s 10 , 000meter kenyan olympic trials than here \? that was the rationale among kenyan running officials , who held their trials for the event here on friday night , hoping to find out which three of their 15 distance runners to take to the london olympic games to get the best three , organizers said they needed to take their contenders thousands of miles away from the altitudes and training conditions of their home country to compete in a climate more akin to that of london in spite of kenyan men s consistently strong performances at international competitions , none has won a gold medal in the 10k since the 1968 olympic games in mexico city in contrast , ethiopians , their neighbors to the north , have scooped up gold at every olympics since atlanta in 1996 news that the kenyan trials were being held in eugene initially baffled some in the track community here and the decision resulted in some backlash in among those angry that their country s trials would not be held within their borders , officials said we knew that the kenyans had not been happy with the results they were getting at the 10 , 000meter distance , tom jordan , meet director for the prefontaine classic , the event that hosted the kenyan trials , said they dominate the marathon and they have the two best milers in the world , so why ca n't they win a gold medal in the olympics at 10 , 000 meters \? nicknamed skinner s mudhole , eugene delivered on its promise of soggy , londonlike weather during part of the kenyan runners' stay kenya is known for its vivid savannahs and wildlife , but oregon s landscape is home to salmon , beavers and nutria though lane county did not boast much in the way of east african cuisine , however , the kenyan delegation gave good reviews to the catered pasta and meat dishes provided by the event organizers nike , the shoe company that traces its roots to eugene s hayward field , financed the journey , said a spokesman for athletics kenya , the governing body for track in the country \( the company has long sponsored the kenyan team and the prefontaine classic \) following the kenyan delegation s arrival in portland on wednesday night , the kenyans trained on nike s beaverton campus thursday before heading down interstate 5 to eugene to prepare for friday s race , the runners trained on trails along the willamette river and pre s trail , the famed tribute to the great oregon distance runner , who died at 24 in a car accident many of the kenyan runners had experience training and competing in the united states but found even the additional hours spent getting to the smaller , offbeat eugene to be worth it i'm very happy here , bitan karoki said at this altitude , i do n't feel too tired when i run karoki said his jet lag was minimal , as well we 've tried to stay busy preparing , he said the delegation stayed at the valley river inn , a spacious hotel that shares a parking lot with valley river center , one of the largest shopping malls in the area the kenyan olympic hopefuls who made the trip to eugene included micah kogo , who won a bronze medal in the 2008 beijing games josphat bett kipkoech , who finished third in last year s prefontaine 10 , 000 meters moses masai , who earned a bronze medal in the 2009 world championships and came in fourth at the beijing games and wilson kiprop , the 2010 african championships gold medalist in the 10k some 7 , 800 fans piled into the stands of hayward field on friday night to watch the kenyans , the main event the event was basically a race that most people would n't watch on television , jordan said , adding , but here they really appreciate distance running as spectators filed in , ominous clouds loomed over a portrait of prefontaine on the field after the discuses were thrown , triple jumps hopped and shorter races around the track completed , a light drizzle trickled down the kenyan delegation began to warm up as the women s 10k wrapped up around 8 30 \( the ethiopian tirunesh dibaba won \) the audience and athletes stood for the playing of the kenyan national anthem shortly before 9 pm by 8 45 , the race had begun , 30 feet thudding on the shiny track , the smell of rain hanging over the field ten minutes into the race , most of the runners were still tightly packed together , a new leader popping to the front every few seconds they stayed a thicket past the 6 , 000meter mark , and only with 2 , 000 meters left did a group of five runners emerge to the front kiprop took the lead with four laps left , the audience took to its feet , increasing the roar of clapping and stomping in the bleachers with 600 meters left , the race was among four runners kiprop crossed the finish line first , in a time of 27 minutes 198 seconds , with masai and karoki behind him the other 12 men will not go to the london games for the 10k it was a tough race , kiprop said through an interpreter , with the kenyan flag draped over his shoulders i 've been preparing for it i am the world halfmarathon champion , and now to be representing my country in the olympics is the most glorious thing within minutes of the race s end , many of the runners had left the track , quietly exiting and beginning the long journey home across 10 time zones kenyan officials were pleased with the results of the race , as well as the hospitality they received from locals most of our athletes have been competing in europe at the sea level , isaiah kiplagat , president of athletics kenya , said and when they come to kenya for the trials , because of the altitude , they are beaten by some young boys who have no experience at all so we thought this time around , we 'd bring them to sea level so that everybody has a chance to do the best for himself then , we take them back to train at high altitudes before they come to london so it s good for us and the rain during the race \? i'm very pleased , he said of the weather very , very pleased
re \( news article , june 11 \) weapons are recovered in roughly one in 1 , 000 stopandfrisks in new york city about 90 percent do not result in arrest or summons even if you believe that stopping and frisking 684 , 330 people last year with these results is a sound practice , there remains a very good reason to rightsize this racebased policy eightyseven percent of all people stopped are black and latino , though they are 23 percent and 29 percent of our population , respectively stopandfrisk as carried out in new york breeds mistrust of law enforcement among communities of color particularly young men , who are disproportionately targeted for stops the policy actually jeopardizes public safety by creating entire communities that are reluctant to call the police because of what they see as a lack of police legitimacy the new york police department should use stopandfrisk like a surgeon s scalpel , not a blunt ax glenn e martin vice president , fortune society long island city , queens june 11 , 2012  mayor michael r bloomberg claims that the low rate of gun seizures shows that the stopandfrisk policy saves lives by persuading criminals to leave their guns home out of fear of arrest but focusing only on gun seizures in stopandfrisks obscures a larger reality the new york police department seizes thousands of guns each year by other means , and those means are far more effective than stopandfrisks at keeping people safe in 2011 , the nypd made 684 , 330 stops and seized 780 guns , a rate of 11 guns per 1 , 000 stops but the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms reported that the nypd submitted 3 , 980 crime guns for tracing through the bureau s system in the same year the simple math shows that 3 , 200 guns were seized by means other than stopandfrisks , four times more than were seized in street stops by allocating police resources to inefficient stopandfrisk tactics instead of using tactics that have higher public safety payoffs , the nypd is missing out on a substantial number of gun seizures by leaving guns on the street , new yorkers are still at risk of being shot the 1 , 821 shootings in 2011 are only slightly fewer than the 1 , 892 shootings in 2002 , when fewer than 100 , 000 people were stopped the seizure rate of about onetenth of 1 percent and the persistence of shootings show that the police are looking for guns in all the wrong places jeffrey fagan david rudovsky new york , june 11 , 2012 put aside that there is no evidence none that new york city s stopandfrisk policy saves lives if the new york police department stops and frisks people to deter crime , rather than based on reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is engaged in crime , the stopandfrisk policy is unconstitutional the constitution limits police power , to protect our personal liberty it would probably deter crime to beat suspects bloody on the street would mayor michael r bloomberg add that tactic to his saves lives stump speech \? jenn rolnick borchetta new york , june 11 , 2012
the mega millions lottery last month with its whopping 656 million prize captured the intense interest of americans across the country estimates suggest that as many as 100 million people participated no matter that the odds of winning the jackpot were known to be much less than being struck by lightning twice investing a few bucks \( or in the case of washington wizards forward chris singleton , ten thousand \) for the chance to become a centamillionaire was irresistible for nearly half of the adult population of the country the overwhelming success of the mega millions enterprise makes it an irresistible target for something more a way to transform american elections and along the way reduce our deep political dysfunction our takenoprisoners tribal politics have at root the reality that the two parties narrow ideological bases have far more influence on the selection of candidates , the positions taken by the candidates and the pressures placed on elected officials than the rest of the population with turnout in presidential elections hovering between 50 and 60 percent , 30 to 40 percent for midterm congressional contests , and sometimes 10 to 20 percent for primaries , it is the bases who rule at the same time , political consultants focus the bulk of their energies on a twoprong strategy for driving the base voters one way or the other both making sure that your party s base is energized and that the other party s base is depressed the obvious fallout is that the issues that dominate are the ones that excite or infuriate the bases abortion , samesex marriage , guns , immigration and the language used to whip up the bases is harsh and extreme all this does even more to turn off voters in the middle other countries like australia have ameliorated this dynamic by implementing mandatory attendance at the polls down under , if one does not show up , even to cast a ballot for none of the above , a fine of roughly 15 is imposed the result has been turnout of 90 percent or more high turnout is nice in and of itself but australian politicians of all stripes say that the main impact has been to turn the campaign , the issues and the discourse away from the extremes and toward the persuadable voters in the middle after all , the pols know that both party bases will be there , with predictable results and that what they need to do is persuade the persuadables this means a sharper focus on the big issues that concern them and the country , from budgets to energy and climate change to education and jobs , and more moderate rhetoric , since fiery words will turn away moderate voters i would love to implement the australian model in america , but i recognize that mandatory voting actually , mandatory anything is a hard sell in this country so here is another idea a series of mega millionslike lotteries for primary and general elections , with awards that can range up to the hundreds of millions for a big general election where your lottery ticket is your voting stub it is a reasonable guess , given what we have seen with big lotteries in the states , that a billion dollars for all federal primary and general elections in a cycle \( a small sum to enhance democracy and reduce dysfunction \) would , by providing a very powerful incentive to get americans registered and to actually turn up at the polls , result in a robust increase in turnout , perhaps to as much as 75 or 80 percent the idea could be applied in states and localities with smaller prizes and not simply using public money perhaps auto dealers could donate cars , for example another way to implement the plan would be to use a state s voter registration rolls and pick five names at random as winners with the names announced after the election , but the prizes given only to those who actually voted all it would take to send a powerful message to other nonvoters is one example in an election where an individual was picked but lost a corvette or 100 , 000 because he or she did not vote to be sure , the basic concept is not new in 2006 , a doctor named mark osterloh managed to get a proposition on the arizona ballot to offer a 1 million prize for a voter in the state s upcoming primary or general election \( those who voted in both would have two tickets , or chances at the prize \) with the lottery winnings coming from unclaimed rewards left in the state s own lottery pool the initiative was widely panned as tawdry , or as dangerous for encouraging uninformed citizens to cast uninformed votes , or as aiming at increasing turnout for no good reason beyond having a higher turnout it failed six years later , after still more dysfunction and acrimony , those objections are much less resonant the idea of encouraging voting to provide more muscle for the broad center of america should be more appealing the counterargument that we should not be bribing people to vote , less so the experience of countries like australia shows that there is no real downside to having nearuniversal turnout and the idea of using a carrot to enhance turnout and depress the role of ideological extremists , instead of a stick like a fine for not showing up at the polls , may be more attractive now than it was in 2006 enhanced voting in primaries , for example , would probably lead over time to fewer bombthrowers and more problem solvers in state legislatures and in congress the best way to implement this idea is to provide some empirical tests it would be nice if , say , mayor bloomberg s foundation kicked in 10 million as a prize for the next new york city election in 2013 to see what impact that had on turnout in new york or perhaps a small state or a city could try its own version of a vote lottery , using a combination of public and private funds if people are willing to stand in line for hours to get a precious mega millions ticket , it is reasonable to assume that they would take the steps necessary to vote to have a chance at the same dream plenty of americans go the extra mile , sometimes literally , to cast their vote but lots of others do not adding an incentive to bring more of the latter to the polls would enhance democracy , not trivialize it norman ornstein is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute his new book on america s political dysfunction , it s even worse than it looks , written with tom mann of the brookings institution , will be published next week
amsterdam few truly insignificant traits receive as much attention as lefthandedness in just the last couple of generations , an orientation once associated with menace has become associated with leadership , creativity , even athletic prowess presidents gerald r ford , george bush , bill clinton and barack obama were born lefthanded \( as was ronald reagan , though he learned to write with his right hand \) folklore has it that southpaws are unusually common in art and architecture schools lefthanded athletes like tim tebow and randy johnson are celebrated the idea of correcting lefthandedness , common in the postwar united states , now seems quaint if not barbaric my parents understood i was lefthanded and did n't make me write against the grain the way so many people their age had to , jonathan galassi writes in lefthanded , his new collection of poems in some ways , today s attitudes toward lefthandedness are a mirror image of those of the 20th century \( perhaps the worst century for lefthanders \) , if not quite a return to the era before 1900 , when lefthandedness was generally considered uninteresting an amusing anomaly to many , and an annoyance to teachers and parents when raffaello da montelupo , a 16thcentury assistant notary in florence , wrote a receipt perfectly with his left hand , the notary called in all 10 or so of his employees to watch this miracle in puzzled exhilaration \( they had expected mirror script , of the kind leonardo da vinci practiced \) , but that was the end of it where people ate using their fingers from common dishes , as is still the case in much of the arab world , it was understandably mandatory that the left hand be reserved for unsavory tasks and the right used exclusively for clean ones lefthanders complied , as a matter of course , and still do the problems in such cultures arise for lefthanded western expatriates accustomed to cutlery lefthanders historically had less to fear at the dining table than in the classroom a classroom is a power struggle the more tenuous the hold teachers have on their pupils , the less inclined they are to tolerate even the slightest deviation from any rule good teachers exude authority their less gifted colleagues resort to authoritarianism sit quietly at your desks , take out your notebooks and write that need for conformity was one reason that lefthanders used to be forced , often quite brutally , to write with their right hands but since most people before the 19th century hardly went to school at all , the average lefthander lived a relatively untrammeled lefthanded life in the village , on the farm and even in the factory the popular image of persecuted lefthanders across history is a gross exaggeration what did change for southpaws , around the turn of the 20th century , was the blossoming of modern psychology one of its basic insights was that we humans like other animals interact with the world in ways that change our mental constitutions think of pavlov s dog , which started salivating at the mere sound of a bell once it learned that the ringing signified feeding time if the child s mind was a tabula rasa a clean slate upon which , as mao zedong once put it , the most beautiful characters could be written then a person s character and mindset would not be immutable and godgiven , but shaped and honed in the environment nature would take a back seat to nurture the idea of normality took root , and with it a nasty premise if minds could be shaped , it followed that they could be wellshaped or illshaped with respect to some norm , naturally the greatest common denominator abnormality undesirable by definition could be remedied , since minds were putty lefthandedness became an illness that needed curing pundits of psychology promoted this dismal view without mercy in his 1937 handbook the backward child , the british child psychologist sir cyril burt depicted lefthanders as fumblers and bunglers who squint and stammer and flounder about like seals out of water a decade later , abram blau , head of child psychiatry at mount sinai hospital , condemned lefthandedness as an expression of infantile negativism leading to rebellious stubbornness , secretive superstition , parsimony , obsessive cleanliness and other unpleasant traits all due , it was believed , to an unloving refrigerator mother as a result , turning a lefthanded child became an act of mercy and the duty of every responsible parent and teacher many older lefthanders today remember those times all too clearly thank heavens for the liberating revolution of the 1960s , which for all its shortcomings put to rest the unquestioned authority of such specious theories society eased back and opened up , and the pressure on lefthanders abated when the pendulum of scientific wisdom swung back around 1980 and the tabula rasa idea , still cherished by the hip egalitarian philosophers of the '60s , lost ground to a new emphasis on nature rather than nurture , the heat was finally off for lefthanders or was it \? the previous , deeply rooted tendency to attribute any number of abnormal mental and physical defects to lefthanders has now broadened to include a tendency to see in lefthandedness the stirrings of genius lefthanders have been redefined as creative , broadminded , natural leaders meanwhile , other studies continue to identify all sorts of negative associations with lefthanders clumsiness , propensity to die prematurely , higher breast cancer rates and greater vulnerability to suicide after reviewing hundreds of such studies for a book on lefthanders , i found that the evidence of positive qualities associated with lefthandedness was anecdotal at best , while the scores of studies associating lefthandedness with all manner of afflictions were generally too unreliable to have any practical consequence even today , only a handful of facts about hand preference warrant the epithet wellestablished lefthanders do have an edge in oneonone sports like tennis , boxing and baseball , and lefthandedness clearly tends to become less pronounced with age we also know that twins are roughly twice as likely to be lefthanded as singletons and that men are slightly more likely to be lefthanded than women beyond that , most common knowledge about lefthandedness consists of myths myths that , curiously , even lefthanders themselves believe in , like the notion that lefthanders always smear their writing solid research has shown that the writing of lefthanders in third grade is indistinguishable from that of righthanders , in both speed and quality so while it s true that the west has become a better place for lefthanders over the past few decades , ignorance still abounds among researchers , no doubt mostly righthanded , who imagine problems in lefthanders where there are none among journalists who keep rehashing old , long discredited stories among teachers who remain ignorant of how to instruct lefthanders correctly on writing and among those who still try , though with greater subtlety than in the past , to pressure little lefthanders into using their wrong right hand
berkeley , calif \( ap \) last year , california catcher turned down close to 50 , 000 to return for his senior season in college rather than sign with the chicago white sox as a 13thround draft pick cal closer matt flemer also walked away from 50 , 000 after kansas city selected him in the 19th round the university of san francisco lefthander , a 25thround selection by the texas rangers last year , took a similar route and passed up the money they all know they took a chance in the baseball business , college seniors who want to keep playing have little choice but to accept whatever money major league teams will offer once their eligibility is up for seniors it s still the same thing you still have to prove yourself again , flemer said the leverage is still minimal for seniors yet more might follow suit this year and stay in school as the college season and spring training begin , players , coaches and executives are curious about the way this year will shape up for prospects of varying talents the amateur draft in june could be like none before because of radical changes in baseball s collective bargaining agreement aimed at slowing spending on players with no professional experience with the new restraints on the signing bonuses that major league clubs give amateur picks , the days of the twosport high school star choosing to jump straight to pro baseball and pass up the chance to play major college football could be over why \? because multimilliondollar signing bonuses will no longer be available in the lower rounds that means more college players selected beyond the early rounds might stay in school and greater numbers of high school athletes are expected to choose the college and juniorcollege routes rather than receive smaller bonuses than the recent norm we 're all speculating how it s going to affect guys and how it s not going to affect guys , said john barr , a special assistant to san francisco general manager brian sabean , who handles much of the giants' draft preparations the kid who is both mentally and physically ready to go out , i think he still goes out for other players , it will not be such an easy decision still , many know they will have little choice but to accept the senior discount the new collective bargaining , i think it s good for college baseball , said mark marquess , the longtime stanford coach i do n't think kids will get offered the enormous amount of money , which is good for college baseball and for professional baseball because it saves them money i think it 'll help more out of high school , that young man who s not going to get 6 million or 7 million that player will not face the pressure of playing for money and will get to work on a college degree for however long he stays , marquess said under the new labor contract , the signing deadline has been moved to july 13 from aug 15 last season given how bonuses are slotted , players should have a good idea of the financial parameters going in some baseball executives think that could lead to swifter postdraft negotiations , but others think the usual wait for deadline night will continue some 400 players could be affected in the first 10 rounds alone teams will have a pool of money from which to sign players that number comes from the sum of set figures in the latest labor deal 72 million for the no 1 overall pick , expected to be the stanford ace mark appel 62 million for no 2 52 million for no 3 42 million for no 4 and so on the 50th overall choice , for example , is slated for a 1 million bonus , while it s 500 , 000 for no 95 picks 300 through the end of the 10th round of the draft will be due 125 , 000 there is wiggle room if a player does not sign , the team loses the money for that slot and if a player signs for less than the allotted amount , the team could shift that money to other picks , even in lower rounds for players selected in the 11th round and beyond , portions of signing bonuses above 100 , 000 would count against the bonus pool whether that sways college juniors , time will tell i felt i was n't missing out by not signing , said krist , part of a cal team that reached the college world series last season after the program was cut and later reinstated his stock dropped in a pitchingheavy 2011 draft , so he thinks this year might be different college coaches and baseball executives have varying opinions on what might happen , because seniors do lose leverage it s something they have to embrace and think about from a career standpoint , san francisco coach nino giarratano said cal s tony renda , a junior second baseman who expects to be taken in the early rounds this year , does not envision much change from the previous format but he realizes that high picks will still be among those set to receive nice signing bonuses the seniors , he said , will have a tough time getting big money baseball s kind of a tricky sport with the draft , renda said it s in the player s best interest if he goes his junior year even though the rules have changed , because once he goes into his senior year they do n't have to give him that slot money they can give him lower than that because what are you going to do , get a job \? you can play baseball or get a job it has n't changed how people will go about the draft , but what it will change is high school players you wo n't have the high school player go in the 20th round and get a million dollars that kid will go to school the minnesota twins are only a few months from perhaps their most important draft in franchise history they pick second their highest selection since choosing joe mauer at no 1 in 2001 and have four more selections among the first 73 , including nos 32 and 42 we just do n't know how it s going to go , how teams are going to try to get creative , said sean johnson , the twins' west coast scouting supervisor you might see more high school kids getting to college before , kids who were not worth 1 million wanted 500 , 000 or 600 , 000 , and teams would give them what they wanted because they saw this coming you 're going to see the college game improve he added it will just depend on the kids some will take what they can get for the seniors , it s tough to guess what that might be remer , who returned for his final season at san francisco with the defending west coast conference champion dons , could wind up benefiting from the attention on the top starter kyle zimmer and get more notice than he would otherwise it s what you 've been dreaming of since you were 6 , remer said , so i do n't know if it s ever an easy decision to skip out on something you could get hurt this year and you might have just lost the opportunity the decision came down to looking into the future do i want to play professional baseball \? yes do i want to play as long as i can \? yes that oneyear separation between signing this year over last year , is it going to be a huge difference \? maybe not st mary s pitcher kyle barraclough was a 40thround draft pick by minnesota last year but was not offered a contract he sought a sixfigure signing bonus , and the twins did not have that kind of money so barraclough returned for his senior season , working toward his degree and playing in a new ballpark on campus jedd soto , a former scout in his ninth season as st mary s coach , expects barraclough to be picked in the first five rounds in the june draft it s pretty easy to explain to families about coming back to get a degree , he said

it was while stepping over the channels of ochre fluid that run between the raggedly cascading apartment blocks that make up the mumbai slum known as cheeta camp that james potter discovered a reallife version of what could be a scene out of a magical realist novel by salman rushdie a toilet facility that gets built and then torn down again , always on the verge of being finished , but never usable five or six people circled around to tell me the tale of the perpetually abouttoopen toilet apparently , for the last 15 years or so , the toilet had been built , demolished and rebuilt three times , said mr potter , a hindispeaking student who is pursuing his master s degree in public health at harvard each time , local politicians claimed that the lavatory facility would open after the elections , but that never happened instead , the residents told mr potter , the government workers would just tear it down and start to build a new one next time the elections rolled around the neighbors didn t have any expectation that the current structure would be opened any time soon , said mr potter mr potter was one of a dozen students from the harvard school of public health who traveled to mumbai in january to research life in the city s slums the mishmash of variables in high density city life make urban public health one of the most pressing and yet least understood aspects of global health this is especially true in mumbai , with over half the city s population of more than 12 million living in slums mr potter and his colleagues decided to create a map of cheeta camp s toilets \( the interactive map can be found here \) that meant two weeks tromping around the slum , figuring out where the toilets were located , who had put them up , how they functioned , and if they were even operational the students saw toilets as a way to delve into the inner workings of the community , to see what worked and what did not of course , toilets are more than just a proxy they are about as fundamental as you can get poor sanitation is one of the most important underlying causes in the country s pervasive malnutrition , said dr richard cash of the harvard school of public health , who led the student trip dr cash has plenty of experience with the effect of poor sanitation on health his work on cholera in bangladesh in 1960s led to the creation of oral rehydration therapy , an inexpensive and simple way to treat diarrhea that has saved millions of lives cheeta camp is an indian oddity a planned slum it was formed in northeastern mumbai when an impoverished community was moved to make way for a government atomic research station the displaced residents were given plots of land on which to settle , but no provision was made for basic infrastructure like sewers so toilets were built ad hoc the first thing the students found was that nobody really knew how many toilets were in the camp the local authorities said one thing , local nongovernmental organizations another so the students counted and mapped they found 46 toilet facilities , containing 701 toilets , to serve cheetah camp s 117 , 000person population of these 46 facilities , 38 were functional that means roughly one toilet per 170 people while a recent movement has sprung up over getting the government to provide more free public toilets , in cheeta camp , the harvard students found that most people preferred the pay toilets unlike the free public toilets , the pay ones , which were generally provided by a nongovernmental organization , had water , electric light and were kept cleaner than governmentrun facilities well worth their 1 or 2 rupee \( 2 or 3 us cents \) cost in the old days , women would avoid the public toilets entirely , said aminabi mohd abdul farah , an 80yearold grandmother of six who has been at cheeta camp since 1976 the ladies would go in the jungle , they were too scared to go to the toilet , which was little more than a hut it was unsafe people were scared the new facilities , built in her neighborhood about five years ago , are a huge improvement , she said there is water , light , everything so we don t have any problem why get scared \? the fact that poor people are willing to pay for cleaner , safer toilets belies the typical portrait of the poor as helpless victims the clean pay toilets seem to have made a difference now we don t have to spend so much on doctors previously we had to struggle a lot , but now are happier , said kanis sayyed hashim , a 45yearold mother who has lived in the slum for 26 years and said her children get sick less now that they use the pay toilets pay or no , small children do not generally use any of the toilet facilities , finding them too big , messy and intimidating instead , they generally do their business in the open , directly into sewers or near drains some slums have toilet facilities built for small children , but there are none in cheeta camp yet the lack of basic services in cheeta camp is typical of indian slums despite india s economic boom , most government services created in recent years help the betteroff population of city dwellers , according to a report in the journal economic and political weekly on sanitation problems in the slums corruption and lack of accountability for officials are pervasive problems governments are often loath to even officially acknowledge slum dwellers , because it would imply they should then receive basic infrastructure , said dr patildeshmukh , executive director of partners for urban knowledge , action and research , a mumbai urban research and advocacy organization by mapping the locations and functionality of the toilets , the students were echoing a process that had been used by slum dwellers organizations in india to force government to act the act of naming streets , counting citizens and mapping facilities turns information into an advocacy tool the students have given the map to local nongovernmental organizations and the medical director of cheeta camp s health center , who seemed pleased to have a better map of the camp and thought the toilet information would be helpful , said rosemary wyber , one of the harvard team when the map is finalized , they will present it to the municipal corporation of greater mumbai , the city s governing body the first thing we heard when we arrived was that there wasn t enough space to build new toilets , said jennifer weaver , another of the harvard students once their map was finished , she said , they could that show that of 46 toilet blocs , eight did not work so why not fix those toilets \?

back when barack obama seemed to be in command of the race and had the poll numbers to back it up that was just a week ago , wasn t it \? there were abundant suggestions that the fix was in , that a compliant , genetically liberal media was smoothing the way for the reelection fo the democratic incumbent rep paul ryan complained on fox news sunday about liberal bias , various conservatives signed a letter suggesting that coverage of the race had been corrupted by a proobama media agenda , and there were even charges that the polls themselves were skewed by political motives ben smith , editor of buzzfeed , said simple political thermodynamics were at work when the numbers aren t working for a campaign , the campaign tends to blame the data rather than the message the side that s losing typically gets obsessed with unskewing the polls , and maybe it was mitt romney s long , long time spent losing that made it so extreme this cycle but after a remarkable performance by mitt romney in last week s debate and a remarkably bad one by the incumbent , a poll by the pew research center showed that mr romney had not only made up ground , but was four points ahead of president barack obama among likely voters \( and a gallup poll seemed to support the notion that mr romney was surging \) so , did the mainstream and allegedly liberal media try to knock down the new numbers \? hardly most reveled in the turn of events because reporters , regardless of their own political affiliations , are always in favor of news in stories all over the newsstand and the web , romney galloped to a lead , democrats were demoralized as mr obama s edge was erased and mr romney surged keyboards clacked and adjectives flew because the poll numbers signaled that the last month of the campaign , which had been looking a bit dreary , was going to be a horse race and reporters headed to the rail with renewed enthusiasm as joseph weisenthal , the business insider writer and tweet machine known as thestalwart , put it , if you want to know the big bias in media \( of which i am guilty \) it s storyline bias the headlines reflected not disappointment , but excitement that the game was on slate was romney s debate win the most convincing in history \? it looks that way the los angeles times romney won debate and , more importantly , the media narrative the new york times romney erases obama s convention bounce in forecast msnbc romney sprinting into the lead reuters us presidential race now a dog fight as romney surges i sent emails to a few people involved in campaign coverage asking whether the charge of liberal bias was overstated tucker carlson , the founder of the daily caller said that liberal bias hasn t gone away , it s just been drowned out by a convincing romney victory in the debate the lesson is that the press doesn t control poll results it s possible to get elected even if the media are rooting for your opponent , as both reagan and george w bush proved it s also true that reporters get bored with the existing storyline , which until last week was that romney had already lost so they welcome a chance to talk about something else but none of this proves there s no bias i don t think any fair person who has watched carefully could claim romney and obama have been held to the same standard by the press they haven t reporter like , desire and concoct action , anything that makes them feel like they are in the middle of something large and elections brings out both the most craven and noble aspects of that imperative the nobler component reflects an understanding that picking the people in charge matters a great deal but it s often craven in execution because journalists will turn any crack in a campaign into a chasm and a slip in the numbers into a spiral it creates not only the illusion of movement , but of relevance matt labash , a writer for the weekly standard , explained as much i think what campaign journalists , conservative or liberal , always crave more than actual fairness , are twists then , each side gets its turn to whine about something which is fairness once removed , i suppose as for polls , these kinds of swings give journos an important opportunity to entertain themselves by analyzing what undecideds , who can t seem to make up their minds after two solid years of campaigning by both sides think at the precise moment of a fleeting news cycle that will likely become obsolete seconds after the clueless swing voter hangs up the phone with their pollster then of course , once swing voters read about how they ve changed their minds , they will only be further confused , thus providing a perfect and endless feedback loop of uncertainty and drama which will need to be further interpreted by the media , thus making us feel relevant , even as our industry is dying this election has made clear , as in hollywood , nobody knows anything but if the media is putting a thumb on the scale , its usually one that points toward anything more exciting than what they are already covering
it was friday before dusk and my husband had corralled our three children showered , in good clothes and on notice for good behavior to sing sabbath prayers i broke away for a moment and ran upstairs to my computer to check the status of a shiny treasure looted from the devil the saddam hussein palace christofle soup ladle malmaison starting price 100 the frenchmade silver serving piece had already racked up six bids its handle was stamped with saddam s eagle and baathist slogan the item , according to the ebay seller in alabama , had been found in the lost luggage of an american soldier , lifted perhaps during a 2003 palace raid , or sold to the soldier by an iraqi looter the auction would end in 32 minutes my family , though , had just begun a long evening of blessings and chicken soup i scanned the bid history , now up to 150 i placed a bid of 157 and ran downstairs come in peace , crown of god ! they were singing in hebrew as i dropped back onto the family room couch come with joy and cheerfulness ! baghdad was a cheerless , fearful place back in july 1990 , when i went there to visit my friend howard , an intern at the american embassy evidence of the regime s brutality had so undermined howard s sense of security that my 6foot5 friend was sleeping with his bedroom lights on it is he , our king , my kids were now mumbling their prayers , hungry delivered us from the grasp of all tyrants , avenged us i could n't concentrate was i winning \? i ran upstairs and saw the message from ebay you 've been outbid ! do n't let it get away i had expected to quietly buy the memento for 100 i had stumbled across it by accident , while looking for silverware a regular christofle ladle retails for 390 how much was dictator kitchenware worth \? i remembered my nights in baghdad , the shattered sleep , the shrieks of signal whistles every hour from the uniformed men in khaki caps biking around our neighborhood , spying for saddam saddam , the president who tortured opponents , who executed his sonsinlaw , who invaded kuwait , who rained missiles on tel aviv , who seized americans as human shields , who gassed kurdish children mommy ! my 7yearold called we need you i increased my bid to 175 and ran down my family was now gathered around the dinner table my husband began to chant from proverbs 31 , the weekly hymn exalting wives a good wife , who can find \? she is worth far more than rubies her husband trusts in her i checked my watch thirteen minutes left there was time to bless and kiss each kid quickly but when my 9yearold daughter proudly dragged out the kiddush over her goblet of trembling grape juice , i felt my eyebrows climb my forehead i 'll be back , i called , hurrying upstairs during the ritual washing of hands outbid ! i countered with 183 down the stairs , for my youngest son to thank god for challah bread then up again , palms sweating , too expensive this would count for my next four birthdays , i reasoned , typing 20750 i wondered who my competitors were , their names encrypted two of them dropped out it was down to me and the mysterious a i i pictured him a i as saddam s son , not the murderous uday or qusay , who both died in a gunfight in 2003 , but the rumored third son , living in hiding , hunched over , shades drawn in a swiss hotel , reclaiming his inheritance by clicking on ebay my own motives were less noble i wanted the spoon because it would bother saddam even dead , he would hate the idea of americans using it to scoop matzo balls he would be hanged , buried and irritated six seconds to go , a i and i went to war at 22250 , i won where were you \? my 11yearold son demanded when i came back to the table my cheeks felt red working on the soup no one mentioned that the kitchen was in the next room , not upstairs the box arrived from alabama a few days later , but by then i was battling buyer s remorse i thought the purchase would amuse my husband , but he recoiled uch , that s like eating off hitler s silver i googled saddam and christofle and discovered that , indeed , saddam chose the french pattern because it was a favorite of adolf hitler s when no one was looking , i picked it up and sniffed it the cupped lip smelled like dog saliva we immersed the piece in a pot of boiling water , a process that renders flatware kosher but every friday , at soup time , i left it in the drawer at first i blamed the menu carrot ginger soup felt all wrong the next week i blamed the company my mother was too cheery , too kansas city , to drink from the ladle of hate when i considered bringing it out to feed my children , what i 'd thought would be empowering turned out to be offputting what if saddam s black mustache had slurped that thing \? finally , one evening an israeli diplomat named dan came to dinner i did n't know him well , but after we cleared the firstcourse plates , i stammered um , would you like me to use this here ladle from saddam hussein s royal palace to , uh , serve your soup \? ok , sure just like that , dan dug into a steaming bowl of crushed moroccan lentils , while discussing his middle eastern neighbors iran s nuclear threat syria s political killings egypt s islamic resurgence dan licked his lips and smiled without a trace of complication i 'll have seconds i had none i reached for a glass of filtered water instead i wondered what i was thinking when i tangled with saddam i had started something i could n't satisfyingly finish i did n't have the stomach for it
huntingdon , tenn the carroll academy girls basketball team had just lost by 59 points to dresden high school , the top team in the conference still , tonya lutz , carroll academy s coach , lauded her team s effort randy hatch , carroll academy s daytoday director and founder of the basketball program , reached into a pocket and slipped 20 to one of the girls , as he usually does after games together , amid giggles , the nine girls on the team bounced to the snack stand in a singlefile line patrick steele , the school s straightfaced security director , followed them over the years , steele has overheard taunts , even racial slurs , directed at carroll academy students , boys and girls , from opposing fans he escorts the players wherever they go from the bus to the gym , to the locker rooms and bathrooms , and back to the bus the girls returned to the empty bleachers on the visitors' side of the gym , munching on candy and popcorn they settled in to watch the boys teams play , the second half of the usual girlsboys doubleheader it might be their favorite time of the day the pressures of their lives melt away amid gossip and sugar but first it was dresden s senior night one by one , every dresden senior winterseason athlete was introduced to an admiring crowd each carried a bouquet of flowers across the court , handed it to beaming parents and received hugs and kisses the carroll academy girls watched destiny broke the mood by pretending to cry miss tonya , can we have parents' night , too \? she asked with a mocking tone a couple of girls giggled we could do a senior night , hatch whispered i could get the sheriff to go round up all their parents that morning , sunlight peeked over the trees and mist loitered over the low spots of winter s dormant cotton fields the fleet of 10 white ford vans , driven by carroll academy teachers and staff members , pulled out of the parking lot they splintered across the countryside , through five counties of rural west tennessee this swath of empty landscape is sprinkled with decaying towns some carry incongruent names borrowed from europe paris , milan , dresden huntingdon , the carroll county seat , is centered by a stately courthouse in the middle of a picturesque square most of the manufacturing jobs that attracted past generations have dried up the his factory that made chic jeans and other apparel in nearby bruceton , employing 2 , 000 or more for decades , closed more than 10 years ago hatch s parents worked at a longgone shirt factory his mother as a seamstress , his father as a sewingmachine mechanic now , doubledigit unemployment feels normal tennessee s population grew more than 10 percent in the past decade , but it is stagnant in this area median household incomes linger in the 30 , 000 range about 15 percent of adults have a college degree drug use is rampant , across generations tennessee had more methamphetaminelab seizures in 2010 than any other state , according to the tennessee methamphetamine task force carroll county , with 18 seizures in a population of about 28 , 000 , had about twice as many per capita as the rest of the state prescriptiondrug abuse is particularly acute in tennessee the state perennially has among the highest number of prescriptions per capita in the country it has the sixthhighest percentage of youth , ages 12 to 17 , abusing prescription pain medications , according to the tennessee department of health it was across this quiet , complex setting that the carroll academy vans meandered they picked up students , some an hour away , and returned past the scrubby trailers along twolane roads and the tidy brick homes along high street , to the school s truckdock entrance the school is a singlestory wing of a former hospital the sign outside reads carroll academy home of the jaguars a statelicensed facility for grades 612 operated by the carroll county juvenile court most students stay at carroll academy for at least six months enrollment wavers from about 70 to 100 , depending on that week s court docket the vans drop off up to 14 students at a time in singlefile silence , they slip into a side entrance students are inspected in the school s hallway there is a dress code black pants and white , buttondown shirts boys and girls open their mouths to show there is nothing hidden there they pull their pants pockets insideout , lift their cuffs to show shoes and socks rules are strict no ballpoint pens , because drugs could be stashed inside no sagging pants , or else a humiliating belt will be fashioned with duct tape no piercings , jewelry , hats , makeup , cellphones , food short hair for boys , ponytails for girls twenty years ago , judge larry logan of carroll county juvenile court was frustrated that he had only two choices for disciplining teenagers he could put them on probation and hope that was enough to scare them and their parents straight or he could place them in state custody , which means or reform school i hate to send kids to reform school , logan said that kind of means i 've given up on them he helped develop a middle road carroll academy it was initially financed with a 145 million grant from tennessee s department of children s services , although its budget has since been carved to about half that about half of the students come through logan s courtroom in huntingdon the rest come from courts in adjoining counties about 80 percent are boys all report to probation officers the goal is to shepherd students through a hierarchy of levels , through good behavior and good grades , and back to their regular school , as the teenagers call it , in as little as six months carroll academy students fall into two fairly equalsize camps those enrolled because they were delinquent and those categorized as unruly the delinquent category includes crimes a recent snapshot showed that 15 students had taken drugs to school , an offense that gets them kicked out and often sent to carroll academy for a year seven students had committed assault , and six were there for vandalism the unruly category refers to transgressions specific to minors most involve truancy seven other students were cited for uncontrollable behavior at home three were runaways we 're not really bad kids , said leslee , a bright ninth grader who consumed a handful of her stepmother s xanax and took the rest to school , a tangled episode that landed her and five others at carroll academy we 're just good kids who made bad decisions hatch , a county probation officer , was chosen to oversee the school when it opened in 1994 he started basketball teams in 1998 a year later , carroll academy was admitted as the smallest member of the tennessee secondary school athletic association and joined a conference that includes the area public high schools there are always plenty of carroll academy boys to play , and the team wins a few games the girls are different there may be only 10 or 15 of them enrolled at any time unless they have a compelling reason a medical issue , for example the school assigns the girls to the basketball team middle school girls play , too , an exception made for carroll academy the idea is that structure , adult role models and a way to occupy their afterschool hours are good for them somewhat unwittingly , the players also become ambassadors to a world that usually sneers at troubled youth before carroll academy s first basketball game in 1998 , the father of an opposing player stepped out of the stands , grabbed hatch s arm and asked that the carroll academy girls not hurt his daughter sports were the best thing for us , hatch said for four years , people did n't know what we were doing here then we got sports , and people said , oh , they 're just like our kids' carroll academy the lady jaguars arrived at dresden and took the court for warmups in their uniforms and sweatsuits , they looked like any other team they did the threeman weave and layup drills the starters were introduced , to polite applause , and they shook hands with the dresden coaches , fistbumped the officials and highfived their teammates the lady jaguars trailed , 285 , after the first quarter they trailed by 4711 at the half not bad , lutz said during her halftime talk well , the score s awful the girls sat attentively with their hands up , palms out it s a rule lutz imposed for all timeouts and while in the locker room to remind the girls to keep their hands up on defense she explained a backdoor screen to run she told constance to stay in arm s reach of her opponent she told summer to get air under her feet when she shoots the final score was 7516 lutz seemed pleased destiny threw up into a garbage can ya 'll gave me effort , lutz said you did n't die on me you did n't quit at dresden high , summers are filled with basketball camps conditioning classes are yearround players take basketball as a regularly scheduled class every day , along with math , science and history it is a system designed for basketball success dresden used to take school buses to away games but so many parents trailed in their cars that dresden cut the expense the girls simply go with their moms and dads when it was time to leave , the carroll academy girls lined up none of their parents were there steele escorted them out

madrid until recently , the prado s copy of the mona lisa one of dozens made over the centuries was not much of a draw then , ana gonz lez mozo took an interest over the last two years , ms gonz lez , a researcher in the museum s technical documentation department , has used all manner of modernday techniques xrays , infrared reflectography and highresolution digital images , among others to make , and then document , an unlikely finding it turns out that the prado s mona lisa is not just any 500yearold copy it was most likely painted by someone who was sitting right next to , trying to duplicate his every brush stroke , as he produced his famous lady with the enigmatic smile when leonardo adjusted the size of the mona lisa s head or corrected her hands or slimmed her bosom or lowered her bodice , so did whoever was painting the prado s mona lisa it had to be painted at the same time , ms gonz lez said someone who copies does n't make corrections because they have n't ever seen the changes they can see only the surface of the painting the discovery is primarily important for what it reveals about the real mona lisa , a painting that has been darkened by layers of aging lacquer the copy , now restored , offers details that are obscured in the original mona lisa for instance , the copy shows an armrest where none can be seen in the original , and reflectographs show a much clearer image of her waistline what is really important about the copy is that we can see how leonardo worked , ms gonz lez said we know something new about his creative process the copy , which also shows a much youngerlooking figure , has once again ignited a debate about whether leonardo s mona lisa should be restored as well ms gonz lez says this is a hard call for the louvre because people are so used to the way the painting looks now but she cannot help being curious most of the time , ms gonz lez spends her hours looking beneath the surface of the prado s masterpieces , searching for insights into the artists' methods and thinking and there , she said , she has found great treasures many important paintings have sketches or first tries adjusted and reworked under the final image sometimes , she said , the work underneath is even more fascinating than the painting itself i get to see what only the artist saw , she said and he saw it five centuries ago on a recent visit , ms gonz lez s work space was as cool and tidy as any computer lab only a messy pool of lifesize images of the louvre s mona lisa and the prado s copy spread out on a table suggested her purpose she ran her hands over the photographs , pausing over the similarities they were clear even to the untrained eye what was she thinking when she made these discoveries \? was she in awe \? she shrugged off such questions other people have asked me that , she said , by way of an answer i am very calm , very prudent when i made the discovery , i talked to the curator here some art magazines have speculated that the prado s mona lisa was painted by leonardo s lover but ms gonz lez has no patience for such gossipy talk that is irrelevant , she said we do n't know that and that is not what the work here is about until two years ago , the prado , which inherited the painting with the rest of the royal collection in 1819 , displayed it but never suspected its significance it was catalogued without fanfare as an anonymous copy , painted on poplar the copy s background was black , and the painting was covered in a layer of dark varnish , which gave it a yellowish glow and further diminished its vibrancy but the louvre was planning a special exhibition of leonardo s work and , because it did not want to move the original mona lisa from its protected area , wanted to borrow the prado painting as a standin a casual comment by one of the louvre curators , asking whether the painting had ever been studied , got ms gonz lez thinking the next day she took her infrared camera into the gallery and got to work just the first pictures were enough for her to conclude that the two paintings had been produced in tandem after that , it was just a question of watching the evidence pile up perhaps the most exciting discovery was that the painting s original background had been obscured by a layer of black paint , a practice sometimes used in the 18th century luckily , a layer of lacquer protected what was under it so , once the paint was removed , the same tuscan background as in leonardo s painting appeared , offering a tantalizing preview of what might be seen if leonardo s mona lisa were restored there is no doubt , however , that the prado painting was not a copy made by leonardo himself while the corrections are identical , the lines are not like i write an a and you write an a , you can tell it is not the same , ms gonz lez said parts of the prado copy are beautiful , she said , like the hands but in general , it is not nearly so fine a painting just why it was made remains an open question it could have been simply for a pupil s instruction or a double commission ms gonz lez started working at the prado 16 years ago , when she was completing her doctorate , one of the first art researchers to focus on the use of computer techniques to study paintings we did not even have windows when i started as a student , she said but little by little , she said , computer techniques of all kinds have become important tools in studying paintings everyone in her family is a scientist , she said her choice to get a fine arts degree was a sort of rebellion when she begins studying a painting , she does a drawing of it , she said , as a way to familiarize herself with the work ms gonz lez seems somewhat indifferent to the attention her recent discovery is getting she said she had participated in far more spectacular discoveries for instance , she said , xrays and infrared reflectographs show that tintoretto sketched nude figures under his clothed ones but , somehow , it is the copy of the mona lisa that everyone is talking about it has grabbed people s imagination , she said she is an icon the prado s mona lisa is on loan to the louvre until june
for the dwindling few out there who still believe that big accusations require a little foundation and that truth as opposed to conjecture matters , here s an update as last week drew to a close , harry reid , the senate s democratic majority leader , had backed up his claim that mitt romney did n't pay taxes for a 10year period with absolutely nothing more than some vague reference to some unnamed guy who said something of the sort to reid during some phone conversation some time ago that s it that s all but for reid , it was enough not only to level his charge but also , as the days pressed on , to double and triple down on it , his language and manner growing more righteous even as his evidence grew no more detailed or persuasive the claim appeared first in with the huffington post that went online tuesday now , do i know that that s true \? reid said in the interview , which also included his mention of the phone call , supposedly from an investor in bain capital well , i'm not certain no biggie ! full steam ahead ! he proceeded to assert that romney s net worth is probably greater than published estimates of 250 million because , he explained , you do pretty well if you do n't pay taxes for 10 years and so a wild supposition was magically transformed into the from which yet another bit of speculation blossomed , and any concern with provable information was long gone , a casualty of the craven rules of political engagement these days it s beginning to seem as if everyone s at the prow of a swift boat , pants on fire and conscience on ice spew first and sweat the details later , or never speak loosely and carry a stickthin collection of backup materials , or none at all that s the mo of the moment , familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late it has spread beyond the practiced rabblerousers of the far right , and democrats are exuberantly getting in on this unbecoming , corrosive game for many years they bemoaned an unfair fight republicans were by and large willing to play faster , looser and flatout nastier than they were is there as much credibility to that lament today \? the democratic congressional campaign committee was forced last week to issue a public apology to the international casino magnate sheldon adelson , who is giving tens of millions to republicans this year , for having asserted on its web site that he was knowingly profiting from a chinese prostitution strategy at his casino in macau it has no proof of that its defenders will say that adelson is so brazenly exploiting lax campaignfinance regulations to hijack the political process that he must be discredited and neutralized by whatever means necessary details , schmetails and reid s defenders will say that romney s reluctance to release more than one complete year of tax returns \( at least so far \) makes clear that he s hiding something , which must be flushed out one way or another plus , to them , reid s claim has the feel of neartruth it passes muster as a metaphor if not as a matter of demonstrable fact it s a genuinely felt worry of sorts and valid as such but if you 're going to subscribe to that sort of reasoning , you might as well put a dead cocker spaniel on your head and start yelling about birth certificates , said jon stewart on the daily show , of the quizzically coiffed donald trump , who to my eyes was wearing either an irish setter or maybe a pomeranian stewart s point an excellent one is that the crazies who insist that president obama was n't born in the united states are reid s philosophical and strategic kinfolk do one tribe s antics justify the other s \? is this a road we really want to continue barreling down \? we 're already on it , thanks in part to a presidential contest in which each candidate s main pitch points everything in a negative direction the new shape of the newsmedia universe does n't help balkanized into microniches where partisans can have their passions stoked and prejudices reinforced , it gives reckless allegations many places to land and even stick before they get a sober look those allegations are intended and tailored to rally the troops , who are believed to care more about truculence than truthfulness the ends justify the reid after the senate leader made his accusation , the saloncom writer alex seitzwald about its theoretical plausibility and determined that it was nothing short of ludicrous meanwhile , the romney campaign and , later , denied the charge reid was unbowed inconsistent , too at one point from his home state of nevada that a number of people had whispered to him of romney s alleged tax evasion , while at a subsequent point he issued a statement citing only an extremely credible source , singular in neither instance did he hang any flesh on these bones i do n't think the burden should be on me , said reid , whose history of intemperate , borderline adolescent remarks was by michael d shear and richard a oppel jr the burden should be on him he s the one i 've alleged has not paid any taxes so if i just decide to allege that reid levied that accusation under detailed and persistent instructions from the obama campaign , the burden would be on him to provide all of his office s email and phone correspondence in order to contradict that \? reid took a wholly legitimate source of concern that romney owes voters more candor and transparency than he has been willing to furnish and undermined it by going too far and too farcical but then there s plenty of overreaching tragicomedy to go around sometimes i have to catch my breath and slow down because the rhetoric in this campaign is just over the top , observed john boehner , the republican speaker of the house , on the fox news radio show kilmeade and friends on thursday in regard to reid s casual slander of romney , boehner said , it s one of the problems that occurs here in washington people run out there without any facts and just make noise and in that very same interview , when boehner turned his attention to president obama and called him inept at creating jobs , he also said he s never even had a real job , for god s sake thus he made his own journey over the top , facts falling by the wayside , his pants getting toasty , the noise grinding on and on
there may have been no better way for newt gingrich to hammer back at the personal allegations from his exwife than to make the media the enemy for telling her story and that s just what he did in spades after cnn s john king opened the debate with a direct question about the abc news report on marianne gingrich s allegations , mr gingrich seized the opportunity i am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that , a visibly outraged and angry mr gingrich said raising the issue , is as as close to despicable as anything i can imagine the audience in the hall went wild , applauding madly and loudly mr king tried to deflect the blame by noting that it was abc , not cnn that ran the story mr gingrich was on a roll , and would have none of it john , it was repeated by your network you choose to start the debate with it don t blame someone else , he said , to even louder applause i am tired of the elite media protecting barack obama asked whether the story should be an issue , the other candidates tried to move the subject to other places john let s get on to the real issues , mr romney said that s all i ve got to say
the planet is warming and the arctic is warming the most , as long foreseen by scientists in a climate system pushed out of balance through the rapid buildup of heattrapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere one result is greater loss of arctic sea ice in the annual summer warmup today , the national snow and ice data center announced that the annual summer retreat of arctic ocean sea ice had reached a new low for the 33year satellite era of careful monitoring \( 158 million square miles , or 41 million square kilometers \) , and there is still another week or two of melting before the typical summer ice minimum occurs this quote in the release from walt meier of the ice center efficiently encapsulates the context by itself it s just a number , and occasionally records are going to get set but in the context of what s happened in the last several years and throughout the satellite record , it s an indication that the arctic sea ice cover is fundamentally changing the animated seaice imagery above from one of two autonomous cameras set on ice near the north pole each spring gives a closefocus view of the slushy conditions that develop on the shifting ice when the summer sun is at its peak \( this is part of the annual north pole environmental observatory project that i reported on in 2003 the cameras drift with the ice through the summer and are currently over the shoulder of greenland you can track their position here \) justin gillis has more on this development over on the news side of the times this excerpt echoes the thinking of quite a few ice researchers i ve interviewed over recent years it s hard even for people like me to believe , to see that climate change is actually doing what our worst fears dictated , said jennifer a francis , a rutgers university scientist who studies the effect of sea ice on weather patterns it s starting to give me chills , to tell you the truth still , there are many other veteran seaice scientists \( this is not false balance \) who note that the complexity of this system has consistently defied predictions in either direction \( see this year s sea ice outlook forecasts to get the range of forecasts \) there s plenty of yeartoyear , and even decadetodecade variability to complicate things , as both modeling and observations have shown and variations in the thickness and extent of sea ice cloaking the arctic ocean are driven by yet another set of complicating factors , ranging from longterm shifts in atmospheric pressure patterns to events as closefocus as the potent arctic superstorm i reported on earlier this month that s one reason that , even with today s announcement that the sea ice reached a new low extent for the satellite era , i wouldn t bet that the arctic is all but certain to be virtually ice free within two decades , as some have proposed i d say fifty fifty odds , at best see the update below including a seaice scientist s take on such wagers but i will bet that profound changes are well under way that virtually guarantee the arctic described in history books an icelocked and forbidding frontier for everyone except the inuit will not resemble the arctic of the second half of this century there will be problems and opportunities , as i and other times reporters chronicled in detail in our 2005 series the big melt and as i wrote in my book , the north pole was here  but is this a situation that is appropriately described as a death spiral \? not by my standards cecilia bitz of the university of washington , one of the authors of future abrupt reductions in the summer arctic sea ice , an important 2006 paper projecting ice trends in this century , sent this reaction \( edited very slightly for email shorthand \) it surprises me to say that the observed trend is still not as fast as the threshold we placed on an rapid ice loss events in our 2006 paper thus , even though models are thought to not lose ice fast enough , every one of the old ccsm3 runs had a rile \( rapid ice loss event \) at some point in the 21st century that beat the current streak none did so before 2012 though , and we know that the model trends speed up as the ice thins as far as bets go , i agree with you a 5050 chance it will take a few decades is about right the current rate of loss each year is about 02 million square km starting from 4 million square km , at this rate it would take 20 years models say it should accelerate , so decrease by a few years maybe the riles we found were due in part to ocean heat flux pulses on the atlantic side i don t think we can say if one has happened lately this year we can t claim a large unusal high pressure occurred like 2007 my best guess is that the ice just started out very thin in the spring the icebridge indicates this was true especially north of banks is , where the ice melted out first jennifer francis of rutgers university sent this additional thought after i sent a batch of ice researchers an email last night seeking broader context for this year s ice retreat the fact that the ice is so dramatically thinner now than it was only 20 years ago means that it is vulnerable to any abnormal weather event or fluctuation in ocean currents if the perfect storm of atmospheric and oceanic conditions that led to the 2007 record , or the patterns that reduced ice this summer , happened back in the thickice era , seaice loss would not be making headlines following this summer s new record ice loss , the arctic will enter a winter with even less ice than ever before , leading to even thinner ice , which barring any monumental external events like a major volcanic eruption , will likely perpetuate the trend in sea ice decline we are all trying to understand a system that has entered territory never seen before , and i think scientists are naturally cautious in their interpretations and predictions of what s to come models were formulated with understanding of the familiar system , which may explain why some model simulations lag observations in losing ice hajo eicken , an ice researcher at the university of alaska , fairbanks , sent this note on the importance of tracking regional conditions as well as the overall picture following up on jennifer s comments , and with my regional blinkers on , it s important to point to the expected increases in interannual variability in total ice extent , but also keep in mind that at the regional level , the thickness distribution of sea ice plays an important role in determining how a particular summer or even specific weather events like storms or stretches of calm sunny weather play out this has been obvious this year in the chukchi and east siberian seas where you had a stretch of thicker sea ice linger well into summer \( in fact , some of the ice remnants though rotten still show up in the satellite data from the region \) earlier this year , a number of research groups was able to coordinate thickness measurements \( airborne , surface based and associated deployment of buoys \) to help us better understand the ice thickness evolution in this sector of the arctic more detail is available on this here while the goal of this campaign was to improve seasonal ice prediction , the work also showed two important processes at work \( i \) older , thicker multiyear ice continues to flush out of the high canadian arctic and depending on winter surface circulation , some of this ice may reach very close to the coast in fact , this winter not just old sea ice but also some glacial ice fragments were spotted in northern alaska inshore waters this thicker multiyear ice takes longer to melt back \( both because of greater thickness and higher albedo than firstyear ice \) and so in conjunction with the weather it is responsible for more extensive ice in the late summer in this region at the same time , it represents a potential hazard to operations in the region , of which as you are aware there is quite a bit this year \( ii \) even subtle yeartoyear changes in the thickness of firstyear ice and its snow cover can play an important important role in determining interannual and seasonal variations in ice extent with an overall thinner ice cover this is what may have contributed in part to lingering ice in this region as a result of thicker firstyear ice \( due to a more severe winter and higher winter ice growth \) as well this is not to detract from the largescale picture discussed by jennifer and cecilia , but under conditions of an overall diminished ice cover , such remnants become very important from a marine ecosystems perspective \( eg , walrus hauling out on such ice \) while at the same time continuing to play a role as a hazard to marine operations j michael wallace of the university of washington , someone whose views i ve tracked closely for decades , had this sobering assessment \( i ve asked him to clarify what he means by irreversible given various papers \( eg , 1 , 2 , 3 \) cutting against that idea and will add an update when it comes \) i view the question of whether the minimum sea ice extent sets a new record this year as secondary the important news is that in five summers the sea ice concentration over the arctic has not recovered from its precipitous decline in 2007 this is one of the clearest examples of a regime shift in the recent historical record i think we still need to be open to the possibility that natural variability has played a role in the recent warming of the arctic , but with each year that goes by without a return to the pre2007 summertime arctic climatology it seems more likely that the remarkable change that we have witnessed will prove to be irreversible after reading my query about irreversible he sent a slightly adjusted version of this comment which you can read in the comment stream by clicking here  ignatius rigor , a climate and ice researcher at the university of washington \( who s been heard from here quite a lot in recent years \) , added this note \( in the group exchange with francis , eicken and others \) what really strikes me is how vulnerable the thinner ice pack is in 2007 we had a persistent high sitting over the canadian arctic , which contributed significantly to the export of sea ice out of the arctic this year , that deep low in august may have may have been the trigger in the past \( pre1990s \) this low would have just spread the ice pack out and increased sea ice extent , but with how thin the ice is , this just allows heat to melt the scattered ice from all sides and have a bigger impact on sea ice extent this afternoon , i asked marika holland , a climate and ice modeler at the national center for atmospheric research , to consider recent ice trends in light of her work with jennifer e kay and alexandra jahn on a paper finding likely periods of ice recovery on the way to an icefree arctic in summer this relates to differing views \( see comment discussions \) on the merits of the phrase arctic death spiral as i ve said , and told holland , that phrase would be fine with me if it were stressed that there will be loop the loops on the way down here s her note the work pointing to periods of recovery on the way to a largely icefree summer later in the century is still valid basically the message is that natural variability is large for sea ice when this reinforces the anthropogenic change , it can cause riles rapid ice loss events but it can also counter that change and cause brief periods of nearstability \( or even small increases on a decadal scale \) so , given the research , i think that looptheloops are to be expected this in no way means that the ice loss is not large , important , and likely to result in near icefree septembers later this century though ! i found a nice recent youtube presentation by holland on climate model projections of arctic ice loss that makes a nice closer here for now
moscow president replaced all but a handful of s cabinet of ministers on monday , in a longawaited step that nonetheless held out little chance the new government would push through major political or economic change news broadcasts emphasized how many new faces were being brought into the highest echelons of government , though most are career bureaucrats rather than independent political stars , and none serve as links to russia s growing opposition movement meanwhile , many of mr putin s key allies appear poised to preserve their clout igor i sechin is giving up the post of deputy prime minister , from which he has wielded tremendous power over russia s energy sector and led a clan of security and intelligence service veterans called siloviki nevertheless , mr sechin can carry out his essential tasks in particular , representing mr putin in negotiations with foreign oil companies to explore risky frontier territories just as easily from another position , said ilya balabanovsky , the chief energy analyst at renaissance capital in reality , what we see from the new government is exactly what we would have seen from the old government , he said his ability to negotiate deals was not really a product of his formal title tension over monday s announcement had built up after repeated delays , sparking speculation that kremlin power groupings were jockeying for significant posts mr putin deepened the suspense by saying that he was of the because he would be busy completing the new government a task that is technically a duty of the prime minister , dmitri a medvedev the appointments were viewed as a gauge of whether the government will remain an independent center of power , as it was when mr putin was prime minister , or return to the weak status it had in the past most analysts interviewed on monday guessed that it would return to a weak status this is not a new force that has arrived on the russian political scene , this is a rearrangement of personnel to preserve the power exercised by the various clans , said dmitri v trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center it is more clear than ever that much of the power will be transferred to the kremlin , and the government will be a tool of the allpowerful kremlin mr putin has not yet announced the staffing of his own apparatus in the kremlin , which is known as the presidential administration among the ministers who have been removed from their posts are some who had become lightning rods for criticism , like the interior minister , rashid nurgaliyev their dismissals answer a clear public demand , but fly in the face of mr putin s model of governing , which relies heavily on webs of relationships in a system like russia s , you do not rule in an institutional way , mr trenin said you rule through people you may appoint a person who rules exactly like nurgaliyev , but he has a different set of friends replacing mr nurgaliyev as interior minister is moscow s police chief , vladimir a kolokoltsev , whom analysts said mr putin had promoted as a reward for keeping order during the recent protests here and as a signal to the opposition that a strong show of dissent would not be tolerated foreign minister sergey v lavrov , defense minister anatoly e serdyukov and finance minister anton siluanov held on to their posts first deputy prime minister igor i shuvalov , a close putin ally , will remain in his post , having weathered a recent controversy about his wealth mr medvedev s chief of staff will be , the veteran political guru who helped mr putin centralize power in the kremlin , but recently began to advocate more open political competition the return of mr surkov , absent from the political arena for many months , strengthens mr medvedev s hand , experts said in the past , mr putin has not hesitated to remove prime ministers during political or economic crises that aroused a demand for change of course , surkov is a very competent political technologist , so he will keep his boss alive , said sergei a karaganov , a dean of the faculty of international relations at the higher school of economics in moscow the most surprising appointment is the minister of culture the post was sought by a crowded field of bureaucrats and cultural icons , but went to vladimir medinsky , the author of pop histories of the soviet union and an advocate of chestthumping patriotic education in schools as the news of the appointment sank in , marat guelman , a gallery owner , mused to the ekho moskvy radio station that the ministry of culture could turn into a ministry of propaganda experts have long said that the next few years may force russia s government to adopt unpopular measures like tax or pension reform , as the country weathers global economic shocks and adjusts to a lower rate of economic growth i want to wish you success in the difficult situation in which the world economy finds itself , in a situation of uncertainty with many unknown factors , mr putin told the cabinet on monday among the first to comment publicly on the cabinet was aleksei l kudrin , a former finance minister who last fall after he told reporters he would not serve in the new government if mr medvedev led it it is not a breakthrough government , mr kudrin told the interfax news service i have serious doubts that it will be able to cope with all the challenges that face russia today
washington after spending millions of dollars testing four different scanning devices that would allow airline passengers to keep their shoes on at security checkpoints , the government has decided for now that travelers must continue to remove their footwear , by far the leading source of frustration and delays at the airport the said it had rejected all four devices because they failed to adequately detect explosives and metal weapons during tests at various airports one of the scanners is now used in airports in 18 countries last september , secretary janet napolitano of the raised hopes when she said that research and development on scanning machines was progressing and that air travelers would eventually be able to keep their shoes on but nearly a year later , the tsa , which is overseen by homeland security , said it was not any closer to finding a solution lisa farbstein , a spokeswoman for the agency , would not address why it had rejected the devices but over all , the machines we tested did n't detect all the materials we were looking for , she said over the years , the government has tried to streamline and cut down on long lines and complaints elderly passengers and children may go through security screenings without taking off any clothing and a prescreening program at 20 airports allows approved passengers to keep on their shoes , belt or jackets and does not require laptops and toiletries to be removed from carryon baggage the growing use of fullbody scanners also allows travelers to go through security lines faster , the government said but no part of airport security has drawn more criticism from passengers than removing their shoes , according to the , a trade group in washington passengers say they hate taking off their shoes more than patdowns and full body scans , the association said it s had enough of an impact that it has pushed people toward other forms of transportation , said robert bobo , a spokesman for the association tsa officials acknowledge the shoe headaches and say the procedure contributes to longer lines at the checkpoints the removal of footwear takes time , reduces the efficiency of the checkpoint , creates safety concerns with footwear removal and contributes to passenger dissatisfaction , the agency said in a blog post last year shoes were ordered off after richard c reid on a flight from paris to miami in 2001 since then , the government says it has found a host of dangerous items in passengers' footwear and says it will not reconsider the requirement until it is satisfied with a scanning technology in 2007 , the agency tested a general electric shoe scanner at orlando international airport the next year , it tested two scanning machines made by l3 communications at los angeles international airport but none of them passed agency muster it also tested a device called , which is intended to detect metal and is made by ido security , an israeli firm , that deploys the scanner in hundreds of airports and ships around the world , including in china , italy and israel michael goldberg , the company s president , said the machine can detect explosives containing metal , but not plastic explosives mr goldberg said the machine performed flawlessly in tests with the tsa but the agency did not think so he said no current technology can detect all of the various chemical compounds used as explosives current xray machines used to scan shoes can detect metal but are not much help in finding liquids or gels that can be used as explosives the government has a , a subsidiary of the french defense giant safran , to develop a shoescanning machine morpho s scanner can detect chemical compounds and metal objects , said brad buswell , the president of morpho and a former homeland security official our device can detect items to see if there is an explosive in a shoe or simply a pair of dr scholl s inserts , mr buswell said he said the company will be testing a prototype with the tsa this year many security experts say the security agency is too focused on technologies for intercepting things guns , knives , explosives instead of focusing on stopping people rafi ron , the former chief of security for israel s ben gurion airport , said the agency should abandon its shoeremoval policy they need a more passengerbased approach instead of looking for items , mr ron said the israeli model is based on interviews and profiles of passengers screeners quickly try to decide whether a passenger poses a threat based on reactions to a set of questions critics said the israeli approach would be unworkable in the united states and cause longer lines some 803 million passengers passed through airports last year in the united states israel , by contrast , screened

hampstead , nh for al sandler , an independent voter here , jon m huntsman jr s performance in sunday s presidential debate was the clincher when mr huntsman said that mitt romney was wrong to criticize him for being president obama s ambassador to china , adding , the nation is divided because of attitudes like that , it was music to mr sandler s ears i think it s an asset that he worked for the obama administration because that s what we need to do we need to bridge the gap between the republicans and the democrats , mr sandler said after hearing mr huntsman speak at a packed coffee shop here on sunday afternoon you need a leader that s going to bring both sides together mr huntsman , the former governor of utah , is counting on a surge of support from latebreaking voters like mr sandler who said he had been wavering between mr huntsman and mr romney until sunday to exceed expectations in the republican primary on tuesday and while he has claimed to feel that surge for days , if not weeks , the energy around mr huntsman s campaign did feel strikingly stronger on sunday at the beantowne coffee house here , he was thronged by supporters and undecided voters who were curious about his candidacy half the crowd had to stand outside the latest suffolk university tracking poll , out sunday , put mr huntsman in third place , with 11 percent of the vote mr romney got 35 percent in the poll of 500 likely republican primary voters in the state ron paul got 20 percent , newt gingrich 9 percent and rick santorum 8 percent the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points bob salter , a registered republican from sandown who came to hear mr huntsman at the coffee shop , said he had just started paying attention to the race and was leaning toward mr huntsman because he did not act like a politician i like the fact that he s the only one who actually answers the questions in the debates , said mr salter , who voted for mike huckabee in the 2008 primary i just have gut feelings sometimes , and he strikes me as a good person he doesn t so much seem to be a politician as a person who cares mr salter said he realized that mr huntsman s chances were long , but that it was up to people like him to change that you just have to make a stand and vote for who you like , he said , and hopefully it snowballs and keeps going others at the hampstead event said they did not think mr huntsman had a shot at winning this year s primary or even placing second or third but several said they hoped he would draw enough support to be a strong candidate in 2016 if he could beat obama , i d vote for him in a minute , said paul demore , an independent voter from sandown but he needs to get his name out there some more after mr huntsman spoke at the coffee shop , mr sandler asked him for help he needed to better understand the difference between mr huntsman and mr romney , he said mr huntsman answered in a word trust that , combined with mr huntsman s performance in the backtoback debates this weekend , was enough to seal the deal for mr sandler romney needs a solid challenger , and i think the rest are a bunch of buffoons , said mr sandler , who voted for senator john mccain of arizona in the state s 2008 primary mccain came here and impressed the hell out of me by being a real individual , a real person , and i feel the same thing about this gentleman he s a real person asked by reporters outside the coffee shop if he was going to win the primary , mr huntsman did not hesitate you know , it s sure feeling like it , he said i feel the energy on the street we re moving in a direction that nobody would have predicted even a few short days ago gail witham , a supporter who introduced him at the event , made an even bolder prediction that mr huntsman would draw 37 percent of the vote , compared with 25 percent for mr romney and eh , somewhere for the others there s been a lot of pandering , there ve been a lot of promises , there s been a lot of lying , there s been a lot of nasty stuff , she said none of that came from the huntsman campaign mr huntsman was to attend a house party in bedford and a townhall event in keene on sunday evening
elliott key , fla like many florida schemes , the city of islandia sprang from the delusions of land developers who imagined a rollicking resort town on an inaccessible speck of coral rock north of key largo in the end , their dreams were just another florida hustle , one the authorities are finally poised to shut down next month , more than 50 years after islandia s incorporation , the miamidade board of county commissioners is expected to take a vote to abolish its tiniest city a chain of 33 islands , reachable only by boat , with elliott key as its centerpiece islandia \( population 5 \) will not be missed , in large part because islandia \( pronounced eyelandeeyah \) never existed it was always more a developers' mirage than a spot on the map islandia has no school , no sewers , no courthouse , no shops and no road leading in or out in fact , most of it sits on national park land it once had a municipal government but that too was a ruse , a function of voter shenanigans that went unnoticed by the county for nearly 30 years since 1961 , none of the voters who chose islandia s succession of mayors and city council members actually lived on the chain of islands , a violation of state law only property owners voted , and for simplicity s sake , they elected themselves \( conveniently , city hall meetings were held inside real estate offices in the miami area \) the aspirations of islandia s city officials began to unravel in 1989 that s when the town s newly elected , but wholly unauthorized , police chief fashioned his own uniform and walked into park headquarters with a sidearm in his holster it was an unorthodox bid at legitimacy alarmed , the park rangers telephoned law enforcement and the miamidade state attorney s office , and that led to a finding that islandia s government had long been illegal the city shuffled toward its demise gradually and now suddenly for years , the state had asked the county to do away with the city , which had become a bureaucratic annoyance it was not until recently , though , that the county had a way of abolishing a city they do n't operate like a city , said commissioner dennis c moss , whose district includes islandia they do n't have any elected officials it s not a city but it has quite a colorful history , he added once a hideout for pirates , the 33 northernmost islands are now one of the florida keys' last unspoiled pockets , bypassed in the early 1900s by henry flagler s overseas railroad to key west and the overseas highway it was most endangered in 1960 when deeppocketed developers and quixotic conservationists , known as bird watchers at the time , fought one of south florida s most formidable battles over the land to everyone s surprise , the bird watchers won decades later , the ocean waters , translucent and shallow , remain a playground for lobster , fish , sharks and coral mahogany , buttonwood , gumbolimbo and mangrove trees abound boaters drop anchor to swim offshore and to fish \( and kick back cocktails \) children stay on elliott key for overnight camping trips you can get the hell out there and restore the soul , said lloyd miller , 91 , who lives not too far away in homestead and helped lead the fight to preserve the pristine archipelago you just go out there and sit in a boat and listen to the quiet it s good for the soul so few places you can do that anymore back in 1960 , the conservationists sought to protect the islands from the proposed construction of a nearby oil refinery and seaport and also from grand plans to blanket tiny , sevenmile elliott key in luxury hotels , shopping centers and beachfront homes thirteen of the islands' 18 registered voters , all of them landowners who wanted development , cast ballots \( in a ballot box ferried by boat \) to incorporate islandia , as they called it incorporation , they figured , was a sure way to skirt state and federal zoning rules and to secure a causeway that would cross the bay from the mainland luther l brooks , a politically connected former bootlegger who once described a politician as so crooked he ca n't wear his shoes , became islandia s first mayor no sooner was he elected than he began to call in favors from politicians to help develop the island his day job was collecting rent from half of miami s black population , living in segregated housing by 1963 , the landowners had persuaded the florida governor to spearhead construction of the causeway development seemed inevitable one day for sure there will be a causeway to islandia , a miami herald editorial predicted but conservationists , including juanita greene , a herald reporter \( and girlfriend of mr brooks \) pulled together their own savvy team mr miller contacted stewart udall , the secretary of the interior , a staunch environmentalist he sent aides to look at elliott key , and decided it was worth saving representative dante b fascell , the late democratic congressman , was persuaded to join the effort , and began to push for a law to turn the island and its underwater acres into a federal park then hoover arrived , said mr miller , of herbert hoover jr , the head of the vacuum cleaner company , and so did his money mr hoover had fallen in love with biscayne bay as a child , when lobster and shrimp coated the ocean floor he wanted the chain declared a national monument and underwrote the campaign nothing could slow the movement to conserve the islands , not even an announcement made in 1967 by albert c bostwick jr , an heir to the standard oil company fortune his plan to build a splashy marina with cottages , villas and dock spaces on elliott key never got off the ground in 1968 , islandia officials made one final incursion they brought bulldozers by barge to elliott key and ordered workers to cut a 125footwide strip across the island it was a makeshift road meant to scar the island enough to sour the federal government spite highway , it was dubbed , and its remnants remain today several months later , in october 1968 , president lyndon b johnson signed the bill to turn much of islandia into a national monument it later became biscayne national park today , 2 of the 33 islands remain in private hands of islandia s five residents , three are park employees , one is married to a park worker and one is a private resident deb johnson ,

a cynic might say that tonight s republican contests in minnesota , colorado and missouri deserve an asterisk in minnesota and colorado , which will hold caucuses , voters will pick their preferred presidential candidate in a nonbinding straw poll , while picking delegates to county and regional conventions in a separate vote in missouri , no delegates are on the line at all the state will hold a separate caucus for that purpose on march 17 the results , nevertheless , will provide an important test of how robust mitt romney s coalition is on less favorable terrain than in states like new hampshire or nevada and they could potentially revitalize the campaign of one of mr romney s opponents , rick santorum nor should one go too far in dismissing the results the process that minnesota and colorado use , holding separate votes for presidential preference and delegate selection at their caucuses , is essentially the same one that was used in iowa missouri is a more debatable case , but as the first primary of any kind held in the midwest perhaps mr romney s weakest region it may tell us something about how states like michigan and ohio are likely to vote when they hold key primaries on feb 28 and march 6 , respectively polling and demographic evidence suggests that mr santorum is the favorite in missouri , while mr romney is favored in colorado minnesota could be the closest contest , but probably leans slightly toward mr santorum the polls we haven t run forecasts in any of the states the fivethirtyeight forecast model was trained on past cases in which at least three different pollsters were active in a state in the closing days of the election we cheated slightly to run a forecast for nevada , where two firms issued polls , but with just one pollster testing matchups in each of tonight s states , my view is that we re better off looking at the polls and the other evidence in a more holistic way the polling firm active in each state is public policy polling , which released a set of survey results on tuesday morning their polls give mr santorum a 13point lead in missouri and a 9point lead in minnesota , while mr romney has a 10point lead in colorado although public policy polling has had good results in elections so far , leads of this magnitude about 10 points are not especially safe , especially with just one poll in the field , and especially in the caucus states however , a demographic analysis of the states tends to give credibility to public policy polling s results demographics harry j enten , writing for the guardian , has found a strong correlation between the number of evangelical voters in the state and the share of mr romney s vote that could be problematic for mr romney in missouri and minnesota , where the share of evangelicals should be relatively high correlation is not necessarily causation , and conclusions based on just five data points can sometimes prove to be specious in this case , however , there is evidence that the religious orientation of voters has a direct rather than incidental relationship with the outcome of the vote according to exit polling in the first five states , mr romney has won an average of 30 percent of the vote among voters who describe themselves as bornagain or evangelical christians , versus 45 percent among those who do not conversely , mr santorum has won 22 percent of the vote among evangelicals , versus just 9 percent among other voters another strong relationship so far is that mr romney has performed well among wealthier voters , while having mixed results among voters with lower incomes we can estimate the income status of each state by looking at the share of john mccain voters whose households made 50 , 000 or less in 2008 , according to that year s exit polls missouri , by this measure , is the most workingclass state to vote so far in 2008 , 39 percent of mr mccain s voters made 50 , 000 or less , well above mr mccain s national average of 32 percent colorado , conversely , is a wealthy state just 23 percent of mr mccain s voters made less than the 50 , 000 threshold in 2008 minnesota is something of a mixed bag although the state has aboveaverage incomes overall , that is not necessarily true among republican voters about onethird of mr mccain s voters made less than 50 , 000 in 2008 , close to the national average google search traffic another thing worth looking at is google search traffic , which gives evidence about the level of interest in each candidate in each state this would have told you something about the vote in past states in nevada , for instance , where mr romney and ron paul performed more strongly than their national polls , their search traffic had been strong , whereas it had been relatively weak for newt gingrich and mr santorum in the chart below , i ve looked at the number of google searches on each candidate s full name in each state over the past week , and then compared it to a baseline , which is calculated by taking the median amount of search traffic for a candidate in the 10 largest states the candidate who does the best by this measure is mr santorum in each of the three states voting tonight , his name is generating about twice as much search traffic as it does in the baseline states that suggests that voters are taking a serious look at mr santorum in these states , and that the fact that he is well behind mr romney in national polls is not of that much significance mr gingrich does poorly by this measure he s getting essentially no more search traffic in colorado , minnesota and missouri than he is in inactive states like california or north carolina mr romney and mr paul are somewhere in between , getting aboveaverage traffic in colorado and minnesota but not in missouri , where mr santorum s numbers are much more impressive and where mr gingrich is not on the ballot even though we re not officially issuing forecasts for these states , we can apply the same technique that we have in the past and consider stronger and weaker scenarios for each candidate mitt romney strong scenario he wins all three states , although missouri is very close most likely scenario he wins colorado by a clear margin and loses missouri by about 10 points minnesota is very close but he loses there once all votes are counted weak scenario he takes a very narrow loss in colorado in addition to minnesota and missouri the equation here is pretty simple the more states that mr romney loses , the more evidence we will have that his position is vulnerable and that the race could go on for some time colorado , however , is unlikely to be a loss for mr romney although his 10point lead in the public policy polling survey is not all that strong , the demographics look reasonably good for him , especially since perhaps about 10 percent of the voters there will be mormon , making up for deficiencies among other groups the flipside is that if mr romney were to lose colorado , it would suggest deep problems for his campaign at the other end of the spectrum , if mr romney were to sweep all three states , a strong case could be made that he has the nomination essentially wrapped up so he has a fair amount on the line tonight rick santorum strong scenario he wins all three states , although colorado is very close most likely scenario he wins missouri by a clear margin and minnesota narrowly and loses colorado by a clear margin weak scenario he gets shut out if mr romney were to endure some losses tonight , he would probably prefer that these came at the expense of two or more candidates , leaving the rest of the field somewhat disorganized mr santorum , however , appears to be the favorite in both missouri and minnesota and probably has the best upset chances in colorado mr santorum has drawn closer to mr gingrich in national polls , and a strong night tonight might be enough to propel him into second place , even though the contests are receiving tepid interest from the news media if mr santorum performs well , it will be important to see whether influential republicans get behind his candidacy or instead start to attack him on the one hand , mr santorum is almost certainly preferred by republican elites to mr gingrich on the other hand , he is probably a more serious threat to mr romney than mr gingrich was , so if republicans are determined to have mr romney as their nominee , their praise of mr santorum could be faint newt gingrich strong scenario he gets a surprise win in minnesota most likely scenario he finishes in third in both caucus states \( mr gingrich is not on the ballot in missouri \) weak scenario he finishes dead last in either minnesota or colorado , while mr santorum has a strong evening unless he pulls off a big upset in minnesota , it is hard to see what good comes for mr gingrich out of this evening if mr romney has a strong night , he will be well on his way to the nomination if mr santorum does instead , he has a good chance of emerging as mr romney s major rival only a split decision and one in which mr gingrich beats expectations by overperforming his polling would leave his condition improved going forward an especially weak showing , after disappointing results in florida and nevada , would have his campaign on the ropes ron paul strong scenario he gets a surprise win in minnesota and finishes ahead of mr gingrich in colorado most likely scenario he is not too far out of the running in minnesota but is well behind in colorado and missouri weak scenario he finishes out of the running and worse than his polling in both colorado and minnesota , calling into question whether he has an advantage in the caucus states at all nevada was an odd state for mr paul he beat his polling there and got a respectable 19 percent of the vote but the caucus states are supposed to be a strength of his , and he will need to do better than that to secure enough delegates to have a real influence upon the republican race mr paul s supporters sometimes blame the news media for its lack of attention to their candidate and they make a reasonable case , in my view but that case will be weakened if he cannot perform well in states like colorado or minnesota , where none of the candidates have received much news media attention , few ads have been running and a candidate with enthusiastic supporters and a strong ground game should have the potential to do well
london lawyers for a muslim cleric wanted in the united states on terrorism charges said on tuesday that the preacher , , was physically unfit to face the accusations against him and that it would be oppressive to extradite him under the terms of british law mr masri , 54 , has been resisting extradition since 2004 american prosecutors want him to face charges of calling for holy war in , involvement in kidnappings in and participating in a plot to set up a terrorism training camp in bly , ore mr masri , who was born in egypt and was notorious for fiery sermons at the finsbury park mosque in north london , has been in prison in britain since 2006 on separate charges , including incitement to murder over the years , he has successfully avoided extradition through a series of legal hearings but , last week , the european court of human rights rejected a request for the right to appeal a decision that british officials took as the final word permitting his extradition in court filings on tuesday before a scheduled high court hearing , mr masri s counsel , alun jones , said he would seek an interim injunction arguing that there is an uncontradicted medical opinion that a scan is medically necessary in light of the cleric s deteriorating health if medical tests find him unfit to plead , or arguably so , it will be argued that it would be oppressive to extradite within the meaning of britain s extradition laws , mr jones said according to the press association news agency the law is very clear , mr jones said if a person is established to be unfit to plead , he should not be extradited but if there is an issue concerning fitness to plead , he should indeed be extradited mr jones said a judge had referred in 2008 to mr masri s very poor health over four years later , it appears there has been , or may have been , a further deterioration , perhaps attributable to sleep deprivation and the continued confinement of the appellant in an unrelentingly harsh environment , the lawyer said mr masri , hookhanded and oneeyed from injuries many years ago , is one of five men wanted in the united states on charges ranging from murder to running a jihadist web site all five are seeking high court injunctions to prevent their extradition , but none of them was expected to appear in court their cases will be heard by two judges over the next few days the four other suspects are seyla talha ahsan , adel abdul bary , khaled alfawwaz and babar ahmad mr bary and mr alfawwaz were charged with multiple murders in the 1998 bombings of the american embassies in dar es salaam , tanzania , and nairobi , kenya , which killed more than 200 people mr ahsan , like mr ahmad , is charged with providing support to terrorists and conspiracyrelated offenses british civil liberties activists have complained about the treatment in particular of mr ahmad , 37 , a computer expert accused of being a fundraiser for terrorist causes he has been held without charge or trial for eight years in an unusual interview earlier this year , mr ahmad declared 'i have been in prison now for nearly eight years without trial i am facing extradition to the us to spend the rest of my life in solitary confinement i have never been questioned about the allegations against me i have never been shown the evidence against me last april , the european court of human rights ruled that britain could legally extradite all five men they asked for the right of appeal but that request was denied last week , triggering the latest moves at the high court
point clear , ala the battle of shiloh began at sunrise on april 6 , 1862 the sabbath as 44 , 000 confederate soldiers swooped down on an unsuspecting union army encampment near pittsburg landing , a nondescript hogandcotton steamboat dock on the tennessee river what followed were two of the bloodiest days of the civil war , leaving nearly 24 , 000 men on both sides dead , dying or wounded when it was over the nation two nations , as it were , for the moment convulsed , horrified worse than the grisly statistics , americans north and south were confronted with the sobering fact that shiloh had n't been the decisive battletoendallbattles there was no crushing victory only unimaginable death more , and perhaps many more , such confrontations were clearly in store the civil war officially started with the shelling of fort sumter , but in many significant ways , it truly began with shiloh union forces had been making their way down the mississippi valley for months , and a great battle to decide control of the region and perhaps the war itself had indeed been anticipated the fate of the armies was sealed in midmarch when grant s 40 , 000 men began debarking at pittsburg landing , a mere 22 miles northeast of corinth , miss , where the renowned confederate general albert sidney johnston had gathered 44 , 000 rebel soldiers at johnston s side was the dashing and magnificently named creole general pierre gustave toutant beauregard , recently celebrated as the hero of bull run noted as a master of strategy and tactics , beauregard urged an immediate attack against grant , who was awaiting the arrival of a second union element marching from nashville under gen don carlos buell johnston told the creole to draw up the attack order for april 5 confusion and disarray reigned from the outset first came an appalling mixup in the muddy streets of corinth , where the 9 , 000man corps of the confederate gen leonidas polk was encamped with all its wagons , animals and baggage polk idiotically refused to march without a written order , and it proved impossible for the other corps to move around him at long last polk shoved off , but the delay had cost the confederates precious time a mighty rainstorm then doused the countryside in floods that washed out roads men became lost during the night , and by dawn they were so hopelessly entangled that the attack was postponed until april 6 , a perhaps fatal error meanwhile grant s army languished at pittsburg landing , supremely ignorant of the menace slowly lurching toward it the yankee soldiers had not been told to fortify their positions in fact , were ordered not to which left them camping in the open like boy scouts , despite mounting reports from the most forward camps of a strong enemy presence on the cool , bright morning of april 6 , when the reports could no longer be ignored , gen william tecumseh sherman mounted his horse and rode forward just as the main confederate battle line emerged from a hedge of trees as he reached for his field glasses a bullet struck his orderly in the head the man toppled from his horse , dead sherman himself was hit in the hand and dashed off , shouting , my god , we are attacked ! the rebel army had come together at last it presented a stirring and dismaying sight , as regiment after regiment , dressed in confederate gray or butternut brown , advanced in three successive waves , each two miles wide banners waving , officers on horseback shouting orders , they marched in perfect lines sunlight glinted off their bayonets , and their bands played dixie , but above it all the bonechilling rebel yell rose from tens of thousands of throats union officers tried frantically to put their units into fighting order men , some of whom had received their weapons only days before , were hastily shoved into a line of battle artillery batteries that had never fired a round were raced to the front , where they began blasting into the surging enemy among the first casualties was the 31yearold col everett peabody , a harvardeducated engineer commanding a missouri volunteer regiment he was struck by four bullets during the first few hours of fighting , but held out to buy time for the yankee divisions in his rear before a fifth slug pierced his skull all morning the confederates drove the blue coats northward in a carnival of slaughter that left the mutilated bodies of both sides strewn in heaps an estimated 10 , 000 of grant s troops fled the fighting and hid under the bluffs by the river , while a number of rebel regiments were banished to the rear for timidity in battle johnston was exceedingly pleased with the assault when word came from one of his commanders that a tennessee brigade was refusing to fight , he rode to the scene and took charge , successfully capturing a union strongpoint returning from his charge about 2 30 pm , johnston suddenly reeled in his saddle when lowered from his horse it was discovered that a bullet had severed an artery behind his knee within a few minutes he bled to death in his boot beauregard took command , and as the afternoon wore on , the confederates pressed nearer to pittsburg landing , the last union stronghold
in barely a century s time , the population of the united states has more than tripled , to 313 million we are a clattering , opinionated cluster of nearly all the world s races and religions , and many of its languages , under one flag you would not know any of this looking at who is voting in one of the strangest presidential primary campaigns in history there is no other way to put this without resorting to demographic bluntness the small fraction of americans who are trying to pick the republican nominee are old , white , uniformly christian and unrepresentative of the nation at large none of that is a surprise but when you look at the numbers , it s stunning how little this republican primary electorate resembles the rest of the united states they are much closer to the population of 1890 than of 2012 given the level of media attention , we know an election of great significance is happening on the republican side but it s occurring in a different place , guided by talkradio extremists and religious zealots , with only a vague resemblance to the states where it has taken place from this small world have emerged a host of nutty , retrograde positions , unpopular with the vast american majority but before getting into how this minority has steered the party into a corner , let s look at the size of the electorate the nine states that have held caucuses or primaries to date are home to roughly 28 million total registered voters , of all political persuasions so far , three million voters have participated in the republican races , less than the population of connecticut this means that 89 percent of all registered voters in those states have not participated in what is , from a horserace perspective , a very tight contest yes , we know republicans don t like their choices it s a meh primary but still , in some states , this election could be happening in a ghost town less than 1 percent of registered voters turned out for maine s caucus in nevada , where republican turnout was down 25 percent from 2008 , only 3 percent of total registered voters participated this is not majority rule by any measure it barely qualifies as participatory democracy results from the two populous states that have held big , mediasaturated primaries , and are more likely to attract average voters , are also very revealing in florida , the largest and most diverse state among the nine , turnout was down 14 percent from 2008 and 84 percent of the state s total registered voters did not participate in the republican contest south carolina is the major outlier this year , the only state to show a big increase in turnout , up 35 percent from 2008 but when you look at who voted , you see a very specific niche in the palmetto state , 98 percent of primary voters were white , 72 percent were age 45 or older and nearly twothirds were evangelical christian , according to exit polls from this picture , you may think south carolina is an allwhite , aging state , full of fervent churchgoers but the census says the state is only 66 percent white , with a median age of 36 exit polls from 2008 put the evangelical vote at 40 percent of total florida was at least closer only in the latino vote to the general election of 2008 in both cases , it was about 14 percent of the total but voters 45 or older made up 78 percent of the primary , versus 59 percent in the general matchup four years ago outside of florida , this contest has been nearly an allwhite affair nevada is 26 percent latino by population in the primary , only 5 percent were latino caucus voters in iowa were 99 percent white again , these numbers represent a small echo chamber whites are 637 percent of the total population of the united states in 1900 , they were 88 percent still more diverse than republican primary voters today the takeaway point of this poorly attended , unrepresentative republican primary contest is not to focus entirely on who is voting but on why the candidates are taking such fringe positions one explains the other thus , the new york times poll of this week found that all voters , by a 66 to 26 ratio , support the federal requirement that private health care plans cover the full cost of birth control for female patients among women , support is 7220 and with catholics , it s 6725 yes , catholics are slightly more liberal than the population at large other polls show a huge majority of americans want to raise taxes on the rich , favor the planned withdrawal from afghanistan and believe the earth is warming because of human action yet the republican frontrunner of the moment , rick santorum , is with the minority on each of these issues , and mitt romney is a near match so , given how out of sync these two candidate are with the rest of the country , how could they be the frontrunners \? it s simple look at who is voting , a nation unto itself
as you no doubt read or heard , jeb bush made news earlier this week , saying that neither his father nor ronald reagan would have found a comfortable place in the republican party of today this is hardly a revelatory observation but it s an essential one , presented in this case by a member of one of the party s ruling clans \( at least once upon a time \) , as my colleague jim rutenberg noted in his terrific news article about bush s comments jim and i were among some two dozen journalists at a monday morning breakfast where bush took questions and said more or less that republicans were too intransigent on tax increases and too harsh on immigration i wrote a column for tuesday s newspaper that pivoted off of something else he said , about a country in decline and after the breakfast , several of the journalists in attendance issued the same lament if only he had run for the republican nomination ! it would have been so refreshing ! there would have been a voice of moderation in the mix ! but would there have been \? the problem with that lament is that it overlooks a corollary \( or anagram \) of the very point bush was making given the current dynamics of the republican party in general and its primary process in particular , he would probably have been compelled to sing a different tune on the campaign trail than he did at the breakfast , or he would have had to content himself with the excellent possibility of an early exit from the race there s a reason none of the actual candidates talked quite the way he did at monday s breakfast they sensed correctly , one has to assume that it simply wouldn t fly in fact bush s comments at the breakfast were for me the final confirmation that he wasn t in the vice presidential hunt he himself had previously said as much , and it also didn t make sense that a man who had reportedly wanted to avoid the invasiveness and turmoil of a presidential campaign would then opt for an approximation of precisely that in the number 2 instead of the number 1 slot if you re going to get slapped around , you might as well do it for the big enchilada , not the little tortilla chip jeb bush said what he did at the breakfast because he was free to because he wasn t running for anything , and hadn t in a while because he was liberated and as he noted at the breakfast , office holders in these bitterly partisan times are more hostage than at many moments in the past to the orthodoxies of their respective parties right now i d say republicans are more hostage than democrats , and perhaps the most vivid illustration of that is the one most often cited that seminal debate in ames , iowa , just before the state s straw poll , when the thenpopulous field of contenders were asked if they d accept a budget deal with 10 of spending reductions for every 1 of tax increases all of them said no even jon huntsman , the supposed moderate in the field i m familiar with arguments for holding the line firmly against tax increases that the only way to cure government of excessive spending is to limit severely its supply of money and take the option of extra revenue off the table that the potential of tax increases on the wealthy to lessen our deficits pales beside the impact of thorough reform of medicare and social security but the hypothetical deal presented to these candidates guaranteed spending cuts moreover , it was a metaphor for acrosstheaisle giveandtake if one party bled this much , would you bleed a little \? and then , of course , there s the fact that jeb bush s older brother cut taxes and still managed to spend lavishly that the government was taking in less didn t stop its fiscally wanton ways that s all been hashed over before my question here is whether , if jeb bush had been on that stage in ames that night , he would have answered as huntsman and all the others did or would have said what he subsequently has that such a hypothetical deal is an attractive one \? the republican primaries are such a paradoxical process , because part of what made mitt romney the favorite from the start were his previous glimmers of moderation and the promise of more such glimmers come generalelection time many of the party s most important power brokers and donors understand full well that to take the white house , conservatism like rick santorum s is not a great bet but to get through the primaries , romney had to tack far enough to the right that his credentials as a moderate were seriously undermined after that breakfast , i wondered how much romney , if he hadn t been a presidential candidate in 2008 and wasn t a presidential candidate again now , might sound like jeb bush i wondered if journalists would express regret that someone like romney wasn t contending because you enter the ring and everything changes perhaps now more than ever
when people talked during the presidential campaign about the potential impact of the election on the supreme court , most meant the impact on the court s membership whether barack obama or mitt romney would get to fill any vacancies during the next four years the vote on nov 6 settled that question , obviously , but it also raised another tantalizing one what impact will other developments during this election season , beyond the presidential vote itself , have on the nine justices \? i have two developments in mind the vote in four states in support of samesex marriage , and the runup to election day that saw both democrats and federal judges pushing back against republican strategies devised to selectively minimize voter turnout both are directly relevant to cases on the supreme court s current docket , and it s worth at least considering whether either or both are potential game changers if so , it wouldn t be the first time in supreme court history that timing turned out to be everything last week , the court agreed to decide the constitutionality of section 5 of the voting rights act , the provision that requires states across the old south , plus texas and smaller jurisdictions around the country , to get federal permission before making any changes to their voting procedures it was totally predictable that the court would take this case , and in making that prediction back in the spring , i described this latest challenge to the voting rights act as catnip to the roberts court , given the majority s skepticism toward government policies that acknowledge the country s racially fraught history by taking race into account today stripped of its doctrinal framing , which i ll discuss in a future column , the argument at the heart of this case , shelby county v holder , is that section 5 , reauthorized by congress in 2006 for another 25 years , is an anachronism , a continuing insult to states that have long since cleaned up their act and have put behind them the racist vote suppression that led to the enactment of the voting rights act in the first place in the abstract , against the background of the election of an africanamerican president , that argument has indisputable force things have changed in the south , chief justice john g roberts jr wrote in 2009 , when the court took an inconclusive swipe at the law in an earlier case the court had serious doubts , he wrote then , about whether the current burdens imposed by section 5 s preclearance requirement were justified by current needs then came the 2012 election , with voter identification laws suddenly popping up in republicandominated states , along with cutbacks on voting hours and restrictions on registration the obama administration precleared georgia s law , under which every county will provide free identification cards to voters who present any of a wide range of documents but the administration invoked section 5 to block new voter id requirements in south carolina and texas , arguing that neither state had met the law s requirement to show that any new procedure neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or membership in a language minority group two separate panels of federal judges in washington rejected the states challenges to the administration s action in the south carolina case , the court said that while the state s voter id plan was acceptable on paper and could be used in future elections , it couldn t be used in 2012 because the state hadn t satisfied doubts about how the system would actually work and had failed to give voters enough time to get the required identification the long march for equality for africanamericans is not finished , judge brett m kavanaugh wrote for the panel \( quite a contrast to chief justice roberts things have changed in the south , from a conservative judge who surely would have been on a romney administration s supreme court short list \) the panel in the texas case , noting that the state s identification requirements were the most stringent in the country and would place a disproportionate burden on poor people and minorities , said the evidence provided by texas to show otherwise was unpersuasive , invalid , or both greg abbott , the texas attorney general , denounced the ruling and said the state would appeal to the supreme court the section 5 case the court accepted last week , which is from a county in alabama , will be argued this winter , with a decision by the end of the current term in june given the open cynicism of the republicandriven efforts at vote suppression this year , and the withering scrutiny of federal judges across the ideological spectrum , the question coming out of the 2012 election season is whether the optics of the voting rights issue have changed sufficiently to bring the roberts court back from the brink to which it was surely headed when the subject of voting rights felt like yesterday s news , a quaint page from a fading history , using the shelby county case to eviscerate section 5 looked easy with voting rights the stuff of today s headlines , i m no longer so sure if time is on the side of preserving the voting rights act , it s also on the side of recognizing the right to , and federal recognition of , samesex marriage note that this observation is something well short of a prediction that the supreme court will declare a constitutional right to marriage equality during its current term a vehicle for doing so , the proposition 8 case from california \( hollingsworth v perry \) is sitting on the court s docket , awaiting the justices decision on whether to take it it s an appeal by opponents of samesex marriage , the backers of the 2008 california initiative known as proposition 8 , from a federal appeals court decision last february that declared the proposition unconstitutional the court has indicated that the justices will take up this case , along with eight cases on the constitutionality of the federal defense of marriage act , at their regularly scheduled closeddoor conference on nov 30 the most likely scenario to emerge from the conference is a grant of review in one of the doma cases , most likely windsor v united states , decided last month by the federal appeals court in new york along with the federal appeals court in boston , in another case also now pending before the supreme court , the new yorkbased united states court of appeals for the second circuit declared unconstitutional the statute that withholds the many benefits of marriage available under federal law from samesex couples who are legally married in their state of residence the obama administration , agreeing with the plaintiffs that the law violates the constitution s guarantee of equal protection , is not defending it the pending petitions have been filed by a group of members of the house of representatives , who have hired paul clement , solicitor general during the bush administration , to press the case for upholding the statute assuming the court grants one of the doma cases , i think the justices are likely to put the proposition 8 case on hold until the doma issue is decided that could push any further development on the constitutionality of samesex marriage as opposed to the constitutionality of refusing to recognize those marriages that individual states have legalized until next summer it s entirely possible that the court could just turn down the proposition 8 appeal , which would allow samesex marriage to resume in california without the supreme court s involvement or it could decide the case , as the appeals court did , in a californiaspecific way that would not bind the rest of the country the moment of reckoning , in other words , has not necessarily arrived yet i think there s an excellent chance that the supreme court will overturn doma the statesrights argument could appeal to those justices whom the equal protection argument leaves cold there is obviously less reason for confidence some would say little reason or none on the deeper question , either in the pending case or in the near future but consider this proposition 8 was adopted by california voters four years ago by the narrow margin of 523 percent , after major mobilization by the religious right if that referendum had been held not in 2008 but last week on the day the religious right failed to work its will in maine , maryland , minnesota or washington there is no chance it would have succeeded in the state of california with nine states plus the district of columbia now recognizing samesex marriage , the intervening four years have made an enormous difference without the supreme court s saying a word , the popular understanding of equality has evolved with near lightning speed and invested the constitutional guarantee of equal protection with new meaning the question of how social movements create constitutional meaning outside the courts is deeply intriguing and crucially important , and is currently producing a rich academic literature that s well beyond my scope here my colleague reva siegel has done pathbreaking work on this question , tracing , for example , how the second amendment argument for private gun ownership as a constitutional right evolved far outside the supreme court and won the day there in 2008 against odds that not long before had seemed insurmountable when the history of how samesex marriage became the law of the land is eventually written , as it will be in the not too distant future , there will be many turning points to mark the supreme court s 2003 decision in lawrence v texas , which held that gay relationships could not be criminalized , will certainly be one landmark but last week s election results , when voters in four states had the choice to say yes or no to marriage equality and said yes in all four , will stand , i think , as the more important development it didn t necessarily tell the justices how to decide the cases now on their docket but in showing them that times are changing , it told them a lot
the kremlin is pleased with the outcome of the us presidential vote barack obama s reelection means predictability in usrussian relations there will be no ritual or real repudiation of the previous four years , no painful reassessment of past policies , and no abrupt change in the cast of characters there might even be more flexibility , as obama promised dimitri medvedev , on the thornier issues of the relationship , such as missile defense yet , the relationship is in need of some heavy lifting unless the reset is followed by a rethink , both the united states and russia will be getting less and less from each other a rethink would mean , above all , upgrading the relationship from largely tactical to strategic in the last four years , obama s russia policy was primarily geared to afghanistan and iran cooperation with moscow has allowed the us to ferry troops and mat riel to and from afghanistan across russia a big help , in view of conditions in pakistan it has also permitted a modicum of unity among the major powers with regard to iran s nuclear ambitions besides , washington and moscow succeeded in reaching another agreement on cutting their nuclear forces and in having russia finally join the world trade organization this is certainly good , but not good enough differences over syria and a lack of agreement on missile defense , and reaction in america to russia s domestic developments and the kremlin s counterreaction , threaten to undermine the relationship as people used to say during george w bush s first term , unless the usrussia relationship goes up , it will go down they were right then , and this lesson must be learned making the relationship strategic would mean protecting it from being overwhelmed by disagreements abroad and special interests at home does russia deserve a strategic status in us foreign policy \? consider the following an agreement on cooperative missile defenses in europe would make sure that the country with a nuclear arsenal almost as big as america s would no longer have to be counted as a potential military adversary expanding washington s vision for the asiapacific to include the country which has a 2 , 700mile long border with china and the longest shoreline in the pacific would make the pivot more realistic making sure that the arctic emerges as an area of cooperation par excellence would require dealing with russia , the biggest of the five littoral states dealing with russia will not be easy it is not america s equal , but fiercely independent it is not an ally , but not a willing adversary either russia , however , is critical for the 21 century s global balance and that should not escape obama s attention i wish george w bush was still in power , a leading egyptian liberal politician said to me in cairo earlier this year at least we knew what we would get with bush not just in egypt , but in syria , israel , bahrain , iran and even saudi arabia there is a perception that president obama and the united states cannot be relied upon this weakens america s allies , and strengthens its enemies president obama can change this perception in his second term by taking his domestic mantra of 'i mean what i say , and i say what i mean'' to the world s most volatile region he has been wise not to intervene militarily in syria in coming months , syrian rebels , turkey and gulf countries will try to lure the us into the jihadist battlefields by escalating violence and chaos will the us maintain its sobriety \? obama s victory will be seen as an amber light in tehran to further isolate iran , and be prepared for consequences of us military options , obama ca n't ignore the palestinians his second term can see him belatedly deserve the nobel prize by bringing israelis and arabs to a settlement he has made new friends in the middle east , not least the region s most powerful political force the muslim brotherhood they will expect leadership and reliability while obama s mideast policies during his first term were occasionally misguided and unfocused , he certainly is better equipped to face these regional challenges than mitt romney with the complex situation followed by the arab awakening , america needs to reach out to the muslim and arab world it should be adamant in opposing extremist religious fanaticism while being firm in protecting its strategic and economic interests but it should not launch a war , ideological or strategic , against islam as such romney would have been incapable of such a differentiated approach obama has tried to suggest such opening in his cairo speech even if there was no follow up and his initial response to the demonstrations on tahrir square was confused , he understands how important this is he is also well aware of the pitfalls of a more active involvement in the syrian imbroglio similarly , if it turns out that diplomacy will fail to stop iran s nuclear ambitions and more robust steps will have to be taken , obama will have the legitimacy , internal and international , to do this unlike romney , he cannot be branded as a gungho warmonger obama has also learned how complicated is the road to an israelipalestinian understanding in his second term , he may try to learn from the failure of his initial attempts to achieve a quick fix despite disagreements between obama and netanyahu on israeli settlements on the west bank , the security cooperation between the two countries has reached unprecedented levels in the last few years and in any case , it is good for the jewish state to have even a sometimes critical friend in the white house sitting here in my hotel room in ulan bator the capital of mongolia , one of the world s fastest growing economies i am pondering the reactions across asia to the us election results and reflecting on a piece i wrote fours years ago about barack obama to most people in mongolia the outcome is irrelevant a couple of americans here said they are happy to avoid the depressing state of politics in the united states , all too obvious during the election year one even said 6 billion we ca n't afford and still no change as other people talked about the chinese handover of power this week , a european living in china pointed out that this is why the chinese system is more efficient in my article of october 2008 i suggested that the global excitement over obama was misplaced after eight disastrous years of george w bush , the chattering classes wanted their faith in america restored , and how better than to have a black president who was promising a departure from the past four years on it is safe to say that for the rest of the world obama has not delivered on foreign policy promises obama promised much , and suggested that america would move beyond a foreign policy based on promoting american exceptionalism across asia , the reaction to the elections has been muted asians woke up sometime ago to the reality that exceptionalism driven by narrow national political agendas is at the core of american foreign policy , and they have to endure its global implications if obama is to restore his credibility , he will need to do more than resort to rhetoric he will need to convince people in asia that he understands america must be humble and accommodate the realities of powersharing in a rapidly changing world he has many opportunities to do this in the way he deals with china , iran , syria , russia not to mention the mess in afghanistan as for the herders in the steppes in mongolia the main issue will be whether their animals will survive the harsh winter the sigh of relief in berlin was palpable it s not that germans and europeans had balked at the thought of a president romney sure , remarks like 'russia is our no1 geopolitical foe'' had raised eyebrows in the continent s capitals , but it seemed clear that a romney administration would , if elected , pursue a fairly centrist foreign policy agenda senior romney advisers like robert zoellick or robert m kimmitt are respected in europe and although most european policymakers ended up working well with the obama administration there have certainly been disappointments and disagreements guant namo , missile defense , drone wars , stimulusvsausterity , to name but a few it s also true that president obama s new mandate is narrow america , if last night s snapshot is a remotely accurate guide , remains divided congressional gridlock and the jan 1 fiscal cliff have lost none of their menacing urgency so why the relief \? simple none of us can afford the luxury of new beginnings the feared rerun of a whipsawing election nightmare was averted yes , there 'll be a new secretary of state in washington , but a candidate like senator john kerry would be another pair of safe hands and a new administration would have been bogged down by innumerable and endless confirmation hearings \( for americans echoing henry kissinger s complaint about there being no single phone number in europe try calling a midlevel bureaucrat in washington in the first year of a new administration \) the plain fact is now that the sometimes appalling , occasionally entertaining , and only intermittently edifying spectacle of these us elections is behind us , it s time to get serious again the crisis on both sides of the atlantic is not just about banks or mortgages what s still at stake is nothing less than the resilience of our economies , the fairness of our societies , the stability of our democracies and the preservation of a free and decent international order leaders on both sides of the atlantic have limited credit and leeway from their worried publics to devote resources abroad that might be used at home all of which means disagreements or no , americans and europeans need each other now more than ever and , frankly , it s time for europeans to step up and say yes , we can , too europe woke up with a deep sense of relief their candidate had made it again the continent may have almost disappeared from the american radar screen , but for europeans , america has kept its emotional if not strategic centrality america may not be what it used to be the one and only indispensable power but europeans follow its presidential elections with keen interest obama may have lost much of its magic , but fear of what a romney victory could mean may has replaced the sense of hope that prevailed in 2008 nevertheless europeans in their majority could not understand why americans had such hesitations in their political choices mitt romney not a bad man in reality looked like a don draper who would not drink alcohol , a character from the mad men series , a man of the past by contrast , obama is still the colder version of let bartlet be bartlet of the west wing series there is a huge difference between the real and symbolic meaning of the results of the us elections for europe the american president is no longer president of the world but an obama defeat would have been a symbolic blow not only for america , but for the entire western democratic world in electing a black president in 2008 , the united states forced europeans to ask themselves difficult questions was a french , german or italian obama possible \? if obama had been defeated in 2012 such questions , with their profound universal message of hope , would sadly have disappeared in the same vein , obama s defeat would have been an encouragement for the tenants of social conservatism in europe at a different level , the defeat of mitt romney in the united states after that of nicolas sarkozy in france is proof that if you loose the centrist votes by flirting too much with the most right wing forces you run the risk of being condemned to defeat obama s victory may seem like a bitter pill for sarkozy it is possible to be reelected in times of crisis but it is definitely encouraging for angela merkel in germany if the leader of the west can make it , so can the leader of europe
several commenters have asked that i provide examples of republicans making reasonable economic arguments some of them seem to be saying that i m proving my bias if i don t provide such examples but it doesn t work that way if all republicans are saying unreasonable things , then it s a distortion indeed , a form of bias to insist that there must be reasonable republicans now , what you can quite easily find are examples of people who used to be republicans , or even still consider themselves republicans , saying reasonable things say , bruce bartlett or david frum but the very fact that they re reasonable has led to their excommunication from the movement ! it s kind of the treason never prospers argument \( for if it prospers , none dare call it treason \) if someone declares that tax cuts don t pay for themselves , or that printing money when you re in a liquidity trap isn t deeply inflationary , or that fear of obamacare isn t holding the economy back , he ceases to be considered a member in good standing of the gop there are , therefore , no reasonable republicans on these issues
two american brothers of a mexican casino magnate who fled drug and fraud charges in the united states and has been seeking a pardon enabling him to return have emerged as major fundraisers and donors for s reelection campaign the casino owner , juan jose rojas cardona , known as pepe , jumped bail in iowa in 1994 and disappeared , and has since been linked to violence and corruption in mexico a state department cable in 2009 said he was suspected of orchestrating the assassination of a business rival and making illegal campaign donations to mexican officials when the new york times asked the obama campaign early monday about the cardonas , officials said they were unaware of the brother in mexico later in the day , the campaign said it was refunding the money raised by the family , which totaled more than 200 , 000 as recently as january of last year , one of mr cardona s brothers in chicago , carlos rojas cardona , arranged for the former chairman of the iowa democratic party to seek a pardon from the governor for pepe cardona , according to prosecutors in that state none was forthcoming last fall , carlos cardona and another brother in chicago , alberto rojas cardona , began raising money for the obama campaign and the the cardona brothers , who have no prior history of political giving , appeared seemingly out of nowhere in the world of democratic fundraising , democratic activists said the money alberto cardona raised put him in the upper tiers of fundraisers known as bundlers , according to a list released last month by the campaign he and carlos cardona each gave the maximum 30 , 800 to the democratic national committee , and a lesser amount to a state victory fund a sister , leticia rojas cardona of tennessee , donated 13 , 000 to the national committee , and another relative in illinois gave 12 , 600 , records show there is no record of pepe cardona making a donation although the two brothers live and work in chicago , they maintain ties to pepe cardona in mexico alberto cardona operates an advertising agency in mexico that has worked for political candidates backed by his brother , according to public records and mexican news reports public records also show that the domain name for the web site of a restaurant pepe cardona owns is registered to alberto cardona obama campaign officials said most of the money raised by the cardona brothers came from themselves and other relatives , donations of about 200 , 000 in addition , the campaign was identifying other donations , believed to total less than 100 , 000 , that were bundled from other people on the basis of the questions that have been raised , we will return the contributions from these individuals and from any other donors they brought to the campaign , said ben labolt , a spokesman for the obama campaign pepe cardona is one of the largest players in mexico s violent and tumultuous casino trade in 2007 , he survived an assassination attempt that was attributed to members of organized crime the state department cable , which was part of the cache made public by wikileaks , said he was suspected of illegally funneling 5 million into mexican political campaigns in 2006 multiple messages left for alberto and carlos cardona over several days were not returned a sisterinlaw , sarah westall of minnesota , said in a telephone interview that it would be wrong to tar other members of the family with the negative publicity surrounding pepe cardona ms westall , who is married to another cardona brother , gabriel , said alberto and carlos took up democratic fundraising because their extended family had long been involved in helping the latino community and because they supported the president there were no other reasons beyond those , she said i understand that it looks real bad , she said but the rest of the family are really good people pepe is actually a good person too whatever the family s motivation , the president cannot pardon someone for state crimes on monday , democratic fundraisers who have had encounters with alberto and carlos cardona expressed surprise upon learning about their family history manuel sanchez , a chicago lawyer who is deeply involved in latino outreach for the obama administration , said he first met them in december at a finance committee meeting for the president s campaign in washington he said he had been told that they were involved in marketing and advertising they impressed him as very smart young guys who wanted to support the president , he said i did get the distinct impression that both of them are very welltodo and successful in their businesses , mr sanchez said , adding that he had no idea they had a brother in mexico or what his background was in johnson county , iowa , the authorities are well acquainted with pepe cardona s past one of nine children of mexican parents who grew up in iowa , , who was born in mexico , was active in civil rights issues at the university of iowa and became president of the student senate while at the university in 1990 , he was accused of misspending student government money , and a year later he was criminally charged with defrauding associates in a telemarketing company he started , according to court records he was sentenced to five years in prison , and while free pending an appeal , he was arrested in new mexico on charges of trying to smuggle across the border , court records show he pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in 1994 , but disappeared while out on bail , later surfacing in mexico in 1998 , federal prosecutors obtained approval from a judge to quash the drug indictment , wiping clean pepe cardona s federal court record however , his current legal status in iowa , where a county judge had ordered him jailed in 1992 , is more precarious on monday , the johnson county attorney , janet lyness , said there was still an outstanding warrant for his arrest on a probation violation charge she said that at least twice over the last four years , a lawyer approached the iowa governor s office asking about a pardon for pepe cardona the last such request came in the final days of the term of gov chet culver , a democrat , and was filed by gordon fischer , a lawyer who is a former chairman of the iowa democratic party in his pardon application , mr fischer explained that he knew pepe cardona from his days at the university of iowa mr fischer declined to comment on monday , citing attorneyclient privilege ms lyness , also a democrat , said she had been told that the application had been initiated by members of pepe cardona s family in the united states she opposed it , and it was not granted i can think of few people who are less deserving of a pardon than pepe rojascardona , ms lyness wrote in her response to the pardon request , adding that it would be a travesty of justice the first campaign donations by alberto and carlos cardona came shortly after news articles revealing pepe cardona s criminal past appeared in the united states and mexico last fall one of them , a long expos in september by a mexican magazine , proceso , chronicled pepe cardona s relatively swift rise to fortune and notoriety in mexico after fleeing the american authorities he obtained mexican gambling licenses , and with help from investors in louisiana , he started opening casinos in and around monterrey , eventually becoming known as mexico s casino czar the article reported that tango media , an advertising company it said is owned by alberto cardona , worked on the campaigns of politicians favored by pepe cardona in communities where he owned casinos it also said carlos cardona was involved in one of pepe cardona s business deals a review of public records found that several of the cardona brothers' business activities have intersected in the united states and in mexico , sharing common addresses and doing work for one another s companies for instance , another brother , arturo rojas cardona pepe s main business partner in his casino and entertainment businesses has an architecture and design firm that has done work for his brothers in the united states , including alberto cardona the nature of alberto cardona s business is not exactly clear on campaign finance reports , he listed his employer as tango latin , a chicago company that seems to be connected to tango productions , a small video production , marketing and photography studio that carlos cardona listed as his employer a check of public records found that alberto cardona is the registered owner of domain names for the web sites of tango media and 40 west , a restaurant owned by pepe cardona , both in mexico ms westall , the sisterinlaw , said she did not know what sort of dealings alberto and carlos had with pepe cardona , but she added that it would not be unusual for large families to help each other in their business activities if someone in the family does web design , and pepe needed someone to do that , he would hire that person first , she said in mexico , that s the way it works
the united nations security council decided on thursday to terminate the observer mission in , where the increasingly violent rebellion against president s government has left diplomatic peacemaking efforts paralyzed but the security council agreed to keep a much smaller united nations office in the country , holding out hope that a political solution was still possible france s ambassador to the united nations , g rard araud , the security council s current president , announced the decision after a meeting on the future of the observer mission , three days before its mandate expires he said all 15 members had agreed that the conditions for extending the mission reduced violence and an end to the syrian government s use of heavy weapons had not been met if you do n't renew the mandate , the mandate is over , mr araud said afterward he said the dismantling of the mission , which at its peak had 300 unarmed observers , will start in a few days mr araud also said that the security council had approved a request by , the secretary general of the united nations , to maintain an office in damascus , syria s capital , with its exact nature and size to be determined there will be a un presence , and we hope a useful un presence , he said the withdrawal of the observer mission represented what some diplomatic experts called an unusual acknowledgment by the united nations that it was helpless to resolve a bitter sectariantinged conflict in which an estimated 18 , 000 people have been killed and none of the antagonists are interested in negotiating some characterized the withdrawal as a positive development that would remove what they called the pretense that a viable peace effort was under way where the un gets in trouble is when you have placeholders , when something s better than nothing , said bruce w jentleson , a former state department diplomat who is now a professor of public policy and political science at duke university something is not always better than nothing still , the security council s decision runs the risk of further marginalizing the role of the united nations in the syrian war , leaving it vulnerable to the same criticism of inaction that it has faced in other major armed conflicts where civilians have suffered massacres and other brutalities mr ban and other united nations officials , mindful of the failures in thwarting atrocities like the 1994 rwanda and 1995 srebrenica massacre , have repeatedly invoked those events in talking about syria last month mr ban , paying the by a secretary general to the memorial site for the 8 , 000 men and boys killed by bosnian serb forces in srebrenica , said , i do not want to see any of my successors , after 20 years , visiting syria , apologizing for what we could have done now to protect the civilians in syria , which we are not doing now edmond mulet , the assistant secretary general for , who attended the security council meeting and will help oversee the monitor mission s withdrawal , acknowledged that the situation on the ground is extremely difficult in syria still , he said , the fact that it s difficult does n't mean we should not face the challenge mr mulet said the new office would be much smaller than the observer mission , perhaps 20 to 30 people , whose precise duties were not clear yet he said there would be no more military observers it s clear that both sides have chosen the path of war , open conflict , he said the space for political dialogue is very reduced at this point there had been widespread expectations that the security council would decide not to renew the observer mission s mandate because of the violence in syria , which had forced the mission s commanding officer to drastically reduce the staff and basically confine those who remained to their damascus hotel for the past two months the observer mission was created as part of the peace plan for syria negotiated by kofi annan , the special envoy for the united nations and the arab league , who announced his resignation two weeks ago in frustration over his failure to persuade mr assad and his adversaries to halt the conflict , now 18 months old speculation intensified that the united nations and arab league were close to announcing a successor to mr annan diplomats said they believed that the replacement would be lakhdar brahimi , a widely respected algerian statesman who has worked for the united nations in other trouble spots , including afghanistan and iraq but a spokesman for mr brahimi declined to confirm that he had accepted the job in a move that appeared to take other united nations diplomats by surprise on thursday , russia s ambassador announced after the security council meeting that he was inviting representatives from the group of influential countries and organizations that had attended a syria meeting in geneva to take part in a meeting on friday at the united nations the ambassador , vitaly i churkin , told reporters that the purpose is to call on all the parties to stop the violence but it was unclear what would be likely to result from such a meeting or who would attend in washington , victoria nuland , the state department spokeswoman , said , frankly , we 're not sure we understand the objective and the goal of the meeting
national harbor , md late one night in february 2009 , the delaware women s basketball coach , tina martin , received a startling text message from elena delle donne , one of the sport s most hyped prospects in years will you open the gym \? six months earlier , delle donne had left the in the middle of the night two days into her freshman year and returned to her family s home in wilmington , del she said publicly that from basketball , but she knew she was mostly homesick delle donne transferred to delaware and played volleyball for the blue hens during the fall , and the text message on that february night was the first outward sign that her passion for basketball still flickered martin did not have time to consider the implications , or the possibilities for seasons like this one , in which delaware is 301 and a no 3 seed in the ncaa tournament at that moment , she just knew she had to hurry to the empty gym and unlock it before delle donne changed her mind it was nice to touch a ball again and have that comfort back , delle donne said i 'd missed it a lot over the next three months , delle donne had frequent latenight basketball workouts that were shrouded in secrecy sometimes she waited in her car to make sure all the delaware players had left the bob carpenter center she did not want to ignite rumors or invite pressure to decide her future a custodian might have known she was in the gym , martin said but that s it that spring , delle donne decided she would play basketball for delaware during the 200910 season now a junior , she is the nation s leading scorer her average of 275 points a game is more than 3 points higher than the next closest player and she has improbably turned the blue hens into a national power delaware , which has never won an ncaa tournament game , will face no 14seeded arkansaslittle rock in a firstround game in little rock on sunday delle donne , a contender for national player of the year , has captivated her university and her state unlike any other women s basketball player elena is the highestprofile player we 've had in our league since david robinson played for navy , said tom yeager , the colonial athletic association commissioner and it goes beyond scoring points delle donne s athleticism and competitive nature were evident at an early age , her family said she removed the training wheels from her bicycle when she was 3 and she learned to juggle at 6 when she was in first grade , she would drain jump shots at halftime of her brother gene s grammar school basketball games she had perfect form , gene delle donne said , and the crowd paid more attention to her than to us as a third grader , delle donne played on a recreation league team consisting of middle school students , and when she reached eighth grade she received her first scholarship offer , from north carolina delle donne blossomed into the nation s top recruit , 6 feet 5 inches with a forward s build and a guard s touch , and she felt obligated to join a basketball power like connecticut but her time with the huskies was fleeting she missed her family too much , especially her older sister , lizzie , who is blind and deaf and has autism and cerebral palsy longdistance communication between the sisters is impossible when delle donne returned home , that barrier was removed lizzie knows elena by smell and touch when she realizes her sister is nearby , her smile glows lizzie loves the feel of water and wind , so elena often sits by a pool with her or drives her around the family s property in a golf cart she s my angel and my motivation , delle donne said she s everything to me during delle donne s freshman season , she was named the conference player of the year and a thirdteam allamerican she entered last season with great expectations but missed 11 games after learning she had lyme disease even after she returned , she said , she felt as if she were running through quicksand still , she averaged 253 points and helped the blue hens to a berth in the national invitation tournament a lot of people get lyme disease and just lay in bed , gene delle donne said elena played four games in four days at the conference tournament with delle donne s illness , various team injuries , and transfers who were not yet eligible , the blue hens were not at full strength at a practice late last season , after delle donne s health had improved , martin put her on a team with guards trumae lucas and akeema richards , who were sitting out after transferring from florida and west virginia i got a glimpse of the future , martin said and i was really , really excited last nov 17 , delle donne in the blue hens' win over no 11 penn state , and as the victories and momentum began to build , the community was enchanted in previous seasons , a set of movable bleachers on one side of the carpenter center was not rolled out for women s basketball games this season , all the seating was used , average attendance rose to 3 , 900 from 2 , 100 and three games were sellouts vice president joseph r biden jr , a delaware alumnus , attended the blue hens' game against drexel on jan 22 it s been fun to see how the community has rallied around this team , athletic director bernard muir said there s been a following that we 've never had before , so we 're savoring it the junior guard lauren carra , a history education major , is an observer at shuemedill middle school in newark , del she said the school held a contest this year in which students could win blue hens tickets for finishing books , and a teacher told her she had never seen them read so much so quickly enthusiasm on delaware s campus is evident , too a weekly email is sent to students highlighting important events , and carra said this is the first season the women s basketball team has been listed frequently several players said their professors have season tickets , and a large contingent of students and fans traveled to the conference tournament in maryland people used to just say , oh , you play basketball \? ' the junior forward danielle parker said now it s like oh , you 're no 12 you 're danielle parker' it s pretty cool outside delaware , the blue hens are still a mostly unknown quantity two women s basketball analysts declined interview requests simply because they had not seen delle donne or delaware play this season when delle donne sat for an interview in the lobby of the team hotel here , she was undisturbed and seemingly unnoticed by the stream of businesspeople and tourists i guess we 're still kind of in the shadows , she said but the anonymity may not last the blue hens are ready for their turn in the spotlight this weekend , and none of the team s five leading scorers are seniors delaware has been selected to host openingweekend ncaa tournament games next year and for delle donne , that could offer the perfect mix amid the bright lights of the biggest event in women s basketball , she would still be surrounded by the comforts of home
washington with openly debating whether to strike at s nuclear facilities in the coming months , the obama administration is moving ahead with a range of steps short of war that it hopes will forestall an israeli attack , while forcing the iranians to take more seriously negotiations that are all but stalemated already planned are naval exercises and new antimissile systems in the persian gulf , and a more forceful clamping down on iranian oil revenue the administration is also considering new declarations by about what might bring about american military action , as well as covert activities that have been previously considered and rejected later this month the united states and more than 25 other nations will hold the largestever minesweeping exercise in the persian gulf , in what military officials say is a demonstration of unity and a defensive step to prevent iran from attempting to block oil exports through the strait of hormuz in fact , the united states and iran have each announced what amounted to dueling defensive exercises to be conducted this fall , each intended to dissuade the other from attack the administration is also racing to complete , in the next several months , a new radar system in qatar that would combine with radars already in place in israel and turkey to form a broad arc of antimissile coverage , according to military officials the message to iran would be that even if it developed a nuclear weapon and mounted it atop its growing fleet of missiles , it could be countered by antimissile systems the question of how explicit mr obama s warnings to iran should be is still a subject of internal debate , closely tied to electionyear politics some of mr obama s advisers have argued that israel needs a stronger public assurance that he is willing to take military action , well before iran actually acquired a weapon but other senior officials have argued that israel is trying to corner mr obama into a military commitment that he does not yet need to make on sunday , prime minister benjamin netanyahu appeared to criticize mr obama for being too vague about how far iran can go the international community is not setting iran a clear red line , and iran does not see international determination to stop its nuclear project , he told his cabinet until iran sees a clear red line and such determination , it will not stop the progress of its nuclear project and iran must not be allowed to have  none of the steps being taken by the obama administration addresses the most immediate goal of the united states and its allies slowing iran s nuclear development so inside the american and israeli intelligence agencies , there is continuing debate about possible successors to olympic games , the covert cyberoperation , begun in the bush administration and accelerated under mr obama , that infected iran s nuclear centrifuges and , for a while , sent them spinning out of control an error in the computer code alerted iran to the attack in 2010 , and since then many of the country s nuclear sites have been modified to defend against such attacks , according to experts familiar with the effort all of these options are designed to buy time to offer israeli officials a credible alternative to a military strike that would almost certainly trigger an iranian reaction and , the white house and pentagon fear , could unleash a new conflict in the middle east while mr obama s national security team has been very closedmouthed about the tense discussions with mr netanyahu , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , gen martin e dempsey , gave voice to the concerns in london on thursday general dempsey repeated the familiar american position that an israeli attack would clearly delay but probably not destroy  but then he went beyond any warning that mr obama has given to israel in public , saying that the international coalition of countries applying sanctions against iran could be undone if the country was attacked prematurely he added i do n't want to be accused of trying to influence , nor do i want to be complicit if they choose to do it united states intelligence officials have said they have no evidence that iran s top leaders have decided to take the final steps toward a weapon iran s intentions remain unclear , intelligence officials say last week , the reported an increase in the number of centrifuges that iran has installed in an underground enrichment plant that is largely invulnerable to israeli attack , but also indicated that iran has converted some of its most highly enriched fuel to a form that would be difficult to use in a weapon the administration has already quietly proposed a stop the clock agreement to get iran to halt production of the fuel that is closest to bombgrade and to ship it out of the country , according to diplomats from several countries involved in the discussions but iranian officials have rejected those calls , insisting on a lifting of all sanctions , and there has been no talk of a broader , more permanent deal mitt romney , mr obama s republican challenger , has taken a harder line , saying he would never agree to allow iran to enrich uranium at any level a restriction even many republicans , including some of mr romney s advisers , say there is virtually no chance iran will accept , since it has a legal right to peaceful enrichment one option the administration has already approved is the military exercise , scheduled for sept 1627 , in which the united states and its allies will practice detecting and destroying mines with ships , helicopters and robotic underwater drones the ships will stay out of the narrow strait of hormuz , to avoid direct interaction with iran s navy in advance of the exercise , the united states navy earlier this summer doubled the number of minesweepers in the region , to eight vessels the deployments are part of a larger series of military reinforcements into the persian gulf in recent months , all described by the united states as defensive that is also the explanation for the american efforts to create a regional missile defense system across the gulf to protect cities , oil refineries , pipelines and military bases from an iranian attack the latest element is a highresolution missile defense radar in qatar , meant to stress that iran s arab neighbors are as concerned about tehran s abilities as is israel military specialists said offensive military options , including strikes against iran s refineries and power grid , could also be telegraphed to the iranians the united states does not have to threaten preventive strikes , anthony h cordesman , a longtime military analyst at the center for strategic and international studies , wrote in a recent paper , iran preventing war by making it credible it simply has to make its capabilities clear in terms of a wide range of possible scenarios but there is concern among american strategists that iran could interpret these actions as encirclement , and that the actions could encourage those elements in the country that want to move faster to a nuclear capability , if not a weapon itself even one of the options that many democrats and republicans advocate to shake iran to help topple president bashar alassad of syria , iran s only real friend in the region could have the same effect inside the obama white house , there has also been debate about whether mr obama needs to reshape his negotiating strategy around clear red lines for iran steps beyond which the united states would not allow the country to go earlier this year mr obama said he believed that the united states and its allies could not simply accept a nuclear iran , largely because of the high risk that other arab states would seek weapons even if mr obama set a clear red line now , its credibility may be questionable according to a tally by graham allison , the harvard expert on nuclear conflict , the united states and its allies have allowed iran to cross seven previous red lines over 18 years with few consequences that leaves one other option that officials are loath to discuss new covert action the olympic games attack on iran s centrifuges was chosen over another approach that the bush administration explored going after electrical grids feeding the nuclear operations but mr obama has rejected any attacks that could risk affecting nearby towns or facilities and thus harm ordinary iranians other plans considered in the past , and now reportedly back under consideration , focus on other targets in the nuclear process , from making raw fuel to facilities involved in missile work one missile plant blew up last year , and israeli sabotage was suspected , but never proven american officials say the united states was not involved one other proposal circulating in washington , advocated by some former senior national security officials , is a clandestine military strike , akin to the one israel launched against syria s nuclear reactor in 2007 it took weeks for it to become clear that site had been hit by israeli jets , and perhaps because the strike was never officially acknowledged by israel , and because its success was so embarrassing to syria , there was no retaliation but iran s is a much higherprofile program at best this would buy you a few years , one administration official said , without acknowledging such a strike was under consideration by the united states or israel even if an explosion at an iranian facility was accidental , the official said , the iranians might well see it as a provocation for an attack of their own
off the coast of san juan island , wash a dog named tucker with a thumping tail and a mysterious past as a stray on the streets of seattle has become an unexpected star in the realm of canineassisted science he is the world s only working dog , marine biologists say , able to find and track the scent of orca scat , or feces , in open ocean water up to a mile away , in the smallest of specks through dint of hard work and obsession with an orange ball on a rope , which he gets to play with as a reward after a successful search on the water , tucker is an ace in finding something that most people , and perhaps most dogs , would just as soon avoid and it is not easy scat can sink or disperse in 30 minutes or less but it is crucial in monitoring the health of the whales here , an endangered group that is probably among the most studied animal populations in the world most of the 85 or so orcas , or killer whales , that frequent the san juans , about two hours northwest of seattle , have been genotyped and tracked for decades , down to their birth years and number of offspring and none of this could happen as easily as it does without tucker and his wet , black nose or the new tricks that he taught the scientists sometimes he 'd just turn around and sit down and stare at me , waiting for me to figure it out , said deborah a giles , who is completing a phd on how orcas here are affected by the thousands of whale watchers and scores of commercial whalewatch vessels that cluster around the animals he s very subtle , said ms giles , sitting behind the wheel of the research vessel moja as tucker , an 8yearold black lab mix , paced at the prow on a recent afternoon one thing to get out of the way quickly orca scat really does not smell that bad perhaps because the animals eat mostly chinook salmon the tastiest kind , many human seafood lovers agree the scent is more fish than foul but unlike , say , a narcoticssniffing dog that can lead its human around by a leash , the research boat itself is , in effect , tucker s legs when he has picked up the aroma he cannot physically go where the sample is to be found , but must somehow signal where he wants the boat to go , with the feces somewhere out there on the water like a delphic oracle whose every nuanced expression must be interpreted by acolytes tucker might lean to one side of the boat , then another , then suddenly sink back onto his green mat with his head between his paws , the scent lost his nose for scat leads on , and all must follow the slightest twitch of his ear is important , said elizabeth seely , a trainer who has worked with tucker for four years at a nonprofit group called the conservation canines , which specializes in dogassisted research on behalf of endangered species she stood at his side on a recent scatsearch session , signaling to ms giles behind the wheel with tiny finger motions a bit to the right , a bit more to the left , circle back that tucker was suggesting by his posture and level of attention out on these waters , though , it seems that every creature is learning new tricks salmon have taken to hiding under commercial whalewatch boats when they are being hunted by the orcas the boats , in turn , are filled with people upward of 500 , 000 during the peak season from may to october who have paid to see whales and who in many cases , boat operators and scientists say , return home wanting somehow to help the animals whaleloving visitors in turn reinforce a local economic engine that hinges more and more on having whales to see the whales are becoming , in a strange way , more in sync with the rhythms of their human watchers resting less during daylight and more at night than they used to in the 1980s or '90s as part of her dissertation at the university of california , davis , ms giles is examining reduced prey availability and increased vessel presence as potential causes for tucker , though , it mostly comes down to his ball toy , which he plays with in exuberant , wild abandon , tossing it into the air and staging crouched bouts of tug of war with ms seely when a fecal sample is found , the researchers carry it toward him and then substitute the ball at the last second , reinforcing the connection between work and reward another scat dog in training , a flatcoated retriever named sadie , was donated to the program by an owner who could not deal with her ball fixation in frustration , the owner put sadie s ball on top of the fridge eight hours or so later , she returned and found sadie still sitting there , staring up at the object of her desires when the owner told me that story , my immediate response was , we 'll take her , ' said prof samuel k wasser , the director of the center for conservation biology at the university of washington and the director of the orca scat  the research , financed by of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , is raising new questions about how to protect the orcas professor wasser said that when he started the project four years ago , he thought boat activity would be a crucial element of whale stress , reflected through stress hormones in their scat but it turned out , he said , that food supply was more important , with fewer salmon because of overfishing by humans or habitat degradation or both emerging as a main stress variable knowing to focus on fish supply , he said , means knowing where to focus public policy efforts on the animals' behalf through the scat , biologists can tell , for example , which whale pods spend the winter off the coast of southern california , because their feces can contain higher trace elements of ddt , the pesticide that was banned in 1972 the poison still echoes through the decades in the fish the whales eat before returning north other orca groups have concentrations of dioxins or pcbs traced to industrial activity around seattle but for all his hundreds of hours on boats , tucker will not get wet he hates to swim , ms seely said she is not sure why a trauma from puppyhood , she supposes it is one thing about which he cannot communicate
it has been a game of sorts over the years marveling when ballplayers turn out to be jewish and straining to expand the parameters of the religion so that as many players as possible can be included for years , kevin youkilis has been a leading figure in this odd , but entertaining , sport that was elevated to onair comedy in 2006 when the actor and comedian denis leary , in an extended bit of shock , wrestled with the startling fact that his beloved first baseman , with a name like a greek omelet , was , incredibly , a jew now , youkilis , is he a greek kid \? leary asked that night during a visit to the red sox television booth when told that youkilis was , in fact , jewish , leary reacted with manic glee that s fantastic , he said that s one bottle of whiskey away from being irish catholic they got the manischewitz , we got the jameson s it s the same guilt , the same bad food that s fantastic we got a jewish first baseman ! the youkilis family story is as traditionally jewish as you can get filled with name changes and tales of persecution in eastern europe and now that the hardnosed 33yearold veteran with the unusual batting stance has signed with the , his background should especially resonate in the new york market , where many fans are jewish and have immigrant roots similar to youkilis s the youkilis family was not originally named youkilis far from it , although exactly what occurred on the other side of the atlantic more than a hundred years ago is more spoken lore than documented fact there are so many stories in the family , mike youkilis , kevin s father , said in a telephone interview wednesday but we 've agreed on one in that story , there was , sometime in the 1800s , a teenager with the last name weiner , who is believed to have been kevin youkilis s greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather give or take a great and who lived in what is now romania fearing the cossacks , who were no friends of the jews , and of being drafted at age 16 into the army , he fled to greece apparently , there was a family friend there with a name like youkilis , mike youkilis said a couple of years later , he got homesick , and when he decided to go home , he could n't come back with the name weiner or he 'd be thrown in jail so he took the greek name he met a lady and they married in romania and started to have kids and we kept the name edward youkilis , kevin s uncle , could not recall relatives ever suggesting that the name be restored to weiner we grew up with everyone thinking we were greek , but never once did i hear a relative say let s change it back , he said by telephone it was n't something we thought was unusual in those days changing back to weiner would have deprived red sox fans of shouting yoooouuuk ! at youkilis after he emerged as a stalwart in the boston lineup mike youkilis s father , a jeweler , and his 10 siblings ultimately left romania for the united states , all detouring first through canada some settled in cincinnati , where mike owns a wholesale jewelry business , and where kevin was raised when kevin was in the minor leagues and making little money , his father said that he told him , i 'll put you to work here but he hated it , mike youkilis added the joke was , if you do n't start hitting , you 'll be doing this' one aspect of the fascination with jewish ballplayers of whom there have never been many is whether one s mother is jewish that , by traditional jewish law , makes one jewish regardless of whether someone is observant of the religion , or oblivious on that score , ryan braun , the milwaukee brewers' star outfielder , is not considered jewish by some because while his father is jewish and was born in israel and lost family members in the holocaust , his mother is catholic braun himself has embraced his jewish identity then there is ralph branca , who learned last year , at age 85 , that his mother , who had raised him catholic , was actually jewish that makes branca jewish , too and yet shel wallman , a coeditor of jewish sports review , said that branca , the brooklyn dodgers righthander who gave up bobby thomson s famous home run , could not be in his publication because he had followed a different faith all his life there is little ambiguity when it comes to youkilis , though while his mother , carolyn , a west virginian , was not raised jewish , she converted after marrying mike and there was never any doubt that kevin would have a bar mitzvah at age 13 , his father said mike youkilis said the ceremony was held in 1992 at adath israel congregation , a conservative synagogue in cincinnati kevin was superb , mike youkilis said we had a luncheon and a party the next night and , he added , none of us speaks hebrew well , but kevin can still read it with the vowels irvin m wise , the senior rabbi at adath israel , was asked about his former student wednesday and responded in an email as you can imagine , he is quite the man' in cincinnati in general and especially in our jewish community he said he last saw kevin at a babynaming ceremony a few years ago but hopes to see him next at one of the monthly cincinnati nights that are held at edward s , the restaurant in tribeca owned by youkilis s uncle whether or not youkilis becomes a tribeca habitu , he is almost certain to be in high demand from jewish groups scott barancik , who runs the jewish baseball news web site , said that youkilis should handle the extra attention well he s always worn his jewishness proudly , he said in fact , back in 2009 , ian kinsler , the texas rangers second basemen , who has a jewish father and , like braun , embraces the jewish part of his identity , said that youkilis was always mindful of their shared heritage when they crossed paths on the field he 'll just say , happy , ' or something like that , kinsler told bloomberg news at the time he s pretty into it in new york , plenty of other people will now be , too
this 144th running of the belmont stakes was supposed to be about history , about a gritty colt named i ll have another and his determined assault on a feat achieved by only 11 horses but the colt s triple crown quest blew up on friday when a sore tendon derailed the kentucky derby and preakness champion and his connections decided i ll have another would not have another chance to run ever again instead , the belmont stakes was merely a horse race a good enough one for more than a crowd of 85 , 811 , largely new yorkers , many of them in fedoras and madras jackets and blowing cigar smoke they returned this grand old racetrack on long island to its sepia heyday , when horse racing did not need government intervention and a sunny afternoon treading to the betting windows was just swell the giveaway that this was a new york crowd , however , was the polite but reserved reception it gave i ll have another when a madefortelevision sendoff was staged for him in belmont s winner s circle the crowd understood that he had been scratched for his own health , but after all , the whole country had been geared up to see if he would pass the test of the champion , as the belmont is known after i ll have another returned to his barn and his trainer , doug o neill , to his seats , the stage belonged to the 11 horses that were left to try to endure belmont s mileandahalf marathon the race is not for the faint of heart human or horse and there was a suspicion that one of the cofavorites , union rags , boasted better press clippings than speed figures he had been the favorite in the florida derby as well as the kentucky derby and had lost in both when his jockey , julien leparoux , got him stuck in traffic bad rides or troubleprone colt was the debate among horseplayers union rags s trainer , michael matz , knew his colt needed a change on the day before the kentucky derby , matz believed in his heart that union rags was going to be the horse here on saturday trying to sweep the triple crown on the day after the derby , matz believed in his heart that union rags s seventhplace finish at churchill downs was not indicative of his talent so leparoux was fired and john velazquez was hired it was a nobrainer johnny v , as velazquez is known , was recently named to racing s hall of fame , and he knows the shortcuts and traps of his home track , belmont park , the way stevie wonder knows a keyboard when he arrived in the paddock saturday , velazquez did not even let matz open his mouth to offer instructions break good , get in a rhythm and go from there , velazquez said in the derby , none of that happened when the gates popped on the belmont , union rags squirted out in stride like a 4yearold too zealously squeezing toothpaste from a tube velazquez tucked union rags along the rail as mike smith gunned paynter to the lead , much as he had another bob bafferttrained horse , bodemeister , in the two previous legs of the triple crown matz , a man given to tight smiles , let the corners of his mouth twitch as he watched velazquez lope union rags down that neverending backstretch as paynter beat back two pretenders , optimizer and unstoppable u long before velazquez skimmed union rags around the far turn , his boots inches from taking rail scuffs , matz understood he was watching something special a brilliant ride , matz said afterward , a rare grin finding its way ear to ear in truth , it was just starting to get good smith and paynter led into the stretch and then some on the outside , leparoux , aboard a 201 long shot named atigun , was angling at smith with a big run he made a nice move , leparoux said of atigun i thought i had a good chance to win smith switched to a lefthand whip , and paynter shuffled to his right , away from the rail it was a mistake that smith acknowledged after the race that a hall of famer like him should not have made , but it was the opening velazquez was awaiting union rags powered through a hint of daylight , and suddenly , it was blue skies and the finish line ahead he shouldn t have gotten through on me , smith said velazquez s colt got a long , elegant neck in front of paynter and stayed there i got lucky , velazquez said the horse did all the work really , velazquez and union rags got good good enough that they might have beaten a healthy i ll have another and upended a triple crown bid for the 12th time since affirmed was the last to earn his place among the sport s immortals 34 years ago \? no one will ever know instead of o neill answering questions about the drug violations incurred by his horses or the 45day suspension that awaits him , the winner s circle was host to phyllis wyeth , an oldschool horse breeder , who was ebullient aboard her motorized scooter she rarely keeps horses to race and sold union rags for 145 , 000 at the 2010 fasigtipton yearling sale , but it did not make her happy there was something inspirational about the colt , and she had been haunted by dreams troubling enough to buy back union rags , a son of dixie union and her mare tempo , for 390 , 000 several months later now union rags had just won the third leg of the triple crown , covering the mile and a half in 2 minutes 3042 seconds and earning wyeth a 600 , 000 firstplace check and his backers 750 for a 2 bet what mattered most now was that union rags had rewarded wyeth s faith in him and showed he was not faint of heart at all it was my dream and he made it come true , she said it was not history , but for horsemen and horse enthusiasts alike , it was a pretty good day at the track
even audiences familiar with yasmina reza s comedy god of carnage , and the way it reduces its four adult characters to squabbling children over the course of roughly 90 minutes , might raise an eyebrow at a production of the play that will open in boston next month when this god of carnage is performed at the bulger performing arts center by the boston teen acting troupe , it will star four teenagers , whose only reallife experience with parental discipline comes from being on the receiving end of it we re doing shows people wouldn t expect to see teens in , jack serio , the acting troupe s 16yearold artistic director , said when i told people i was doing this , people would roll their eyes you re doing that \? but the hilarity in this show , we don t want it to come from , it s funny seeing your son up there , acting like an adult the funny of the show is , the adults can see themselves in it god of carnage , which chronicles a raucous , violent and vomitfilled evening in the life of two pairs of parents trying to negotiate a truce between their misbehaving children , won the tony award for best play in 2009 for a broadway production that starred james gandolfini , jeff daniels , hope davis and marcia gay harden , who also won the tony for lead actress in a play a film adaptation , carnage , directed by roman polanski and starring jodie foster , john c reilly , christoph waltz and kate winslet , was released last year brendan caulfield , a 16yearold high school junior who will perform the role of alan , the cellphone abusing father , in god of carnage , said he did not know the play or the movie when he went in for an impromptu audition in march i had never seen god of carnage , i had never heard about it , mr caulfield said actually , i went to the wikipedia page to read up on it but since he has become familiar with the text and spent time working with his costars minhy tran , 18 kyle jackson , 18 and abby ryan , 17 mr caulfield said he has gained a new appreciation for the play , which the troupe will perform from may 23 through 26 i thought it was going to be difficult , because you re playing these characters who are much older than high school students , he said they ve gone through so much more because they re married with kids and none of us have ever had those experiences it s a lot of observation , i guess , of other people who are like the characters mr caulfield added it s probably the most difficult show i ve ever been in , because you re onstage the entire time there s only four people , so you can guess you re going to get a lot of the lines you have to be in the zone , 100 percent of the time that s the hardest part mr caulfield said his parents were supportive of his work in god of carnage , and occasionally supply him with inspiration for his performance whenever the rare quarrel comes up in my house , i always keep one ear open , he said
stuart r schram was a minnesotan who made his way to paris , an army nuclear physicist who became an expert in french political history , and a mind wide awake in a world remade by war and its cold aftermath by the late 1950s , having already worked on the , published scholarly works in french and german , and taught himself russian and japanese , he turned his considerable intellect to a divisive and mysterious subject far across the globe and accessible to the west almost solely through written works and transcripts  it was an ambitious and rewarding move over the next 50 years , mr schram , who died on july 8 in france at 88 , completed a seminal biography of mao just before the disasters of the cultural revolution , and spent much of the rest of his life translating into english exhaustive volumes of mao s words , in the process shedding critical light on a rapidly changing china to other china scholars , mr schram provided cleareyed analysis of mao at a time when many people were eager to reduce him to either an evil dictator or a visionary hero mr schram s works , they say , are touchstones in the study of how mao adapted marxism for consumption by one of the world s oldest cultures he struck a middle ground between cold war anticommunism and armchair revolutionary paeans and praise , said timothy cheek , a china historian at the university of british columbia he had this monster textual capacity where you just had read more than anyone else and on any given question you can cite a bunch of stuff mr schram was working at the institut d' tudes politiques de paris , or sciences po , when he began learning chinese he soon became an authority on china and mao by using the principal source available the written record he completed the political thought of mao tsetung in 1963 three years later , he produced the biography mao tsetung now you can go to the grass roots and talk to real chinese , said roderick macfarquhar , an expert on china at harvard who knew mr schram in those days , none of us could get into china you could n't talk to people in china , but what you could do was try to analyze what the leaders were thinking and doing rendering a level assessment was not made any easier by mccarthyism and the volatile politics of postwar america several former colleagues suggested that mr schram found more freedom to work in europe , where he would not be suspected of being an apologist for communism lord wilson of tillyorn , the penultimate governor of hong kong before britain ceded control and a former colleague of mr schram s , noted in an interview that china quarterly , which was edited at different times by lord wilson and mr macfarquhar \( mr schram was on the board \) , was founded in london even though much of the best work on china was being done by americans , often underwritten by philanthropies like the ford foundation it made more sense to establish a journal that was trying to be totally objective in britain than in the united states , lord wilson said mr cheek said mr schram s earliest works still stand up to scrutiny the questions he was addressing were not the questions readers come to today , he said the difference is time and place people were not worried about the taliban or global financial collapse or would china take over the world in the 1960s , people were trying to explain , how the heck did the communists win and chiang kaishek fail \? even as mr schram delved into mao s early failures he suggested that he agreed with estimates that nearly 40 million people died from starvation resulting from mao s of 1958 he was surprised by the damage done by mao s 196676 cultural revolution , colleagues said stuart had noted over the years that mao was very proud of chinese history , mr macfarquhar said he was surprised mao was willing to countenance this kind of destruction mr schram enjoyed applying his research skills to french wine and food and sometimes read a book a day , including detective novels , said his wife , marieannick schram he eventually traveled to china every year and was in beijing during the protests in tiananmen square i think he had very mixed feelings about mao , ms schram said i would not use the word admiration , but of course he was very intrigued in the late 1980s , mr macfarquhar enlisted mr schram to translate and edit a comprehensive 10volume series of known mao writings and speeches from before mao took control of china in 1949 seven volumes in the series , mao s road to power , have been published and three more are essentially complete , said mr cheek , who worked on the eighth volume it leaves us something that will endure when another generation s questions change , mr cheek said of the series stuart reynolds schram was born in excelsior , minn , on feb 27 , 1924 , the son of a dentist and the grandson of a railroad engineer he received an undergraduate degree in physics in less than three years from the university of minnesota and was drafted into the army , where he worked in chicago on developing an atomic bomb as part of the manhattan project he received his doctorate from columbia in the political behavior of french protestants , completing his research in france he also spent time in japan having worked on the bomb , he wanted to study more of human beings , ms schram said in 1967 , he took a position at the university of london s school of oriental and african studies , where he was the first director of the contemporary china institute the schrams began splitting their time between the brittany region of france and cambridge , mass , after mr schram began work on mao s road to power mr schram died of complications from a stroke , his wife said a son , arthur , also survives him in 2003 , harvard held a conference honoring mr schram called mao reevaluated at the conference , mr schram criticized mao but also explained why he thought many historians do not place mao in the same global rogue s gallery as stalin , hitler and pol pot in many ways his political instincts were sound , mr schram said he tried to invest in the chinese people but in his personal feelings he was emotional , wrongheaded and hysterical , and these qualities increasingly took over in the 1950s but despite enormous blunders and crimes , he was a great leader who was trying to do the best for china i think he 'll be remembered for that
there will be no ricky rubio until midwinter after he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury last march kevin love is out for six to eight weeks after breaking his right hand during a routine home workout but a funny thing happened on the way to tempered expectations for the minnesota timberwolves thanks to a combination of veteran leadership , smart coaching , and a little bit of scheduling fortune , the wolves have managed a 31 record to start the season more impressive still , rick adelman s squad has succeeded without any eyebrowraising individual stats the everimproving center nikola pekovic leads the way in scoring at a pedestrian 14 points per game and the veteran pickups andrei kirilinko and brandon roy top the team in rebounds \( kirilinko , 70 \) and assists \( roy , 55 \) meanwhile , a cadre of young talent including the secondyear forward derrick williams , the swingman chase budinger \( acquired in a trade with houston over the summer \) , and the russian rookie alexey shved is looking to make the most of playing time opportunities in love and rubio s absence with six players currently averaging more than 9 points per game , the timberwolves have relied on an offense predicated on patience , good passing and perhaps most important an impressive offensive rebounding rate of 330 , good for third in the league \( the team ranks second in overall rebounding rate at 540 \) even the team s defense , which finished 20th in efficiency last season , has been solid , ranking fifth through wednesday night granted , all three wins and perhaps the biggest reason for the team s defensive success to date came against teams \( the nets , sacramento and orlando \) either struggling with new rosters or lotterybound , and none of which currently reside in the top half offensively still , the confidence instilled by an early winning streak cannot be discounted nor can the unlikely reemergence of kirilenko and roy , both of whose paths back to the nba have been reason for celebration after a long and successful stint with the utah jazz , kirilenko weathered last season s lockoutshortened season in his native russia , where he played for national powerhouse cska moscow in july , kirilenko , a forward , signed a twoyear deal worth close to 20 million to play in minnesota , helping bolster a lovepekovic front line already seen as one of the league s most promising so far , kirilenko is living up to the contract hype , averaging 125 points \( on an impressive 67 percent shooting \) , 7 rebounds , 35 assists \) and a per of 167 then there s roy , a sweetshooting guard who for half a decade had made his name as the undisputed cornerstone of the portland trailblazers , and was one of the most formidable oneonone scorers in the league but what once seemed like a surefire hall of fame career was soon slowed by a rare degenerative knee condition , as 40plus minute outings gave way to carefully considered stints off the bench following the 2010 season after a yearlong retirement , roy signed with the timberwolves in july roy s days as an instantoffense weapon may be behind him , but his multidimensional savvy is of significant value to the wolves make no mistake about it love and rubio remain the franchise s two indispensable players , at least in the long term for now , however , adelman can at least take solace in a pair of veterans capable of keeping the ship on a steady course jim cavan is a contributing writer at a member of the espn network you can find him on twitter \( jpcavan \) a previous version of this post incorrectly stated that minnesota s victories came over toronto , sacramento and orlando the timberwolves lost to toronto , but beat new jersey
perhaps you have a new year s day of your own a day when it suddenly feels as though you 've truly left the old year behind it may be the day you no longer have to think twice when putting the date on a check , if you still write checks , that is perhaps your new year started the moment the days began lengthening just before christmas or perhaps you hold off for the vernal equinox \( march 20 in 2012 \) , when new year used to be celebrated and when , in many places , you can feel the newness of the year about to burst out of the ground but the calendar insists that this is the start of the public new year , and so we adjust our feelings to suit , whether we stayed up late to watch the revelers in times square or went to bed early knowing the year would come in on its own there is an undeniable excitement to this day on what other day in the calendar do you feel as though you 've been handed a large lump of time , to be shaped as you see fit \? when else do you feel time s door closing so solidly behind you as you step out into the new world \? we are like children on a bright winter s day , all sent out to play with no demands or excuses to stay behind you may be a maker of resolutions even a keeper of them or you may have resolved to make none at all this year it makes no difference a resolution , after all , is just a plan to take change by the throat , when we all know that that is what change does to us , whether we like it or not there is simply no telling what this new year will bring , and that is the very thing that makes it so new
slate is out with two pieces today on an attentiongetting new study that looks at adult outcomes for children raised by parents in samesex relationships one by the study s author , the university of texas sociologist mark regnerus \( who coauthored the excellent survey premarital sex in america \) , and a response by will saletan that tries to tease out some of the study s implications for the gay marriage debate the background to the study is the striking fact that even as traditional marriage has declined in the united states marriage rates tumbling , outofwedlock childbirth climbing , and cohabitation becoming as respectable as wedlock the evidence has mounted for the institution s importance to the wellbeing of children a happy childhood is possible in many different environments , of course but a growing body of research indicates that no other parental arrangement , from single motherhood to cohabitation to shared custody , affords as many social , economic and emotional advantages as being raised by two biological parents joined in a lifelong commitment \( isabel sawhill from the brookings institution and kay hymowitz from the manhattan institute have both had good recent pieces elaborating on some of these themes \) as the cause of samesex marriage has advanced , however , a number of studies have suggested that gay parenting may be an exception to this rule , and that the outcomes of children raised by homosexual couples may be identical to children raised by married biological parents identical , or even better one highprofile recent study marshaled evidence that children of lesbian households , in particular , may have advantages over the children of straight couples many of these studies , though , compared relatively small and selfselected samples of gay couples to a larger range of heterosexuals many relied on the parents own assessments of their children s wellbeing few followed the children into adulthood \( another justpublished paper surveys some of the limits of the prior research \) this is where regnerus s study comes in it s more comprehensive than many of its predecessors , drawing on a large survey of americans between the ages of 1839 and comparing young adults who reported having a parent in a samesex relationship to young adults who grew up in other family structures \( married , singleparent , stepparents , etc \) for this population , regnerus s findings basically confirm the twoparent biological family s advantages across a range of variables , from mental health to material prosperity , intact heterosexual households showed different and generally better longterm outcomes for children than other family structures gay parents included \( these differences were actually larger with lesbian mothers than with gay fathers , though this may reflect the fact that children with dads in gay relationships were less likely to be living with them \) the same patterns held , too , when the study controlled for particular challenges facing children from samesex households , like whether they faced bullying and lived in a more conservative part of the country children do not need a married mother and father to turn out well as adults , regnerus cautions but neither does there appear to be a gay and lesbian exception to the general pattern that children appear most apt to succeed well as adults when they spend their entire childhood with their married mother and father or at least , there wasn t such an exception in the recent past because it focuses on adult outcomes , regnerus s study is necessarily a look backward no matter where they lived or how they were treated by their peers , many of his subjects came of age when homosexuality was still marginalized and despised and gay marriage barely on the radar screen the majority were born to malefemale couples in which one partner later came out as gay \( adding an extra layer of complexity and heartbreak \) , rather than being planned via adoption , sperm donation or in vitro fertilization almost none were raised in a single samesex household for their entire childhood today the models of gay parenting have presumably shifted , the stability of gay households has presumably increased , and the outcomes for children may be shifting as well for the purposes of the gay marriage debate , then , any past disadvantages associated with being raised in samesex households could easily be cited as evidence for why gay couples need full marriage rights now the better to guarantee their children , existing or potential , the stability and continuity the institution provides if a similar study a generation hence shows significant convergence between children raised in married samesex households and children in intact biological families , it would vindicate one part of the case for samesex marriage this is basically the argument that saletan makes in his remarks what the study shows , then , is that kids from broken homes headed by gay people develop the same problems as kids from broken homes headed by straight people but that finding isn t meaningless it tells us something important we need fewer broken homes among gays , just as we do among straights we need to study regnerus sample and fix the mistakes we made 20 or 40 years ago no more sham heterosexual marriages no more postparenthood selfdiscoveries no more deceptions no more affairs and no more polarization between homosexuality and marriage gay parents owe their kids the same stability as straight parents that means less talk about marriage as a right , and more about marriage as an expectation to the extent that regnerus s findings make a case for skepticism about gay marriage , on the other hand , it s mostly a case for federalism and patience samesex marriage is a social experiment , and like most experiments it will take time to understand its consequences we don t know how relationship norms and expectations will evolve in the gay community where the ongoing dan savagestyle debates about monogamy and fidelity will lead , for instance , or how closely samesex marriage will be associated with childrearing we don t know how plausible saletan s vision of wedlock and parenting running on parallel tracks for gays and straights really is and the nearuniversal liberal optimism on the subject notwithstanding , we don t really know how straight culture will be influenced on the long run by the final , formal severing of marriage from procreation if gay marriage gains ground on its current trajectory state by state , steadily but still somewhat gradually , driven mostly by generational change then there will be time to watch these trends and debate their implications but if the supreme court \( that is , anthony kennedy \) simple nationalizes gay marriage , there will be no room for debate and no chance for any reconsiderations if gay marriage is simply a basic natural right , of course the formal legal expression of our right to love as we wish it shouldn t be up for reconsideration under any circumstances this is a widespread view of wedlock , and it may already be the dominant one but regnerus s study is a reminder of why marriage has traditionally been regarded as something other than just a celebration of love and a signifier of civic equality , and why the rationale for the institution has involved a child s rights to his or her biological parents as well as in two lovers rights to one another marriage s purpose , in this sense , has not been just to validate the consenting adults who enter into it , but to provide support and recognition for a particular way of bearing and rearing children one whose distinctive advantages remain apparent , even as that recognition declines and disappears
retirement looked like the furthest thing from andy roddick s mind on friday night as the former no 1 dismissed the tricky bernard tomic in just under 90 minutes it was a dominant performance , with roddick wisely crashing the net to force the young australian out of his game of dinks , dunks , ducks and slices expect more of the same today against fabio fognini  the italian hasn t played exceptionally well to this point , going five sets to beat journeyman edouard rogervasselin in the first round and beating guillermo garcialopez in straight sets in the second fognini s counterpunching , backcourt game was honed on red clay , where he has had the most success as a pro he was a quarterfinalist at roland garros in 2011 , and has made the third round there twice fognini has nice ground strokes and a solid serve but like many claycourt players , he rarely takes advantage of his opponents subpar balls by pressing forward or taking the net roddick the teenager might have had trouble with a guy like fognini but roddick the 30yearold has a bigger serve , a bigger forehand , and is better at the net and just as consistent oh , and he ll have the crowd on ashe ready to do anything short of grabbing a racket to help roddick win in other words , it would be a monumental achievement for fognini to capture even a set roddick isn t done here quite yet laura robson vs samantha stosur on the women s side , robson may be the story of the tournament to this point , having ousted two grand slam champions in kim clijsters and li na can robson make it three \? maybe stosur , the defending champion , has looked terrific to this point , cruising through three rounds without losing a set but none of her wins was against a player as good as robson has beaten only varvara lepchenko , who was able to take the first set to a tiebreaker against stosur , was ranked in the top 50 i m not quite ready to call the upset here , but if the 18yearold robson continues to play the way she has , this will be the toughest test yet for stosur , who has had a history of flunking in spots like this philipp kohlschreiber vs john isner isner can struggle at times against baseline marksmen like kohlschreiber we saw a hint of that on friday when the topranked american dropped the second set to the veteran jarkko nieminen before winning in four kohlschreiber is a much tougher out than the finnish veteran , and has taken isner the distance in all three of their previous meetings , including a close threesetter in toronto earlier this month the german is a tough competitor who won t be intimidated by isner s serve , power or by the crowd , which will be solidly in the american s corner if isner can shortcircuit kohlschreiber s baseline game by serving well and blanketing the net , he will win if kohlschreiber returns well , passes isner consistently and keeps the big man on the run , he will win this should be one of the better matchups of the day marion bartoli vs petra kvitova kvitova , the no 5 seed and 2011 wimbledon champion , has moved into the fourth round almost unnoticed she s had good wins against pauline parmentier , polona hercog and alize cornet without dropping a set her route gets a lot tougher against bartoli , who has had only a slightly harder time in her first three matches this pairing will feature plenty of power from the baseline , with kvitova s superior serve making the difference richard gasquet vs steve johnson johnson played a smart , steady match friday to beat the always unpredictable ernests gulbis in four sets the twotime ncaa champ now faces a tougher opponent in gasquet , the no 13 seed johnson has the game to win this match , but gasquet is playing extremely well , having beaten the 2010 ncaa champion bradley klahn easily on friday if johnson can get ahead early , this could get interesting other matches of note  maria sharapova vs nadia petrova both of these women hit the ball one way hard it s just that sharapova s brand of bang , boom baseline tennis is bigger in just about every way petrova , the veteran , scored a small upset against the no 15 seed , lucie safarova , on friday , but her run ends here under a barrage of sharapova bombs  janko tipsarevic vs grega zemlja zemlja is a nice baseline player , who with this match becomes the first slovenian male player to reach the third round of the open he will not be the first to reach the fourth round , however tipsarevic , the no 8 seed , has too much game  lleyton hewitt vs david ferrer if you are a fan of long backcourt rallies , this is the match for you hewitt has played well here , but there are a lot of miles on those tires , especially after his grueling fivesetter on friday against gilles muller hard to see this going his way  victoria azarenka vs anna tatishvili the young georgian , tatishvili , is a player on the rise , and has done well to make the fourth round here in by far her best grand slam performance azarenka , the world no 1 and top seed , is her better in every phase of the game , however this could be over quickly  alexandr dolgopolov vs stanislas wawrinka here s your pick em match of the day two guys with similar games who are very evenly matched get a comfortable seat because this could go five  julien benneteau vs novak djokovic benneteau , the no 31 seed , plays a similar game to djokovic , just not anywhere near his level getting a set here would be an accomplishment for the frenchman
indianapolis unlike a small number of boisterous giants , rode the high road to championship heaven , officially making it a habit of besting tom brady and the in the no brag , just fact manning set a super bowl record by completing his first nine passes brady bettered him with a record 16 straight but manning had the ball late in the fourth quarter and that , brady knew , was going to be trouble eli s had a great season , brady would say , softly , disconsolately , referring to the seven fourthquarter comebacks engineered by manning , including the biggest of all sunday night at lucas oil stadium he made some great plays in the fourth quarter manning to mario manningham was the one to remember in super bowl xlvi , down the left sideline , into double coverage manningham somehow managed to make a magnificent catch and stay inbounds and the 38yard connection was part of manning s masterpiece , 88 yards in nine of a title winning drive , a 2117 victory and the giants' second title in four years it was tough to get into the end zone , manning said , failing to acknowledge the paradox of new england having let ahmad bradshaw score from 6 yards to leave brady 57 seconds to come up short , just as he did in arizona four years past all manning knew was that the giants survived brady s heave to the end zone while he tried to push away the memory of his own desperation pass caught by hakeem nicks last month in green bay it all happened , just the way a handful of giants had predicted , though none of the boasts came from manning , or his coach , and there is a difference when the talking is done by the most recognizable faces of an nfl team as opposed to a comparatively anonymous lineman or a cocky defensive back here in indianapolis , coughlin and manning stayed true to themselves , close to the vest , tied to each other , a tandem in weeklong tedium both have loosened up considerably over the years , growing more comfortable in the pressurized environment and deservedly secure with their burgeoning standing in giants' history , all the while dismissing most talk that reflected on them this is n't about one person , manning said , at the podium reserved for the game s most valuable player , another reprise from 2008 but you could not help but count the trimmings for quarterback and coach once mocked as too meek , manning , 31 , now trails the great brady in super bowl titles , 32 coughlin has equaled bill parcells with two apiece as giants coaches , and both will likely end up together some day in the hall of fame with his second ring , manning became his family s leader , doubling the total of peyton , who took some heat here last week for pursuing his developing feud with the hometown colts when it was supposed to be his brother s time but if you believed eli was bothered by that , you were not paying attention for the last eight years the e in eli does not stand for excess he is derek jeter in shoulder pads better than most , he understood that nothing really happens at the super bowl until kickoff , and that while there may have been a stage there was no actual show until the yakking was over through the years , manning s personality has been scrutinized as much as his quarterbacking skills , and often with the contention that his awshucks demeanor would inevitably flatten his growth curve i think people expected eli to be like peyton , to be this fiery guy , and he just was n't , said david carr , his backup but in a way they demand the same things out of their teammates they just go about it in a different way and now people appreciate that even keel they think his personality has actually been his best attribute , especially this last half of the season because he never rode the roller coaster with everyone else there is even a possibility that coughlin has learned how to better control himself by experiencing manning s extraordinary restraint in the heat of the moment the old curmudgeon is always lurking inside , trying to escape like houdini , but you could hear the respect in coughlin s voice when he talked about manning s calm in the clutch he s the mvp both times and he should be for that last drive , coughlin said he really has put the team on his shoulders the whole year manning began the season by saying not boasting that he considered himself to be an elite quarterback by sunday night , the snickers had long faded and no one would argue that as he stood with coughlin as super bowl champions , conquerors of brady and reigning nfl genius , bill belichick yes , it could have gone the other way under the roof at lucas oil the giants put a couple of ball on the ground in the fourth quarter and would have been finished had the patriots recovered brady and wes welker could not connect when the slippery receiver was wide open deep in giants' territory on secondand11 from the giants' 44 the patriots punted two plays later manning had the ball with 3 minutes 46 seconds left it was his ball , his time , in peyton s house while brady watched helplessly from the sideline , while the football world settled in for another breathtaking finish , there was no upstaging him now
indian wells , calif the market for a 34yearold outfielder coming off the worst season of his career with a history of injuries is unlikely to be bountiful what exactly does the future hold for jason bay \? the one benefit of bay s surprise separation from the mets on wednesday is that he s likely to be had at a bargainbasement price with the mets paying him a sizable amount this season , bay can take whatever offer he prefers , even if that offer is only for the league minimum , which is probably the type of offer he s going to get a quick poll of several team executives at the general managers meetings revealed that while most teams won t immediately close the door on signing bay , none of them were eager to express any interest one executive of a national league team who considered trading for bay as a buylow option prior to last season said his team will likely pass on obtaining bay this offseason the executive said that too many questions exist about bay s health i haven t even looked at the medicals , said dan duquette , the orioles general manager , who last year gambled on such reclamation projects as nate mcclouth and lew ford , and has a clear need for a left fielder bay lives in seattle , his wife s hometown , and he has expressed interest in playing for the mariners seattle is always looking to provide pop for an offense that last year that ranked fourth worst in the majors in runs aside from the injuryprone franklin gutierrez , the mariners have no other established major league outfielders it s too early to consider , said jack zduriencik , the mariners general manager perhaps a feelgood reunion with the pirates might be in order bay had the best seasons of his career with the pirates from 200308 he was an allstar with pittsburgh in 200506 the challenge for us is that because we have got a group of good young outfielders that we feel good about , how much production would we get if we thought he would be more productive \? neal huntington , the pirates general manager , said of bay huntington said the team would need to have several more discussions about their own outfielders to even consider a freeagent option such as bay bay s agent , joe urbon , said he has yet to reach out to teams , and he would not specify whether bay was looking for a team where he would be a starter or whether he would want to join a winning team as a parttime player in the end , bay might not have a choice
it remains one of the most iconic images of the heat of battle in 20thcentury thoroughbred racing the spectacular headon view of the stretch duel between ridan and greek money in the 1962 preakness stakes was captured almost by accident 50 years ago , on a scorching hot may afternoon by joseph a dipaola jr , a longtime photographer for the baltimore sun dipaola caught the very instant when a popular , 24yearold panamanian rider , manuel ycaza , the jockey on ridan , attempted to interrupt the forward momentum of the 27yearold john rotz aboard greek money just strides before the horses crossed the finish line in the 88th preakness dipaola , who worked for nearly 50 years as a news photographer for the sun , wanted to find a different angle from the usual finish line perspective he took his camera another 30 to 40 feet farther down the stretch at pimlico and aimed it back toward the action the image dipaola s lens revealed that day was a shocking moment that remains one of the most memorable shots in american thoroughbred racing photography it was the extraordinary , awardwinning frame that captured ycaza s wild maneuver aboard ridan at the culmination of the two colts legendary stretch duel that defined the running of the 88th preakness for posterity greek money , a sturdy chestnut colt bred and owned by the brandywine stable of donald ross , then the president of delaware park racetrack in nearby wilmington , already had logged a staggering 19 starts during his young life but the trainer virgil raines a stalwart of the midatlantic racing circuit in maryland , delaware and new jersey known as buddy opted to have greek money forego the kentucky derby in favor of the preakness , just as the great man o war had passed on the temptations of bluegrass and red roses in kentucky in favor of the slightly shorter run for the blackeyed susans in maryland back in 1920 raines shipped greek money directly to pimlico two weeks before the preakness the colt , a homebred son of greek song , was the only horse of the 11 preakness starters that already had successfully contested a race over the track the preakness prep , an allowance race run at oneandonesixteenth miles at pimlico a week before the preakness raines also secured the services of the central illinoisborn rotz , a capable rider who traveled to baltimore from his new york base to ride greek money for the first time in the prep with only three horses entered for a 5 , 000 purse , the prep was a nonwagering exhibition , but it proved the perfect tightener for greek money he won the race easily over smart and princegret , whose trainers subsequently opted not to enter them in the preakness the next saturday in an era when racing the following week was relatively common , the colt was considered a relatively fresh horse in the preakness field , but he went off as the third choice in the face of stiff competition from the upset derby winner decidedly , the runnerup roman line and the thirdplace derby favorite , ridan , along with jaipur , the betting favorite in the preakness jaipur had won the gotham stakes , an important derby prep race , but also skipped the trip to kentucky , instead winning the withers stakes at a mile at aqueduct on may 12 rotz commented later that his initial trip to baltimore was worthwhile because it enabled him to learn before the preakness a few things about the horse he had previously never ridden in a sports illustrated magazine profile of rotz by whitney tower in 1964 , the jockey recalled that he would never forget the simple instructions raines gave him before the preakness buddy said to me , johnny , go out and ride him as if you owned him that was all covering the mile and threesixteenths of the preakness in a modest 1 562 , greek money broke well from the no 10 post and quickly was hustled toward the early leaders approaching the clubhouse turn , the colt carved out a stalking position in fifth , trailing just behind the frontrunners jaipur , sunrise county , ridan and roman line who entered the turn as a fourwide phalanx as the field rounded the first turn , the leaders battled for control with jaipur and his jockey , robert ussery , holding a narrow lead over sunrise county barreling along the backstretch , ridan slipped through on the rail to challenge jaipur sunrise county carried on in third as roman line tracked just off the leaders in fourth rotz had greek money tucked in just behind the front four , staying in the hunt and saving precious ground while the frontrunners continued fourwide as the field entered the far turn , ridan and ycaza held the lead , while jaipur and sunrise county began to waver from their exertions rotz and greek money doggedly remained nearby along the rail with energy in reserve as the field approached the top of the stretch , rotz guided greek money toward an opening that suddenly appeared along the rail when ycaza mysteriously allowed ridan to drift out around the turn from there , their twohorse duel was on ridan and greek money left the rest of the 11horse preakness field behind as they battled almost strideforstride , heads bobbing , through the homestretch control of the lead changed between them at least twice as the two colts ran headtohead greek money poked his nose in front only to have ycaza feverishly urge ridan back into the lead at the eighth pole , but greek money was nothing if not tenacious as rotz nudged the chestnut to surge ahead again throughout their duel , the two horses were almost inseparable as they careened through the lane , bumping against each other repeatedly like gladiators then , in the heat of the final few yards of the contest , ycaza suddenly took their relentless charge to the wire to another plane entirely as the headon film of their stretch duel later revealed , ycaza leaned precariously over ridan s left shoulder with his left elbow extended rigidly out to the side , aiming directly into the path of rotz s upper torso as the horses approached the finish line intently focused on pressing his horse s head forward toward the wire , rotz barely had time to notice ycaza s acrobatics as he thrust his arms directly up greek money s neck in harmony with the horse s stride , giving one final , forward push as the horses hit the wire it was rotz s concentration and his lastditch effort after a flawless ride for the mile and threesixteenths that culminated in a perfectly timed headbob which , despite ycaza s startling maneuver , secured the victory for greek money by the narrowest of noses given the contentiousness of the stretch run , it was no surprise that the inquiry message soon illuminated the infield tote board , but the question regarding the race s outcome wasn t initiated by either the stewards or by rotz greek money had won the photo finish and with it the blanket of blackeyed susans and the right to have his name inscribed on a replica of the woodlawn vase , the ornate , historic preakness trophy shockingly , the claim of foul was lodged instead by ycaza , who immediately asserted after the finish that greek money had impeded ridan in the stretch greek money s connections were incredulous the patrol films showed otherwise , however , and , while the order of finish was allowed to stand , the photograph that dipaola shot that afternoon provided evidence of the stunning moment of truth of the riders proximity and ycaza s obvious infraction in the stretch ycaza later was suspended by the maryland stewards for 10 days \( the penalty eventually was reduced to five days \) the only surviving member of the winning team from greek money s preakness , rotz , now 77 , recently recalled the race with the characteristic , selfeffacing understatement that earned him the nickname gentleman john at the track people assumed it happened in the preakness , and i thought he was kind of leaning my way , but i told the stewards and i still stand by this i don t think he ever actually made contact with me , rotz said of ycaza by telephone earlier this week from his home in illinois noting the loop in ycaza s left rein as shown in dipaola s photograph , rotz said he believed ridan probably would have won the race if ycaza simply had concentrated on riding his own horse still diplomatic about their close encounter in the pimlico stretch , rotz also allowed that he and ycaza , against whom he rode almost daily for more than a decade at new york s major race tracks , had crossed paths in a few other close finishes over the years , but none was quite as dynamic or well known as their finish in the 88th preakness while ridan was given a rest after the preakness , greek money went on to run in the belmont stakes the colt had nothing left to offer , however , after his long campaign and enervating preakness victory he finished a wellbeaten seventh behind the victorious jaipur the next year he won the excelsior handicap at aqueduct as a 4yearold he eventually retired to stud duty at 5 , where he had limited success trained by leroy jolley , who was 25 , ridan was owned by a partnership that included jolley s father , moody , along with ernest woods and john l greer the colt s rivalry with jaipur was renewed in the travers stakes in august at saratoga their headtohead duel throughout most of the one and onequarter miles is still regarded as one of the most exciting editions of the country s oldest stakes race just as they had lost the preakness to greek money by a nose , ridan and ycaza just missed in the travers , losing to jaipur by the merest whisker ridan returned to win three more races as a 4yearold , but an injury eventually forced his retirement to stud duty , where he , too , had only moderate success as a breeding stallion rotz and ycaza each continued their successful riding careers into the 1970s , and both were eventually inducted into racing s national hall of fame in saratoga springs raines continued to train successfully for 34 more years , retiring in 1996 he died at 91 in aiken , sc , in 2000 highly regarded by horsemen and racing officials , raines was nominated for induction into racing s hall of fame in 2006 he was inducted posthumously into the delaware park wall of fame in 2008 and has been memorialized annually since 1996 with an achievement award presented to an owner and a trainer for exemplary conduct demonstrating professionalism and integrity by monmouth park in new jersey dipaola , whose perfectly timed image of the 1962 preakness stretch duel was cited at the time by life magazine as its picture of the week , died in late april at 91 in timonium , md in an interview in the sun upon his retirement in 1984 , dipaola commented on his illustrious preakness photograph truthfully , i didn t know what i had until i developed it , but then all heck broke loose , didn t it \?
as i noted in my earlier article , rules and conventions about when to use and not to use commas are legion but certain errors keep popping up here are a few of them identification crisis if i ve seen it once , i ve seen it a thousand times i m referring to a student s writing a sentence like i went to see the movie , midnight in paris with my friend , jessie comma after movie , comma after friend and , sometimes , comma after paris as well none are correct unless midnight in paris is the only movie in the world and jessie is the writer s only friend otherwise , the punctuation should be i went to see the movie midnight in paris with my friend jessie if that seems wrong or weird or anything short of clearly right , bear with me a minute and take a look at another correct sentence i went to see woody allen s latest movie , midnight in paris , with my oldest friend , jessie you need a comma after movie because this and only this is mr allen s newest movie in theaters , and before jessie because she and only she is the writer s oldest friend the syntactical situation i m talking about is identifiername the basic idea is that if the name \( in the above example , jessie \) is the only thing in the world described by the identifier \( my oldest friend \) , use a comma before the name \( and after it as well , unless you ve come to the end of the sentence \) if not , don t use any commas grammatically , there are various ways of describing what s going on one helpful set of terms is essential vs nonessential when the identifier makes sense in the sentence by itself , then the name is nonessential and you use a comma before it otherwise , no comma that explains an exception to the onlythingintheworld rule when the words a , an or some , or a number , come before the description or identification of a name , use a comma a bronx plumber , stanley ianella , bought the winning lottery ticket when an identifier describes a unique person or thing and is preceded by the or a possessive , use a comma baseball s home run leader , barry bonds , will be eligible for the hall of fame next year my son , john , is awesome \( if you have just one son \) but withhold the comma if not unique my son john is awesome \( if you have more than one son \) the artist david hockney is a master of color the celebrated british artist david hockney is a master of color and even the gay , bespectacled , celebrated british artist david hockney is a master of color \( why are there commas after gay and bespectacled but not celebrated \?

is it a meaningless suspension for a meaningless game for an infraction that appears in no rule book \? or was the suspension of the shakhtar donetsk striker luiz adriano by uefa on tuesday justified in the interests of gentlemanly play and sportsmanship \? the actions in the match against nordsjaelland of denmark are by now a \) infamous , b \) notorious , c \) unsporting , d \) inspired , e \) all of the previous or f \) none of the previous they have been seen around the world , chewed over and discussed the play is below on tuesday , uefa , the sport s european governing body , banished luiz adriano for shakhtar s final group stage match , a game that means little to the ukrainian team since it has already qualified for the knockout stage from group e the match in donetsk next week against the serie a champion juventus means more to the italian club , which is battling chelsea for second place in the group the uefa control and disciplinary body today decided to suspend luiz adriano for one match , uefa said in a statement on its web site luiz adriano had been charged with violation of the principles of conduct during last week s uefa champions league group e match against fc nordsjaelland in copenhagen luiz adriano scored a goal after his team tried to play the ball back to the danish team s goalkeeper after an injury to a nordsjaelland player it is one of those unwritten laws of the game , generally followed around the world , but often compromised from time to time by overly aggressive \( or simply oblivious \) players shakhtar issued a statement on its web site  though shakhar s coach mircea lucescu initially came to the defense of his player , he later acknowledged a mistake had been made on monday , the team s owner rinat akhmetov said the action was unacceptable , adding i would like to make it clear publicly that everyone associated with our club is deeply disappointed with the incident i have personally spoken to the players about their responsibilities as role models for young fans of shakhtar , and of football as a whole here is another wellknown incident from an english fa cup match in which the ultimate outcome was quite different when arsenal manager ars ne wenger recognized the error in the incident and offered a replay to sheffield united , which was accepted did luiz adriano deserve to be suspended \? should uefa have ordered a replay for a match won 52 by shakhtar \( in which luiz adriano scored two other goals \) \? has the unwritten rule by now passed into broad acceptance or is the notion of sportsmanship less important these days \? other than the arsenal game , can you think of any similar incidents \?
los angeles when the devils were down , three games to none , in the stanley cup finals and their team bus pulled into staples center before game 4 , coach peter deboer saw something that irked him when your bus has to pull by the 10 limos parked on the road for the afterparty , that s definitely a motivation , deboer said sunday after his team arrived here for monday night s game 6 that motivation served the devils well they won game 4 , and game 5 in newark as well that made them the first team since 1945 to rally from 03 down in the stanley cup finals and force a game 6 on monday morning , no limousines were parked along the intersection of chick hearn court and georgia street , where the devils team bus would pass early in the afternoon before arriving at the players entrance instead a crew was erecting bleachers for the x games competitions , which begin in two weeks the limos deboer saw belonged mostly to celebrities attending game 4 last wednesday according to staples center ushers , there was an unusual number of celebrity bandwagonjumpers in addition to kings regulars like will ferrell , alyssa milano and matthew perry one , charlie sheen , stepped out of staples center for a smoke , despite numerous signs warning that reentry was not permitted a female security guard duly denied reentry to sheen , who responded with a profanityspiked tirade such distractions were lost on the devils , whose celebrity support in newark is pretty much limited to springsteen recordings played at the prudential center after victories but distractions were very much on the minds of the kings , who said repeatedly that amid all the hubbub surrounding game 4 and the chance to win the stanley cup at home , they lost their focus and the game , 31 even game 5 had a little different feeling to it , anze kopitar said after the kings morning skate monday , referring to their 21 loss at newark everyone is excited , everyone s got friends and family flying in you try to avoid it you d rather not be running around looking for tickets surely , kopitar was asked , you weren t running around before the game trying to secure tickets \? no , but there are a few requests , and sometimes it overwhelms you , how big an event it is and how everyone wants to be a part of it , he said i just try to tune it out indeed , the sense that the kings were overwhelmed by the expectation that they would win the stanley cup after jumping to their fourth consecutive 30 series lead had come up again and again in the days since that game 4 defeat in addition to kopitar , justin williams , mike richards and dustin brown were among the kings who spoke about ticket requests , texts and phone calls distracting them from the task of finishing off the devils we don t want any distractions , defenseman drew doughty said sunday after the kings arrived from newark i think a lot of us before game 4 were distracted with family members and friends and the cup coming into the building family always comes first for everyone , but at this point in the year , the team has to come first doughty said the kings were thinking of things ahead of time , and on monday morning , coach darryl sutter noted that was probably a function of the team s relative inexperience this team has not been in a playoff environment for more than two or three games , most of these guys , sutter said the mindset has to be , or is , the same thing as when a series starts to try to win the game , not getting further than that to foster the right kind of mindset , the kings had a team meeting and dinner sunday night , according to sutter , whose dry , prairie humor , delivered in a low rumble , has become a highlight of offday and pregame news conferences we did some video and dinner together last night , he said , waiting a beat hockey video sutter s quip was probably not a reference to the adult film actress taylor stevens , who sat behind the devils bench here in games 3 and 4 and tried to offer her own form of distraction in a lowcut tank top the slowmotion video of deboer avoiding eye contact with stevens has been viewed 26 million times on youtube deboer was asked sunday afternoon about stevens s presence behind his bench we won last time she was there i ll buy her a ticket if we can do that again , he said , as reporters laughed
midland , tex one was a union pacific freight train bound for louisiana , a 7 , 200footlong behemoth with 84 cargo cars rumbling through the flat industrial edge of this west texas city the other was a popular annual parade for wounded veterans and their spouses , a leisurely cruise through the dusty streets that moved slowly enough that the participants comfortably sat in chairs on the back of flatbed trucks about 4 30 pm thursday , four days after , the two processions collided , leaving a deadly , chaotic scene at a rail crossing two miles outside downtown midland one dozen veterans who had dodged gunfire and explosives in tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan were killed or injured in the unlikeliest of places , at a socalled show of support parade in a patriotic city known as the hometown of laura bush and the childhood home of her husband , former president george w bush four army and marine veterans were killed , and 16 veterans and civilians were injured , at least one of them critically on friday , there were more questions than answers about what went wrong , and whether mechanical or human error was to blame , as the began an investigation veterans and their spouses had been seated on the open flatbed trailers of two trucks , one driving in front of the other the authorities said that the first truck drove over the railroad crossing at south garfield street and west industrial avenue , but that the second one was traveling over the tracks when the train struck the rear of the vehicle witnesses who were either driving in the parade or watching it on the street said the rail crossing s long gate arms came down on the people seated on the trailer as the truck made its way over the tracks and they described how the train seemed to come from out of nowhere , blaring its horn , they said , only seconds before impact i did not hear the train at all , said one witness , joe cobarobio , 39 , who stood filming the parade i did not hear the horn as it was approaching the intersection i only heard it right about three seconds before it slammed into the back of the tractortrailer at the rail crossing , purple heart soldiers became first responders , tending to the injured , and others , relatives and witnesses said , became heroes once more one of the four who died , joshua michael , 34 , a retired army sergeant who had been wounded by an improvised explosive device in iraq , pushed his wife off the trailer to save her life , relatives said i think she was the only one on the float who was not injured , said mr michael s motherinlaw , mary ruth hefley , 74 he was a hero in this army and a hero in life , in my eyes mr michael worked as a real estate agent and lived in converse , tex , with his wife and two children , ryan , 14 , and maci , 7 he had met his wife , daylyn michael , 34 , when both attended amarillo college he had two purple hearts from service in iraq she said last night the little boy was doing real good , ms hefley said , referring to her daughter and grandson but the little girl just cried that s all she would do , is cry the others killed were gary stouffer , 37 , who served in the marines for 17 years , was wounded in afghanistan and is survived by his wife and two children william lubbers , 43 , who served in the army special forces , had been shot in the arm in afghanistan and lived in fayetteville , nc , with his wife and two children and lawrence boivin , 47 , who received a purple heart while in the army in iraq and leaves a wife , two stepdaughters and a grandson of four people still at midland memorial hospital , one was in critical condition and three were listed as stable , a hospital spokeswoman said one person was transferred to a hospital in lubbock on thursday night in serious condition , and 11 others have been released , she said national transportation safety board officials said investigators had not determined whether the rail crossing s red flashing lights and gate arms were functioning at the time of the accident they also said they had not determined whether , as witnesses reported , the gate arms came down on the middle of the flatbed trailer a spokesman for union pacific , tom lange , said a preliminary investigation by the company found that the lights and gates at the crossing were working at the time of the crash and that the train crew had properly sounded the locomotive horn federal regulations for train crossings require that flashing lights and bells at the gates begin at least 20 seconds before a train passes however , in designated quiet zones , the train engineer does not have to blast the horn but can make that call if it appears to be necessary the crossing in midland was one of those designated quiet zones federal rules require the gate arms to begin to move downward no less than three seconds after the flashing lights begin and to be horizontal at least five seconds before the arrival of the train mark rosekind , an ntsb member , said investigators were collecting a number of video and data recordings of the accident the lead engine , for example , had a forwardfacing video camera known as a track image recorder , and other locomotive units had socalled event recorders collecting data there were 10 collisions at that rail crossing between 1979 and 1997 , but none in the past 15 years , mr rosekind said none of those collisions led to fatalities a likely focus of the investigation will be the train s speed a union pacific spokeswoman said the company changed the speed limit for trains in midland from 40 miles per hour to 70 mph in 2006 she said the company had not had any accidents at that crossing since the speed limit was increased mr rosekind said the train was traveling 62 mph at the time of the accident its emergency braking had been applied before the collision , but it had not been determined precisely when the parade left a downtown hotel on thursday and then turned south onto garfield street , where it crossed the train tracks , escorted by sheriff s and police officials as well as civilian vehicles it was headed for a banquet in the veterans' honor the train was traveling east it had started its journey in los angeles and was headed for shreveport , la the truck that was struck was carrying 26 people in the seats on the flatbed trailer 12 veterans , 12 spouses and 2 civilian escorts robert volker was driving his pickup truck near the front of the parade with his wife , melissa , at his side two trucks carrying the veterans and their wives were behind them mr volker had driven over the railroad crossing when , 15 to 20 seconds later , he heard a loud boom , he said we thought at first it was maybe a blown tire , he said we immediately look back and just see dust after the crash , mr volker said , the veterans went to work we saw a lot of the soldiers from the first float doing what they do , he said controlling the scene , helping their comrades , doing what they 're trained to do
did you know that science can teach you all sorts of amazing things about how the world works and why it works that way and how the dinosaurs probably all had feathers \? did you know that it can also teach you things that you never wanted to know and now notsosecretly wish you did n't \? i am referring to a recent out of the that determined that the women of the grand old party have more feminine faces than those of their female democratic colleagues in conducting the study , researchers analyzed the faces of the house of representatives in the 111th congress based on objective measures of feminine facial structure the faces were then rated according to gendertypical femininity , and shown to undergraduate students , who \( in exchange for course credit \) were asked to judge which political party they thought each face was affiliated with the students guessed correctly with surprising accuracy the resulting data suggested that the more conservative a female politician is , the more likely her face will conform to subtleties that are considered typically feminine the flip side being that more liberal female politicians tend to have less feminine facial structures as in they 're more masculine , i guess as in terrific the researchers call it the michele bachmann effect funny , but that s exactly how i refer to the tingly feeling that overtakes me when i read or hear something so profoundly ridiculous that i briefly consider living the rest of my life in monkish isolation on a mountaintop with only the cold wind for companionship listen , anybody who has ever attended the democratic national convention knows that democratic women prefer flats over heels , by an estimated ratio of 10 to 1 after all , if the sensible shoe fits but this is anecdotal it s the type of research done after three days of being yelled at on the convention floor by people in 10gallon hats , with only a steady diet of coke zero and sunchips to keep you upright you 're punchy who can blame you for slumping on the floor outside a women s washroom and counting people s feet as they go by \? but this ucla study contains measurable scientific data collected by actual professional scientists who have just basically given us the green light to go ahead and judge a book by its cover and though the data offered no evidence as to the relative attractiveness of either party s representatives \( as the facemodeling software controlled for superficial markers like makeup and hairstyles \) , why would that stop anyone from conflating gender typicality with sex appeal \? the answer is ha ha , of course it would n't , but i adore your innocence i ca n't figure out which part of this story is the most unforgivably retro is it the part where the internet is flooded by a tsunami of bickering over which political party has the prettier members of congress and or prettier voters \? followed by smug accusations of sour grapes , actual sour grapes , and finally resentful grumbling by lots of women in comfort clogs , maybe even including me \( it s none of your business but i require them for the back support take it easy , i have a doctor s note \) or is it the part that suggests that a key factor in the electability and , dare i say , presence of a female politician on a national stage can be dependent on something as random as the placement of her eyebrows \? are there really subtle ways in which people would consider a woman suitable for office that are rooted in their visceral reaction to the width and prominence of her cheekbones \? well , probably all i know is that once i finished reading the study i'm pretty sure 1970s burt reynolds reached across the passenger seat of his trans am to give me a wink and a boob honk thankfully , the sex typical phenomenon applies only to female members of congress when it comes to male members of congress , the results of the study are somewhat less conclusive so guys , feel free to go to work on behalf of your constituents without wondering for a second whether psych undergrads around the country are hotly debating whether or not you got hit at birth with an ugly stick do n't you worry your pretty little manheads about it in the end , of course , it s hard to know what the takeaway is for voters what should bother us more that a scholarly journal decided to float this information out into the preelection maelstrom of partisan nastiness or that some people will relish the findings and distribute the study as a voting guide \? perhaps over time the answer and the usefulness of this research will reveal itself but until that comes to pass , perhaps science could take a crack at something i can use right now , like time manipulation , since i ca n't help but yearn for the person i was before reading this study the person not compelled to consider the possibility that her own facial structure could be construed as mannish by a certain light
aurora , colo more than three weeks have passed , but daryl johnson still begins his emergency room shift at the hospital here with a sense of foreboding i walk through that doorway every day and it hits me oh my god , the er s full , is it going to happen again \? mr johnson , a paramedic , said it s always in the back of my mind the events that played out in this denver suburb on july 20 have shifted the course of many lives the victims and their families will never be the same , of course nor will the university of colorado s anschutz medical campus , where james e holmes , 24 , who is charged with killing 12 and wounding 58 at a midnight showing of the new batman movie , was until june a graduate student but for the doctors , nurses and other staff at the hospital which received 23 of the injured , one of them dead on arrival the shootings were not only a trauma but also a test of their skills , their stamina and their teamwork , as the simulated disaster drills they had practiced turned abruptly into reality looking back , many said that having come through the experience , they now felt prepared for anything a violent and unpredictable world might throw at them we went into emergency medicine because we know it s crazy you never know what s going to come through the door , said dr comilla sasson , one of two attending doctors in the emergency room that night but the thing none of us have gotten over is , we made it through we really , truly shined april koehler , the emergency department s nurse manager , said that for days after the shooting , she woke up in the middle of the night with the urgent feeling she had to go out and help someone just as she did when her emergency pager went off at 12 56 am that friday , the message reading simply mass shooting jason kennedy , a paramedic , served in iraq with the first armored division , and little fazes him but he finds himself replaying the images of those hours in his mind the flashing lights of police cruisers bearing the wounded , the screaming and the blood , the hallways filled with bandaged patients lying on stretchers or standing in a daze , baffled survivors of an unexpected battlefield you catch yourself thinking about it for no good reason , mr kennedy said just out of nowhere all 22 patients who arrived at the emergency room for treatment survived everyone who came in with a pulse left with a pulse , said becky davis , the emergency room charge nurse only one , caleb medley , 23 , who was shot in the head and lost an eye , remains in the hospital , in critical but stable condition three other local hospitals received smaller numbers of injured patients from the shootings dr sasson arrived for her shift at 11 pm that thursday filling in for another doctor at the last minute , she had skipped the twohour nap she usually takes before a night shift as her colleague ran through the list of patients , she thought , i can just power through till 8 am avery mackenzie , 28 , remembers that she was focused on increasing my efficiency and being able to clearly communicate my plan to the patients and the other doctors fresh out of medical school , she had begun the first year of her residency only three weeks before and was still getting used to introducing herself as dr mackenzie in the first hour and a half of her shift , she examined a man with , a woman with and another patient with a bloodstream infection it was typical emergency medicine , she said but soon afterward , with the er already full to capacity , news of a shooting began to filter in ms davis , the charge nurse , thought it was probably a gang shooting they had happened before at the theater and she began preparing for one to three new patients , the usual number from such an event but at 12 45 am , she got a call from a police officer at the scene telling her of multiple wounded , and that the victims were being transported by police car mr kennedy , listening to the police scanner , could hear the terror in the voices of the police officers at the scene it basically sounded like absolute chaos , he said it sounded just like a war zone first it was a few injured , then it was 4 , 5 , 6 and then it was 15 and then it was unknown , and crowds of people covered in blood we were like , oh man , what s going on \? ' the first police cruiser screeched into the ambulance bay at 1 06 am , followed closely by others , each bearing two or three victims it was another car , another car , dr sasson recalled we were standing out here literally pulling out bodies and putting them onto stretchers by 1 21 am , 15 minutes later , nine patrol cars and an ambulance had pulled up , discharging 13 patients , many with disastrous injuries i think a lot of us have seen very bad gunshot wounds before , dr sasson said but some of the pictures that i think many of us have stuck in our heads to this day are just some of the most horrible injuries , people with their guts hanging out , people with their brains coming out a storeroom just inside the doors was quickly transformed into a treatment room the two trauma rooms were already full , and stretchers lined the hallways one man sat in the waiting room holding up his bleeding arm i'm ok take care of the other patients first , he told the doctors every 15 minutes , dr sasson and the other emergency room attending doctor , barbara blok , along with other staff made the rounds gunshot wounds are notoriously unpredictable and patients can go from super stable to critical , blood pressures dropping , crashing , , unresponsive , within a couple of minutes , dr sasson said throughout the hospital , people were reacting a command center was set up calls went out to neurosurgeons , chest and vascular specialists , and orthopedic surgeons , who sped in to work , as did more than 100 other staff members , from radiologists to housekeepers nurses came down from the intensive care unit residents hurried to the emergency room from other floors operating rooms were opened up nine operations were carried out over the next hours the hospital s blood bank received 185 units of blood rapidly depleting supplies chest tubes , and sterile operating room towels were replenished at one point dr sasson remembers thinking , i wonder if the shooter is here \? dr gordon lindberg , a surgeon and medical director of the hospital s burn unit , who coordinated surgery through the night and operated on a patient with 18 shotgun holes in the small bowel , said that since the shooting he had often thought how lucky it was that the gunman s semiautomatic rifle jammed shotgun pellets , smaller and traveling at a lower velocity , inflict less damage , he said as good as we were in mobilizing everyone and getting everyone here and opening the operating rooms , he said , if it had been mostly an automatic rifle to people s heads , bellies , vessels , you name it , i do n't see any hospital handling it i really do n't there would have been deaths at 7 am , with 22 patients examined , triaged and treated , dr sasson and her colleagues looked up to see the morning shift trickling in some of the arriving workers had not yet heard the news how was your night \? they asked adrenaline , training and instinct had pulled the er workers through but by the next tuesday , an immense sadness had set in on the spur of the moment , a group of them went upstairs to visit a young woman who had been severely injured they wanted to see that she was alive , to comfort her if they could but the tears that flowed were theirs we walked into the room and all of us just started bawling , dr sasson said and she was the one saying , it s going to be ok'
the creation of army corps during the early winter of 1862 represents one of the greatest , if lesser known , organizational accomplishments of the union army the sheer numbers were staggering by the end of march , the army of the potomac , the premier union military force in the eastern theater , alone had swelled to 120 , 000 men by comparison , the american army that had captured mexico city during the mexican war the nation s last major conflict had numbered only about 14 , 000 soldiers such an immense force required new levels of military organization in an effort to streamline the army of the potomac , president lincoln ordered its 12 divisions , stationed in and around washington , into four corps the first , second , third and fourth the corps as a unit type was already wellunderstood in europe napoleon had grouped his infantry , cavalry and artillery into corps during the early 1800s , greatly increasing the french army s operational mobility these units formed the largest organizational blocks within individual armies , and would serve as the primary means for field commanders to control their forces in the enormous battles that were to come by the end of the civil war the union had created nearly 45 army corps , but none achieved the distinction of the second corps of the army of the potomac during its life span of just over three years , the second corps , which began with about 18 , 000 men , suffered more casualties than any other union command of comparable size it served in such key battles as antietam , fredericksburg , gettysburg , the 1864 overland campaign from the wilderness through cold harbor , and the siege of petersburg its senior commanders the major generals edwin sumner , darius couch , winfield scott hancock and andrew humphreys ranked among the best combat commanders ever fielded by the union army even today it stands as one of the finest american fighting units ever constituted the quality of the second corps was evident at every level , but no more so than in the individual soldiers countless letters and diaries speak to individual soldiers bravery through an unremitting series of brutal battles but also evident is a deep commitment to the union soldiers in the second corps knew that the united states would endure even if the confederacy established itself as an independent political entity , but they believed the freedoms guaranteed white americans by a republican form of government would suffer a fatal blow they were , one wrote , fighting to protect our great and free government and the best government that ever was instituted jonathan stowe , a farm laborer , enlisted in the 15th massachusetts one of the hardestfighting regiments in the second corps during the autumn of 1861 stowe wrote that southerners who took up arms against a freely elected government were not only my country s enemy , but base traitors to humanity and the world he made the ultimate sacrifice one year later , when he was mortally wounded at antietam by the spring of 1864 , lt josiah favill admitted that he and many other soldiers were homesick yet maintaining the union came above all else , and until the work is done this army will never lay down its arms at first glance , not all of the soldiers of the second corps seemed destined to become among the most redoubtable fighters in the union army many of them came from democratic homes and ethnic communities that gave little support to the expansion of federal war aims to include emancipation pvt william smith of the 116th pennsylvania , a largely irish regiment recruited in philadelphia , argued that fighting to free the slaves was a betrayal of why he had gone to war to hell with the niggers , he concluded after the second corps was badly bloodied in the fighting around fredericksburg , va , during late 1862 , a new york private fumed that the loss of life was because of the accursed nigger it is all fudge and i am mad and yet what modernday americans must grasp , amid the harshness of such racial attitudes , is that the soldiers of the second corps saw the fighting through many of these men reenlisted during the winter of 1863 and 1864 , when their threeyear term of service was about to expire that fall , in fact , they overwhelmingly voted for abraham lincoln and the continuation of the war in overwhelming numbers without such resolve , whether the union even would have won the war , let alone destroyed the institution of slavery , remains open to question the emphasis on union continued into the postwar era veterans of the second corps were active in commemorating their wartime sacrifices and accomplishments through the dedication of battlefield monuments , especially at gettysburg the site of ferocious fighting during the summer of 1863 , gettysburg marked a major union battlefield triumph amid the chirp of birds and the sway of the breeze , survivors of the second corps reminded listeners that they had helped to render this field hallowed ground , dear to every lover of liberty and the cause of free constitutional government reflecting the move toward national reconciliation by the late 19th century , veterans of the second corps praised their former grayclad adversaries as americans as brave as ourselves and foemen worthy of our steel africanamericans and their plight in the postwar south rarely intruded upon the good feelings , even as second corps veterans often patted themselves on the back for helping to bring an end to the institution of slavery talk flowed freely about slavery as a foul blot wiped out forever and america as a land where all mankind are free yet the transition of millions of blacks from slavery to freedom simply was not these veterans concern pride in the second corps became almost boundless at battlefield reunions veterans sometimes blurred the truth to bring more credit to their units but they recognized that association with the second corps brought prestige the second corps was the gallant old corps and the fighting corps of the army of the potomac veterans likely would have been pleased when , on the 50th anniversary of the fighting at gettysburg , speaker of the house champs clark , elected from the former border state of missouri , referred to soldiers of the second corps as those unconquerable men in blue and , to a great extent , he was right the second corps demonstrated the wisdom of lincoln s organizational innovation men could be placed in immense operational units and still develop a strong sense of cohesion , both with the unit and its overall mission more important , perhaps , is that this cohesion proved more powerful than the racial antipathies that ran through many parts of the union army , frustrations and outright hatreds that could otherwise have ripped the force apart long before its battlefield victories were complete follow disunion at or join us  lawrence a kreiser jr is an associate professor of history at stillman

we re coming up on the second anniversary of my piece myths of austerity , in which i tried to knock down the simply insane conventional wisdom then gelling among very serious people intellectually it was , i think i can say without false modesty , a huge win i \( and those of like mind \) have been right about everything but i had no success in deflecting the terrible wrong turn in policy moreover , as far as i can tell none of the people responsible for that wrong turn has paid any price , not even in reputation they re still regarded as very serious , treated with great deference and the political tendency behind that terrible economic analysis has at least a 50 chance of triumphing in america oh well meanwhile , ed balls who i gather was nearly forced out of a leadership position by the very serious members of the labour party has been right all along , and now has a great term for the failed policy prescription since it was advocated by cameron , merkel , and sarkozy , he calls it camerkozy economics well done
berlin the has shown signs of reigniting in recent days , sharpening the debate between the champions of austerity and a growing chorus urging more expansionary policies to promote growth even the traditionally hardline called on tuesday for stronger european nations to ease the fiscal brakes by stretching out budget cuts over a longer period but if that message was intended foremost for , it seemed destined to fall on deaf ears with two state elections coming up next month , chancellor is unlikely to shift her position , popular with voters , against additional help for the economies of struggling european partners we do n't see the need that perhaps other countries see to boost growth through additional increases in expenditures , said a senior official in the german finance ministry , speaking on the condition of anonymity instead , we see quite clearly , and will remind our partners about their responsibilities from toronto , the official said , referring to commitments made at the group of 20 summit meeting in june 2010 , to cut their deficits in half and stabilize their debt levels at the same time , the official said that germany hoped other countries would join in increasing the international monetary fund s resources to help it combat the crisis politics as much as economics is adding to the sense of uncertainty in europe president nicolas sarkozy of france , who is trailing the socialist candidate fran ois hollande in the polls before the first round of the presidential election on sunday , has joined his opponent in promoting progrowth policies in greece , nationalist antigerman fringe parties are gaining strength ahead of next month s parliamentary election the german state elections may not directly affect the federal government in berlin , but they distract from continentwide concerns and crisis management while thrusting parochial issues to the forefront the german government does not have a mandate to share further the burden of the common currency on less competitive economies like those of greece , portugal , ireland and , increasingly , and italy what seems certain , however , is that the crisis will continue to fester until new measures are taken to address its root causes borrowing costs for struggling southern european countries like spain and italy have begun to rise again as the effect of the european central bank s injection of about 13 trillion in cheap loans into the banking system in december and march has faded much faster than expected the threeyear loans were meant to buy time for struggling governments and financial institutions , but the breathing room appears likely to be measured in months rather than in years the recent shift has underscored that there have been no substantive fixes beyond promises by countries to reduce their budget deficits it looks like it s coming back with a vengeance , largely because none of the underlying problems have been solved , said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the center for european reform mr whyte said that despite two years of crisis management , the fundamental structure of the euro zone remained intact , with lowerproductivity economies in the south yoked to higherproductivity economies in the north , which prevents the laggards from competing through a currency devaluation the ecb bought time , but what it ended up doing was simply tightening the link between national banks and their sovereigns , mr whyte said they made the system more vulnerable if markets started losing faith in debt sustainability in countries like spain yields on spain s 10year bonds climbed above 6 percent on monday , though they fell slightly on tuesday after a successful auction of shortterm debt by spain s treasury spain has emerged as the central test this year after missing its deficit targets as it slips back into recession the government in madrid has had a difficult time reining in spending by the 17 regional governments a bailout of spain would be much costlier than one for smaller economies like those of greece , portugal or ireland , testing the resources of the euro zone countries many economists , particularly in the united states , have argued that spain has to stimulate its economy with additional spending if it hopes to return to economic growth , an argument rejected by the german government in an interview with the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , christine lagarde , the managing director of the international monetary fund , said she was concerned about the health of spanish banks and warned against slashing spending too quickly it is not a view shared here in the german capital in an interview with reuters on tuesday , germany s finance minister , wolfgang sch uble , praised spain for making difficult economic changes you do n't win back trust overnight , mr sch uble said , adding that spain was following the right path by cutting spending german officials have also recommended changes in labor markets as a longerterm strategy to promote growth as deficits balloon in countries across europe , germany continues to watch its deficits and financing costs fall in another sign of germany s recent strength , the bundesbank said on tuesday that the country s debt had fallen to 812 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 , compared with 83 percent in 2010 that is still far above precrisis levels in 2007 , german debt was 652 percent of the size of the country s economy the problem with the crisis in germany is that we know we have a crisis , but we do n't feel it , said eckart d stratenschulte , a political scientist and the director of the nonprofit european academy berlin even as the european central bank loans improved market conditions , european leaders , including ms merkel , were clear that they did not believe that the crisis was over many in germany argue that a sense of crisis and the elevated borrowing costs that come with it is necessary to end outofcontrol spending in the heavily indebted nations and to push through the economic liberalization they need to restore growth but the higher borrowing costs and austerity measures cut into growth , critics say , lowering government revenues in a selfdefeating downward spiral and leading to higher interest rates and further budget cuts it s concerning that the markets are again running out of patience and driving yields higher , said thomas mayer , chief economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt that creates further head winds the imf on tuesday raised its forecast for global growth slightly for the year in europe , the fund projected recovery in the second half of 2012 , except for spain , italy , greece and portugal , where substantial improvement is not expected until next year the crisis , mr mayer said , is like a manic depressive moving between euphoria and worries , and now we 're in the valley of worries again
athens it was about a year ago that fotis i antonopoulos , a successful web program designer here , decided he wanted to open an ebusiness selling olive products luckily , he already had a day job it took him 10 months crisscrossing the city to collect dozens of forms and stamps of approval , including proof that he was up to date on his pension contributions before he could get started but even that was not enough in perhaps the strangest twist of all , his board members were required by the health department to submit lung xrays and stool samples since this was a food company i laugh about it now , he said but it would n't be so funny if i did n't have a very good job with very good pay it would have been an absolute nightmare with s economy entering its fourth year of , its entrepreneurs are eager to reverse a frightening tide last year , at least 68 , 000 small and mediumsize businesses closed in greece nearly 135 , 000 jobs associated with them vanished predictions for 2012 are also bleak but despite the government s repeated promises to improve things , the climate for doing business here remains abysmal in a recent report titled , mckinsey company described greece s economy as chronically suffering from unfavorable conditions for business startups faced immense amounts of red tape , complex administrative and tax systems and procedural disincentives , it said the tale of what it took to launch mr antonopoulos s web site has turned him into something of a celebrity these days , though a reluctant one he had hoped his experience which he first described in a podcast between friends would encourage other young greeks to set up their own web businesses instead , his story has grabbed headlines here as a glaring reminder of how far greece has to go to become a country that encourages new business ventures i know that what happened to us is not in isolation , he said this is what everyone else who tries to start a business is living it is very frustrating ecommerce is still relatively new in greece , though growing but internet businesses with international sales are so rare that when mr antonopoulos sought help with processing payments , three different greek banks seemed incapable of grasping the concept before the banks would agree to act as clearinghouses for credit cards , they insisted that portions of the olive shop web site including the company s marketing and privacy policies be written exclusively in greek , even though mr antonopoulos tried to explain that his customers would not understand greek we kept trying to tell them that the idea was to export that customers might be chinese , and they would n't understand , he said , throwing up his hands it was useless in the end , he turned to and had what he needed to get started in less than 10 minutes , he said none of this is news to vassilis korkidis , the president of the national confederation of hellenic commerce , a trade association in athens you could tell me anything , and i would believe it , mr korkidis said i have seen it all part of mr antonopoulos s problem , mr korkidis ventured , was his unwillingness to pay what is routinely referred to here as the speed tax bribes to move things along nor is mr korkidis much of a fan of recent government efforts to improve things he pointed to a pamphlet produced by the ministry of development , which explained a new onestop shop program for new businesses this does n't work , he said you have to collect 10 papers first and then it is onestop shopping ridiculous at 36 , mr antonopoulos is an aging computer whiz kid with long hair and an easy smile he is the head of digital innovation at atcom sa , a company that makes software to manage content , advertising and searchengine results on web sites and mobile devices he believes that technology and the internet can be a gateway from misery to success for greece he hoped that would provide a case study , showing young greeks , particularly those comfortable with computers , that they did not have to leave the country to find work in marketing olive oils , olive wood and olivebased cosmetics , he is focusing on a product category that many experts say greece could do a lot more with the mckinsey report , for instance , said that greece was the thirdlargest producer of olive oil in the world but exported 60 percent of its output to italy in bulk this allows italy to capture an extra 50 percent premium on the price of the final product but mr antonopoulos s entrance into ebusiness ran into trouble almost from the start finding prizewinning olive oil was not hard , he said nor was convincing farmers that they needed to find prettier bottles but getting a small warehouse in athens was a nightmare no warehouses are allowed in the city instead , he had to settle on a storefront and cover up the windows and there were permits and certificates to be obtained from the tax office , the pension office , the chamber of commerce , the health department , the building department , the fire department and more mr antonopoulos and his three partners took turns waiting in line it was a way to keep up the morale we each took a week the worst moment , he said , was when representatives from two agencies came to inspect the shop and disagreed about the legality of a circular staircase they walked out telling him that he would have to figure it out at that point , we actually thought about just going to the uk with this , he said one of the inspectors knew about new legislation the other did n't and they just refused to come up with a solution at one point , the company got a huge order from denmark , he said but the paperwork for what amounted to a wholesale transaction was so onerous that they decided not to even try to fill the order in contrast , he said , getting approval from the united states food and drug administration to export his products to the united states took about 24 hours it was all online , he said nothing could be done online in greece even so , mr antonopoulos said that his story did eventually have a happy ending his company , up and running for just five months , has already shipped goods to the united states , argentina , australia , japan and even mongolia , and it is covering its costs stool samples cannot be the center of this story , mr antonopoulos said we made it
cairo women are erratic and emotional , and they make good wives and mothers but never leaders or rulers that , at least , is what osama abou salama , a professor of botany at cairo university and a member of the muslim brotherhood , told young men and women during a recent premarital counseling class what was striking , though , was the absence of any reaction none of the 30 people in the class so much as winced a woman , mr abou salama said , takes pleasure in being a follower and finds ease in obeying a husband who loves her since the brotherhood rose to power and one of its former leaders was elected president , much of the uncertainty over its social agenda has centered on its plans for women will the brotherhood try to impose a conservative dress code \? will it try to bar women from certain fields of work \? will its leaders promote segregation at schools \? but in a country where a vast majority of women already cover their hair and voluntarily separate from men in coed environments , those questions are largely academic mr abou salama s class makes that case can you , as a woman , take a decision and handle the consequences of your decision \? he asked a number of women shook their heads even before mr abou salama provided his answer no but men can and god created us this way because a ship cannot have more than one captain more than any other political group in egypt , the brotherhood is fluent in the dialect of the masses by upholding patriarchal and traditional values about a woman s place in society , it garners popular support , builds political capital and reinforces social conservatism the woman is the symbol of a moral platform through which easy gains can be made , said hania sholkamy , an anthropologist and an associate professor at the social research center at the american university in cairo those who deprive women of their rights , limit their freedom or place them in a subordinate position believe that the political cost of doing so is very low the lectures of mr abou salama , who has raised three daughters , are part of a fourweek workshop called bride and groom against satan and sponsored by family house , a charity financed by the brotherhood it is one of several brotherhood efforts that have grown since the revolution , reflecting , as much as promoting , the religious values that define a large segment of society among its many activities , family house offers financial support to struggling households , provides a matchmaking service and sponsors mass weddings for lowincome couples this is part of the reformist methodology of the muslim brotherhood , said walaa abdel halim , the family house coordinator who organizes the youth counseling workshop shaping a righteous individual leads to shaping a righteous family , and by shaping a righteous family , you get a righteous society that can choose a righteous leader those broader efforts at shaping a conservative religious society , played out over decades by the brotherhood , were seen as partly responsible for helping elect mohamed morsi president in june at the time , mr morsi , who resigned from the brotherhood after taking office , gave assurances that he would protect the rights of women and include them in decision making less than three months into his presidency , though , mr morsi has not fulfilled a campaign promise to appoint a woman as a vice president instead , he named a team of 21 senior aides and advisers last week that included three women one of those three , omaima kamel , a medical professor at cairo university and a member of the brotherhood since 1981 , makes it clear that she is not about to press society to change attitudes about women let s face it , if your work took you away from your fundamental duties at home and if your success came at the cost of your family life and the stability of your children , then you are the one who stands to lose , she said by telephone a woman can work as much as she wants , but within the framework of our religious restrictions many analysts and critics of the brotherhood see that kind of philosophy , one that gives women independence so long as they maintain their traditional obligations , as effectively constraining women to established gender roles there is an absence of a welldefined vision , so they use words like 'religious restrictions , ' said ibrahim elhoudaiby , a researcher of islamic movements and a former member of the brotherhood ok , sure , so what exactly are those restrictions , so we can know them and figure out how to deal with them \? as long as we do n't define what those limits are , then we can expand them to the point where women , practically speaking , cannot work in mr morsi s political program , called the renaissance , there is an emphasis on a woman s authentic role as wife , mother and purveyor of generations the program then makes recommendations to safeguard family life foremost among them are premarital classes for youths free from the restrictions of the government of hosni mubarak , which outlawed the brotherhood , the movement s social outreach programs have mushroomed since mr morsi s election in less than a year , family house expanded from a single office to 18 branches around egypt and is developing a plan to encourage all couples to attend at the group s headquarters , in the densely populated cairo neighborhood of nasr city , mr abou salama walked into a spacious room where the front seats were for men and the back seats were for women he lectured on qualities to seek in a partner , getting acquainted under parental supervision , dealing with inlaws and consummating marriage in his social paradigm , understanding that the woman was created to be an obedient wife and mother and that the man was created to fend for his family holds the secret to a happy marriage i want you to be the flower that attracts a bee to make honey , not the trash that attracts flies and dirt , mr abou salama said as the women listened intently
americans are often told that in today s globalized world , we are at a competitive disadvantage because of our lazy monolingualism for too long , americans have relied on other countries to speak our language , secretary of education arne duncan said at the foreign language summit in 2010 but we wo n't be able to do that in the increasingly complex and interconnected world the widespread assumption is that few americans speak more than one language , compared with citizens of other nations and that we have little interest in learning to speak another but is this true \? since 1980 , the united states census bureau has asked does this person speak a language other than english at home \? what is this language \? how well does this person speak english \? the bureau reports that as of 2009 , about 20 percent of americans speak a language other than english at home this figure is often taken to indicate the number of bilingual speakers in the united states but a moment s reflection reveals that the bureau s question about what you speak at home is not equivalent to asking whether you speak more than one language i have some proficiency in spanish and was fluent in mandarin 20 years ago but when the american community survey \( an ongoing survey from the census bureau \) arrived in my mailbox last month , posing that question , i had to answer no , because we speak only english in my home i know i'm not alone there are countless americans who speak languages other than english outside their homes not just those of us who have learned other languages in school or through living abroad , but also employers who have learned enough spanish to speak to their employees workers in hospitals , clinics , courts and retail stores who have picked up parts of another language to make their jobs easier soldiers back from iraq or afghanistan with some competency in arabic , pashto or dari thirdgeneration kids studying their heritage language in informal schools on weekends spouses and partners picking up the language of a loved one s family enthusiasts learning languages with computer software like rosetta stone none of the above are identified as bilingual by the census bureau s question every census in the united states since 1890 \( except for one , in 1950 \) has asked about language characteristics , and its question has always seemed to assume that english is the only language relevant for the aspects of life that take place outside the home this assumption , though outdated , is somewhat understandable after all , the bureau s primary goal in asking this question is not to paint a full and complete portrait of the language proficiencies of americans but rather to track immigrants' integration into mainstream american society and to ascertain what services they need , and in what languages \( in october , for instance , the census bureau released a list of jurisdictions with large numbers of voters who need voting instructions translated in a language other than english \) nonetheless , to better map american language abilities , the census should ask the same question that the european commission asked in its survey in 2006 can you have a conversation in a language besides your mother tongue \? \( the answer , incidentally , dented europe s reputation as highly multilingual only 56 percent of the respondents , who tended to be younger and more educated , said they could \) until the census question is refined , claims about american monolingualism will almost certainly be overstated the celebrated multilingualism of not just europe but also the rest of the world may be exaggerated the handwringing about america s supposed linguistic weakness is often accompanied by the claim that monolinguals make up a small worldwide minority the oxford linguist suzanne romaine has claimed that bilingualism and multilingualism are a normal and unremarkable necessity of everyday life for the majority of the world s population but the statistics tell a murkier story recently , the stockholm university linguist mikael parkvall sought out data on global bilingualism and ran into problems the reliable numbers that do exist cover only 15 percent of the world s 190odd countries , and less than onethird of the world s population in those countries , mr parkvall calculated \( in a study not yet published \) , the average number of languages spoken either natively or nonnatively per person is 158 piecing together the available data for the rest of the world as best he could , he estimated that 80 percent of people on the planet speak 169 languages not high enough to conclude that the average person is bilingual multilinguals may outnumber monolinguals , but it s not clear by how much the average american may be no more monolingual or less multilingual than any other average person elsewhere on the planet at the very least , we ca n't say for sure not in any language
from a distance it can be difficult to tell what distinguishes one realitytelevision battle royale from another , but by any measure , the rumble that set off the second season of vh1 s mob wives , in january , was a genre classic a war of words between karen gravano and drita d'avanzo that escalated into fisticuffs and ended up derailing a party thrown by renee graziano , it made for intense , uncomfortable viewing , with ferocious howls , pulled hair , drawn blood and deadliest catchlevel emergencysituation camerawork so gripping was the scene that it has essentially inspired two spinoffs transplants the concept follow women related to the mob by blood or love or both to the land of al capone , with a crew of stars even more pugnacious than their staten island peers of the original and then there s , a lighthearted lifestyle series that follows angela raiola , a staten island partystarter who s friends with the mob wives circle , but who , it should be noted , is also the one who encouraged ms gravano and ms d'avanzo to talk out their differences that night , knowing perfectly well that reasoned conversation is not their strong suit \( both shows , now in their first seasons , run sunday nights on vh1 \) big ang was an outercircle character on the second season of , a fixture behind the bar at the drunken monkey , which she owns , and a steady source of redfaced glamour plasticsurgeryabetted , with a face dal would have loved , big ang was the show s comic relief and goto confidante older than the main women , she represented the ghost of mob wives future , standing on one s own after the good years with wiseguys have dried up her spinoff serves as a palliative to the constant warfare of the main franchise she s a relentless flirt , and part of the humor comes from watching her navigate a deadbeat husband , neil , and her urge to bat eyelashes at any pair of pectorals in range i like the wiseguys 'cause they know how to treat women , she said on mob wives last season they bought me nice houses , gorgeous furs , diamonds , cars they 're very generous , and they 're very goodlooking but the big ang of big ang does for herself she buys a new home so her 500 pairs of shoes , 300 pocketbooks and 200 hats can have room to breathe she remodels her bar and hires oily young men to serve shots so that she might attract a younger crowd in last week s episode , she saw a cardiologist , who recommended quitting alcohol and cigarettes big ang , who talks with the mottled purr of an ancient car engine , gave it a try but ultimately was having none of it this summer i need to drink and smoke , she announced , and that was that like snooki and the situation before her , she s the ultimate neighborhood star gone national she and her friends make up a naughty golden girls troupe , a rejoinder to the severity of the clique on mob wives and , now , mob wives chicago , which has a brawltoepisode ratio tending toward 1 1 , impressive even by the high standards of the era this season began with a faceoff , too , as if it were n't important to get to know anything about these women apart from their willingness to throw down the chicago team roughly cleaves into two camps on one side is nora schweihs and pia rizza on the other , christina scoleri , leah desimone and renee fecarotta russo though of course , allegiance is liquid ms schweihs , who has a sad , sallow mien , has just returned to chicago to rehabilitate the reputation of her father , reputedly a mob hit man who was under federal indictment for racketeering and extortion when he died she s tragic , continually trying to recover innocence her upbringing did n't allow for , even throwing herself a birthday party \( gocart racing included \) to make up for unfulfilling birthdays as a child in the series premiere last month , she was at the center of the fight that eventually engulfed ms rizza and ms scoleri after yet another gathering disintegrated into warfare on last week s episode , ms scoleri said of ms schweihs , this poor girl does n't know how to fight it was n't a compliment needless to say , the women of mob wives chicago do n't get along , but the lack of even baseline affection among them sets them apart from their mob wives counterparts those staten islanders appear to be animated by love and respect , while the chicagoans appear uniformly unhappy and rote the effect is deadening , with none of the original s grand emotional swoop maybe , as the second wave , they know what the roles are and play them well or maybe there s no big ang to strive for
in august of 2002 i survived a car accident although i can still see the van speeding toward us , i cannot bring to mind the crash itself , only its aftermath i see the ruined windshield in front of me , the brooklyn street , the sky and clouds everything is black , gray and white no color my husband is speaking to me from the driver s seat , but i cannot answer him all i know is that i do not want to move i feel at once serene and distant i have this thought if i'm going to die , this is not such a bad way to go some time later , a man s voice tells me that the jaws of life will make a lot of noise , and i think to myself , i do n't care as i lie on a gurney in the emergency room and a woman cuts off my clothes with large scissors , i feel grateful that i'm wearing jeans and a cotton sweater and not something expensive after two ct scans , it is clear that my neck is not broken i am bruised and battered that is all for four nights after the accident , i relive what i cannot remember by day the moment of impact , the blasting jolt to my body , the roar of collapsing metal and splitting glass in my ears and i wake with a scream in my throat , my heart racing , my limbs stiff with terror it feels as if the collision were happening again although i recall those nighttime flashbacks , i still am unable to remember the smashup itself my inability to recall the collision , my frozen indifference to what had happened to me , and my nightmares are classic symptoms of trauma my suffering was too shortlived to have qualified me for a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder i fit the criteria , however , for acute stress disorder , which must last at least two days but no longer than a month according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , or dsm , acute stress disorder , like ptsd , begins with an extreme traumatic stressor , followed by intrusive memories or nightmares of that event further , the person must show dissociative symptoms numbing , detachment , depersonalization or emotional unresponsiveness after the accident , i was clearly in a dissociated state weirdly detached from myself and although i left the hospital without an injury that could be seen on a ct scan , both my memory and my sense of self had been altered by the shock it is not known why some people develop traumatic symptoms and others do n't my husband , daughter and the family dog were all in the car with me , and i was the only one who came down with acute stress disorder then again , i took the brunt of the shock the van hit the side of the vehicle where i was sitting apparently , children of people who suffered from ptsd have a greater chance of developing the illness , but why they do remains mysterious there is no ptsd without emotional trauma , but some of us may be temperamentally more disposed to become ill with it than others my late father , who fought in new guinea and the philippines during the second world war , had repeated flashbacks at night after he returned to civilian life , and once while he was awake the intrusive memory seemed to have been triggered by a hymn he was listening to in chapel as the horrible images unfolded before him , he began to shake uncontrollably , and he found himself back in the philippines witnessing what he believed was the unwarranted killing of a japanese officer as an infant i had febrile convulsions in 1981 i had a brief seizure that threw me against a wall , and then a yearlong migraine in 2006 i developed a mysterious seizure disorder that manifests itself in violent shaking , which i now control with medicine the shaking symptoms first appeared when i gave a speech in memory of my father , but i also once had a seizure while climbing a mountain , which was probably caused by hyperventilation it is tempting to link my shaking and my flashbacks to my father s the question is how \? if there is a genetic susceptibility to ptsd , it remains unknown , but both strong emotion a psychological state and a lack of oxygen a physiological one are known to cause seizures ptsd is a relatively new term , but emotional trauma has been cataloged in various ways and gone by many names over time soldier s heart , railway spine , shell shock , battle fatigue , hysterical neurosis and the one i think is most apt , physioneurosis the last term was coined by abram kardiner in 1941 to describe the enduring psychobiological damage sustained by his patients on the battlefield the brain is a dynamic , plastic organ it develops and changes through our experiences in the world our subjective feelings of joy , sadness , irritation and shock may all be understood as fluctuating brain states , but they are responsive states that occur in relation to what happens to us this is brutally clear when it comes to ptsd when i wobbled out of the hospital in my huge paper scrubs , after losing my clothes to that pair of scissors in the emergency room , i was told to return if i developed headache , nausea or dizziness \( signs of a head injury missed by the scan \) , but no one mentioned that i might be subject to nightmarish repetitions of the accident as a culture we are still caught in the mental physical divide , prone to thinking of psychiatric illness as either all in your head or , conversely , as chemical imbalances or organic brain diseases none of these is a helpful or accurate description of any psychiatric condition we cannot isolate the brain from life experience and the environment they are inextricably entwined what happens to us becomes part of us , body and mind luckily , my flashbacks disappeared , but i am still often anxious when i ride in a car my muscles become tense i feel a constriction in my lungs , and i avoid looking ahead into the traffic a bump in the road , a sudden stop , a loud noise all of these make me gasp in fear i am not entirely free of the physioneurosis that began with a car accident almost 10 years ago this is an excerpt from anxiety , a series at nytimescom opinionator drawing \( drawing by noah frase \)
assessed the one recent afternoon , dressed in blue pajamas , redandgreen robe and black slippers they got no one , he said , slumped on a sofa in his manhattan apartment to reach that conclusion , he first called seymour siwoff , who runs elias sports bureau siwoff told him they were not very good he told breslin to call jay horwitz , the mets' publicrelations chief i call him on some bus down south , breslin said , and i say , who do you got \? ' he tells me about wright , murphy and lucas duda breslin pronounced duda doodoh breslin jotted notes on a manila folder , homework for an interview with a reporter horwitz tells me , tell him we 're going to be better than we were , ' breslin said breslin , now in his 80s , knows about bad mets teams ca n't anybody here play this game \? was his slim chronicle of the 1962 season , in which the expansion mets lost games no team since 1900 has been worse but to breslin , the mets were wonderful comic relief for a sport grown stagnant and a city that had lost the dodgers and the giants the mets , he wrote , were for the cabdriver who gets held up and the guy who loses out on a promotion because he did n't maneuver himself to lunch with the boss enough baseball s business , he wrote , was filled with arrogant , moneyhungry people with a sense of loyalty only to a bank account ca n't anybody and nine other have been released as ebooks by open road media in time for the mets' 50th anniversary he has paid little attention to baseball or the mets since '62 and would rather speak of joan payson , the original mets owner , than fred wilpon she was terrific , breslin said wilpon \? met him once he s not my style breslin is working on a novel but is shopping for a manual typewriter because his computer is driving him crazy he has stopped writing his recently resurrected column in the daily news fifty years after ca n't anybody here play this game \? breslin ca n't recall why he chose to write about the mets but he knows why they appealed to him he has always loved losers , and those mets were epic losers hobie landrith , ed bouchee and joe christopher were not classically oppressed , like many of those he has written about seriously , but they qualified as the humorous downtrodden worthy of a 124page book they were a team that could n't hit or field straight casey stengel was the manager of a roster that included marv throneberry , rod kanehl , the two millers \( and \) and gil hodges in his twilight , playing at the polo grounds , enemy turf to a former brooklyn dodger like hodges you had to be a sucker not to write about them , breslin said and i had a billiondollar title about that title he quotes stengel saying the line during a conversation in which he laments that he has a defensive catcher \( chris cannizzaro \) who cannot catch the ball and lets runners circle the bases makes you think , breslin wrote you look up and down the bench and you have to say to yourself , ca n't anybody here play this game \? ' it s a really good line but it s not really the line breslin turned it into something better than it was he did n't say it alone , breslin said , a smile on his face i heard him say something in league with it breslin s fiction or his columns could not conjure a character like throneberry might come close but marvelous marv was something to behold in a game against the cubs , chicago s don landrum found himself in a rundown between first base and second throneberry was part of a posse of mets chasing him down the only trouble , breslin wrote , was that marvin did not have the ball but he did not get out of landrum s way and was called for obstruction then , in the bottom half of that inning , marv whacked what appeared to be a triple as usual , marv had that wonderful running action , breslin wrote but throneberry did n't touch first then he did n't touch second he hitched up his belt and listened to the crowd cheer for him ernie banks called for the ball at first base , stepped on the bag , and throneberry was called out i can still see his face , breslin said stengel thought he was crazy if the mets were any good , breslin s story would have been dead after the team won 9 of 12 games in may to climb into eighth place , general manager george weiss suggested the possibility of vaulting into seventh place , which was a toxic thought to breslin this was hoping for boring mediocrity , breslin wrote , as if offended who would have cared about the mets if they became a seventhplace club \? happily , the team would have none of this they mets lost their next 17 , returned to 10th place and never left it was hell to play for them , but for anybody who watched them , it was great , he wrote this was bert lahr in the wizard of oz' or the marx brothers in room service' in of ca n't anybody here play this game \? in the new york times , charles poore wrote here is one of the most imaginative spoofs of the year jimmy breslin has invented a fabulous baseball club he calls the mets
chicago inside classrooms at the chicago police academy , wouldbe officers learn how to make arrests , spot drugs , understand gang terminology , process crime scenes but this class looked different rows of sworn , longtime police officers listened silently to barked commands from an unlikely trainer a novelist do n't dodge race , do n't dodge sex , do n't dodge the war on drugs because people told you they 're winning it and you on the street know that they 're not , said , the writer , pounding his fist on a table that s what you 've got to talk about if you 're going to back away from that , you 're wasting your time talking to me i can tell you how to start i'm really good at that , but i ca n't propel you through the fire you 're getting ready to face for the police officers here , a few in full uniform , this was not the everyday fire nor was it the usual training seminar none of these officers , in fact , were required to be here in a profession that plenty of professional writers without a single day spent in a squad car like to write about , the has begun a voluntary workshop for officers who wish to tell their own stories so far , 25 do certainly , there are already accomplished officersturnedauthors and even a but national law enforcement organizations say it is extremely unusual for such a workshop to come from a police department itself , where most of the training in writing involves incident reports and search warrant applications among these officers , not all were dreaming of writing crime thrillers some aspired to more offbeat genres children s stories , selfhelp guides for police leadership , biographies of criminals , tales of weird cold cases , and at least one planned to modernize stories from the bible by interweaving them with incidents from police work every policeman has said more than once , we have got to write a book , ' said sgt cynthia schumann , a 26year chicago police veteran who said she had been jotting down her own notes , just words and bits and thoughts , for years people would not believe you ca n't make it up what we 've seen it could be something very humorous , or it could be something very devastating and tragic and martin preib , an officer who attended the seminar though he has already , said an effort to help actual police officers tell their own stories was critical overdue , even i think it s high time the publishing world listened to the police , said officer preib , a 10year veteran who describes his writing as somewhere between fiction and nonfiction there is a wealth of literary possibilities there , but people in publishing are very politically correct and arrogant they generally do not listen to the police , or dismiss their point of view in favor of clich s about the police still , the process envisioning , writing , editing will be anything but easy , warned mr newton , whose second crime novel , start shooting , was recently released his fellow instructor , , the nonfiction author most recently of get capone , described himself to the officers as the good cop to mr newton s bad the first steps , mr newton said in sometimes profane terms , were to kill the internal critic and to decide not to hold back on touchy issues , whatever the discomfort will you give yourself permission to tell the truth \? he called out to the officers and if you wo n't , do n't do this some officers later acknowledged that they worried about running afoul of department rules or irking their bosses by writing about their work like many other police departments , chicago s has sometimes clashed with writers over what information should be made public and what should not i guess the biggest issue i have with myself is to give myself permission to actually deal with a felon , said sara sotgiu , an officer for 12 years she said she might write about a gang leader , a contemporary in age , whom she arrested for punching a cab driver in her first weeks on the job i remember thinking , how is it that i'm where i am and he s where he is \? she said how did we get to each other s lives from separate worlds \? lt maureen c biggane , commander of the department s office of news affairs who helped create the writing program after mr newton and mr eig volunteered to teach one , said she was not concerned that officers might violate protocols in their writing the department decided to go forward with the program , she said , for a simple reason to help officers pursue their interests beyond everyday police work whether many among the first group survive the occasional classroom meetings like this one , a continual backandforth via email with the authors , or even the first homework assignment remains to be seen officers were asked to write 25 words or fewer on what their book would be about words that , once rewritten over and over and ultimately boiled down to a single word , would serve to keep them from straying into tangents when they got around to actual writing ray cox , a 21year veteran who works in the department s evidence section amid drugs , guns and rape kits , wrote a bitter , divorced cop , calloused from witnessing hopelessness and despair on the chicago streets he struggles to find balance until three ladies impact his life the authors sent it back , praised and marked with ideas for revision my impression is they 're dealing with powerful themes and terrific story lines , but nailing down the essence of what they want to say is going to take much time and many rewrites , mr eig said of his sense so far this is like psychotherapy , and the first impulse for these and other writers is to resist
medford , mass , who was elected yesterday to be s first female president , will also become the first elected female leader anywhere in the confucian civilization , which consists of china , japan , north and south korea , taiwan , singapore and vietnam , and makes up nearly a quarter of the world s population yet the mark she puts on history will not be determined by her gender , or even by the domestic policies she campaigned on it will depend on how successfully she can address the greatest moral challenge to the korean nation alleviating the tremendous suffering of fellow koreans in , who are perhaps the most systematically oppressed people in the world today to be sure , cracking the citadel of masculinity in a culture steeped in millenniums of male chauvinism is historic simply by winning , as the candidate of the governing centerright new frontier party , ms park instantly became a role model for hundreds of millions of women across east asia indeed , her very candidacy revealed the depths of male chauvinism that many educated south koreans blithely accept in october , for example , a male psychology professor at a leading university pointed out that ms park has never married or given birth , and commented on a tv program women in korean society attain the phenomenon of womanhood by getting married , giving birth and raising children park geunhye falls short of those conditions only her reproductive organ makes her a woman competing in such an atmosphere , ms park did have one advantage south koreans' respect for the economic accomplishments of her father , park chunghee , who in the 1960s and '70s presided with an authoritarian hand over one of the modern world s greatest economic turnarounds under his stewardship , south korea eradicated abject poverty and mass hunger , and laid the groundwork for becoming an industrialized leader in global trade in her campaign , ms park promised further expansion of the economy , pledging to rebuild the middle class by creating jobs and restructuring the economy , while also lowering college tuition and expanding child care and other social welfare programs parties on the left proposed more drastic reforms and more generous programs , but south korea s voters evidently put their faith in ms park s more modest goals attending to economic health and social welfare are essential tasks for any national leader , of course but they do not define the greatest national challenge that an affluent south korea faces today and ms park would do well to remember why her father is widely honored today , in spite of his authoritarian rule he , like other korean leaders before and since , was able to define the most compelling national task of his time and accomplish it the first such modern leader was kim ku , who , more than any other , is revered for leading koreans in their struggle for independence during and after the peninsula s occupation by japan in the first half of the 20th century later , in the decades when ms park s father was in charge , reconstruction and economic development in the wake of the korean war remained south korea s most compelling national challenge and in the 1980s and '90s , the central task was nurturing the seeds of democracy the work for which former president kim daejung , a champion of popular government and human rights , is still admired despite his questionable policy of giving north korea unconditional aid , including hundreds of millions of dollars in cash today , the single greatest calling for the ethnic korean nation is liberating the north korean people for more than 60 years , north koreans have languished in the shadow of a vast network of gulags , their lives are stripped of the most basic liberties freedom of speech , thought , religion , assembly and movement north korea is unique among the world s modern literate , industrialized , urbanized economies to have suffered a peacetime famine in its case , a manmade disaster that claimed about 10 percent of the population in the mid to late 1990s so the need to improve the conditions of life inside north korea is the urgent calling for an independent , affluent , free south korea today it is a calling that none of park geunhye s predecessors have attempted to answer , even though south korea claims , in its constitution , to be the sole legitimate government representing all koreans ms park acknowledged the task when she stated during her campaign , we cannot go on neglecting the suffering of the north korean people , the very people who will be the main actors in a unified korea she went on to say that she would try to prevent the forcible repatriation of north koreans and would strengthen the resettlement support program and tailored support system for north korean defectors , so that each one of them may maximize their talents to their full potential ms park s challenge , once she takes office in february , will be to keep faith with such pledges so far , no south korean leader has made north korean human rights a priority none have ever called for north korea to dismantle its concentration camps for political prisoners , nor have any met in public with north korean defectors , for fear of provoking the leadership in pyongyang , the capital but today , as it was 60 years ago , the argument for calling on the north to tear down the camps and provide the north korean people with information about the outside world is compelling after all , a nation cannot remain half slave and half free , and the danger of doing so only increases with each year that the political and economic contrasts between the two halves of korea increase ms park should strive to raise global and local awareness about north korean human rights abuses for example , she could generously increase funding for radio broadcasts and other information transmissions into north korea sponsor publications and international conventions on the subject and greatly expand programs that support resettlement of north koreans in south korea such efforts may not yield visible results in the near term rather , they are likely to bring periods of impasse and tension in intrakorean relations but even if there is a decline in summit pageantry and diplomatic deals , these measures would achieve what really matters they would encourage north koreans to learn more about the outside world and demand , if only gradually , more from their leaders even modest progress on the protection of rights as basic as the right to life itself , and freedom from enslavement , or freedom of expression and assembly , would change north korean lives for the better and if such changes helped to deliver hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of fellow koreans from bondage , they would give park geunhye a legacy that no leader over the past two millenniums of korean history can yet claim
it s hard to believe that anyone but scholars of modern literature or paid critics have read wh auden s dramatic poem the age of anxiety all the way through , even though it won a pulitzer prize in 1948 , the year after it was published it is a difficult work allusive , allegorical , at times surreal but more to the point , it s boring the characters meet , drink , talk and walk around then they drink , talk and walk around some more they do this for 138 pages then they go home auden s title , though that people know from the moment it appeared , the phrase has been used to characterize the consciousness of our era , the awareness of everything perilous about the modern world the degradation of the environment , nuclear energy , religious fundamentalism , threats to privacy and the family , drugs , pornography , violence , terrorism since 1990 , it has appeared in the title or subtitle of at least two dozen books on subjects ranging from science to politics to parenting to sex \( mindblowing sex in the real world hot tips for doing it in the age of anxiety \) as a sticker on the bumper of the western world , the age of anxiety has been ubiquitous for more than six decades now but is it accurate \? as someone who has struggled with chronic anxiety for many years , i have my doubts for one thing , when you ve endured anxiety s insults for long enough the gnawed fingernails and sweatdrenched underarms , the hyperventilating and crippling panic attacks calling the 20th century the age of anxiety starts to sound like calling the 17th century the age of the throbbing migraine so metaphorical as to be meaningless from a sufferer s perspective , anxiety is always and absolutely personal it is an experience a coloration in the way one thinks , feels and acts it is a petty monster able to work such humdrum tricks as paralyzing you over your salad , convincing you that a choice between blue cheese and vinaigrette is as dire as that between life and death when you are on intimate terms with something so monumentally subjective , it is hard to think in terms of epochs and yet it is undeniable that ours is an age in which an enormous and growing number of people suffer from anxiety according to the national institute of mental health , anxiety disorders now affect 18 percent of the adult population of the united states , or about 40 million people by comparison , mood disorders depression and bipolar illness , primarily affect 95 percent that makes anxiety the most common psychiatric complaint by a wide margin , and one for which we are increasingly wellmedicated last spring , the drug research firm ims health released its annual report on pharmaceutical use in the united states the antianxiety drug alprazolam better known by its brand name , xanax was the top psychiatric drug on the list , clocking in at 463 million prescriptions in 2010 just because our anxiety is heavily diagnosed and medicated , however , doesn t mean that we are more anxious than our forebears it might simply mean that we are better treated that we are , as individuals and a culture , more cognizant of the mind s tendency to spin out of control earlier eras might have been even more jittery than ours fourteenthcentury europe , for example , experienced devastating famines , waves of pillaging mercenaries , peasant revolts , religious turmoil and a plague that wiped out as much as half the population in four years the evidence suggests that all this resulted in mass convulsions of anxiety , a period of psychic torment in which , as one historian has put it , the more one knew , the less sense the world made nor did the monolithic presence of the church necessarily help it might even have made things worse a firm belief in god and heaven was nearuniversal , but so was a firm belief in their opposites the devil and hell and you could never be certain in which direction you were headed it s hard to imagine that we have it even close to as bad as that yet there is an aspect of anxiety that we clearly have more of than ever before selfawareness the inhabitants of earlier eras might have been wracked by nerves , but none fixated like we do on the condition indeed , none even considered anxiety a condition anxiety didn t emerge as a cohesive psychiatric concept until the early 20th century , when freud highlighted it as the nodal point at which the most various and important questions converge , a riddle whose solution would be bound to throw a flood of light upon our whole mental existence after that , the number of thinkers and artists who sought to solve this riddle increased exponentially by 1977 , the psychoanalyst rollo may was noting an explosion in papers , books and studies on the subject anxiety , he wrote , has certainly come out of the dimness of the professional office into the bright light of the marketplace none of this is to say that ours is a serene age obviously it isn t it is to say , however , that we shouldn t be possessive about our uncertainties , particularly as one of the dominant features of anxiety is its recursiveness anxiety begins with a single worry , and the more you concentrate on that worry , the more powerful it gets , and the more you worry one of the best things you can do is learn to let go to disempower the worry altogether if you start to believe that anxiety is a foregone conclusion if you start to believe the hype about the times we live in then you risk surrendering the battle before it s begun to receive immediate updates and new posts subscribe to the  daniel smith is the author of the forthcoming book monkey mind a memoir of anxiety \( simon schuster , july 2012 \) his work has appeared in the atlantic , granta , n 1 , new york , the new york times magazine and elsewhere he writes regularly about anxiety at his web site , the monkey mind chronicles
president obama s position inched forward in the fivethirtyeight forecast on thursday his chances of winning the electoral college are 761 percent , according to the forecast , up from 752 percent on wednesday mr obama s projected margin of victory in the national popular vote also increased slightly , to 34 percentage points by and large , the story that thursday s polls told was the same one as on wednesday mr obama continues to get very strong results in state polls that use industrystandard methodology , meaning that they use live interviews and place calls to mobile phones along with landlines in the 10 states that have generally been ranked the highest on our tippingpoint list ohio , virginia , florida , wisconsin , colorado , nevada , iowa , pennsylvania , new hampshire and michigan there have been 21 such polls since the democratic convention ended mr obama has led in all 21 of these surveys and usually by clear margins on average , he has held a sixpoint lead in these surveys , and he has had close to 50 percent of the vote in them mr obama s results have been more varied among polling firms that use different methodologies a series of polls in eleven swing states , released on thursday by the online firm yougov , were fairly strong for mr obama , putting him ahead among likely voters in all of the states except north carolina but automated polls , like those from the rasmussen reports , have had lukewarm results for mr obama a rasmussen reports poll released on thursday , for instance , put mr obama three points behind in iowa i don t mean to keep repeating this point about polling methodologies , but it really does seem to be the easiest way to unpack the statelevel data right now in contrast to the sixpoint lead mr obama has held on average among the swingstate polls that included cellphones , and the fivepoint lead he had on average among the yougov internet surveys , mr obama has been ahead by just two points on average in polls that called landlines only , most of which were robopolls conducted by automated script if mr obama s lead is five or six points in the typical swing state right now , then mitt romney will probably need some sort of external contingency to give him much of a chance at winning if mr obama s lead is more like two points instead , then routine factors like the debates or economic reports could more easily put mr romney ahead , although obviously there would be no guarantees although the forecast model weighs polls from the stronger polling firms more heavily , it continues to project something of an inbetween result in part because the national polls seem to have gravitated more toward the range of a three or fourpoint lead for mr obama , and in part because it continues to assume that mr obama could still be experiencing a modest afterglow from his convention that will subsequently fade however , mr romney will need to see mr obama s numbers decline fairly soon if he wants to bank on the convention bounce hypothesis the penalty that the forecast is applying to mr obama s polls will phase out over the next week or so the model would make mr obama a 839 percent favorite right now were it not for the convention bounce adjustment but isn t mr obama s convention bounce declining already \? it sure seemed to be the case a couple of days ago but now the evidence has become more ambiguous the most powerful argument that mr obama s convention bounce is fading or perhaps has already faded is the gallup national tracking poll , which showed the race reverting to a tie on thursday after once having given mr obama a sevenpoint lead gallup is one of four national tracking polls , however , and the others tell a variety of stories , none of which are exactly consistent in the rasmussen reports tracking poll , mr obama s numbers faded sharply late last week , but they have since rebounded in thursday s version of that poll , he held a threepoint lead over mr romney when voters who leaned toward a candidate were included in the ipsos online tracking poll , mr obama s numbers have fluctuated some , but he remains five points ahead among likely voters only slightly off his peak \( the survey also put mr obama 10 points ahead among the broader universe of registered voters \) in the rand corporation s tracking poll , mr obama lead has expanded slowly but steadily in fact , he reached his highest level of the year on thursday , with the survey giving him a 54 percentage point advantage among likely voters a simple average of the four tracking polls put mr obama 34 percentage points ahead on thursday that is essentially no different than a week ago , when the same technique gave him a 35point lead it s at least possible that mr obama s bounce was fading but that the attention to mr romney s 47 percent comments has since given mr obama renewed momentum it will take a few more days before we can come to any sort of conclusion about this , however , especially since some of the tracking polls use long field periods and have only conducted a fraction of their interviews since mr romney s remarks were uncovered it s also possible that we ve been jumping the gun the four national tracking polls all shot up very quickly after the democratic national convention , to the point that it seemed possible that mr obama might eventually \( if temporarily \) gain as much as a six to eightpoint advantage in the race but the gallup tracking poll , which showed an especially sharp shift , could have been exaggerating it because of statistical variance and now may be underselling it for the same reason last week , mr obama s state polls seemed to be underwhelming relative to his national ones this week , just the opposite has been true that might lend credibility to the hypothesis that the some of the national trackers initially exaggerated the extent of mr obama s bounce but also , that the gallup poll now exaggerates his decline of course , if you re a purist , then the gallup survey is the only one of the four tracking polls that you ll find acceptable , since it s the only one to use a traditional methodology but then you have to reconcile that with the fact that the polls using the strongest methodological standards at the state level are now giving mr obama a sixpoint lead in the battleground states mr romney would much prefer the robopolls , warts and all and if his numbers don t improve soon , he had better hope that they are right
moscow two leaders of moscow s street protest movement and the husband of another were convicted in three separate judicial hearings on thursday , increasing fears that something resembling a campaign of reprisals had begun aleksei navalny , an anticorruption activist who is among the most prominent members of the opposition movement , was fined 1 , 000 rubles , about 34 , for remaining at the location of a rally for longer than a cityissued permit had allowed sergei udaltsov , the leader of a marginal political movement called left front , was sentenced to 10 days in jail for organizing an unsanctioned march after a protest on march 10 outside the courtroom , mr navalny said moscow courts were rubberstamping official decisions to persecute protest organizers they are all cases related to mass protests , he said the most severe sentence on thursday went to , the husband of olga romanova , one of the organizers of the street rallies he was convicted in a regional court on economic fraud charges not related to the protests and sentenced to five years in a penal colony the conviction stems from a business deal that is more than four years old , and it comes in spite of a ruling by the russian supreme court last september that overturned mr kozlov s earlier conviction in the matter because mr koslov served a portion of the former sentence , the conviction on thursday means he will serve a year and half in prison has no statute against double jeopardy ms romanova , a former journalist who leads russia behind bars , a group advocating judicial reform , brought attention to the case by championing her husband s cause at several mass protests after disputed parliamentary elections in december in february , as she organized and spoke at rallies , prosecutors showed her a draft of their proposed sentence for her husband , a development she interpreted as a threat and has since presented as evidence that the case was politically motivated after the judge read the sentence thursday , supporters in the courtroom chanted shame ! and ms romanova yelled to the judge , damn you ! police also detained a third member of a punk band that slipped into moscow s main orthodox cathedral just before the presidential election this month and performed a lewd song as a protest while condemning the stunt , opposition leaders have pleaded for leniency for the musicians , and said the case was emblematic of the wider prosecutorial onslaught they say demonstrators are facing here the band s lawyer said that the police detained the third musician on thursday the group , wearing masks , performed what it called a punk prayer service last month in the cathedral of christ the savior , where senior members of the russian government attend services , though none were present at the time the lawyer , who identified the activist only by her first name , irina , told the interfax news agency that she had originally been a witness in the case but that prosecutors had reclassified her as a suspect and arrested her the two other musicians face up to seven years in prison
what if john elway , broncos executive vice president for football operations , could have written an honest , cathartic open letter to broncos fans this past march \? it might have gone something like this dear broncos fans , enough already with the tebow mania really , enough i have nothing against the guy i meant it when i said i d be happy if he married my daughter and i m thrilled that we were able to reach the divisional round with him but the truth is , and my guess is coach john fox would agree , we reached the divisional round despite him yes , tebow was great in our the wildcard upset over the steelers but that was the only game in our last five that we won in those four games that tebow was not a winner , he completed 394 percent of his passes you find that inspiring \? no team can sustain success over the long haul with poor quarterback play you can t build your foundation on winning miraculously fortunately , owner pat bowlen has given me the green light to go after peyton manning in free agency i d say , based on our talks , there s a good chance manning will come to the mile high city we re willing to offer him 96 million over five years it might seem ridiculous to sink that kind of money into a 36yearold with neck problems trust me , it s not unlike with tebow , manning gives us a chance to win a super bowl even if it s a small chance , it s still a chance and that s all this business is about winning super bowls merchandise sales , inspiring storylines , media attention , galvanized fan bases those are wonderful , but in the big scheme of thing , they re only sustained by winning and winning comes from leadership and skill , not leadership and faith besides , as much as you might think you hate the idea of losing tebow , most of you will be giddy with excitement once manning arrives that excitement will lead to ticket sales and national broadcast games and all the other extracurricular stuff that tebow brought so there you have it sorry if this was a little blunt i m just tired of the politically correct nonsense i took this job to win titles nothing else matters i learned that during my playing days when , until the last two years of my career , half of you thought i stunk here s to an actual chance at a real super bowl run ! sincerely , john elway offense no one knows for sure whether peyton manning can be the player he was before the neck problems for the purposes of this preview , let s assume he can that s what the broncos are doing true , the broncos \( and manning himself \) have acknowledged the possibility that he won t regain his form they structured his contract in a way that makes it basically a oneyear , 18 million deal with a team option next march to extend it another four years at 42 million guaranteed that s just smart business as far as this year s operations go , elway and his staff are assuming they ll have the manning everyone knows and loves broncos offensive coordinator mike mccoy has gladly replaced his system with the one manning ran in indianapolis system overrides are becoming old hat for the 40yearold coach last year he rewrote his entire playbook to accommodate tebow and the runoption mccoy didn t get much credit for that highly successful act of ingenuity and humility , and he won t get much credit for whatever success denver s offense has this year the notsoinaccurate perception is , manning is completely running this show manning s offense is simple in theory because his game is predicated on dissecting the defense , he likes to get defensive looks that are as consistent and static as possible that s why each week you ll see the broncos use the same small handful of base formations featuring little to no presnap motion and shifts this minimalist approach makes the new system fairly easy for broncos players to learn what s not easy is the execution everything manning does is based on timing and precision , so chemistry with the other 10 players on the field , particularly the wide receivers , is everything don t expect a quick indy redux in indy , manning spent the better part of 10 years perfecting this system with a familiar group of guys and keep in mind , he was working in a climatecontrolled stadium and on a team that , from day 1 , had been constructed 100 percent around him even though the broncos are catering to manning as much as possible , he s still stepping into an organization that plays outdoors at elevation and has an unfamiliar group of men with whom he has worked for a few months these might seem like small details , but it s the small details that make manning who he is the group of guys is not completely unfamiliar , however , because the broncos signed veteran wide receiver brandon stokley and another excolt , tight end jacob tamme at 36 , stokley is nearing the end of his career and may not assume a meaningful role ahead of his youngerthoughlessrefined replica , matt willis tamme , on the other hand , with sinewy shortarea movement skills and the size to work the seams , is promised to play a major role as a starter in the base twotightend offense he may wind up second in manning s tight end pecking order , though , as fellow free agent pickup joel dreessen is also an excellent fit for this system dreessen is a serviceable , though not particularly strong , inline blocker and , more important , a fluid route runner also in the mix is virgil green , a superathletic seventhround pick from a year ago who moved to third on the depth chart after last year s fourthround pick , julius thomas , had major ankle surgery back in april as for the wide receivers , a lot of people are expecting big things from demaryius thomas , given that he s a strong but supple former firstround pick who blossomed down the stretch last season but a word of caution thomas , despite what he showed in the playoff win over pittsburgh , is not a prototypical playmaker his fairly ordinary acceleration and topend speed will make him more of a possession target in the long run in the short run , he must become a better route runner if he wants to click with manning no 2 receiver eric decker is very good at beating press coverage off the line of scrimmage it wouldn t be at all surprising if he s manning s favorite target out of the gate the freeagent pickup andre caldwell will handle the no 3 duties from the slot caldwell is quick and capable of changing directions sharply , but he s also prone to mistakes if that s a problem , stokley , or perhaps the journeyman jason hill , will get his snaps we don t think of manning and the run game as one and the same because , as a scrambler , manning always had the mobility of a beached whale but manning affects the team s run game as much as any quarterback in the league with his adjustments at the line of scrimmage still , the perfect play call usually can t overcome a lack of backfield speed , which is why bronco fans should be a little worried about willis mcgahee s being their primary ballcarrier mcgahee was excellent as a methodical chainsmover in denver s groundnpound system last season , but in a singleback offense that features a lot of offtackle runs , his depleted initial quickness will be an issue fourthyear pro knowshon moreno , on the other hand , has great skills for this system problem is , he s coming off an acl injury and has always been inconsistent that s why the broncos drafted ronnie hillman , a small but elusive spaceoriented runner , in the third round hillman should have no trouble surpassing downhill pounder lance ball on the depth chart you might think it s vital for the broncos to have an offensive line that can keep manning upright but manning , with his impeccable pocket mobility and awareness , has always been able to keep himself upright that doesn t mean he won t be grateful for his front five this year it may be the best he s ever played behind it is , however , a better runblocking than passblocking unit left tackle ryan clady is the star he has stellar athleticism and , most of the time , solid technique the statistics from last season that suggest clady struggled are mostly misleading he had a few mental gaffes but , most of the time , he nailed tough assignments with no tight end or running back help opposite clady , secondyear right tackle orlando franklin can be a load in the run game , but he must develop quicker feet and sounder technique , especially in pass protection inside , center jd walton and guards chris kuper and zane beadles form an excellent threesome none are perfect , but all have just enough power to survive in tight spaces and the mobility to stretch outside they function well as a unit , too to develop some muchneeded interior depth \( and perhaps have insurance in case kuper can t bounce back from the horrendous ankle injury he suffered in week 17 or the broken forearm he sustained in training camp \) , the broncos spent a fourthround pick on philip blake , a 26yearold from baylor who primarily plays center but has some experience at right tackle defense it was john fox and coordinator dennis allen s stalwart defense that pulled the broncos out of the mud and carried them to a division title last season but this unit has been largely retooled since then allen is now the head coach in oakland his replacement , former jaguars coach jack del rio , should be every bit as proficient all three levels of the defense have experienced notable changes defensive tackles broderick bunkley , marcus thomas and ryan mcbean left in free agency at linebacker , dj williams is suspended for the first six games in the secondary , brian dawkins retired and starting corner andre goodman was released replacing goodman may have been elway s second finest accomplishment this past offseason he signed 25yearold tracy porter , a risktaking playmaker who made several significant highlights as a saint porter doesn t quite have the physicality to thrive in the aggressive pressman coverage that this defense frequently played last year , but del rio s predilection for classic zone coverages could change the defensive approach anyway in offcoverage , porter can be an electric , fluid playmaker porter is capable of sliding inside and covering the slot , but the broncos may have stumbled upon a nickelback gem in undrafted secondyear pro chris harris he was very solid down the stretch in 2011 still , his body of work is not large enough to merit serious trust yet that s why the broncos pounced when buffalo released veteran corner drayton florence florence is a strong shortarea defender who can play inside or outside rounding out the cornerbacking group is , of course , champ bailey remarkably , the 14thyear veteran has shown virtually no sign of decline bailey still shadows the opposing team s top receiver almost every week , and offenses still think twice about throwing his way there have been whispers about him moving to safety perhaps that will happen if this year s fourthround pick , cornerback omar bolden , fulfills his high athletic potential and avoids the knee problems that hounded him in college but that day , if it ever comes , is still well down the road for now the safeties will be last year s fourthround pick quinton carter and freeagent pickup mike adams frankly , it s not a great tandem carter gets exposed in man coverage \( which the broncos asked their safeties to play frequently in sub packages last season \) and adams , though versatile , is ordinary the broncos would love to see physical 2011 secondrounder rahim moore claim a starting spot , but he s been upanddown thus far depth in the secondary will be critical if fox and his staff use their nickel and dime packages as often as they did late last season the sub packages are where they can let secondyear stud von miller roam the front seven or line up as a speedrusher along the edge miller is worth building entire defensive packages around uncommon strength and fluidity , as well as sensationally quick hands , could make him the best pass rusher in the league by season s end while that part of natural progression plays out , miller , in the meantime , must dedicate himself to improving his surveying skills as a firstand seconddown strongside linebacker the broncos only other veritable passrusher , elvis dumervil , also happens to be a better player in nickel and dime packages at 248 pounds , the seventhyear veteran doesn t have the girth to anchor against the run or get off blocks inside against the pass \( though , to his credit , he s not an outright liability in this sense \) what he does have is an unusual 511 stature that creates great natural leverage when blended with his quick first step another reason denver s defense came alive late last season was dumervil busted out of a twomonth slump in november miller and dumervil make for a potent duo on passing downs , though the rest of the front seven could struggle in those situations until athletic stallion dj williams returns the broncos have a heady , fairly fluid passdefending linebacker in wesley woodyard , but he s it they still need someone to fill in for williams secondyear pro mike mohamed has been floated as a possibility , though a seemingly more sensible solution would be secondyear pro nate irving the book on irving coming out of north carolina state was agile , athletic and adept at making reads in space it s those traits that got him drafted in the third round , rather than in the sixth like mohamed but for various reasons , irving barely saw the field in 2011 in the playoffs , denver turned to middle linebacker joe mays in nickel instead mays doesn t have the changeofdirection quickness to thrive in coverage he is , however , a superb rundefender who plays well in traffic and has good instincts that can override his soso speed when hunting down ballcarriers outside his physicality in the middle will be particularly crucial when the finesseoriented woodyard is filling in for the thundering williams all of these linebackers jobs will be tougher in 2012 because they most likely won t get as much protection playing behind this year s crop of defensive tackles four years ago , a starting duo of justin bannan and ty warren would have made a defensive coordinator giddy but bannan , though still very good as an inside run anchor , is now 33 and will probably need to be in a rotation warren , 31 , has missed virtually two full years with a hip and triceps injury he has to prove he can still play , let alone perform at a high level if he can t , kevin vickerson , a serviceablebutfarfromdynamic rotational player , will assume a heavier load or , the broncos could just turn to their secondround rookie , derek wolfe he was not a highly regarded prospect coming out of cincinnati , as scouts trumpeted his hustle more than his explosiveness elway , however , was struck by wolfe s consistent productivity on film on the outside , starter robert ayers is an athletic run defender opposite dumervil however , with jason hunter possibly out for the year with a triceps tear , and with fifthround rookie passrushing specialist malik jackson and 2011 seventhrounder jeremy beal vying for backup reps , there s not much to be particularly excited about with the defensive end position as a whole special teams kicker matt prater was successful on a few pressurepacked attempts last season and , as a reward , got a lucrative fouryear , 13 million contract over the summer punter britton colquitt led the league in total punting yards last season , thanks to tebow he ranked eighth in average net punting denver s return game is not very dynamic , with receivers matt willis and eric decker expected to handle most of the load bottom line the broncos are a much better team than they were a year ago , but that doesn t mean they ll run away with the division it will take some time for manning and the rest of the offense to get acclimated to one another , and even then , there may not be enough ballhandling talent to make it work predicted finish 3 afc west

here is how disappointment works in the real world you go out to dinner and one of the dishes is not up to snuff , a fact you make clear by not eating it the waiter notices if you do n't seem like a jerk and the restaurant is a good one , he will take the item off the bill or perhaps bring you a free dessert everyone goes home feeling good what we should expect , and demand , online is more complicated derry stover , a 27yearold environmental health analyst in nebraska , needed a new laptop battery he checked the reviews of the electronics vendor mambate on the buycom shopping site consumers love mambate nearly all its reviews 97 percent are favorable , giving it an overall rating approaching perfect only 3 percent were negative and none were neutral reassured he was in good hands , mr stover bought a battery for 3298 , plus shipping it was a purchase he regretted the battery did not hold its charge well mr stover gave mambate a neutral review of 3 , something that apparently no customer had ever done before mambate got in touch immediately if mr stover was dissatisfied , he was told , he could ship the battery back for a full refund the vendor would even send a prepaid label to make it easier but mambate presented another possibility , according to emails mr stover forwarded to me here it is , verbatim if you would like to keep this item , we could refund you 799 and offer 1 year warranty but could you please change the feedback rate to 4 \? as we value your shopping experience with our store and is that acceptable \? two followup emails from mambate insisted in equally broken english that it really , really wanted to clear up the issue in the end , mr stover took the deal morally inexcusable on my part \? yes , but hey , i had just finished up my master s program with a mound of student loan debt we 're all in debt these days , which is one reason we 're buying online and who in mr stover s position could resist getting a better price on an inferior product \? even if we thereby make it harder for those who come after to know what the real score is \? mambate , which sometimes seems to be rendered as mambate , is based in brooklyn as with many internet vendors , it is unclear who is running the site or where they are from i wondered about this because on mambate s about page , scarcely a sentence is written in traditional english for example delivery lead time is significantly shorter as our headquarters and shipping department was seated in new york a spokeswoman for mambate said that appearances to the contrary , it did not trade cash for favorable reviews it is our practice to offer a partial refund as compensation for any unsatisfactory customer experience , the site s general manager , sharon wang , said in an email it was not our intent to imply that the refund was related to a request for a ratings change buycom also said the whole thing was an aberration , customer service gone a little too far an isolated incident , the chief marketing officer , bernard luthi , called it perhaps , although it s hard to see why mr stover would have been singled out for exceptional treatment it is hard not to suspect that across the internet , a lot of unhappy customers are being bought off this way the result is a distorted picture of excellent merchandise and topnotch service when the reality is somewhat less mr stover remains impressed by mambate not its skill at merchandising but at managing its reputation what s interesting , he wrote to me , is how calculated their approach was i did n't give a negative review , i gave a neutral review , and they did n't ask for a 5 , but a 4 rating sly effective , too this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
on saturday night in massachusetts , a jim thorpefabio hybrid in a new england patriots uniform will emerge from the foxborough shadows with all the confidence granted by good looks , athletic gifts and the homefield advantage tom brady , the quarterback ideal a threetime champion married to a worldfamous model so laserlike in his throws that he could hit the 11 bus in boston , 30 miles away in the numbers no question brady , 34 , is living an american male fantasy , a faustian swirl of physical prowess , sexual aura , weekly heroics and fame he s so cool that he can wear uggs and get away with it but when the patriots meet the in a divisional playoff game at gillette stadium , brady will not be the most riveting athlete on the field he wo n't even be the most riveting quarterback that honor will belong to a young bronco named perhaps you 've heard of him tebow , 24 , is the quarterback question mark he 'd rather run than throw another wobbly pass that would n't make a pop warner football highlight reel he is an unmarried , selfdeclared virgin with no supermodel on his arm he is a devout christian who thanks his lord and savior so often that had jesus telling him enough already yet , somehow , this nfl sophomore who has been denver s starting quarterback for all of 12 games has upended cynical assumptions about professional athletics to become more than an unlikely playoff contender and the country s favorite active athlete , as declared by a recent poll by espn tim tebow is now a cultural touchstone espn s sportscenter dedicated an hourlong program to tebow on thursday , triggering a case of nationwide twitter hyperventilation some fans are wearing broncos jerseys with tebow s number and jesus' name around the world , people are tebowing kneeling in prayer , with head resting on one hand , oblivious to surroundings , just as tebow does after victories still , when a wedding party tebows in las vegas , or a couple tebows on abbey road in london , or two scuba divers tebow underwater in belize , it can be hard to tell whether they are celebrating or mocking him for his virtuous ways what , exactly , is it about tim tebow that so fascinates and provokes us \? why do some people project onto him the best of this country \( humility , tenacity , plain old decency \) and the worst \( sanctimoniousness , overexposure , political intolerance \) \? part of the answer may lie in the way he seems oblivious to the throaty roars that envelop him on and off the field , as though tebow is always tebowing , whether kneeling or standing up it seems a stretch to interpret his calm indifference as a particularly arrogant strain of piety more likely , it is his way of saying that none of this the rahrah football sunday , followed by the weeklong football kremlinology is what truly matters tebow may not think that tebow is what matters , but much of the country apparently does why \? legions of pundits , writers and insomniac callers to latenight radio have analyzed the subject but maybe no investigation or deep sociological inquiry is required maybe the key to the tebow phenomenon is just this he wins games what s more , tebow tends to win in the closing minutes , against considerable odds and amid the persistent doubts about his ability by the football establishment he often can seem like a regular guy suddenly thrust into the middle of a professional football game , only to win by summoning a superhuman will that we all wish we had finally , and it cannot be denied , tebow s very public conviction about his faith resonates \( is n't he a model for how to live \? \) , intrigues \( how can he be so certain \? \) or annoys \( ca n't he keep it in the church pew \? \) if he were not in the playoffs , perhaps we would not care as much but since he is , his extraordinary athleticism and proven heroics including two college championships and a heisman trophy are routinely forgotten in favor of a more mystical possibility to date , there s no hard evidence of any divine intervention instead , the tebow effect conforms to a more familiar narrative that of fans seeing what they want to see hero or villain , the genuine article or another fraud in a person who plays sports for a living tebow s background reads like a movie script rejected for being too improbable the son of christian baptist missionaries born in the philippines after his mother rejected recommendations to end the lifethreatening pregnancy with an abortion homeschooled in florida on to a public high school to play football on to the university of florida , where he placed biblical citations john 3 16 or philippians 4 13 on black bands beneath his eyes in 2009 , a reporter at a news conference asked tebow whether he was saving himself for marriage when the virile young college hero answered yes , many in the room were so dumbstruck that he jokingly wondered whether he had just stunned the reporters into silence \( of course , a playboy playmate and others were soon volunteering to free him of his virginity \) by the time tebow was selected in the first round of the nfl draft in 2010 , older fans could be forgiven for recalling a story from 1985 about sidd finch , a rookie pitcher who supposedly showed up at a mets training camp throwing 168mileanhour fastballs he had grown up in an english orphanage , studied in tibet , played the french horn , and was entirely fictional part of an april fool s day hoax perpetrated by george plimpton and sports illustrated but the tebow story was true almost too good to be true while some athletes swan around at gentlemen s clubs , he plays flashlight tag with his family while some athletes dedicate themselves to video games in their free time , he visits hospitals and prisons , and goes to the philippines in the offseason as part of a ministry to help orphans those who distrust this kind of faithbased outreach , perhaps because they detect a conservative political agenda behind it all , found an aha moment during the 2010 super bowl in a 30second commercial paid for by focus on the family , an evangelical christian nonprofit organization , tebow and his mother told the story of his birth a miracle baby and her choice not to have an abortion there was no tebowing that week in the halls of planned parenthood last season , in his rookie year with the broncos , tebow mostly played a backup role one can only imagine how his imperfect throwing motion and preference for bulling through the defensive line ached the teeth of john elway , the legendary broncos quarterback the passperfect tom brady of his day who this year became the team s executive vice president for football operations tebow began this season on the bench as well but when the broncos fell to 13 , and were in the midst of losing a fourth game against the san diego chargers , the muchmaligned backup stepped in to start a gripping comeback the broncos lost the game , but tebow won the right to start at quarterback this epithetaverse quarterback led the broncos to victories in seven of their next eight games , often in lastminute , unorthodox ways against the kansas city chiefs , for example , he threw the ball only eight times and connected only twice although one was for a 56yard touchdown in the fourth quarter and against the chicago bears , he somehow led his team to a 1310 victory in overtime after the broncos had trailed , 100 , with less than three minutes to play in regulation decent people who are proud of their faith , do good things and succeed in life tend to irritate some of us they remind us of our private failures , so , naturally , we hope they stumble spectacularly facefirst into the mud and those who dislike tebow were rewarded when the broncos lost the final three games of the regular season in living rooms around the country , some people were gleefully channeling billy crystal s parody of edward g robinson in the ten commandments where s your messiah now , moses \? but the broncos backed into the playoffs then , on sunday , in the first seconds of overtime against the favored pittsburgh steelers , tebow threw a pinpoint , bradylike pass for a winning touchdown to extend his team s improbable season in a game that was the highestrated television show since last year s super bowl , tebow threw for 316 yards add john and a colon , and it becomes one of the biblical citations he used to paint on his face holy vince lombardi ! the broncos' season may very well end in foxborough on saturday night , at the hands of an ideal quarterback who throws rockets from the pocket but at least tim tebow has made more than a few people think about life beyond the gridiron and new england fans might take note of this the other day , luke ravenstahl , the mayor of losing pittsburgh , made good on a friendly bet he put on a broncos jersey , knelt down in his city s roberto clemente memorial park and tebowed
as the union governor of virginia , francis h pierpont was in a unique position virginia was , of course , a confederate state , but the mountainous western counties had broken away to remain part of the united states by may 1862 his constituents were ready to make things official on his desk on the second floor of the customs house in wheeling , an ohio river city of 14 , 000 residents , was a bill calling for the creation of a new state , carved primarily from the western counties of virginia the creation of west virginia was made possible by secession , but it was also a long time coming freeing the western counties from the political domination of the tidewater and piedmont slaveholders had been a goal of pierpont , an abolitionist lawyer from fairmont , for years with the bulk of the state s wealth along the coast , the slaveholding elite and their defenders had kept tightfisted control of state spending , largely ignoring western pleas for turnpikes and railroads the only internal improvements they would support was the wildly impractical james river and kanawha canal , a waterway longer than the erie canal and one that was to cross mountains once pierpont was elected unanimously by the wheeling convention that rejected virginia s secession in may 1861 , he and his colleagues set their sights on statehood as a convention , they dared gov john letcher to bring them forcibly back under richmond s control instead , they declared all the state offices from letcher s on down vacant pierpont also had to plead with the lincoln administration to be recognized as the state s legitimate government and have its representatives and senators seated in congress there were no guarantees indeed , it was already clear that washington would not intercede to support the wouldbe breakaway prounion counties of eastern tennessee the western virginians also needed protection the few thousand muskets that the governor of massachusetts sent their way were a nice symbol of unionstate solidarity but not enough to hold their own against the bushwhackers authorized by letcher s government , its militia companies that had captured the harper s ferry arsenal , and the confederate armies rolling into virginia their prayers for federal troops were finally answered when gen george b mcclellan crossed into virginia with regiments of ohio volunteers in the fall of 1861 now , led by pierpont , loyal virginians were raising their own volunteers to hold their ground they had already put to flight a cluster of confederate sympathizers , if not true soldiers , at philippi in june 1861 securing the western counties was the first order of business for pierpont and mcclellan over the fall and winter they failed while there were a few battles at rich mountain and romney large skirmishes , actually in the mountains and in southwestern virginia , mcclellan , headquartered in grafton , wrote to my great regret i find that the enemies of the united states continue to carry on a system of hostilities prohibited by the laws of war individuals and marauding parties are pursuing a guerrilla warfare , firing upon sentinels and pickets , burning bridges , insulting , injuring and even killing citizens , because of their union sentiments , and committing many kindred acts left unsaid was the guerrillas success in disrupting passenger rail service from baltimore to wheeling for six months the union government tapped a leading legal scholar , francis lieber , to define what these bands were freebooters , marauders , brigands , partisans , spies , rebel , highway robbers and how they should be treated when captured after much hemming and hawing , lieber concluded that bushwhackers unite the fourfold characteristics of the spy , the brigand , the assassin , and the rebel and cannot be treated as a fair enemy with that as guidance , mcclellan and other military leaders vigorously applied the hard hand of war to civilian secessionists at the start , those suspected guerrillas and disloyalists who were not executed were held at camp carlile near wheeling as their numbers grew , they were taken to camp chase , close to columbus , ohio , and others even farther away to places like delaware the gettough policy of union commanders and pierpont s restored government had minimal effect in curbing the insurgency following a streetbystreet gun battle in wytheville , union troops found themselves in a no quarter fight as the soldiers , citizens , and even women fired from their houses , both public and private in retaliation , the colonel commanding reported , we burned the town to ashes mcclellan was hailed as a hero for saving northwestern virginia from destruction and spoliation by spring 1862 federal and state troops loyal to the union controlled the lines of communication , especially the railroad , the strategic mountain passes and the principal population centers near the ohio at no point during the civil war did the restored government of virginia control much of what is now west virginia that limited success raised an important question if things were stable , and union victory possible , why go through the difficulties of creating a new state \? wouldn t the two be reunited after the war \? in speaking to the special session of the legislature on may 6 , 1862 , pierpont , who was both directing the virginia governmentinexile and pushing for western virginia statehood , recalled the reasons a new state was nevertheless necessary the barrier is so great that no artificial means of intercourse have ever been made beyond a mud turnpike road , he said all the trade and commerce of the west is with other states , and not with eastern virginia the two sections are entirely dissimilar in their social relations and institutions while the east is largely interested in slaves , the west has none , and all the labor is performed by freemen the subject of the division of the state has been agitated at one time and another ever since i can remember even before the legislature began its debate , he was being begged to leave his virginia office to govern the new state pierpont said i can t go i have to look after virginia as brave as these words were , pierpont s government was struggling to organize and arm for its defense against the conspirators and usurpers at richmond and their aiders and abettors a year into the war from an office with a bare table , a half quire of paper and a pen and ink , pierpont scrambled to do as much as he could with what he had he quickly enlisted another unionist , john list , to lead a cavalry detachment to the region s banks and ensure that the hard currency held in their vaults did not travel across the mountains to richmond most of pierpont s job , though , involved managing the flood of minutiae of a state government at war certificates of qualification and election , invoices , bonds , oaths of allegiance to the restored government and the union , commissions for army officers especially being pressed by field commanders , election returns , proceedings , reports , resignations , proclamations , maps and special orders to state banks , railroads , turnpike operators and county officials controlling the local level politically was bedeviling even without a war pierpont , who had never held elective office , looked upon the courthouse cliques the sheriff and the county court that combined all three branches of government in its magistrates as mere toadies and timeservers , who rewarded themselves with fat jobs and contracts now many of them were out of office because they refused to swear allegiance to pierpont s government and the union , a precondition to holding on to their old positions some joined the night riders it was quite a feat no other union governor , with the possible exception of hamilton rowan gamble of missouri , in the first year of the war had to work as closely with military commanders as pierpont no other union governor had to establish civil government behind the advance of union armies , as pierpont was often asked to do in northern virginia and from the atlantic ocean to williamsburg even in the mountainous west , his emissary to pocahontas county , the rev samuel hall young , had to wait for the troops of the ohio 23d to settle the horse thieves and bushwhackers there before moving in to set up civilian control all the while , the lincoln administration was scrutinizing events in wheeling although the heavy fighting in virginia had moved far to the east , the idea of reorganizing governments and even creating new states in prounion or unionheld sections of confederate states had political appeal in an election year there were possibilities in eastern tennessee , western arkansas , northern alabama and mississippi , and perhaps even louisiana close to new orleans the president had already appointed military governors in those states and wanted to hold elections in them to restore civil authority still , as 1862 progressed , despite holding two elections in the sections of virginia held by the union army , the work of reestablishing civil governments at the local level showed little progress in faraway fairfax , close to washington , a meeting of loyal citizens petitioned him to open the polls to end their present condition of anarchy ultimately , the wheeling government selected 50 counties , all of them west of the shenandoah valley \( and thus safe from immediate confederate control \) to form a new state the united states senate voted to admit west virginia on july 14 , 1862 , and the house concurred that december on june 20 , 1863 , west virginia became the newest state in the union pierpont , meanwhile , continued on as head of the prounion virginia government , and after the war andrew johnson appointed him provisional governor he was pushed out in 1868 , however , after which he returned to private law practice in west virginia today a statue of the father of west virginia stands in the capitol s statuary hall as a hero of the mountain state follow disunion at or join us  john grady , a former editor of navy times and a retired director of communications at the association of the united states army , is completing a biography of matthew fontaine maury he is also a contributor to the navy s
voters in nevada will have to make an actual choice , a federal judge there ruled on wednesday to combat voter apathy after watergate , nevada essentially institutionalized the protest vote , allowing voters to choose none of these candidates in elections for statewide and presidential candidates but the ruling , by judge robert c jones of the united states district court in nevada , means it is almost certain to be left off the november ballot which may help the republican party mr jones ruled that because none can never win , offering that option on the ballot is unconstitutional in the complaint , obtained through courthouse news service , some of the plaintiffs , financed by the republican national committee , expressed concern that voters would protest by choosing none of the above and be disenfranchised when they would otherwise choose mitt romney and the republican incumbent in the competitive united states senate race , dean heller two electoral college electors for mr romney are also on the list of plaintiffs , as are a registered democrat and independent none has never won , but some believe it served as a spoiler in the 1998 senate race harry reid , now the senate democratic leader , beat john ensign by 428 votes 8 , 125 people voted for none the lawsuit was filed against nevada s secretary of state , ross miller , whose office argued that voting for none was essentially the same as not voting , which citizens have always had the right to do mr miller , a democrat , said in a statement that he is planning an immediate and expedited appeal to protect the longstanding public interest of the none of these candidates option mr jones issued only an oral ruling , but promised to offer his written reasoning before sept 7 , when ballots must be ready for printing
with tom brady set to become the second quarterback to start five super bowls , the fifth down is comparing his body of work to some of the sport s greatest performers in the game that decides it all they say you cannot compare players from different eras they being roughly everyone who read tuesday s installment of the qb files , which compared tom brady with john elway so , what would the same people have to say about comparing brady with terry bradshaw \? while the eras certainly were quite different , brady and bradshaw are not entirely dissimilar each contributed relatively little statistically in his first super bowl \( relying heavily on a hardhitting defense to keep the score close \) and each blossomed into a 300yard passer over the course of his four super bowl appearances  in just over half as many passing attempts , bradshaw threw for nearly as many yards and more touchdowns than brady his average of 1109 yards per attempt would break the singleseason record , set by sid luckman in 1943 \( now we are really comparing eras ! \) brady has limited his turnovers more , but bradshaw threw three of his four interceptions in a cakewalk against the rams in 1980 , so they did not prove costly advantage bradshaw bradshaw was replaced as the team s starting quarterback for part of the 1974 season by coach chuck noll , but was able to regain his job in time to lead the team to its first super bowl win brady started the 2001 season as drew bledsoe s rarelymentioned backup by the end of the season he was the super bowl mvp while not a situation where an advantage can clearly be determined , it is interesting that each player spent part of a championship season on his team s bench , but still was able to win the title game bradshaw s team was loaded from top to bottom over the course of the team s dynastic run , as the steel curtain featured the alltime greats joe greene , jack ham , jack lambert and mel blount brady has had some famous teammates in richard seymour , tedy bruschi , junior seau and others , but at this point none of them resonates with the power of those vaunted pittsburgh teams advantage bradshaw brady seemingly has met his match in bradshaw while more accurate and less prone to turnovers in the super bowl than bradshaw , brady has not been as explosive offensively , and that glaring loss to the giants seems to give bradshaw all the edge he would need should brady win a fourth ring sunday , then it would be worth taking another look at their r sum s
emmit powell hesitated when he was asked to talk about the city of san francisco s efforts to promote his popular barbecue restaurant as the anchor of a showcase redevelopment project in the fillmore district the venture led to his financial ruin i went through a lot there , and i do n't really want to go back into that situation , said mr powell , a onetime gospel singer , real estate investor and restaurateur it was devastating for me i lost my business i lost my home i lost my property i do n't want to blame them , because i do n't think it would do any good for 30 years , mr powell ran the popular barbecue joint powell s place in hayes valley the fillmore neighborhood redevelopment project was closed in 2009 , and today mr powell s former restaurant and 360 , 000 in san francisco redevelopment agency loans that he could not repay exist only as line items in a new city controller s audit the agency is being criticized for handing out millions of dollars without proper controls or even standards for evaluating whether grants and loans did any good , and then making inadequate efforts to collect loan payments the state supreme court this week gave gov jerry brown approval to shut down the state s approximately 400 redevelopment agencies , a move that mr brown said would free 17 billion to help reduce the state s budget deficit civic leaders including mayors ed lee of san francisco and jean quan of oakland said the decision would destroy a program that revitalized some of the most blighted parts of their cities time and time again , san francisco has demonstrated that when redevelopment is used to its fullest potential , it can deliver results , mr lee said on dec 29 , citing the south of market redevelopment projects yerba buena gardens and mission bay as examples of successes but critics of the redevelopment agencies said they were little more than slush funds for city officials to spend on other projects or to dole out to political allies and friends and the recent audit of the fillmore redevelopment area by the city s controller s office concluded that there was virtually no oversight of the money tiffany bohee , the redevelopment agency s executive director since october , said new systems have been created to monitor spending and contract performance you 're talking about righting historic wrongs , she said of the fillmore project sometimes it works sometimes it does n't but that was before my time gabriel metcalf , executive director of san francisco planning and urban development , a nonprofit research firm , said redevelopment agencies had used many strategies some of them worked , and some of them did n't , he said the same agency that made mission bay happen also gave out money to community groups in other areas without as much to show for that the san francisco redevelopment agency was created in 1948 to modernize parts of the city the first and most famous of those efforts involved razing , and in some cases moving , hundreds of fillmorearea victorian row houses occupied by black families , and eliminating dozens of blackowned businesses just west of downtown san francisco the fillmore street jazz scene , which thrived in the 1940s , faded away critics said the redevelopment agency s fillmore jazz district plan , established in 1995 , was an attempt to make amends for those urban renewal efforts they said that by the time the redevelopment program was closed in 2009 , the agency had squandered millions of dollars in grants , loans , contracts and subcontracts , leaving behind a few highrise condominium buildings , a neighborhood of empty storefronts and lingering resentments this was the agency s attempt to do penance for its past sins , said barbara meskunas , who from 2005 to 2009 served on the western addition redevelopment area s project area committee london breed , who served on the redevelopment agency commission from 2005 to 2011 , said the agency s fillmore project was hampered by unrealistic expectations the goal was to try to reinvent a district that was long gone , to try to artificially create something , she said in the case of the fillmore , we 've not succeeded fred blackwell , executive director of the redevelopment agency from 2007 to 2011 , said that some very good things had come out of the redevelopment but none of them atones for degradation of community that happened in the late '60s or early '70s , he said and frankly , i do n't think there was any way for the redevelopment agency to atone for that decades later in all , the san francisco redevelopment agency listed 30 contracts and programs totaling 574 million that were aimed at reviving the jazz entertainment district the agency handed out 58 million to finance the fillmore jazz district revolving loan program and 225 million for an apartment building yoshi s , a jazz club in oakland , received a 44 million loan in 2007 to open a branch on fillmore street in 2008 the club received 28 million more the fillmore street business has struggled , in part because of a lack of demand for jazz in that location , said kaz kajimura , the club s founder to stay afloat , the club has branched out to rb and rap jazz was getting harder and harder to make the business out of , mr kajimura said , adding that the fillmore club did not become profitable during a normal month until november 2011 \( he said that a previous december had been profitable because of holiday parties and banquets \) in 2005 , the redevelopment agency lent 17 million to the restaurant 1300 on fillmore street in 2007 , the agency lent the restaurant 350 , 000 more , and in may 2008 , 852 , 000 more in october 2008 the restaurant s owners said they needed another 1 million to stay in business , according to city records the agency lent them 100 , 000 , and 1300 is still in business ross mirkarimi , a former city supervisor who asked for the controller s audit , said many of the agency s grants had not been large enough to be effective it was sort of pocket money instead , said mr mirkarimi , whose district included the fillmore neighborhood of all the projects in the fillmore redevelopment area , the relocation of powell s place seemed to generate the most initial enthusiasm in 2005 , after three decades in business , mr powell said , the redevelopment commission approached him they came and said , we can introduce you to the manager of the fillmore center they have some buildings , property up there , he said we would like to see you go there because of the history of the restaurant we want to make it a jazz heritage center and return afroamerican businesses into the area and i was the anchor to go in there and get other businesses in in addition to a 360 , 000 loan , he mortgaged his house and a property in oakland to pay for improvements to the fillmore property but the restaurant remained closed for six months while mr powell waited for various permits , although he continued to owe lease payments by the time he opened he was 60 , 000 in arrears on loan payments in november 2007 the restaurant closed the controller s audit said the redevelopment agency never tried to collect the outstanding 360 , 000 loan

jim palmer was preparing for a broadcast at camden yards last wednesday when the scoreboard showed history unfolding in seattle felix hernandez , the mariners ace , had reached the ninth inning of a perfect game , and palmer , the baltimore orioles hall of fame righthander , had to watch palmer had been there before on june 16 , 1973 , he retired the first 25 texas rangers hitters at memorial stadium two outs from perfection , palmer fell behind the texas catcher , ken suarez , 20 , and challenged him with a fastball suarez chopped a single through the middle , the price palmer paid for refusing to risk a walk i had already pitched a nohitter , palmer said , referring to a game in 1969 so i was going for the perfect game palmer watched with particular interest as hernandez fell behind his final hitter , sean rodriguez , also 20 instead of a fastball , hernandez toyed with rodriguez by breaking off a slider for a strike it was a clear signal that hernandez had extreme confidence in his stuff , and rodriguez soon struck out , sending safeco field into delirium it was the first perfect game in mariners history , but the third in the majors this season , after philip humber of the chicago white sox \( who also threw his in seattle \) and matt cain of the san francisco giants this is the first season ever with three perfect games , and hernandez s gem was the sixth since july 2009 historically , the outbreak of perfect games defies explanation in the entire decade of the 1970s , only three pitchers carried perfect games into the ninth inning palmer and pittsburgh s ken brett gave up hits the chicago cubs milt pappas issued a twoout walk before retiring his final batter there were no perfect games in the 1890s , 1910s , 1930s or 1940s , either but the most recent extended stretch came from may 8 , 1968 \( catfish hunter \) , to may 15 , 1981 \( len barker \) , a period that covered the prime years of some of the game s most durable and celebrated arms nine pitchers threw 2 , 400 innings in the 1970s gaylord perry , phil niekro , steve carlton , palmer , ferguson jenkins , tom seaver , bert blyleven , don sutton and nolan ryan all are in the hall of fame none pitched a perfect game so why are there so many now \? yankees manager joe girardi , who caught the fourth and final perfect game of the 1990s , by david cone , was stumped there s a lot of guys with high velocity and guys with outstanding breaking balls , girardi said still , in saying that , it s kind of shocking i would say it s random , because no matter what , as good as your stuff is that day , there s still luck involved , that a guy doesn t get a swinging bunt with two strikes , or he doesn t get a bloop over the infielder s head i mean , there s still luck so i just think it s a coincidence palmer offered a few theories , including advanced scouting reports that predict where each batter will hit the ball , thus putting fielders in better position he also said that talented pitchers could exploit today s wider strike zone , and that hitters were more accepting of strikeouts now than they used to be cain had 14 strikeouts in his masterpiece , tying sandy koufax s 1965 record for the most in a perfect game , and hernandez had 12 yet humber had only nine strikeouts , and mark buehrle \( 2009 \) and dallas braden \( 2010 \) each had just six and while the perfect game cluster is unusual , baseball has experienced other , sudden surges in nohitters , even before the current era of steroid testing the 1990 and 1991 seasons each included seven nohitters , similar to 2010 , which had six , and this season , which also has six whatever the frequency , palmer said , a perfect game s a perfect game in other words , always special and the circumstances often defy logic against the yankees in 1967 , palmer came close to perfection by facing the minimum 27 batters and allowing only a single to horace clarke , who was erased on a double play but palmer had nothing i got a cortisone shot so i could get out there , he said i was throwing about 80 miles an hour , and they were expecting 97 they were swinging before the ball even got there my next start , i gave up three runs in one inning in boston i was on my way to tearing my rotator cuff palmer recovered , of course , and dominated the next decade , with three cy young awards and eight 20win seasons but he was never perfect , and neither was anyone else
the nhl players association recently turned down the league s realignment proposal there are two major issues that the players have concerns about the first is the unbalanced conferences , which gives certain teams a better percent chance of making the playoffs than others the second is the unknowns surrounding the schedule and the changes in travel throughout the season most guys overwhelmingly feel that there is a big disadvantage being in a division with eight teams compared to a division with seven teams , detroit defenseman niklas kronwall told reporters the other concern is that we really don t know what the travel would be like would there be longer road trips or more backtoback games \? the unbalanced conference issue is a nobrainer it simply is not fair when you have an even number of teams in your league , there is no reason to have the percentages of making the playoffs be more or less for individual teams there is a major difference in seven teams fighting for four playoff spots and eight teams battling for another four berths even major league baseball , which many would say has the most oldschool mentality when it comes to rules , is making the change in 2013 when it moves the houston astros to the american league , leaving each league with 15 teams the way i see it , the players union had no choice but to turn down this proposal on that issue alone when it comes to the subject of travel , and the question marks that surround that issue , it gets into a bit of a gray area the players want more information about it they want to see a template of what a schedule would look like with these changes , which was not provided by the league the issue is that we asked for some documentation to figure out if they had done any travel projections , the pittsburgh penguins player representative craig adams told reporters we wanted to see how it would change the current setup , and if it would change financials up to this point , they haven t given us any information that sentiment has been echoed by many players , and their frustration has been made known but do the players have a gripe on the issue of travel \? and are all the players on the same page \? it has to be difficult for all the players to be pulling on the same rope when some feel their travel would increase while others feel it would lighten they went around and asked are you in favor , are you not in favor , adam burish of the dallas stars told reporters for the stars , it would have been great our division games , none of them are in the same time zone realignment would have been good for the stars , but would it have been good for the philadelphia flyers or the st louis blues \? probably not as much it would seem that putting dallas in a division with at least a few teams in its time zone would be fair how about for a team like the devils , who boast one of the better travel schedules in the league \? it seems as if they would be comfortable with the status quo i was surprised to hear that it didn t go through , the devils captain zach parise told reporters i didn t like the change in the playoff format , so it s not bad for us but i know some teams are going to be upset with the travel i personally like it the way it is and didn t want any changes above you have three different perspectives , from three different teams one player wants change , another wants things to stay the same and the other just wants more information therein lies the tricky subject of travel and the different perspectives players from different cities have the stars don t have a team in their division playing in the same time zone is that fair \? the columbus blue jackets and the detroit red wings are in the eastern time zone , yet they play in the western conference does that make sense \? the reality is that you are an nhl player first and part of one of the teams second at any time you can get traded or released , but you are always part of the nhlpa having as many players as possible educated on all the information is important , so that when changes come , the players are aware why it is being done and how it benefits the league as a whole the nhl had the right idea when it came out with a template for realignment but more communication from both sides will be needed if the two want to make this idea a reality
when jeremy lin signed a contract offer with houston , the knicks had to decide whether to keep their young point guard certainly the knicks had to consider a number of factors such as lin s ability to recover from his knee injury , the salary cap effects of the contract and what lin s potential would be recently i wrote about jeremy lin s prospects at knickerbloggernet i analyzed him using some advanced stats and visual evidence however , i admit that my thoughts might be subjective and prone to my own biases hence a more objective way is to use statistics to evaluate the young point guard one way to have a more balanced view of lin , is to find players with similar stats at the same age , or as it s commonly called similarity scores without getting too indepth on my method , i use a combination of shooting rates and perminute floor stats when two players are being compared , i normalize \( zscore \) the pertinent stats and then add them up in what can be called a zsum the lower the zsum , the more alike two players are by limiting the pool of players to those of the same age , i can compare players at the same part of their career curves that is , there is little use comparing a veteran at the tail end of his career to a neophyte still learning the ropes using this process , i m able to come up with a list of players who have similar statistical profiles at the same age hence by looking at the top 10 most compatible players , one could get a good idea at the ceiling and cellar for a given player at a given age for example , my similarity scores on eddy curry before the knicks signed him in 2006 would have found that he was most similar to bill cartwright , lorenzo charles , rasheed wallace , tom chambers , gary trent , joe barry carroll , tim mccormick , john wallace , eric leckner and eric white with the exception of wallace and chambers , none of these players were at all worthy of the price the knicks paid for curry to contrast , here are how the similarity scores of pau gasol would have looked that same summer there are some less than stellar players in his list , like pervis ellison , james edward , and roy hinson of his top 10 most comparable players , however , half appeared in at least one allstar game by using this objective analysis , it was clear that gasol s potential for greatness was far beyond curry s as for lin , his two most similar players are robert pack and phil ford it s difficult to glean much from these two pack played in 77 games at the age of 23 , but injuries prevented him from reaching that mark again he averaged only 37 games played over his next seven seasons meanwhile , ford s nba career lasted only seven seasons although he was highly touted as a young player , ford claims he fell out of the league because of his lackadaisical training habits , although rumors of his alcoholism followed him during and after his playing career  the interesting thing about pack and ford is that despite their subdued careers , both players had superb athleticism pack was a slam dunk contest runnerup in 1994 , and was nicknamed pacman for his monstrous dunks , occasionally gobbling defenders in his wake ford was a threetime ncaa allamerican , nba rookie of the year and a member of the allnba second team that these players are high on lin s list , speaks well of his athleticism perhaps what is most interesting about lin s similar players is the era they played most of the players on this list played before 2000 looking further down his list for modern players who are comparable to lin , one would find sergio rodriguez , t j ford , tierre brown , andre mille , and dwyane wade the reason for this disparity is lin s extremely high turnover rate at 48 turnovers per 36 minutes , few players today cough up the ball anywhere near that mark given lin s top 10 most comparable players , his future is muddled unlike gasol , lin s comparable players aren t strong enough to forecast an allstar appearance in his future nor are they as weak as curry s , which means that lin will likely be better than trolling the league for an endofabench roster spot lin does have a couple of former all stars on his immediate list , like mark jackson , tim hardaway and clyde drexler but to reach that kind of potential , he will have to do a better job of limiting his turnovers while maintaining or improving on his other stats given a full recovery from his knee injury , most likely lin will have at worst an average nba career , with the potential to be more unfortunately , statistics can t answer which path the houston point guard will actually take mike kurylo is the founder and editor of , a member of his book on the 2012 knicks , , will be released in november
oaxaca , when the rev alejandro solalinde chose to dedicate himself seven years ago to helping central and south american migrants traveling to the united states , he was an obscure country priest and the migrants moved in the shadows since then , both father solalinde and the plight of the people he serves have emerged into a very public light the crimes the migrants face extortion , rape , kidnapping and murder have become so brazen and brutal that mexicans can no longer ignore them as the horrors have multiplied , father solalinde s demands for the migrants' protection have begun to resonate things have changed a lot , father solalinde said in an interview here this week the total invisibility of not seeing the migrants , of not knowing what was happening to them , all the different abuses , which are growing more serious , more violent , has passed i have become famous because of the migrants , because people are concerned about them at the same time , his insistence that the authorities pursue the criminals preying on migrants and his accusations that the police and politicians protect and even aid the gangs have also turned him into a target in may , after receiving six death threats in two months , he decided to take precautions he left mexico , traveled through north america and europe , and then spent a few weeks resting in the mexican city of guadalajara father solalinde , 67 , did not stay away for long , though he returned this week to his beloved state of oaxaca , where he runs in ciudad ixtepec , a sweltering railroad town where migrants wait to scramble atop cargo trains that will take them on the next leg of their wearying trip to the united states more migrants will be arriving , he said , pushed by poverty and violence at home a longsuspended train service directly from the guatemalan border is being renewed that means the merchandise is coming , the captive customers , father solalinde said he expected the threats to continue as well for the criminals , he said , there is a problem father solalinde is in the way he wo n't let us do our work comfortably so we have to pressure him , threaten him , kill him so he wo n't disturb us back in the public eye again this week , father solalinde received celebrity treatment here in the state capital , where reporters crowded him and residents greeted him on the street after he left a meeting with oaxaca s governor to map out new strategies for protecting the shelter in mexico city earlier in the week , he met with federal officials , who promised additional security measures for the shelter , hermanos en el camino \( brothers in the road \) , and provided him with two new bodyguards , to add to the four state escorts who have protected him since he filed a complaint against members of the zetas drug gang in late 2010 two more guards have been assigned to the shelter even amid the threats , father solalinde said there were tentative signs of change after he spent years presenting evidence of abuses to the authorities , to no effect , a handful of state police officers have been put on trial , although none have served prison time the federal government has taken on an investigation into one prominent attack on migrants and this week presented him with a chart showing more than 40 suspects still , neither the federal nor state government has made any progress in figuring out where the latest death threats came from he seemed unperturbed about going home , though i discovered that when you are not afraid , they respect you more , he said bit by bit , i got stronger , i learned and lost the fear the story of father solalinde s mission is entwined with the slow acceptance of here for all the complaints about the mistreatment of mexican immigrants in the united states , central and south americans as they travel across mexico the , whose bodies were found in august 2010 on a ranch in the northern border state of tamaulipas , brought home the reality of the dangers to migrants the following april , the authorities found 193 bodies in mass graves not far away , many believed to be migrants kidnapped from buses traveling toward the border shared by mexico and the united states experts believe that as many as 22 , 000 migrants are kidnapped a year , based on testimony compiled by the national human rights commission in mexico but victims are usually too afraid to complain , and the families who might speak for them are far away and often ignorant of what occurred father solalinde , who talks tirelessly in full paragraphs , is determined to break that silence growing up on the wrong side of the middleclass divide in mexico city , father solalinde was always restless after joining the church , though , he seemed to settle into a comfortable existence as a parish priest in toluca , an industrial city outside the capital then he was sent to a church congress in oaxaca on his last day , laden with shopping bags filled with souvenirs , he caught sight of a group of indian women selling vegetables on the sidewalk as their children played nearby dressed in smart clothes from the united states , he was suddenly ashamed god speaks , and the voices inside cannot be quieted , he said i wanted to blackmail god i said , look , lord , of everything i have spent , i will give you 30 percent , even 50 percent of what i have bought , and i will give it to your poor' but that voice would n't be silent , father solalinde said i continued to be anxious until i gave up and i said lord , you have won you do n't want my wallet' he asked to be sent to the poorest part of oaxaca , where he lived among the mixtec indians deep in the mountains when he started building the shelter , it was still a crime to help an illegal migrant in mexico that is changing , and the roman catholic church now supports a network of about 50 shelters across mexico after lobbying from father solalinde and other advocates , congress passed a law last year that recognizes migrants' human rights and no longer makes it a crime to be in mexico illegally , although the government has yet to put the law into effect the priest s outspokenness prickles some of the church hierarchy in mexico when father solalinde left the country in may , the spokesman for the mexican church conference , msgr victor ren rodr guez , an auxiliary bishop , told reporters that the death threats were not a priority for the church at the same time , though , lawyers from the church s pastoral division have worked with father solalinde to file complaints against the abuse the migrants face there is enormous impunity in mexico , he said , vowing to continue his activism if crimes against mexicans are never punished , well even less so for those against migrants
las vegas donald trump endorsed mitt romney here thursday afternoon in a joint appearance that lasted less than seven minutes and included no questions the two men stood behind a lectern emblazoned with a gold trump plaque \( a large romney sign hung off to the side , largely out of the tv shots \) , and the endorsement came amid several impromptu news conferences that mr trump organized for himself when they finally took the stage together , mr romney uttered perhaps the truest statement of the event , which had come together in a lastminute flurry after false reports that mr trump would throw his support behind newt gingrich there are some things that you just can t imagine happening in your life , mr romney said this is one of them he proceeded largely on message , making sure to give a shoutout to mr trump s magnificent hotel , and calling his endorsement a delight then , continuing on to the message his campaign presumably wanted him to drive home , mr romney added , i m so honored and pleased to have his endorsement , and of course i m looking for the endorsement of the people of nevada promoting his own success as a businessman , mr romney said i spent my life in the private sector not quite as successful as this guy , but successful none the less as mr romney and his wife , ann , stood off to the side , mr trump then stepped up , grinning and nodding at the crowd , which offered up occasional shouts of the donald ! calling it a real honor and privilege to endorse mitt romney , mr trump added , mitt is tough , he s smart , he s sharp , he s not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love he concluded so , governor romney , go out and get em you can do it on thursday morning , mr gingrich was asked while touring a forklift manufacturer in las vegas if he was expecting mr trump s endorsement , as insiders in his campaign had told a variety of news outlets , including the new york times , the previous evening who knows \? mr gingrich said with a shrug i m just watching in amazement some people have this knack of gathering attention , he said with a laugh , referring to mr trump michael cohen , a political adviser to mr trump , said that the developerturnedreality star never gave mr gingrich an indication of an imminent endorsement he and mr trump were traveling to las vegas , mr cohen said , as the internet was lighting up wednesday night with accounts of a gingrich nod we landed and the cellphones started going , mr cohen , who is mr trump s usual conduit to political reporters , said he made no effort to throw cold water water on the erroneous reports you can t get 1 , 000 emails and start responding , he said earlier in the day , mr trump held at least two impromptu news conferences as he wandered around his hotel , pausing to answer reporters questions with relish no , he would not entertain a thirdparty or independent run if mr romney was the nominee yes , he likes mr romney s tough stance on china and all those mean things he said about the guy just months ago \? well , that was before he knew him just twiddling my thumbs , mr trump joked when asked if he planned to pass the time hanging out until mr romney arrived in fact , he explained , he was touring his hotel with his hotel people how do you like it \? he asked a group of traveling reporters , many of whom had spent the night elsewhere do you see why it s the no 1 hotel in nevada \? at another point , the crowd grew so thick that network and cable anchors , vying for mr trump s attention , seemed to spin him around like a bobblehead doll , shouting out questions from all sides when the brief endorsement wound down , mr and mrs romney , after greeting some friends in the front row , retreated offstage , as mr trump followed unable to help himself , he turned back to the room and flashed a v sign for victory , we assume before he disappeared only to reappear again , just moments later , for yet another press conference
nashville maybe the will finish their contract negotiations with r a dickey before they depart baseball s winter meetings this week maybe they will leave with a new catcher , or a capable outfielder or two or maybe none of those things will happen for a short while wednesday morning , these things seemed not to matter almost a full week after the news first emerged that the mets had signed to an eightyear , 138 million contract , the team made things official , reintroducing their longtime third baseman the player considered the face of the franchise with a lengthy , feelgood news conference i'm humbled , privileged , emotional , said wright , who was drafted by the mets as a teenager it was very important for me from day 1 that i finish what i started things have n't gone the way we would have liked the last couple of years , but that s going to change wright , who turns 30 this month , donned a crisp mets jersey and tugged on a new cap as his parents , girlfriend , agents and several mets officials watched from the front row smiles abounded the overarching theme of the day , the subtext of this entire scene , was that the mets were turning their floundering enterprise in the right direction but over the past two months , wright needed to be assured of the specifics of the continuing mets project before resuming his role as the team s centerpiece the negotiations began when jeff wilpon , the team s chief operating officer , took wright out for a burger during a lateseason trip to miami the discussion that night was about the big picture he wanted to make sure i was going to be around and nothing he was reading from all of you , that we were selling the team or going anywhere , was the truth , wilpon said to a group of reporters as we 've said from the beginning , we 're not going anywhere after the season , general manager visited wright at home in norfolk , va , where they played golf and shared a midafternoon meal wright asked alderson that day about the team s minor league system , trade possibilities and potential freeagent signings there are 100 different factors that went into this decision , but before any of them could even be taken into consideration , no 1 had to be that commitment to winning , wright said i got the answer i wanted to hear just after midnight on friday , wright and the mets agreed to the deal , which is structured to give the team slightly more financial flexibility next season than it would have had on his previous contract the deal also includes a full notrade clause wright said he never envisioned an alternative i can honestly say , i 've never pictured myself in a different uniform , and it would n't be as meaningful if i were to win somewhere else , he said whether the mets , fourthplace finishers for four straight seasons , can make the playoffs anytime soon will remain to be seen whatever the case , wright , wilpon and alderson spoke about accumulating victories with some urgency wilpon said he thought the team could compete for a playoff spot during the 2013 season there s a lot of ways to get to the postseason now , with the extra playoffs and everything , he said i think we would be competitive this year asked when the team would return to the playoffs , wright said , we are n't that far off alderson , who has been able to keep a detached view of the team , emphasized the need for victories in the near term people will subscribe to the process , and they 'll get what you 're trying to do , alderson said but at some point in time and not that far out , in terms of horizon you 've got to actually win the mets' chances for success will be easier to gauge once dickey s situation has been resolved as of wednesday , the two sides could not agree on dollar amounts for an extension , and the mets did not seem to move closer to engineering a trade wilpon , as he did last month , suggested that he did not have a problem letting dickey pitch for the mets next season without a new deal , calling his 5 million optionyear salary a bargain but that particular outcome , dickey said tuesday , would create a bad dynamic for him , and alderson said wednesday it was not preferable , from our standpoint with things appearing rather static , someone asked alderson whether he expected the mets to leave nashville with any players we 're going to leave here with david wright , alderson said and for a little while , that seemed enough
chicago preparations for the arrival of , the singer and actress and beloved product of chicago , at this city s criminal courthouse were elaborate and months in the works a private entrance was readied , a crush of news and entertainment reporters were required to sign pledges to abide by stringent rules of courtroom decorum and potential jurors were quizzed about their knowledge of american idol and dreamgirls but when ms hudson appeared , at last , in a courtroom on monday , the dizziness over her celebrated rise to stardom quickly gave way to the bleak circumstances that had brought her the shooting deaths of her 7yearold nephew , her brother and her mother in one of chicago s grittiest south side neighborhoods , englewood glamour was wiped away yes , that s my mommy , ms hudson testified on monday afternoon , when asked to look at a photograph ms hudson told jurors that she had slept in a bed with her mother until she was 16 years old even as an adult , she said , she communicated with her mother every day , often by text messages that began arriving early in the morning nothing arrived one morning in october 2008 , ms hudson testified , in her first hint that something was wrong ms hudson was the first prosecution witness called in a murder trial against william balfour , her former brotherinlaw , who prosecutors say shot ms hudson s family members in 2008 after growing jealous and possessive of his wife , julia hudson , ms hudson s sister jennifer hudson , who first drew national attention with appearances on american idol in 2004 and went on to win an oscar for her role as the singer effie in dreamgirls , was undeniably the most anticipated participant in this trial until the moment she stepped up to the witness stand , there was speculation about when and whether she would appear in the end , she answered questions for only about 30 minutes , the judge pausing to offer her time to compose herself and urging her , at one point , to speak up and slow down ms hudson said she had been traveling , in florida , in 2008 when her family members were killed , but quickly flew home , and went to the cook county medical examiner s office to identify her mother , darnell donerson , and her brother , jason hudson , both of whom were found inside the family home , as well as a young nephew , julian king , inside an suv that was taken from the home mr balfour , who went to grade school with ms hudson and who could face life in prison , has pleaded not guilty in an opening statement on monday , his lawyer suggested that ms hudson s prominence had left law enforcement authorities feeling special pressure to solve the case quickly , leading them to focus on mr balfour right away , despite a lack of physical evidence against him but a prosecutor said mr balfour , who had been estranged from julia hudson , had repeatedly threatened her , even pledging that he would kill her family first , then her the lawyers on both sides seemed to agree about only one thing a grim picture of lives in englewood , a neighborhood where the drug trade seemed to thrive and where gunshots were heard but sometimes ignored because they were too ordinary jennifer hudson told jurors she had not liked mr balfour ever , not in the sixthgrade class they attended together in englewood and not later none of us wanted her to marry him , she said of her sister i tried to keep my distance with william any chance i got , jennifer hudson told the jurors where he was , i tried not to be
the latest veteran lawmaker to be the subject of a vigorous primary challenge is the 80yearold senator richard g lugar of indiana , who is being challenged for the republican nomination by state treasurer richard mourdock mr lugar has won every race he has run since 1967 , when he was elected mayor of indianapolis , save for a close call in which he narrowly failed to defeat the longtime democratic incumbent senator birch bayh in 1974 mr lugar was elected to the senate two years later by defeating another democratic incumbent , vance hartke , in 1976 mr lugar was instrumental in passing a 1992 law that helped to secure the former soviet union s nuclear arsenal , and his genteel centerright politics are a good fit for indiana , where he has normally been reelected easily but senators and other elected officials who once seemed untouchable have become fair game for primary challenges in the last several years , and mr lugar has a formidable problem on his hands with mr mourdock the latest poll in the race , from wenzel strategies for the citizens united political victory fund , which supports mr mourdock , put mr mourdock ahead 44 to 39 percent ordinarily , the rule is that a poll commissioned by a partisan group exaggerates their candidate s standing by an average of about 6 points sometimes more and sometimes less by that measure , then , the wenzel strategies poll could be read as showing the race as more of a tossup the last nonpartisan poll of the race , from howey depauw , put mr lugar 7 points ahead , although it is now about a month old however , momentum is a considerable factor in primaries , especially when one candidate begins with a deficit in name recognition and his numbers improve as he becomes better known to voters recent polls had put mr mourdock s name recognition at only about 60 to 70 percent , which suggests he has some upside in his numbers as his name recognition continues to increase in advance of the may 8 primary meanwhile , key republican officials are certainly acting like it is mr mourdock s race to lose a super pac that had been supporting mr lugar , the american action network , has pulled out of the race mr mourdock received the endorsement of sarah palin , meanwhile , while mitt romney is conspicuously remaining neutral in the race  thus , mr lugar has probably become a modest underdog to retain his seat he had 14 million in cash on hand as of april 18 , a decent amount that should give him some chances , but not a true firewall in a state that has several different media markets , including some that cross state boundaries , and with mr mourdock s help from outside groups if mr lugar loses , it should increase democrats odds of picking up the senate seat in november democrats have a fairly good candidate in indiana in the form of united states representative joe donnelly , who represents the second congressional district and who narrowly retained his seat in a very tough environment for democrats nationally in 2010 the second district , which includes south bend and michigan city , is slightly republicanleaning relative to the country as a whole but slightly democraticleaning relative to the rest of indiana still , indiana remains a red state , despite barack obama having narrowly carried it in 2008 mr obama s victory came in part because his campaign put a great deal of effort into winning the state , relying on volunteers and media exposure in the chicago market , while john mccain s campaign put almost none in nor is mr mourdock in the christine o donnell category of candidates as the state treasurer , he is roughly as wellcredentialed as mr donnelly mr mourdock has some standard tea party lines in his platform , enough to be problematic in more urban parts of the state like indianapolis and northwest indiana still , he is not all that far outside of indiana s political mainstream not obviously more or less so than mr donnelly , who voted for mr obama s health care bill , although he has bucked his party on other issues like gunownership rights and capandtrade all of that points to a close race , and the lone poll featuring a mourdockdonnelly matchup showed the race to be an exact tie , although with both candidates lacking name recognition i d probably give a slight edge to mr mourdock on the basis of indiana s overall partisan orientation mr obama s win in 2008 , while it made for a more impressive electoral map for mr obama , may have been somewhat transient democrats did poorly in indiana in the 2010 midterms , with another united states representative , brad ellsworth , failing to mount a competitive race against a middling republican candidate in former senator dan coats mr donnelly could be in a tough spot as it regards mr obama , who may want to compete in indiana again and whose turnout operation could be key to getting democratic voters to the polls , but who now has only middling approval ratings there nevertheless , this would undoubtedly complicate republicans electoral calculus although democrats still face considerable difficulty in retaining the senate , their offensive prospects have gradually become more promising over the course of the cycle , with clear pickup opportunities in massachusetts and nevada and some prospects in arizona democrats might also hope to have a de facto pickup in maine , where the independent angus king is the clear favorite and they have essentially conceded the race to him , although mr king has yet to commit to caucusing with either party should he win if mr lugar hangs on to win , he might be somewhat more vulnerable than in past races as some issues that mr mourdock has raised , like mr lugar s residency status in indiana , could potentially be picked up upon by mr donnelly still , while it might be tempting to draw a parallel to the former democratic senator blanche lincoln of arkansas , who barely survived a primary challenge and then was defeated badly in the general election , i don t think the precedent really holds the partisan dynamics of arkansas worked against mrs lincoln , while indiana s work in favor of mr lugar , who also retains considerable appeal to independent voters a poll of the lugardonnelly matchup gave mr lugar 50 percent of the vote to mr donnelly s 29 percent it s early enough that such a deficit is not literally insurmountable , but mr donnelly would need to run a pitchperfect campaign and would probably also need mr lugar to make some further tactical or strategic errors
boston jarrod saltalamacchia emerged from a back room in the clubhouse saturday , his curly hair dried and puffed tall like a big , brown orb and he grinned and waited for his teammates' reaction check out salty ! you 've got to see this , someone shouted to david ortiz , who turned , laughed and hugged saltalamacchia , boston s first fulltime catcher since jason varitek retired this offseason you look like will ferrell in semipro , ' said the young third baseman will middlebrooks , who jogged from the other side of the room to take a look kelly shoppach shook his head , jon lester confirmed , definitely , will ferrell , and middlebrooks fetched daniel nava s white headband with the headband on , saltalamacchia , a 6foot4 , 235pound bruiser , did resemble ferrell s portrayal of the fictional 1970s basketball player , and he seemed content with the joke s success minding his own business , reliever andrew bailey said from afar he s just a 6yearold kid in a 30yearold guy s body saltalamacchia is , in fact , 27 , but he is perhaps older than 30 in baseball years the switchhitting catcher once thought he would spend his whole career with the atlanta braves , the team that had drafted him and his favorite team as a child then he thought he would settle in with the texas rangers , who landed him in the mark teixeira trade in 2007 by the time boston acquired him in 2010 , saltalamacchia was not as na ve , but he did still enjoy himself his beard is full , but wellkept , and he has not cut his hair in nearly a year at first , it had been an homage to gary carter s signature hairdo , and then later , his 5yearold daughter asked him to keep it as a young boy , saltalamacchia followed many catchers , not just carter , and in 2007 , before a bravesred sox interleague game , he sent a jersey to be signed by varitek a fellow switchhitting catcher , varitek , whose closecropped haircut epitomized professionalism , was not cocky or showy , and he was respected for that , saltalamacchia said , a natural idol varitek signed the jersey and wrote , catch with pride , and the two remained cordial , but never became good friends , until boston chose saltalamacchia as varitek s successor three years later it was like i had been on the team for years , when i got traded over , saltalamacchia said we sat down and talked , and he said , i'm here for you' he did n't look at it as anything other than he was trying to mentor me and be a friend the two could not be more different , but they bonded because they shared an obsession with the position , a tribute to the mantra varitek had wrote to saltalamacchia in 2007 some refining was necessary saltalamacchia had not played more than 100 games in a season and had never been trusted as the guy that required two steps , said boston s pitching coach , bob mcclure knowing how to prepare a game plan , which saltalamacchia could already do , and knowing how to handle pitchers' personalities , which varitek could help with varitek schooled him on josh beckett , john lackey , jon lester and the rest of the rotation , each with his own howto manual when results were not immediate , saltalamacchia needed varitek s reassurance more than he realized in 2011 , when saltalamacchia played in 103 games , while varitek , in his final season , often reminded him that his approach , technique and temperament were sound now , varitek is gone , and saltalamacchia has prospered , finally with some semblance of consistency years ago , as one of the game s top prospects , his power was considered mature friday against the , he hit his 17th home run , the most of any major league catcher this season but his batting average was not he struck out 10 times , and the home run was his only hit , playing in three of the four games this weekend and by sunday , he frowned with just six hits , four of which were homers , in his last 10 games , he has either smacked the entire ball , or none of it behind the plate he has fared better of late , as manager bobby valentine said of saltalamacchia , he s blocked the ball very well , he s called a good game i think he s turning into a very fine allaround player like his predecessor , though , saltalamacchia s throwing arm has been testable he has caught runners at a rate of 17 percent , the second lowest among catchers who have played at least 50 games he is working on that aspect of his game , collaborating with the pitchers , with whom he has been more at ease he knows it is all business with beckett and lester , but he can joke with felix doubront , franklin morales and usually anyone out of the bullpen some of the guys are real serious , and they need yelling basically , then laughter , saltalamacchia said but some of the guys need a little laughter to realize the situation s not doordie , and they pitch better then as he spoke , saltalamacchia s headband was still choking his hair , creating a sort of mushroom top , and someone had taped a picture of john mcenroe , his own headband choking his sizable hair , next to saltalamacchia s locker he leaned back and in a tender tone said it feels good to go out there and have the pitching staff look to me , and not have jason there , because jason s always been there it s nice to have them lean on me a little more
greenburgh , ny forwards may be executing most duties required to win stanley cup playoff games forechecking , blocking shots , throwing body checks but they are foundering in the most significant aspect of the game , scoring goals the topseeded rangers barely scraped past the ottawa senators \( seeded eighth \) and the washington capitals \( seventh \) in the first two rounds and find themselves struggling against the \( sixth \) as the eastern conference finals move to new jersey for game 3 on saturday afternoon tied at 11 the rangers' wingmen and centermen are averaging 15 goals a game , the lowestscoring group of forwards among the eight teams that survived the first round fortunately for them , their defensemen are the highestscoring group and their power play is ranked fifth in the postseason there is another troublesome statistic plaguing an anemic offense the rangers have averaged 13 goals a game at even strength , worst in the playoffs the rangers addressed those problems at practice friday , shaking up two line combinations and practicing threeontwos in the offensive zone coach john tortorella would not discuss tactics with reporters , but some players said the idea was to find a way to move past the devils' pinching defensemen along the boards and get the puck into the devils end to generate more offense still , the lack of scoring by the forwards made tortorella s decision to bench for 13 minutes in a 32 loss in game 2 seem all the more selfdefeating gaborik , a 41goal scorer during the regular season who has 4 goals and 6 assists in 16 playoff games , was benched after he made two mistakes that led to the devils' tying goal late in the second period tortorella did not put gaborik on the ice when henrik lundqvist was pulled in the last 90 seconds he 'll bounce back , he s a team guy , his centerman , brad richards , said after practice we 've all gone through it that s a coaching decision , not a players' decision he takes that stuff to heart we expect he 'll be one of the best players tomorrow richards s six goals in the postseason lead the team the rookie chris kreider is the only other forward with as many as four goals it was obvious i needed to do a better job on that second goal , gaborik said , referring to his failure to clear the zone in a puck battle with defenseman bryce salvador and a halfhearted attempt to block salvador s shot , which was tipped in by ryan carter i need to be better there and win those battles one physically imposing new line at practice consisted of the 6foot7 brian boyle at center , flanked by mike rupp \( 65 \) and artem anisimov \( 64 \) big , small or medium build , we play hard along the boards , tortorella said obviously that was void the other night he would not confirm if the boyleruppanisimov line would be used saturday nevertheless , boyle has gone nine games without a goal and rupp has yet to score during the playoffs anisimov has 8 points in 16 games , despite frequent fourthline relegations that have left him averaging only 14 minutes a game another line change consisted of john mitchell flanked by brandon prust and ruslan fedotenko none of those players have scored in the playoffs washington s defense did n't pinch too much they kind of played a 14 trap style , defenseman michael del zotto said but new jersey s done a good job pinching their d down the wall , and they 've been successful with that , so we have to make some adjustments there and win the puck battles on the wall look for the rangers to attack more frequently up the middle in an attempt to ignite their offense they 're not blowing the doors off us scoring goals , either , richards said it s going to be a tight series slap shots of the 35 highestsalaried players in the nhl this season , only three are still playing in the postseason , and they are all rangers brad richards , who made 12 million this season and is currently the highestpaid player in the league marian gaborik \( 75 million , tied for 18th \) and henrik lundqvist \( 6875 million , 31st \) brandon dubinsky skated before practice for the first time since injuring his right ankle in game 7 against ottawa
in his new novel , capital , john lanchester tracks the lives of several characters living and working on one london street a banker and his wife a polish house builder a muslim family running a shop a teenage west african soccer star and a political refugee who works illegally as a traffic warden , to name a few the street s residents have been receiving notes in the mail with pictures of their own houses and the cryptic message we want what you have in a recent interview via email , mr lanchester discussed fiction and nonfiction , dickens and tolstoy , immigration , the changing behavior of the english , and more below are excerpts from the conversation the organizing principle for the book is that its many characters all have a connection to pepys road , a street with houses that were mostly built in the late 19th century what was it about that particular street that inspired you to anchor the book there \? it s a fictional street at least i thought it was , though it turns out that there are a couple of real pepys roads in london , none of which was my model i was thinking of a composite of streets around near where i live in clapham , with features and properties borrowed from all around the place i liked the idea of a street that was a kind of microcosm of london in the same way that the city is a microcosm of the wider world i count about two dozen characters in the book who have at least some claim on the reader s attention and emotions , and six storylines can you trace all of that complexity back to one moment of genesis \? a scene that came to you \? or a character \? it was in the dna of the book that it would have a large number of characters and storylines i don t remember a single eureka moment when that occurred to me the family groups were always at the heart of the book , and i don t remember there being a sequence so much as i remember all of them being there all along i should say , it s an odd thing about the fiction writing process for me in that i often don t remember much about it it s as if it happens in a sort of semidream state nonfiction isn t like that at all your last book , iou , was a nonfiction look into the complicated world of finance was it tempting to get wonkier about the financial aspects of capital than you did \? it might have been if i hadn t written iou what happened was that i completed a draft of capital in early 2009 and then stuck it in a drawer for a few months , as i always do when i get to that point in a book , in order to get some perspective and see it clearly before i go back to finish it i normally promise myself that i ll do something constructive with the time take up pilates , write a screenplay but instead mess around doing nothing in particular , before i wake up with a start and go back to finish the book this time , though , i decided to use all the stuff i d found out about the world of finance , from observing the reallife crash going on i d guessed that one was coming in fact , when i started writing capital in 2006 , the whole shape of the book was based on the idea that one was coming so i had a builtin interest in the bust , and i ended up writing a nonfiction account of it , and that certainly had the effect of quarantining the novel from too much detailed explanation of financial specifics you can do a lot of things in fiction , but sustained explanation isn t one of them there are four subplots that involve people being in london and not feeling fully at home there some are there legally , some illegally , but there s an overall sense of displacement is the book meant to say any particularly pointed thing about immigration issues \? immigration is a huge issue in britain at the moment , as it is in most developed societies it speaks to me deeply as a subject , because i am a welldisguised sort of semiimmigrant myself my father was born in africa and brought up in hong kong and australia , my mother was irish , i was born in germany and brought up in asia , mainly hong kong , where we lived until i was 17 , so although my passport and everything else about me seems straightforwardly british , i have quite a strong sense of having arrived in london from somewhere else so that sense of displacement which i would also argue is a fundamental feature of modernity is something that interests me as for immigration as a political issue , the debate here is so narrow that any portrait of it in the round is bound to seem pointed , just by being at odds with the grotesquely onesided media version you write that one character , a builder named zbigniew , had once had a sense of the british as a moderate , restrained nation it was funny to think of that now it wasn t true at all how much of that reflects your own thoughts about the country \? i oscillate between thinking that something fundamental has changed in britain , in the direction of abandoning previous restraints , and conversely that what s happened is really just the reversion to a historical character that is largely intact the english used to be notorious in europe for being vulgar , obsessed with money and trade , drunk , and bellicose that changed in about 1870 , when everything became buttonedup and victorian , but now it is changing back , at speed so i veer about on this one there s something sprawling and oldfashioned about this book the novelist claire messud compared it to dickens did you have any models for it as you were writing \? i did think about the 19th century a lot not dickens so much , though i m deeply flattered and embarrassed by the comparison , but i don t see dickens as a realist and i had been brooding on the realist novel i was thinking about stendhal and balzac and tolstoy in particular , especially in terms of all the permissions they had that , i came to realize , i didn t feel i had they could know anything they wanted about characters , they could tell you anything , they could go in and out of their heads at will , they could be omniscient i thought hang on , how come writers from over a century ago had more freedom than i do \? so i gave myself a special pass to know as much as they were allowed to know do you know yet what you ll be writing next \? another novel or back to nonfiction \? i have a novel in mind , but i like to brood quite a lot before i start writing fiction , so i have a nonfiction project to write in the interim before that i m writing a short book about the london underground , as part of the celebrations for its 150th anniversary next year in the course of researching it i got to fulfill a lifetime s ambition by sitting in the front of the train with the driver
berkeley , calif xavier alvarez is a liar even the brief filed on his behalf in the united states supreme court says as much xavier alvarez lied it informs us that he has told tall tales about playing hockey for the detroit red wings , being married to a mexican starlet and rescuing the american ambassador during the iranian hostage crisis but as the brief reminds us , none of those lies were crimes another of his falsehoods , however , did violate the law in 2007 , while introducing himself at a meeting of a california water board , he said that he was a retired marine who had been awarded the medal of honor \( both lies \) he was quickly exposed as a phony and pilloried in the community and press as an idiot and the ultimate slime but his censure did not end there the federal government prosecuted him under the , which prohibits falsely claiming to have been awarded a military medal , with an enhanced penalty \( up to a year in prison \) for claiming to have received the medal of honor mr alvarez was convicted but appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , which held that the act violated the first amendment the government has taken the case to the supreme court , which is scheduled to hear arguments this week the question before the court is not whether there is a constitutional right to lie rather , it s a question about the scope of the government s power over individuals whether the government can criminalize saying untrue things about oneself even if there is no harm to any identifiable person , no intent to cheat anyone or gain unfair advantage , no receipt of anything of value and no interference with the administration of justice or any other compelling government interest the court should rule in favor of mr alvarez harmless fibbing should not be a federal offense the justice department argues that the stolen valor act serves an important government interest preserving the integrity and credibility of the military medals program false claims , it maintains , dilute the reputation and meaning of the medals but the government has offered no evidence that lies by crackpots like mr alvarez have in any way damaged the honor or prestige of medal recipients a few instances of dubious characters lying about medals does not require the government to deploy the heavy artillery of criminal sanction the united states has had military medals since the revolutionary war , but the founding fathers did n't seem to think such legal protection was necessary , and neither did congress until 2006 , when it passed the act nor has the government shown that the law is necessary and narrowly tailored to protect any valid government interest those who lie about being awarded medals could easily be exposed if the government maintained an online database of medal awardees the government could even shame known liars by publicizing their names the stolen valor act is also dangerously broad it puts satire and parody at risk of criminal prosecution the comedian stephen colbert could not safely perform a skit in which his blowhard patriot persona claimed to have a medal the act does n't require proof that anyone believed or was deceived by the false claim if the supreme court were to accept the government s argument , other disconcerting legislation could easily follow congress could enact a law that criminalized false claims by political candidates about their qualifications for office , or false claims about their opponents surely the government has an important interest in preventing voter deception but as much as we want to encourage factual accuracy in our politicians , do we really want the government to prosecute , for example , senator marco rubio , the florida republican who on his senate web site that his after rather than before fidel castro took power \? who among us has not said things about ourselves that are untrue \? who has not exaggerated or embellished details to tell a better story \? the public humiliation that follows such exposure is punishment enough the recognized constitutional remedy for false speech , as justice louis d brandeis famously said , is not suppression but more speech the court should reject congress s attempt to police what we are allowed to say about ourselves
if workplaces were fairer , domestic workers would be protected by minimumwage and antidiscrimination laws and by unemployment insurance they would also have things most employees take for granted , like meal breaks but too many nannies , caregivers and housecleaners have none of these things confirms what advocacy groups have struggled to convey that domestic workers , a vital but invisible sector of the economy , are suffering the predictable consequences of toiling behind closed doors in an unregulated industry , by nik theodore , an associate professor of urban policy at the university of illinois at chicago , and linda burnham , research director of the national domestic workers alliance , surveyed 2 , 086 workers in 14 cities it found that 23 percent of workers made less than their state s minimum wage , which must be at least 725 an hour livein workers had it worse 67 percent of them earned less than the minimum , 65 percent had no health insurance and about 82 percent had no paid sick days about 30 percent reported health problems , and 25 percent of livein caregivers said their jobs made it impossible to get five hours of uninterrupted sleep the median wage was 11 an hour for nannies , 10 an hour for caregivers and housecleaners often too little to support a family wages varied widely by ethnicity and immigration status hispanic nannies made 857 an hour , compared with 1111 for asian nannies undocumented immigrant caregivers were paid considerably less than legal residents and citizens as the study shows , domestic work in the united states lies at the crossroad of the immigrant rights and women s rights struggles participants were nearly all women , from 71 countries their experiences argue for strong policy reforms , starting with including domestic labor in the list of occupations that enjoy core federal and state workplace protections these women deserve fair treatment achieving basic rights should n't have to depend , haphazardly , on the kindness of their employers
adrian levy is coauthor of the meadow , a newly released book about the 1995 kidnappings of six foreigners in kashmir and the aftermath he and cathy scottclark , both veteran journalists , also have written books about russian artwork , pakistan s nuclear weapons and jade in the meadow , they examine al faran , the group responsible for the kidnappings , and its links to masood azhar , a pakistani cleric jailed in india whose release the group was demanding , as well as recreate the kidnapping and months that the hostages were held mr levy responded to questions from india ink by email about the book , and particularly the startling theory that underpins it that the indian government and military allowed the hostages to die , as part of a larger political game that was being played in kashmir at the time can you tell us about the research process for this book \? we began reporting for the sunday times magazine in south asia around the time of the kidnapping , before becoming correspondents based in delhi , working for the sunday times foreign department we then moved over to the guardian , and worked across the entire of asia kashmir was a story issue crisis we followed and investigated for those two newspapers \( consecutively \) for 16 years over that time we developed close contacts in the jammu and kashmir police , intelligence bureau \( ib \) , research and analysis wing \( raw \) and as significantly in civil society groups , consisting of lawyers and the socalled mothers of the missing , or association of the parents of disappeared persons from their foundation to now these relations all deepened after the earthquake of 2005 , when we and them scoured kashmir reporting the disaster but also reporting on the emergence of unmarked and mass graves in areas previously closed down our focus on the missing and the graves brought us back to the subject of the western missing , which officials , agents , officers and villagers began to talk about freely for the first time , as a cathartic reaction to their mapping of the graves in 2007 , after finishing a book on pakistan , we went back to our notes from the 1995 kidnappings , and approached the western inquiry teams first diplomats , scotland yard detectives , and the fbi , to explore what had been known and what were the basic research material available timelines , maps , sightings , eye witness accounts armed with these , including the complete diplomatic chronology of events , we then moved research to pakistan , where we have worked extensively there we have particularly good contacts with federal investigators , and inside the government and military these led to meetings with the masood circle , his father and associates in the punjab , karachi and what was the northwest frontier province an enormous range of material was made available to us , including a masood journal and his early writings , as well as files on his group s creation of al faran in india , with the help of western diplomats and contacts in delhi , we created lists of who was in the jk police inquiry , the ib and raw at the time , running the valley , but also with specific responsibilities these names included the most senior officers and agents , all of whom we approached and then returned to on multiple occasions , interviewing them and drawing them out they in turn passed us on to others in raw \( mostly retired \) , ib and the police , until we had a fairly complete diagrammatic structure of who was where and had interviewed almost all of them the army and the ministry of defense declined to get involved at any level , although gen dd saklani , who was the security adviser to the governor , did talk at length my general observations would be that the jk police s senior officers wanted to talk and were enormously helpful , as were ib through them we got to files and tape recordings we also determined the exact route taken by the kidnappers , and followed that route , through anantnag , and over in kishtwar and the warwan valley , interviewing hundreds of villagers over the years , staying in sukhnoi where we learned from villagers , and then the ib and the jk police , the hostages had been deliberately penned in for 11 weeks approximately , while they were observed in detail and near daily , by an indian helicopter our basic method was then to take the gamut of witness statements from the countryside back to the jk police , ib etc and bounce them around to see what memories were jogged and if these memories matched official accounts , which they did the view of indian politicians , was that none of this \( in 1995 \) was in their control , given the governor s rule was in place in the valley , and they were elbowed out and replaced by the military intelligence policing arrangement we did approach former civil servants from south block who all confirmed that the hostages had been penned in the warwan and that intelligence and military ran the show so starting with maps and a chronology , we created lists of officials and agents , whose accounts we then matched to new eyewitnesses , and whose statements we put to the people who had run the inquiries to eke out the truth we also then reached out to all of the victims of the earlier kidnappings we looked at these events in details from all sides to see the building methodology of the group we visited some of the jihadis involved in jail in india and in pakistan the most shocking part of the book concerns the role of the indian government and military can you tell us at what time in your reporting you had , as one crime squad member said in the book , the dawning realization that their desire to solve the crime was at odds with the goals of some senior figures in the military and the intelligence services we had no idea until 2010 the idea of a conspiracy of some sorts had been building , in that we had been told , convincingly by officials and civilians , that the hostages whereabouts was known for an extensive period of time there was no attempt to rescue them , only efforts to make the affair more protracted we also knew by then the workings of internal and secret talks between the jk police , ib and the kidnappers we had the tape transcripts and interviews with those who talked on all sides and from this it became clear that these talks were sabotaged by indian officials the details were rich and precise , showing how at every level when a solution was found , it was undermined at the highest level by the intelligence agencies and military no names were ever given us , although the opinion expressed by all involved in talking to al faran was that only those at the top within intelligence could have had access to the information in 20102011 , we also were introduced to the renegades who had been working with the military and ib , and they and their handlers revealed a truce that had been struck between themselves and the kidnapping group , a truce that went against everything that was being expressed publicly these renegades , their handlers and the police who were investigating them , suspicious of their involvement in the kidnapping , led us in 2011 to information , witnesses and official accounts of how the hostages were sold , bought from al faran , and taken charge of by the renegades led by nabi azad in shelipora who are the people that you would say strongly support your conclusion \? the crime branch team on the ground , the security team working for the then governor of kashmir , very senior officers in the jk police , both serving and retired , ib officers \( retired \) , jailed militants in tihar , who were first framed for the killing and then cleared by the indian authorities , british foreign office sources \( retired \) , and eyewitness to the men s death we also were shown extensive records , journals , accounts by investigators including eye witness statements we interviewed the eyewitnesses and police sources inspector general rajinder tikoo \( who led the negotiations with the kidnappers \) confirmed the sabotaging of the talks and that intelligence did not want there to be a resolution he resigned as a result from the inquiry he then had no part to play and does not express a view of the ending did you attempt to make contact with any of the seniormost figures who would have been involved in that decision \? members of thenprime minister narasimha rao s inner circle \? pranab mukherjee , who is quoted during one press conference \? former gov of kashmir rao \? former heads of raw or ib who would have been active at that time \? if so , what was their response \? military , apart from saklani , would not play ball politicians all declared they were led by the intelligence and military as they were out of the picture ib and raw conceded that prolonging the crime was their intention it was wrapped up in the language of strategy , in that they could publicly claim the warwan valley was inaccessible and that any raid would be detected and thwarted leading to the deaths of the hostages ib and raw officers conceded that the view inside the bunker of intelligence was that pakistan started this , and would not be allowed to end it the kidnapping was a boon that enabled the indian intelligence fraternity to clearly demonstrate pakistan backed terror and demonize kashmiri aspirations these same agents and officers claimed that the ending was a local affair and riven by agents in the valley who were too close to the renegades who were by now uncontrollable the special task force of the police were similarly out of control , they were a criminal nexus indeed , they were also keen to point out that a judicial inquiry into prime minister rao s government in delhi concluded that it , too , was completely in the pay of a criminal nexus , tainting his entire administration in scandal

krasnaya polyana , russia it was an eventful and entertaining weekend of world cup ski racing at the newly opened rosa khutor alpine center in russia s krasnaya polyana mountains , the first test held high above the 2014 olympic host city of sochi bode miller and the tour s fastest competitors made their first turns on the demanding , lengthy and highly technical downhill piste , but switzerland s beat feuz proved that he is a racer to be reckoned with he captured the downhill saturday , his 25th birthday , and followed that with an impressive second in sunday s super combined the overall leader ivica kostelic slashed through slalom gates en route to his sixth victory of the season sunday but his victory came with a price kostelic , a 32yearold from croatia , injured his right knee and appeared uncomfortable during the awards ceremony he was taken to a sochi hospital for a magnetic resonance imaging exam , which the team said revealed no new damage kostelic , who surmised that the injury could be meniscus related , will have a second mri in basel , switzerland , on monday , his team said kostelic s father , ante , blamed the injury on an overly icy slalom course and too many jumps on the downhill run the day before feuz s stellar twoday performance catapulted him to 70 points behind kostelic in the race for the overall title , with six tour stops remaining though relatively unknown outside the region , the village of krasnaya polyana , nestled in the western caucasus , will undoubtedly become more popular in the period leading to the 2014 olympics , when it will become the mountain setting for russia s first winter games krasnaya polyana has been bustling with construction , with some projects mostly completed , including the rosa khutor alpine center , which saw 57 of the world s top ski racers descend its sinuous 3 , 500meter downhill course saturday the piste , which was icy and bumpy near the top , proved to be a formidable challenge and featured four daunting jumps , some launching the racers more than 165 feet through the air the setup of this hill is good , the jumps are awesome , miller said they 're huge as you can see , but they have good steep landings and straight takeoffs , so i think it sets up for a great natural downhill miller , the 2010 olympic downhill bronze medalist , finished fourth saturday and did not finish sunday s super combined like many of the world s leading racers , miller gave the course mostly high marks , though he was somewhat critical of the gate setup , which he said was too twisty near the top , slowing speeds the reality is that a downhill should be a challenge , it should be dangerous and it should have risk , miller said part of that is carrying speed off of terrain and into big turns and jumps if it does n't challenge athletes , then you wo n't ever see their best , and an olympic downhill has to be the real thing rosa khutor has a staggering vertical drop of 1 , 075 meters , about 50 meters longer than the venerable lauberhorn course in wengen , switzerland , another test of endurance that feuz won this season his time saturday was 2 minutes 1410 seconds , considerably high by world cup standards it s an absolutely beautiful course , a really complete downhill with rolls , jumps and a lot of turns , feuz said after his victory maybe it s possible to change the upper part a little bit to make it a little less turny , but this is just a matter of detail feuz , who was congratulated by president dmitri a medvedev of russia at an awards ceremony , gave high marks to krasnaya polyana it s really exciting to see what they 've done here , feuz said i heard that three years ago , there was nothing here and now to see all this building , construction and also the good spirit you can really feel that all these people are working hard and doing their best the canadian racer benjamin thomsen , 24 , who finished second saturday in a careerbest performance , also endorsed the course a lot of guys are upset with how turny and icy it is , but finishing second , i'm very happy with it , thomsen said it s a legburner for sure , and you have to have a lot of willpower other racers were more critical , including the current world cup downhill leader didier cuche , who finished 12th after training friday , he suggested that the jumps might be too long , depending on conditions on saturday , when asked about them , cuche said , i think there is no way to talk about the jumps today because my run was bad from the top to the bottom kostelic echoed his sentiment they need to be careful with the jumps because they are pretty big , and i do n't think they should get any bigger , he said although there were a few crashes saturday , none were serious or resulted in significant injuries the first weekend of racing at the future olympic site also came with exceedingly high levels of security athletes , coaches and spectators went though metal detectors before boarding a gondola to access the racecourse armed security and special forces personnel were noticeable on the mountain i completely understand these guys because the danger here could be immediate with trouble being not so far away , kostelic said , referring to conflicts along the nearby borders with georgia and chechnya the norwegian skier aksel lund svindal said it s something i 've never seen before it seems a little bit extreme , but it s probably better to be on the safe side the rosa khutor ski resort , which opened in 2011 , will be a training site for russian athletes , who will face higher expectations when they compete in 2014 three russian racers took the course saturday , with alek glebov , the fastest of the three , finishing 44th for our team , it s a big advantage , glebov said we can come here to train and really get to know the courses better

clairton seems to make the news mostly when there is a shooting , bednar said , though there has not been a single homicide this year football makes the news , too , and on that topic the news has been unfailingly good home of champions , reads the orangeandblack sign at the city limits if word spreads about the team , maybe businessmen will be intrigued enough to look at clairton and its yearning main street and community pool and leafy park and tidy brick homes , bednar said , like the developer who is considering a gas station and convenience store or the one who hints of a gated community to replace the barrenness on lincoln way it is all talk , but in these heady football days , at least it is hopeful talk people rally around the team , bednar said if we can rally around some other project , we can take small steps there are not going to be any quick fixes , but if you make progress , at least you 're headed in the right direction on thursday afternoon , the bears held a light practice in their orange game jerseys and white pants tom nola , the coach , dropped his cellphone in a hallway outside the locker room and said , oh , sugar he does not curse , and any player who does must apologize and do pushups a retired history teacher , nola , 59 , is graying and laconic with a thin mustache and a slight limp that hints at his days as an athlete he did not yell at his students in the classroom and seldom finds a need to yell at his players on the field instead , he provides a calm , settling presence for a team that plays with sophistication on offense and relentlessness on defense now in his 11th season as head coach , nola considered retiring in 2011 but returned for a chance to set the state record for consecutive victories state athletic officials said it seemed unlikely that another mill town would challenge the record in the near future , or maybe ever it s a bit anachronistic now , places like that hanging on , said rod frisco , an official with the pennsylvania interscholastic athletic association and a former longtime sportswriter in the state the fact that clairton is still a school district is as amazing as the football team gov thomas w corbett , a republican , toured clairton last year and urged the state s ailing school districts to consider mergers such talk has swirled and eddied here since the mid1980s clairton officials sent out letters of inquiry to four nearby districts , but none showed interest in consolidation so clairton maintains its own school system , 800 students in grades k through 12 taught in one building the district is faced with a depressed tax base , low test scores and a reduction in state financing that totaled 900 , 000 or about 1 , 200 per student over the past two years school officials called the cuts devastating clairton high school lost an afterschool tutoring program staff has been trimmed more teachers and new textbooks are needed still , few seem to want a merger when you lose your school , a town loses its identity , said richard livingston , clairton s school board president clairton is known nationally for its football team that would n't happen if you did n't have a school before friday s playoff game , there was no pep rally except on rare occasions , even a pep rally is considered an unnecessary indulgence by the restrained nola everybody in school knows who they are , he said of his players i do n't want them hyped up too early after the final bell , players headed to the cafeteria for a pregame meal otherwise , many would most likely have to play on an empty stomach then the team walked up the hill to the stadium titus howard , a receiver and defensive back , gave a kiss to his girlfriend , tori james , a cheerleader he did not feel well , he told her just play your game , james said he gave her his cookie from the pregame meal in the locker room , players grabbed their gear and boarded two school buses for a 45minute drive over rolling hills , across the joe montana bridge , to a neutral stadium in houston , pa the field was lush artificial turf , the dressing room luxurious for a high school clairton once had its own extravagance , a swim team , but the school pool is now a storage space for chairs , computers and boxes when students ask to revive the swim team , peter mathis , the athletic director , says , sure , bring your own water during warmups , clairton tried to unnerve its opponent , neshannock high school , which had won its first playoff game two weeks earlier all my soldiers , are you ready \? linebacker dyran davenport called out you know , his teammates replied they repeated the call and response , slapping their thigh pads in unison nola approached a couple of reporters and said , you think that s intimidating \? he then gathered his players a final time in the locker room and gave his usual understated motivational speech the time has come to show them who the bears are clairton s seniors had played together since they were in midget ball at age 6 they had not lost a game since the season opener in 2009 neshannock s most urgent concern was tyler boyd , a bears running back and receiver who had rushed for 1 , 850 yards and 36 touchdowns this season a senior with an elegant , gliding style , boyd is considered one of the nation s top recruits in 25 years , i 've seen a lot of great running backs , some of whom have gone to the nfl , neshannock coach fred mozzocio said he s just as electric boyd raced into the end zone from 6 yards to give clairton an early 60 lead it was his 107th career touchdown , 7 short of the state record howard caught a touchdown pass to make it 200 on this frigid night , bears fans filled the home side of the field and pressed along the stadium fence frank billy , who graduated in 1961 and played at notre dame , said that clairton once drew as many as 15 , 000 fans to games , so many that the police controlled the crowds on horseback after each score friday , the brothers charles and carlton wade called their father , charles sr , to give him an update now 91 , the elder wade played halfback with his brother in the late 1930s four of his sons played at clairton , along with four grandsons , including wayne wade , the current defensive coordinator it s in the blood , the family patriarch had said a night earlier , sitting in his kitchen , wearing a state championship ring on a necklace though his sore back and knees prevented him from attending games this season , charles wade sr avidly followed the bears in the newspaper and remained a demanding fan when his sons reported that clairton led neshannock by 267 at halftime , he replied , that s all \? earlier this season , he wailed when told that brentwood high school had taken an early lead on the bears and charles jr , a pastor , asked his father , do i need to send an ambulance \? as the other bears left the field at halftime , garrett santoline , a starting tackle , took off his helmet and joined the band he began playing an instrument in the seventh grade and found that he could not quit because we did n't have enough trumpet players his presence was especially vital friday clairton has only 14 band members at full strength , and the baritone sax and tuba players were out sick my whole low end is gone , said david geckle , the band director as usual , clairton improvised six baton twirlers , known as the honey bears , marched with the band two of the majorettes split time on the trumpet , and the band made up in determination what it lacked in size then santoline rejoined the football team , which extended its lead to 377 after the postgame handshake , the bears gathered in a semicircle and linebacker damond flowers rolled a ball toward his teammates , sending them sprawling like bowling pins nola waved to his mother in the stands and fortunately escaped a gatorade bath with the temperature hovering in the mid30s in the dressing room , jeff kimball , the team trainer , displayed his goodluck charm , a packet of heinz ketchup , signifying that clairton was headed to the western pennsylvania regional championship game friday morning at heinz field in pittsburgh the clairton coaches joked about exchanging game film with storox high , the coming opponent until recently , the bears were decidedly lowtech before the 2010 state semifinals , eric fusco , an assistant coach , handed over game film on vhs tapes , which infuriated a rival coach do you know what year this is \? the coach said i could n't find a vcr if i tried the players celebrated and dressed and headed for home , one win from establishing an improbable state record with 60 consecutive victories it does n't matter where you are around pittsburgh , said mathis , the athletic director you say clairton , people think great football they do n't think dying steel mill town
beijing on thursday , china s communist party will begin its 18th national congress , which it nicknames 18th major i do n't belong to a political party and have never felt that communist party meetings are any of my business but my home is in beijing i am a writer , and han chinese my wife , , is also a writer , and tibetan the other member of our household is my mother , who is 90 a few weeks ago , china s political police asked my wife to leave beijing because 18th major , a onceinadecade coronation of new party leaders , was on the way the communist party views tibetans and uighur muslims from western china as noxious they are constantly under suspicion as troublemakers , if not terrorists my wife , as it happens , is petite , as lacking in guile as a window pane , and about as far from a terrorist as one could get she has , however , written some words in protest of the fate of her fellow tibetans and for this , the party has put her on a blacklist , barred her from publishing , deprived her of her job , and denied her a passport when she obeyed the recent order and headed home to tibet , police officers along the way stopped and searched her at nearly every juncture while chinese people on airplanes , trains , buses and motorcycles are streaming into and out of tibet by the thousands , tibetans themselves have become outsiders in their own land , blocked at every turn my wife finally did make it to lhasa , the tibetan capital , but only because state security in beijing had ordered the tibetan police to allow her to enter for the sake of 18th major after all , this is priority no 1 these days then , on oct 24 , state security officers visited my home again this time it was me they wanted out of beijing they left it to me to guess why the party saw me as a threat i write fiction , and have also written two books on national minorities in china , with the goal of increasing mutual understanding among china s ethnic groups does such writing displease the party \? i suppose it does a uighur professor who teaches in beijing had invited me to his home to observe id aladha , an important muslim holiday , with some of his uighur friends but state security forbade me to attend , and , to be sure that i did n't , they posted roundtheclock guards outside my door none of this involved any legal procedures when i asked the guards on what authority they stood at my door , they said nothing and pointed upward we all knew what that meant the ones up there , the party meanwhile the uighur professor was forced to cancel his gathering the reason \? eighteenth major the communist party has , for the sake of its own meeting , asked that my wife leave me and that i leave my elderly mother , who is too old to live without someone to care for her incidentally , she joined the communist party in 1947 \( two years before the founding of the people s republic , and a time when joining was still dangerous \) and did so in order to oppose the reigning nationalist government , which she saw as lacking humanity now , i want to ask her , what do you think of the humanity of the communist party today \? but cannot bring myself to inflict on her the pain that the question would bring i have replied to state security that a party conclave is no reason to disperse a family they , in turn , threatened that if i refused to leave , things would become uncomfortable for me they did not say how i have decided to wait at home and see what does a party that vows before the entire world that it follows the rule of law have in mind for my discomfort \?

kenner , la took a short detour from campaigning on monday to inspect the damage wrought by last week and the government response , a stop that took on outsized political overtones in this campaign season his visit , after a rally with union supporters in toledo , ohio , came three days after toured the louisiana coast on friday a day after accepting his party s nomination in tampa , fla mr obama s timing was decided in consultation with local officials , white house aides said , to avoid the presidential entourage getting in the way of the cleanup even as both parties jousted about their respective responses to natural disasters , mr obama sounded a nonpartisan note in remarks to reporters after his tour and discussions with officials and residents when disasters like this happen , we set aside whatever petty disagreements we may have , mr obama said nobody s a democrat or republican we 're all just americans looking out for each other earlier , the white house press secretary , jay carney , similarly told reporters aboard that disasters are apolitical but he and other democratic officials faulted mr romney s running mate , representative , for his efforts as the house budget committee chairman to cut federal disaster aid accounts efforts that some republican governors also opposed when it comes to the kinds of choices politicians make in washington about what their priorities are , it is worth noting that last year there was an effort to underfund the money that s used to provide relief for americans when they 've been hit by disasters , mr carney said mr ryan led that effort , he added reacting to the criticism , mr ryan s spokesman , brendan buck , said in a statement a romneyryan administration will always ensure there is disaster funding for those in need period as democrats gathered in charlotte , nc , for their convention , mr ryan tried to dampen some of their party mood with an appearance in the same state , keeping the focus on the nation s economic woes in an address that drew 2 , 000 people at east carolina university in greenville there s a little gathering going on over in charlotte , mr ryan said he said the democrats could not ignore the stubborn economic difficulties still felt by many people and cited the unemployment rate of 96 percent in north carolina , where mr obama won in 2008 but where the race is close this year , according to the latest polls mr ryan s presence on the trail came as mr romney stayed away from campaigning for a second straight day , instead vacationing at his summer home in wolfeboro , nh in his visit to louisiana , mr obama was joined by his administrator of the , craig fugate among local officials who met with him were gov bobby jindal and senator david vitter , both republicans who are frequent critics of the president also along was senator mary l landrieu , a democrat who led the criticism of mr ryan and by extension mr romney when mr romney visited on friday mr obama toured la place , a community in st john the baptist parish according to the administration , poststorm flooding there was unprecedented , though none had been expected , blocking evacuation routes to interstate 10 problems include a demand for transportation and temporary housing for returning evacuees , as well as schools closed by damage the motorcade passed military humvees and troops in fatigues and crowds of supporters and the merely curious as mr obama went to a government building for briefings with local officials and first responders afterward he toured a neighborhood that suffered flooding in brief remarks to reporters , mr obama noted that the levees built after held , leaving questions about how to prevent the kind of flooding that occurred in the wake of hurricane isaac we 're going to make sure that at the federal level we are getting on the case very quickly about figuring out what exactly happened here , what can we do to make sure it does n't happen again and expediting some of the decisions that may need to be made to ensure that we 've got the infrastructure in place to protect people s property and to protect people s lives , he said in the rally earlier in toledo , mr obama pointed to his bailout of the auto industry as a major argument for his reelection as he spent a fourth labor day with union workers in a swing state without the rescue , more than one million americans across the country would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst economic crisis since , mr obama told an estimated 3 , 100 supporters , most of them africanamericans , crammed into a high school gymnasium not far from a jeep plant in communities across the midwest , it would have been another great depression his focus on the auto industry s comeback was layered on the stump speech he has delivered now for three days in swingstate campaigning before the convention this week he engaged in an extended sports metaphor , to mock mr romney s recent remark that he should replace mr obama as the country s coach to produce a winning season in the case of the auto industry , the president said , mr romney would have called the wrong play one out of eight ohio workers are employed in jobs related to the auto industry , according to the obama campaign , and the bailout of general motors and chrysler ultimately saved nearly 155 , 000 jobs with manufacturers and suppliers in the state
republican attacks on president obama s plans for medicare are growing more heated and inaccurate by the day both mitt romney and paul ryan made statements last week implying that the affordable care act would eviscerate medicare when in fact the law should shore up the program s finances both men have also twisted themselves into knots to distance themselves from previous positions , so that voters can no longer believe anything they say last week , both insisted that they would save medicare by pumping a huge amount of money into the program , a bizarre turnaround for supposed fiscal conservatives out to rein in federal spending the likelihood that they would stand by that irresponsible pledge after the election is close to zero and the likelihood that they would be better able than democrats to preserve medicare for the future \( through a risky voucher system that may not work well for many beneficiaries \) is not much better a republican attack ad says that the reform law has cut 716 billion from medicare , with the money used to expand coverage to low income people who are currently uninsured so now the money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program the ad warns what the republicans fail to say is that the budget resolutions crafted by paul ryan and approved by the republicancontrolled house retained virtually the same cut in medicare in reality , the 716 billion is not a cut in benefits but rather the savings in costs that the congressional budget office projects over the next decade from wholly reasonable provisions in the reform law one big chunk of money will be saved by reducing unjustifiably high subsidies to private medicare advantage plans that enroll many beneficiaries at a higher average cost than traditional medicare another will come from reducing the annual increases in federal reimbursements to health care providers like hospitals , nursing homes and home health agencies to force the notoriously inefficient system to find ways to improve productivity and a further chunk will come from fees or taxes imposed on drug makers , device makers and insurers fees that they can surely afford since expanded coverage for the uninsured will increase their markets and their revenues the republicans imply that the 716 billion in cuts will harm older americans , but almost none of the savings come from reducing the benefits available for people already on medicare but if mr romney and mr ryan were able to repeal the reform law , as they have pledged to do , that would drive up costs for many seniors namely those with high prescription drug costs , who are already receiving subsidies under the reform law , and those who are receiving preventive services , like colonoscopies , mammograms and immunizations , with no cost sharing mr romney argued on friday that the 716 billion in cuts will harm beneficiaries because those who get discounts or extra benefits in the heavily subsidized medicare advantage plans will lose them and because reduced payments to hospitals and other providers could cause some providers to stop accepting medicare patients if he thinks that will be a major problem , mr romney should leave the reform law in place it has many provisions designed to make the delivery of health care more efficient and cheaper , so that hospitals and others will be better able to survive on smaller payments the republicans also argue that the reform law will weaken medicare and that by preventing the cuts and ultimately turning to vouchers they will enhance the program s solvency but medicare is not in danger of going bankrupt the issue is whether the trust fund that pays hospital bills will run out of money in 2024 , as now projected , and require the program to live on the annual payroll tax revenues it receives the affordable care act helped push back the insolvency date by eight years , so repealing the act would actually bring the trust fund closer to insolvency , perhaps in 2016 mr romney and mr ryan said last week that they would restore the entire 716 billion in cuts by repealing the law the congressional budget office concluded that repealing the law would raise the deficit by 109 billion over 10 years the republicans gave no clue about how they would pay for restoring the medicare cuts without increasing the deficit it is hard to believe that , if faced with the necessity of fashioning a realistic budget , keeping medicare spending high would be a top priority with a romneyryan administration that also wants to spend very large sums on the military and on tax cuts for wealthy americans regardless of who wins the election , medicare spending has to be reined in lest it squeeze out other priorities , like education it is utterly irresponsible for the republicans to promise not to trim medicare spending in their desperate bid for votes the reform law would help workingage people on modest incomes buy private policies with government subsidies on new insurance exchanges , starting in 2014 federal oversight will ensure a reasonably comprehensive benefit package , and competition among the insurers could help keep costs down but it is one thing to provide these premium support subsidies for uninsured people who cannot get affordable coverage in the costly , dysfunctional markets that serve individuals and their families it is quite another thing to use a similar strategy for older americans who have generous coverage through medicare and who might well end up worse off if their vouchers failed to keep pace with the cost of decent coverage mr romney and mr ryan would allow beneficiaries to use vouchers to buy a version of traditional medicare instead of a private plan , but it seems likely that the medicare plan would attract the sickest patients , driving up medicare premiums so that they would be unaffordable for many who wanted traditional coverage before disrupting the current medicare program , it would be wise to see how well premium support worked in the new exchanges this will be an election about big problems , and it will provide a clear choice between contrasting approaches to solve them in the medicare arena , the choice is between a democratic approach that wants to retain medicare as a guaranteed set of benefits with the government paying its share of the costs even if costs rise , and a republican approach that wants to limit the government s spending to a defined level , relying on untested market forces to drive down insurance costs the reform law is starting pilot programs to test ways to reduce medicare costs without cutting benefits many health care experts have identified additional ways to shave hundreds of billions of dollars from projected spending over the next decade without harming beneficiaries it is much less likely that the republicans , who have long wanted to privatize medicare , can achieve these goals
garbagnate milanese , italy a rapt crowd gathered in this drab town in the milanese hinterland one evening this month to hear beppe grillo , an italian comedian , serve up his characteristically caustic take on the country s politics and he did not disappoint mr grillo pointed to the row of freshfaced italians candidates of his on the stage behind him these kids , they may be inexperienced they still have n't learned how to rig a budget , or give contracts to their friends , he paused , his gravely voice drowned out by laughter and applause what they are , he said , is the product of the hyperdemocracy that he has been promoting through his and the plethora of web sites that have aggregated likeminded italians bent on proselytizing for a new form of political activism it is through a deft mixture of mordant humor , righteous anger and grassroots organization that mr grillo s movement is proving to others that it is no joke committed to changing italy s entrenched political system by offering an internetdriven , consensusbased alternative , the threeyearold five star movement has quickly become a force to contend with in italy s fractious and fractured political arena in a first round of local elections earlier this month , candidates from the movement ran in 101 of 941 cities and captured nearly 200 , 000 votes a national average of 9 percent enough to become the second or third political force in some municipalities in runoff elections this week the movement won mayoralties in one major city parma and three smaller towns the average age of the four mayors elected with the movement was 31 years , about half the average age of parliament members we 're at the beginning of something new that will change everything the web is sweeping everything away , toward a world most people do n't even know exists , said mr grillo , a popular comic for more than four decades , who has more than 550 , 000 and nearly 850 , 000 it s difficult to understand in person , mr grillo , 63 , is far more subdued than he is on stage , where he is a whirlwind of jokes and gibes aimed at italy s moribund political parties and its leaders , including prime minister mario monti mr grillo , who is from genoa , cheerfully refers to the prime minister as rigor montis because of the government s tough measures to decrease italy s debt hatched from , which he started in 2005 , and , the five star movement is rapidly becoming a nationwide vessel for , which are seen as having lost touch with the electorate recent polls show that confidence in the traditional parties has plummeted below 5 percent , and mr grillo s antipolitics message has found fertile ground angelo pellegrino , a plumber who had come to hear mr grillo , said politicians are thieves , clowns , buffoons , they live like kings although , we are also to blame we did , after all , vote for them political commentators have been tempted to dismiss mr grillo s movement as a national protest vote against entrenched interests , not unlike other dissident movements in europe , like germany s progressive pirate party and the farright golden dawn in greece but the movement s members reject the characterization , and promote their own agenda an environmentally friendly , anticonsumerist , proeducation platform , articulated with plenty of local variations community chapters decide which issues they want to emphasize and then elect a spokesperson to represent the ideas in elections the novelty is the use of the web as a constituency , the idea of new democracy , with a direct relationship between the elected and the electors , said federico fornaro , a historian who has written about the movement it is a model of party in franchising , he said the focus on local issues largely accounts for its success so far speaking to his supporters on monday night , federico pizzarotti , the newly elected mayor of parma , pledged that he would be the people s representative i think we can give an example to italy , and to europe , of what can be done if we work together , he told a cheering crowd before the elections , mr grillo had described the vote in parma as our stalingrad , a reference to the battle between soviet and german forces that was a turning point in the war on monday night , he spoke of taking berlin , a reference to the national elections that will be held next year , and are certain to pose new challenges to the movement s ability to organize and mobilize its leaderless membership finding a common message to deliver to the electorate will also test the glue of a hyperdemocratic movement that refuses to define itself through labels and works out its political positions on web sites so far , they 've only won in small cities , said paolo natale , a professor of political sociology at the university of milan it will be interesting to see whether the utopian vision they now propose can be incarnated for the national elections that reliance on the movement s followers on the web as a point of contact is both their strength , and their strong weakness , he said they can be a bit na ve mr fornaro , the historian , described the movement s shift to the national level as a triple backward somersault with no net below , he said he added , it s one thing to raise a ruckus , another to govern none of that bothers mr grillo , who is happy to acknowledge that the movement is a work in progress and insists that he is not first among equals or the movement s guru , as his critics say yet it is undeniable that the comic s pronouncements he is open , for example , to italy s exit from the euro zone create shock waves he also advocates forcing politicians to stand trial before a jury of average citizens there is no forgiveness in a popular movement , he said the internet is also unforgiving and has an inherent system of checks and balances , according to gianroberto casaleggio , the consultant responsible for developing mr grillo s online presence if you 're credible and popular like grillo , then your message has wide diffusion on the web , he said it s a calvinist movement if you lose your credibility , then your message has no future mr grillo gloated after monday s success that people were attuned to his message and now let s take this wretched country , he wrote on twitter after the elections

it was 50 years ago saturday that the mets played their initial spring training game , an 80 loss to the st louis cardinals there was nothing surprising in that result , considering the mets went on to win only 40 games all season , a record for futility that still stands but what is somewhat intriguing is the identity of the first announcer to greet listeners of the game s radio broadcast it wasn t ralph kiner or bob murphy or lindsey nelson , all of whom were on hand for the start of what would be their long collaboration chronicling the team s fortunes instead , the first voice coming out of the radio belonged to none other than howard cosell , still emerging at that point as a largerthanlife personality in american sports cosell was the host of clubhouse journal , a pre and postgame show , and now , as game time approached , he was interviewing pitcher roger craig some 20 feet behind the plate at al lang field in st petersburg , fla craig had started his career with the brooklyn dodgers and was about to embark on a season in which he would finish with 10 wins for the mets and an unthinkable 24 losses cosell wasted no time being unrealistic i get the feeling you think this mets club could surprise a few people , cosell said to craig , who at one point refers to cosell as howie i m sure we will , howard , craig said we are going to surprise a few people , and i m sure all the players feel like i do but cosell and craig were not the only ones sounding overly optimistic that saturday afternoon , with the sun shining , richie ashburn about to bat leadoff , and stan musial and minnie minoso in the outfield for the cardinals on the wabc broadcast , nelson sounded excited , too , as he welcomed fans aboard for the return of national league baseball to new york five years after the dodgers and the giants had bolted to california , breaking millions of hearts bob murphy , ralph kiner and i are on hand to bring you every bit of the action , said nelson , while noting that the game was being sponsored by rheingold extra dry and brown williamson , a cigarettemaker yes , the new york mets are on the air in their first great season the rare audio time capsule of the game was preserved by marc gold , one of those abandoned dodger fans who was instantly smitten with the mets gold s grandmother had bought him a telectrosonic reeltoreel tape recorder for his bar mitzvah about 18 months before the mets began playing , and he was eager to put it to use gold s father connected the radio to the tape deck to eliminate background noise when they announced the mets were going to come in , that was such exciting news , said gold , who grew up in the canarsie section of brooklyn i had pictures of the dodgers in my room and i put x s on their pictures and immediately fell in love with the mets by his own admission , gold , who works in the family s horseradish business , is no historian but he understood , even at 14 , that the mets first game was something worth commemorating in addition to keeping score at home that season , he compiled a metsthemed newsletter , which he periodically printed in his father s office on mcdonald avenue in brooklyn and sold for 45 cents robert lipsyte covered that first exhibition game for the new york times and gracefully got to the point in the lead paragraph of his article seven white yawls rocked idly and ineffectually at anchor in tampa bay today , in perfect harmony with the new york mets at bat , in the field and on the mound , he wrote by the end of the fifth inning , with the cardinals ahead at 70 , the crowd of 6 , 872 began to stir , lipsyte observed later in the article some of them got up and left same old mets , a man said that sort of humor would come to define the early image of the mets but for a 14yearold like gold , trying to recapture the joy of rooting for a hometown team \( switching allegiance to the yankees was out of the question \) , it was difficult to poke fun at the mets , even if others were doing so the writers said the mets are funny , but they weren t funny , they were terrible , gold said those years between 10 and 16 made its mark and rooting for a losing team , it does a job on a kid still , on that saturday 50 years ago , when the mets were taking their first steps , there was hardly a cloud in the sky , the games did not yet count and the future looked and sounded bright and it all started with a hello from howard cosell
barcelona , spain in preparation for its final exhibition contest , the usa basketball staff convened after midnight monday morning and analyzed game film until 4 30 am the afterhours film session highlighted the reality of the calendar and the caliber of the united states men s team s next opponent , on tuesday that would be spain , renowned international men s basketball powerhouse , its deep roster stocked with experienced , towering post players , its strengths seemingly tailored to the united states roster s greatest weakness , a lack of experienced , towering post players what stands out is the quality of players , said steve wojciechowski , the associate head coach at duke , who assists with usa basketball s scouting you 're talking about the gasol brothers , guys who have been nba allstars then you have a halfdozen or so other guys who are either in the nba or nbaquality players they 're as deep or deeper than any team we 'll play spain s international basketball rise can be traced to the most significant event in usa basketball history , the 1992 barcelona games , in which a collection of nba hall of famers \( and christian laettner \) seized the gold medal and boosted global interest in their sport marc gasol , the younger of the brothers , attended an olympic basketball game with his father in 1992 he was 7 years old the game featured lithuania that was about all gasol remembered that and the interest those games inspired the next significant step took place in 1998 , according to jonathan givony , an international basketball expert and the president of a roster that included pau gasol , jose calderon , juan carlos navarro and felipe reyes won the under18 european championships the next year , they won the under19 world championships stage set that core stayed together , grew together , and when marc gasol joined his brother in 2006 , spain triumphed in the world championships this chemistry they built is what makes them so dangerous in a setting like the olympics where most of the teams are just thrown together a month or so in advance , givony wrote in an email their frontcourt is clearly the best at the olympics , which could give the us major problems when took control of the united states' men s team in 2005 , he looked to countries like spain to overhaul the american development system spain s basketball federation , its youth feeder programs , the way it constructed a system and kept its core together , impressed colangelo thus the country inspired by the dream team provided part of the blueprint for the socalled redeem team , which secured gold in beijing in 2008 the revamped system aided the united states in this olympic cycle , too , as several post players bowed out with injuries , including dwight howard , chris bosh and blake griffin colangelo and coach chose to replenish the roster with athletic , versatile players , not necessarily the tallest ones , and the replacements , other than anthony davis , came from the system and were familiar with it we ca n't talk about things we do n't have , because there was n't any option to replace them with , colangelo said we have to play to our strengths those strengths , compared with spain s strengths , are what make tuesday s matchup between two gold medal contenders so intriguing the united states must contend with spain s size , while spain s post players will be forced to defend the united states on the perimeter , where someone like kevin durant , an athletic 6foot9 forward , can drain 3pointers as if playing international popashot how much each team will choose to reveal remained something of a mystery monday marc gasol said he did not think spain would try it all tomorrow calderon said , you 're not going to show a lot of things both players , nursing injuries , could skip the exhibition entirely so while this game will provide bragging rights between the los angeles lakers teammates pau gasol and kobe bryant , while the winning team will become the instant favorite for the london games , none of the involved parties overstated the game s actual importance kobe does n't like to lose against anyone , pau gasol said but i 'd like to let him win tomorrow and beat him in london that 'll be ideal after four exhibition contests , including a close victory here sunday against argentina , colangelo compared this united states team favorably with the 2008 gold medal squad he labeled this group deeper , more athletic and more experienced he characterized many of the leaders on that team , like lebron james and carmelo anthony , as inexperienced compared with now that team also did not have durant , who led the united states with 27 points against argentina in the earlymorning film session , colangelo said krzyzewski found seven plays against argentina that accounted for an 18point swing , the difference between a tight game and a blowout this included one possession in which argentina , aided by two fouls , one a technical , scored 6 points officials also regularly whistled united states players for traveling , another reminder of the differences between nba games and international ones before practice monday , krzyzewski showed his team those clips much work remained , with team usa s first olympic contest less than a week away , but not until after a potential goldmedalgame preview that counts for nothing but could hold major olympic implications anyway

as a young man , robert a caro was a newspaper reporter caro is the painstaking , some would say obsessive \( though he has always denied it \) writer , whose first book , the power broker , a 1 , 336page biography of robert moses , took him seven years to complete after which he turned to his true life s work \( perhaps even his true obsession \) , a multivolume biography of lyndon johnson , the fourth volume of which , the passage of power , has just been published to great acclaim , by none other than former president bill clinton and which has been 36 years in the making so far working for a newspaper meant meeting deadlines , deadlines that , yes , allowed the paper to come out the next day , but also meant , all too often , compromises caro could n't repeat himself in a newspaper article he could n't say the same thing five , six , seven times , until he was sure absolutely that the reader got the point he could n't include all the many stray facts he had uncovered sometimes , words even had to be cut from a robert a caro newspaper article cut ruthlessly , mercilessly , by editors who did n't understand the importance of those words , or the significance of those seemingly stray facts but once caro turned to books , and , especially , once he began working on his lbj biography in the mid1970s , all the previous obstacles fell away he would spend years nay , decades in the field , finding stray facts no one else had ever known existed and then , when he started writing , he could n't stop other , lesser authors had deadlines , but not caro he turned in each volume only when he was ready , and sometimes a decade passed between volumes so much time , in fact , that he began quoting his previous books in his newer books originally intended to be three volumes , written over maybe a halfdozen years , his lbj biography eventually stretched to four , and then five the fifth , which caro has yet to write , is supposed to be the last one there was something unquestionably aweinspiring about caro s quest to create a biography as big as johnson s life the third volume , especially , entitled master of the senate caro s 1 , 167page account of johnson s years as the senate majority leader was immediately hailed as one of the greatest illuminations of power ever written but was there also something about caro s pursuit of lbj that was just a little bit ahablike \? i ca n't imagine this being done or even attempted by anyone else , his publisher , sonny mehta , he s given over so much of his life to another guy mehta meant it as a compliment , but it did make you wonder was any biography worth nearly half the writer s life \? to write his new book , which weighs in at a mere 712 pages , caro spent 10 years recounting just six years , from 1958 to 1964 , three in which very little happened , since , as john f kennedy s vice president , johnson had little to do yet every time you had a thought like that , you hit a chapter that reminded you anew of caro s literary powers in the passage of power , for instance , caro retells the kennedy assassination a story that has been written hundreds of times before yet caro makes it feel completely fresh , spellbinding even there were other problems , however in the first two volumes , published in 1982 and 1990 , caro s johnson is a man with a hunger for power in its most naked form , for power not to improve the lives of others , but to manipulate and dominate them , as caro wrote in , the first volume johnson has almost no redeeming qualities in the first two books yet how could this same man , at the end of volume 4 , push through the landmark civil rights act as president \? how does caro square this great achievement as well as all the other liberal achievements to come with his portrayal of the powermad johnson in the earlier volumes \? in truth , he never really does if the johnson of volumes 1 and 2 is the bad lbj , then the johnson of volume 4 is the good one it is almost as if caro is writing about two different people as if , for all his reportorial skill , he ca n't countenance johnson being both ruthless and compassionate in the same volume he has to be one or the other so here we are and here he is , at the age of 76 four volumes later , and there is so much more yet to tell caro still has the goldwater race to cover , and the legislative achievements that follow and , of course , there is still vietnam to write about nearly half a life later , in other words , caro is finally getting to the heart of the matter one could imagine other writers managing to squeeze it all into the one final volume being contemplated \? not a chance
for those of us with a twitterenabled polling addiction and a bad crosstab habit , it s almost become possible to lose sight of the fact that there s more at stake in this election than whether state pollsters are more reliable than national ones , or whether gallup s likelyvoter screen is an outlier or spoton , or which party s demographic projections makes more sense maybe that explains why this politico story on the romney transition effort seemed to come and go last week with hardly any comment obviously the various onbackground quotes need to be taken with a grain of salt \( not least because the most important players in romney s inner circle are still absorbed with the campaign \) , but this seemed like a striking passage one of the biggest worries for a romney administration , according to the aides , will be keeping conservative lawmakers happy when the most urgent task , dealing with the nation s fiscal emergency , is going to immediately alienate the loud , powerful wing of house republicans that is resistant to raising revenues , even though their leaders recognize it is a mathematical necessity that would be the most urgent task for a vice president paul ryan , who has credibility with the tea party wing of house republicans from his stint as a reformist house budget committee chairman we re going to come in and need to be able to do a lot of things that aren t easy to do , the official said ryan is going to have to help keep the conservatives at bay and on the field some of them are going to expect us to come in and do a lot of things that we aren t going to be able to do one of those things , the piece reports , is romney s repeated promise to repeal obamacare' which is sure to be curtailed , even with a republican senate , his advisers admit now this is semicontradicted later in the same piece , when we get a discussion of how romney plans to try to use the filibusterproof reconciliation process to rewrite the tax code and dump much of the affordable care act so again , take it all with a grain of salt but the thrust of the piece comports with what i ve heard from various \( and to be clear , noninner circle \) people doing work for the transition , and it leaves two strong impressions overall first , that romney sees himself as having much more room to maneuver than the liberal narrative about his inevitable captivity to his base \( and his own more implausible promises \) would suggest second , that no matter which party holds the senate , but especially if the democrats do , the policy agenda in a romney presidency both its shape , and his ability to push it through will hinge in large part on what kind of cooperation he gets from the more centrist portions of the democratic senate caucus  here a great deal depends on whether you take 2001 or 2005 as the model for how senate democrats might behave after the 2000 election and notwithstanding the bitterness of its florida endgame george w bush was able to armtwist , pressure and a cajole a number of red and purplestate democratic senators into voting for his signature domestic policy proposal , the 2001 tax cuts this experience informs jonathan chait s recent claim , in a piece explaining why liberals should quake at the prospect of the romney presidency , that romney could pass a version of paul ryan s budget even if harry reid remains the senate majority leader in 2001 , redstate democratic senators were desperate to tout their bipartisan credentials and wound up supporting the bush tax cuts in return for token concessions in 2013 , you ll have a wave of democratic senators from red \( often increasingly red \) states like alaska , louisiana , montana , south dakota , and north carolina facing reelection the next year none of them is going to want the optics of standing with their party in a highprofile showdown , especially where the president could blame them for jeopardizing the recovery and blocking tax cuts for the middle class now , i happen to think that the smart political move for senate democrats would be to ape the mcconnell strategy , blocking romney at every turn , which would make his promise to work with both parties a failure , and at the same time , block stimulus spending that would speed up the recovery \( this is a pure , cold political analysis \) their best shot to survive the midterm election is an unpopular romney burdened by a sluggish recovery but the senate democratic caucus tends not to think in mcconnellesque terms senate democrats in red states put their chips on positioning themselves in the center they will perceive obstructionism as risking their political career and will likely be racing to cut a deal , even an unconscionable one imagine you re romney , trying to pass some version of the ryan plan through a senate with , say , 51 or 52 democrats in 2014 , democrats will be defending senate seats in states like alaska , louisiana , montana , south dakota , and north carolina all those senators will be desperate to burnish their bipartisan credentials romney would barely sweat the task of picking off a couple of them to support his agenda , perhaps in return for some a favor to their local industry but of course , 2001 wasn t the last time a republican president tried to woo democrats in order to get a controversial measure through the senate there was also the case 2005 , when a recently reelected president bush decided to spend his political capital on a push social security reform , and the democrats met his push with uniform resistance via reihan salam , here s an amy sullivan article from 2006 on the success of this party of no strategy most of the press corps expected the debate over social security reform to be a painful defeat for democrats not only were moderates predicted to jump ship and join with republicans to support the president s plan , but social security one of the foundational blocks of the new deal social compact would be irrevocably changed but then a funny thing happened reid and pelosi managed to keep the members of their caucuses united in opposition day after day they launched coordinated attacks on bush s risky proposal without a single democrat willing to sign on and give a bipartisanship veneer of credibility , the private accounts plan slowly came to be seen by voters for what it was another piece of gop flimflam as the privatization ship began sinking , republicans challenged democrats to develop their own plan , and when none was forthcoming , pundits whacked the minority party for being without ideas but not putting forth a plan was the plan it meant that once the bottom fell out on public support for bush s effort which it did by early summer democrats couldn t be pressured to work with republicans to form a compromise proposal it was a brilliant tactical maneuver that resulted in a defeat at least as decisive as the republicans successful effort to kill clinton s healthcare plan now the democrats held just 45 senate seats in 2005 , as opposed to the 50 they held in 2001 even before jim jeffords went rogue on the republicans and as the last four years have demonstrated , it s easier to keep a smaller senate caucus voting in lockstep than the larger one , which would suggest that a close to 5050 senate might actually give romney more opportunities to peel off vulnerable democrats than bush had seven years ago but on the other hand , a truly ryanesque budget would have more in common with social security reform than it would with the bush tax cuts it s one thing for a vulnerable senate democrat to break with his party on what was sold as a freelunch tax cut following a long economic expansion it s quite another to volunteer yourself as the 51st vote to dramatically restrain discretionary spending and end medicare as we know it after an election rife with mediscare rhetoric from both sides i d like to think that there would be democratic votes for , say , the premium support reform in a romney presidency , because i m confident that no entitlement reform can long endure if republicans can t get some democratic buyin but if that happened , it would only come at the end of a long and drawnout negotiation process involving significant concessions on both sides a favor to their local industry might be enough to win votes on some issues , but not for a budget that grabs the medicare third rail with both hands so the question is twofold how good a negotiator is romney , really , and how willing are democrats to come to the table \? chait s scenario , in which romney simply rolls democrats , isn t likely to happen the scenario in which romney has a slim senate majority and passes major legislation through reconciliation seems likely to lead to a backlash that would endanger any substantial reforms long before they re implemented the scenario where romney simply can t get anything through the senate would obviously be an ugly one so i m left to hope \( though not expect \) that an initial show of flexibility , like the kind previewed in the politico piece , would buy a president romney enough goodwill to ultimately push through a tax reform entitlement reform reform of health care reform trifecta , while compromising on the various places where the official house gop agenda is either implausible or unwise if , of course , we get a president romney at all
the white house said on monday that it had investigated its own staff members and concluded that none of them were involved in the prostitution scandal in colombia that has ensnared members of the secret service and the military kathryn ruemmler , the president s counsel , conducted a review of the white house advance team that traveled to cartagena in advance of president obama s trip there this month and produced no indication of any misconduct , said jay carney , the white house press secretary unlike secret service agents and military officers , members of advance teams work directly for the white house , and some critics had asked whether they might have been engaged in the alleged misconduct senators charles e grassley , republican of iowa , and joseph i lieberman , independent of connecticut , have suggested in recent days that investigators examine the behavior of the white house staff white house advance teams often work closely with secret service and military service members in the days leading up to a presidential visit mr carney said ms ruemmler initiated the review out of due diligence , not out of any evidence that white house advance staff members had been involved twelve members of the secret service and 11 members of the military have been caught up in the scandal six of the secret service employees have resigned or are being fired this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

followed , tabloidstyle web site and a crime correspondent for milenio , a national newspaper but his killing last week , in this hilly capital of a state , veracruz , where drug violence has exploded in the past year , scared off many of his brethren it has sown confusion and fear over whether any precaution matters mexico for several years has been one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists , with 45 killed or missing since 2007 , but veracruz state is considered patch of all in which to report the news the violence here has gone off the charts , with at least nine journalists killed in the past year and a half veracruz , with prime drug and migrant trafficking routes crisscrossing the state , plus a busy port on the gulf of mexico known for smuggling contraband , has erupted into a battleground , as two of the most powerful organized crime groups , the zetas and the sinaloa cartel , fight for dominance reporters increasingly report only the official version of crimes , if at all , and newspaper editors have told government officials they are pressured by criminals to report or not report certain episodes perhaps the most devastating effect of this unprecedented wave of violence is the fact that people in veracruz are being deprived of vital information of one of the issues that is obviously having a very serious effect in the lives of the people , which is the level of violence , the number of killings , said carlos laur a , who monitors latin america for the committee to protect journalists the selfcensorship , he added , has a direct impact on the quality of democracy as other journalists have laid down their notebooks and cameras and fled veracruz , mr b ez , 46 , took pride in staying behind and not allowing the criminals to impose their will he taught his children to watch for suspicious people and cars , but also indulged passions like painting the mountainous xalapa landscape and writing romantic poetry , which were quite removed from his nighttime job of documenting the carnage on the streets we cannot give in to fear , we cannot live our lives afraid to go out , afraid to see friends , afraid to do what we do , a colleague recalled his saying earlier this year , after an investigative reporter for a national magazine was killed in her apartment here mr morales , the photographer , who is 54 , has a similar philosophy , saying , you have to accept the fear , but not let it paralyze you he made clear he photographs many things besides dead bodies , which he believes keeps him safe and i do n't label the dead or say who was who in a confrontation , he said after stumbling upon the stillhot crime scene on a recent night others have stopped reporting altogether i cannot go on here , said one journalist , her voice trembling this week as she made plans to leave she said she was told by a state official that she was on a list of journalists believed to be under threat , which was circulated among government officials , though none would acknowledge its existence gina dom nguez , a spokeswoman for the state governor , javier duarte , said the police were working aggressively to investigate the journalists' killings and quell the violence the governor , she said , is putting additional police officers on the streets and has proposed a new commission to assist threatened journalists but reporters here have their doubts about such efforts , tending to see the government , political leaders and organized crime as an interconnected mafia , in the words of several , using them as pawns in a struggle for power the authorities have linked mr b ez s killing to organized crime because of the way it was done he was kidnapped outside his office june 14 and his body dumped on a downtown street with a message attached to the corpse this is what happens to those who betray us and want to be clever , sincerely the zetas , said the note journalists here , skeptical that mr b ez s case will get a thorough investigation , are making their own connections , wondering , for example , if his death was some message to the governor , given mr b ez s wellknown , longterm friendship with ms dom nguez he also had just won a car in a raffle the governor had sponsored as part of world freedom of the press day on june 7 more than a few of mr b ez s colleagues read something into the fact he was found dead on a downtown street a block from the statehouse , near a government communications office and three newspaper offices ms dom nguez rejected talk about ulterior motives as speculation she said the authorities were scouring his web site and his newspaper articles to see if something he wrote or ignored might be connected to his death the lack of answers has left reporters suspicious even of one another , with whispers about which among them might be on the take mr b ez s death hit the journalism community particularly hard because he had mentored several younger reporters , pressing them to look for telling details in their images and their reports he did not investigate organized crime , friends said , and devoted a lot of space to accidents , assaults and routine arrests he was quick with a laugh , and serious about his web site , which he founded with a group of other journalists they have all left the state , friends of mr b ez said , and nobody answered telephone calls or emails or a knock on the door of the site s offices , which are now guarded by the police the web site , however , remains active , with a few new news reports of accidents and other episodes we cannot even describe how we should feel , said a friend , who , like mr b ez s anxious family members , spoke only on the condition of anonymity who is going to protect us \? the police \? human rights groups \? the marines \? who , i want to know , who \?
beijing when s vice president and presumptive next president , , arrives at the white house on tuesday , american leaders will be scrutinizing him for hints of future stances on crucial issues , from chinese military intentions to the nuclear programs of iran and north korea but none is more important and for now , more opaque than the question of where mr xi and the next generation of leaders want to take china s economy , which is still growing rapidly but shows signs of stress and structural instability , economists say mr xi s crosscountry swing , from washington to an iowa farm town to los angeles , comes at a politically charged moment in american relations with china china s economic competition with the united states has already become a theme in this year s republican presidential primaries , and president obama has toughened his tone on chinese trade and fiscal issues in meetings with mr xi at the white house on tuesday , a stock list of economic demands that china lower barriers to american investment , build a consumerdriven economy that would buy more american imports and allow to rise against the dollar more quickly seems likely to dominate mr obama s side of the conversation , according to officials in washington for his part , mr xi , introducing himself to the american public , will showcase a downhome personality in contrast to that of china s stoic current president , hu jintao he will announce some business deals with american companies and , like every chinese visitor , pledge to improve bilateral relations but given the domestic pressures over this year s onceadecade leadership transition in china , the odds that mr xi will accede publicly to mr obama s requests are practically nil there is a longerterm debate about reforms going on even now , however in recent months , some communist party elites have privately debated the necessity of those reforms with renewed vigor some of the discussion has crept into public discourse , and there are a growing number of attacks by intellectuals and former officials on what they call the vested interests that threaten to take china further down the road of crony capitalism but the delicacy of the leadership transition and the structural limits on mr xi s authority , particularly in his first fiveyear term in office , would hamper attempts by him or his colleagues to push reforms even if they are inclined to do so he and a new leadership team are set late this year to inherit a quasimarket economy geared above all else to generate fast growth the stateowned industries that have ballooned in size , the coastal provinces that have grown rich on exports , the local governments that have reaped billions from land sales and poured billions more into building glittering cities all have interests in that economic policy economists agree that reforms are needed to land ownership , the social welfare system and the financial sector , and that china must overhaul its investmentdriven growth model , but all of that would work against those interest groups the big state corporations , in particular , have gained political clout alongside their wealth they have monopolies on the most important industries banking , oil , aviation , construction , telecommunications and they maintain close ties to the top party officials two former executives of mammoth oil and machinery companies sit on the current standing committee of the politburo , the ninemember body that essentially runs china by consensus the officials expected to take posts on the standing committee this october all have ties of some kind to the heads of state enterprises for example , wang qishan , who is seen as relatively liberal on economic policy , was a top state bank executive himself corporate executives regularly rotate into top provincial posts , and still more sit on the communist party s central committee if the new leadership can crack down or curtail these companies , they will score well with the public but those interest groups are very powerful , cheng li , a scholar of elite chinese politics at the brookings institution in washington , said in an interview the political risk is overwhelming so , say some , is the risk of doing nothing concern has mounted in some quarters of the party and anger among citizens over the emergence of a powerful and privileged elite cynics have coined the phrase black collar to describe the bigcity titans and government elites who wear expensive black suits and invariably drive black luxury automobiles , often flouting traffic and speed laws there was a notable lack of discussion of new economic reforms at the party s annual economic work conference in december , where mr hu focused only on talk of stability , according to an editor at a party newspaper but in at least five private forums organized by the children of communist revolution elites last year in beijing , the need for reforms was discussed , say people briefed on the meetings those socalled princelings in attendance wield power through personal connections that could in the long run influence the next group of leaders , even though their calls for change have no immediate effect much about mr xi points to a person who , by the standards of current leaders , will be comparatively progressive unlike the parochial mr hu , mr xi , 58 , is welltraveled and intimately familiar with the west his daughter attends harvard , and he is said to enjoy hollywood films about \( mr hu is said to be a russophile \) mr hu , a onetime power technician , worked his way up through jobs in china s hardscrabble interior mr xi is the son of a communist party aristocrat , xi zhongxun , who was present at the birth of china s turn to capitalism and helped develop the special economic zone of shenzhen mr xi rose through party jobs in china s entrepreneurial coastal centers some experts say that the background and the histories of china s other new leaders bode well for an economic overhaul these people got their college education in the honeymoon years of reform and opening up , in 1977 and 1978 when the country was just beginning to be transformed , said li daokui , an economist and adviser to china s central bank those who were most excited were college students these people are intrinsically believers in reform and opening up but mr xi s voice , while influential , will be just one of many in china s collective leadership managing the economy probably will fall to two other standing committee members li keqiang , the apparent choice to succeed wen jiabao as prime minister , and mr wang , the onetime head of a stateowned bank who is regarded as a top candidate for first vice prime minister mr wang has deep ties with china s finance and industrial sectors , and he has played a central role in economic talks with treasury secretary timothy f geithner his history he was a prot g of zhu rongji , an economic reformer who served as prime minister from 1998 to 2003 bolsters a general belief that he supports marketoriented economic policies mr li s views are unclear , but he served earlier as governor of the central province of henan , one of the nation s poorest and his current portfolio , which includes making changes in china s housing and health care sectors , suggests a bent toward improving average citizens' lot but some party elites have criticized mr li as ineffectual and reluctant to challenge vested interests in those sections whatever their views , major policy changes will have to run a gantlet of scrutiny and potential opposition by a new politburo and other communist party powers , including mr hu , who , like his predecessors , is expected to still play a signature role and the changes are unlikely to be swift many nearterm economic policies have already been laid out in the party s latest fiveyear plan , unveiled last year until mr xi manages to fill important jobs with his own allies , a process that will take years , mr hu s economic blueprint will be the guide for some years to come , mr hu is going to be an overlord , one economist who has advised party leaders said in an interview late last year if xi has any hope , it s in his second term that is , the last five years of his expected decadelong stint as president
cincinnati buster posey s fifthinning grand slam thursday was the kind of moment that baseball history is made of it was a majestic blast 434 feet off a pitch from cincinnati reds starter mat latos that sailed over an auxiliary scoreboard and gave the giants a commanding 60 lead in the fifth , and deciding , game of their division series with the  that the home run was hit by one of the best players in baseball , that it seemed to guarantee that the giants would become the first team to rally from a twogamestonone firstround deficit by winning three straight on the road , only added to the momentousness but , in fact , the game was n't over and over the final four and a half innings , as the reds gnawed away at the lead and threatened again and again to steal the game away , anxiety replaced jubilation as the giants battled to hold on and they just did manage to do so , winning , 64 , with giants closer sergio romo finally outdueling the dangerous jay bruce in a 12pitch atbat with the tying runs on base in the bottom of the ninth before striking out scott rolen to end the game only then could the giants pour onto the field at great american ballpark and bask in what they had done a threeday odyssey in enemy territory in which they edged the reds in game 3 on a 10thinning error , battered cincinnati in a game 4 blowout and endured all of the late challenges in game 5 when the giants come down to earth , they will move on to their next destination , the national league championship series , against the winner of friday s game 5 between the st louis cardinals and the washington nationals they were a surprise team two seasons ago when they won the world series with a roster that was cluttered with castoffs this year s group now becomes a surprise , too , for the simple fact that it made through those three days in cincinnati , including those final , tense innings in this ballpark with their offense , no , it did n't feel safe , posey said of the 60 lead that kept shrinking and shrinking the reds first counterattacked with two runs in the fifth on a brandon phillips double they narrowed the lead to 63 on ryan ludwick s home run to lead off the sixth as that inning progressed , the reds put two more runners on but ryan hanigan struck out looking , and bruce was caught trying to steal third on the same play for the giants , it had to be the sweetest double play of the season still , the reds continued to apply the pressure with two on in the seventh , giants reliever jeremy affeldt got ludwick , the tying run , to hit the ball right back to him for the third out in the eighth , with runners again on first and second and the tying run at the plate , angel pagan , in center field , made a sliding catch on dioner navarro s sinking liner and then came the bottom of the ninth romo walked zack cozart with one out and then allowed backtoback singles to joey votto and ludwick to cut the lead to 64 now bruce , with 34 home runs on the season , came to the plate , and a battle ensued pitch after pitch , foul ball after foul ball finally , on pitch no 12 , bruce flew out to left i just said , this guy s not going to beat me and i'm going to get him , ' an emotional romo said in their jubilant locker room , giants players credited their teammate hunter pence with giving a rousing speech before game 3 that ignited the club it was big , huge , encouraging , very motivating , everything , pagan said we felt like warriors trying to hunt people i do n't know how to explain it there was so much energy and it was so important to us it even spilled over into a new pregame ritual , with the giants huddling together in the dugout and bouncing up and down just ahead of the first pitch the giants' comeback put reds manager dusty baker on the losing side of another painful postseason collapse he was managing the giants when they had a threegamestotwo lead over the los angeles angels in the 2002 world series before blowing a 50 lead in game 6 and losing the series and his chicago cubs , a year later , squandered a threegamestoone lead over the florida marlins in the national league championship series that was the series made famous by steve bartman , the fan who got in the way of a cubs player trying to catch a foul ball at a crucial point you get tired of the disappointments , but then you get over it , baker said it hurts big time
as television networks have covered internet companies positions against antipiracy legislation before congress this week , they have had to consider whether to disclose the positions of their parent companies virtually all of which have campaigned in favor of it such disclosures are always sensitive inside newsrooms , and especially so in this case , because conspiracy theories have taken root online about why journalists at tv networks like nbc , abc and cbs gave so little coverage to the proposed laws in december and in early january , when their parent companies had helped to convince lawmakers to support the legislation network executives privately attributed the dearth of coverage to the arcane , hardtoillustrate nature of the legislation , colloquially known as sopa , not to corporate interests all the networks were paying attention by wednesday , though , when wikipedia and a fleet of other web sites orchestrated an online protest against the legislation all three of the network morning news shows mentioned the protest , but during their initial reports none disclosed the point of view of their parent companies nbc s today show , however , did make a point of disclosing it during a conversation with marissa mayer , a google vice president after she explained google s opposition to the legislation , the coanchor matt lauer noted that comcast , the parent of nbc , is in favor of that legislation , saying it s imperative to protecting content copyrighted content and avoiding piracy he asked , so where is this going in your opinion \? we are very much worried about piracy , ms mayer answered that said , we think there are better , smarter , more targeted ways to address rogue foreign web sites than asking for broad censorship when asked if abc s good morning america or other programs would add a disclosure going forward , an abc news spokesman said , we will disclose disney s support for the bill we just added a line to an online story to that effect cbs news declined to comment an article on cbsnewscom on wednesday stated , cbs corporation , which owns cbsnewscom , is a member of the copyright alliance an industry group representing content producers that supports sopa and pipa cnn , which covered sopa earlier than other television news outlets , has been relatively diligent about disclosing that its parent , time warner , supports the legislation at the business news network cnbc , owned by comcast , wednesday s conversations about the issue on the morning programs squawk box and squawk on the street lacked disclosures , spurring the network s managing editor nick dunn to send a memo to producers as discussed numerous times we should disclose nbc s position in sopa pipa when doing story please make sure you do so , he wrote the disclosure was included on the network s afternoon program power lunch another network owned by comcast , msnbc , also lacked such disclosures until wednesday afternoon america s newsroom , a morning newscast on the fox news channel , did not mention the fact that its parent news corporation supports the legislation on wednesday , nor the fact that the company s chief executive , rupert murdoch , has been posting to twitter about the issue the liberal fox watchdog media matters asserted that fox reported the absurd spin from its parent company on sopa without noting their parent company s support for the bill other programs on fox have made clear where its parent stands shepard smith , the afternoon and evening anchor , said on tuesday during an explanation of sopa , important to note here , among the supporters is our boss , rupert murdoch , the chairman and ceo of the news corporation , which is the parent company of this network megyn kelly , another afternoon anchor , made a similar statement on wednesday time for a disclosure of our own the new york times company has not taken a corporate position on the proposed antipiracy legislation the editorial board of the new york times has stated that the house version of the bill is too broad and could stymie legitimate speech
the packers , the saints and the patriots have three of the best passing offenses in nfl history besides leading in many of the conventional statistics , the three teams rank well ahead of the rest of the league in adjusted net yards per attempt , calculated as net passing yards \( which includes sack yards lost \) plus 20 yards for each passing touchdown and subtracting 45 yards for each interception that total the number of adjusted net yards is then divided by the total number of pass attempts and sacks the packers average an incredible 94 any a , while the patriots and saints each average over 8 any a we can also calculate how many adjusted net yards each team added relative to the average team we do that by subtracting the league average any a 590 this season from each team s average that difference is then multiplied by the total number of pass attempts \( including sacks \) to understand how many \( adjusted net \) yards each passing attack adds relative to the average team for example , the packers averaged 942 any a , or 352 more any a than the average team over the course of 593 pass attempts , that means green bay added 2 , 085 adjusted net yards above league average that s the thirdhighest mark of any team since 1970 , behind only the 1984 dolphins \( 2 , 255 yards \) and the 2004 colts \( 2 , 146 \) the saints and the patriots added over 1 , 500 yards above average , putting the three teams in the top 10 over the past 42 seasons however , all three teams rank below average in adjusted net yards per attempt allowed the texans \( 804 adjusted net yards allowed better than average \) were the top defensive team this season in terms of adjusted net yards allowed above average if we add a team s offensive adjusted net yards over average \( listed below as o value \) and a team s defensive adjusted net yards over average \( d value \) , we can identify exactly how proficient a team was at passing and stopping the pass on a collective basis why would we want to do that \? for starters , offensive and defensive passing ability is the easiest way to identify the quality of a team but more relevant for purposes of playoff football the 2010 packers , the 2009 saints and the 2008 steelers all led the league in total passing value , en route to eventually winning the super bowl so did the 2007 patriots , before falling to the giants on the game s biggest stage sixteen of the 41 super bowl winners since the aflnfl merger led the league in total passing value \( sum of offense and defense \) another 10 champions ranked inside the top three thirtytwo of those 41 super bowl champions ranked in the top five in passing value even with a belowaverage passing defense , the packers , on the strength of their offense , have one of the best total passing values in league history only nine teams since 1970 have added over 2 , 000 total yards of value five of them won the super bowl , and two others lost in the super bowl green bay s significant lead in that metric along with having home field advantage in the nfc playoffs makes them an obvious favorite to reach the title game the table below shows each team s rankings in offensive and defensive passing values the packers , the patriots and the saints all fit the general profile of an elite offense based on a dominant passing attack but with a questionable defense from 1970 to 2010 , nine playoff teams met those criteria by averaging at least 28 points per game , 1 , 100plus passing yards of offensive value and having a below average pass defense none of them won the title what was it that prevented those teams from reaching the super bowl \? it s worth noting that all but one of those teams lost on the road , a sign that s it s very rare for teams with porous defenses to earn homefield advantage throughout the playoffs but even more noteworthy , it was usually the offense that failed them six of those teams had just one score after three quarters , in each case trailing by double digits heading into the final quarter the 2004 colts lost in new england on a snowy day , 203 the 2000 broncos ran into the impenetrable ravens defense , and lost 213 the 2003 colts lost in new england , and trailed , 217 , in another snowy foxborough nightmare the 76 colts the only team to lose at home on the list ran into an impenetrable steelers defense that allowed 28 points over the last nine games of the season baltimore trailed , 267 , by the end of the third quarter before ultimately losing , 4014 the 2000 rams had the explosive offense but were stuck on 7 points after three quarters in an eventual 3128 loss to the saints the 81 chargers lost in the freezer bowl in cincinnati , 277 the other three teams played in closer games , but were unable to eke out a victory the 1998 san francisco 49ers lost to the atlanta falcons in a matchup of two elite teams that split their regularseason games when the teams were division rivals the 49ers lost garrison hearst to injury on his first carry of the game , but atlanta also forced steve young into one of his worst games of the season the 82 chargers trailed , 276 , in the first half against miami , in a game when dan fouts threw five interceptions as the chargers lost , 3413 only one team lost in a shootout the 2009 vikings minnesota lost in overtime to the eventual champion new orleans saints , 3128 and while the offense moved the ball well and scored four touchdowns , the vikings committed five turnovers that day what does that tell us about these playoffs \? it s hard to imagine the saints being shut down by the 49ers the way the 76 colts \( against pittsburgh \) or 00 broncos \( against baltimore \) were as the rules continue to make it easier for offenses to move the ball , we should start to see more elite passing teams losing in shootouts but the blueprint of great passing dome warm weather team losing on the road in the playoffs still applies to new orleans , and a tough road opponent in san francisco may do the trick for new england and green bay , homefield advantage would seem to differentiate them from other teams on the list although foxboro and lambeau field would typically be the sort of environment where great passing offenses die in the cold , as long as wind isn t a huge factor , new england and green bay should be able to pass on any team the patriots should be able to hide their weakness on defense until a potential super bowl berth neither baltimore or houston \( and certainly not denver \) is a strong passing team green bay may have to deal with two of the best passing attacks in the league the giants and new orleans but it s still difficult to envision any opponent winning a shootout in lambeau field last year s super bowl featured the top two defenses in points allowed although it wouldn t be too shocking to see an allharbaugh super bowl between baltimore and san francisco , odds are we ll see two of the top three scoring offenses in the super bowl this year super bowl xxix had 75 total points , making it the highestscoring super bowl as san francisco crushed san diego , 4926 super bowl xlvi could give that record a good scare in a few weeks chase stuart is a contributor to , and
on fall saturdays , the soldout football stadium at the resembles a vast scarlet sea , with 80 , 000plus fans cheering for the fivetime national champion cornhuskers by contrast , nebraska s baseball stadium accommodates 8 , 500 spectators the team has never won the college world series , and its most famous former player may be joba chamberlain of the yankees but through the university s nonprofit publishing wing , the pulse of baseball beats strongly in the heart of cornhusker nation from offices about a mile off campus , in the shadows of the state capitol in lincoln , the and its imprint , bison books , publish four to eight books a year for the hardcore hardball fan via its partnership with the society for american baseball research , or , nebraska also distributes the organization s wonkish publications , the national pastime and the baseball research journal we 're a humanitiesbased academic press that happens to publish scholarly work about baseball , said rob taylor , the nebraska press s interim editor in chief people sometimes forget that sports is a vibrant part of american history other university presses , including those at syracuse and temple , have long published sports titles but nebraska s baseball focus , with a decided emphasis on the obscure and the offbeat , has won praise some of its books landed on baseball america magazine s top 10 list for 2011 volumes 1 and 2 of david nemec s major league baseball profiles , 18711900 and pitching in the promised land a story of the first and only season in the israel baseball league , by aaron pribble titles for spring 2012 include robert k fitts s banzai babe ruth , about the allstar barnstorming tour of japan in 1934 chris lamb s conspiracy of silence , about the role of journalists in the desegregation of the major leagues and the second volume of norman l macht s biographical trilogy of manager connie mack we published , the former player and executive , taylor , 42 , said most fans do n't comprehend the impact cronin had on the game beyond his playing days taylor , who directs the press s editorial staff of seven , said print runs for baseball books are in the low thousands , a small number compared with releases from major forprofit publishers and none of nebraska s titles are likely to achieve the bestseller status of books like jose canseco s juiced or jane leavy s 2010 biography of mickey mantle , the last boy but driven by an alliance with sabr , the nebraska press has found an appreciative , if niche , audience nebraska has helped keep the literature alive , said jim gates , the baseball hall of fame librarian , who estimated that 300 to 400 baseball books were published annually they 've become a major source of quality publications on a variety of topics , including history all of which raises the question , how did footballcentric nebraska get its baseball focus \? taylor gave the credit to daniel ross , one of his predecessors in the early 1990s , ross began buying the rights to overlooked older gems that trade publishers were dropping through bison books , ross resuscitated eric rolfe greenberg s cult novel the celebrant and mark harris s fiction oeuvre , including the southpaw and bang the drum slowly bison republished two compendiums by the new yorker essayist roger angell \( the summer game and five seasons \) and books by the boys of summer author , roger kahn , in addition to christy mathewson s pitching in a pinch and sol white s history of colored baseball ross gave new life to classic books , taylor said all of that baseball history was in danger of disappearing from bookshelves bison recently issued two collections by the sportswriter turned screenwriter twilight of the longball gods and sometimes they even shook your hand in turn , schulian urged taylor to publish a compilation of sports columns written by john lardner , the son of ring lardner here was a guy that had n't been in print for 40 years , said schulian , who served as editor for the john lardner reader in 2010 mainstream publishing houses did n't want anything to do with him this is the sort of book that university presses exist for the books that other people back away from after ross left the house in 2001 , nebraska moved to publish more original titles that attracted the attention of writers like fitts , who abandoned a career in anthropology to pursue his passion japanese baseball his first book for nebraska was a biography of the japaneseamerican pioneer  fitts spent five years researching and writing banzai babe ruth baseball in japan is a marginal topic in the united states , fitts said , so you know going in that this is n't about the money my goal was to produce the best story i could , and nebraska gave me that opportunity they take their time and do it right schulian said , the books i did with nebraska were labors of love or labors of ego perhaps nebraska s biggest concern is the future will the young generation of baseball fans , raised on a steady diet of video games and facebook , want to read 300page books about topics as esoteric as the 1897 pennant race and the demise of the seattle rainiers \? taylor , for one , believes that interest for quality baseball literature will never die baseball is a vehicle to teach about american history , he said it will continue to be a big part of our list as gates said , as long as there are writers and publishers , there will be books about baseball
there are two questions concerning mitt romney s service at the private equity firm bain capital the narrower question is did bain help ailing companies and add value to the economy or did it plunder dying firms \? the larger question is does romney s success in business tell us anything about whether he would be a successful president \? let s tackle the bigger question here at first blush , business success would seem to be good preparation for political success a ceo learns to set priorities , manage organizations and hone analytic skills but these traits are more transferable to being a mayor , which is more administrative , than to being president moreover , for every michael bloomberg who successfully moves from business to politics , there is a jon corzine , donald rumsfeld , donald regan , meg whitman or carly fiorina former executives who were either unsuccessful in political office or who could n't get elected in the first place if you look back over history , you see that while business success can sensitize a politician to the realities other executives face , there s little correlation between business success and political success the traits that actually correlate with successful presidencies have deeper roots first , successful presidents tend to be emotionally secure they have none of the social resentments and desperate needs that plagued men like richard nixon instead they were raised , often in an aristocratic family , with a sense that they were the natural leaders of the nation they were infused , often at an elite prep school , with a sense of obligation and responsibility to perform public service whether it is a george washington , a franklin or theodore roosevelt or a john f kennedy , this sort of president enters the white house with ease and confidence , is relatively unscathed by the criticism of the crowd , is able to separate the mask he must wear for public display from the real honest self he knows himself to be this sense of emotional security can also be found in great military leaders , like dwight eisenhower , and in serenely successful movie stars , like ronald reagan second , great presidents tend to have superb political judgment in his essay on this subject , isaiah berlin defines political judgment as a capacity for integrating a vast amalgam of constantly changing , multicolored , evanescent perpetually overlapping data a president with political judgment has a subtle feel for the texture of his circumstance he has a feel for where opportunities lie , what will go together and what will never go together this implicit knowledge is developed slowly in people like harry truman or lyndon johnson who have spent decades as political insiders and who have a rich repertoire of experiences to draw on it also comes from voracious social contact it comes to leaders who have a compulsive desire to be around people and who can harvest from a million social encounters a sense of what people want and can deliver third , great leaders have often experienced crushing personal setbacks this experience , whether it s lincoln s depression or fdr s polio , not only gives them a sense of sympathy for those who are suffering , but a personal contact with frailty they are resilient when things go wrong they know how dependent they are on others , how prone they are to overconfidence they are both modest , because they have felt weakness , and aggressive , because they know how hard it is to change anything finally , great leaders tend to have an instrumental mentality they do not feel the office is about them they are just god s temporary instrument in service of a larger cause lincoln felt he was god s instrument in preserving the union fdr felt he was an instrument to help the common man and defeat fascism this sense of being an instrument gives them an organizing purpose it gives them a longer perspective , so they do n't get distracted by ephemera it means their administration marches in one direction , even though it is flexible and willing to accept incremental gains along the way in sum , great presidents are often aristocrats and experienced political insiders they experience great setbacks they feel the presence of god s hand on their every move unfortunately , we 're not allowed to talk about these things openly these days we disdain elitism , political experience and explicit godtalk great failure is considered baggage in today s campaign lingo today s candidates have to invent bogus story lines to explain their qualifications to be president that they are innocent outsiders or business whizzes in reality , romney s bain success is largely irrelevant to the question of whether he could be a good president the real question is whether he has picked up traits like emotional security , political judgment and an instrumental mindset from his upbringing and the deeper experiences of life we 'll learn more about that as he confronts brutal attacks that now besiege him
tulsa , okla late on thursday afternoon , jacob c england , 19 , posted a message on his facebook page , expressing grief and anger over the second anniversary of his father s death mr england s father , carl , was shot on april 5 , 2010 , at an apartment complex here , and the man who was a person of interest in the case , pernell jefferson , is serving time at an oklahoma state prison mr england is a native american who has also described himself as white mr jefferson is black today is two years that my dad has been gone , mr england wrote , and then used a racial epithet to describe mr jefferson it s hard not to go off between that and sheran i'm gone in the head , he added , referring to the recent suicide of his 24yearold fianc e , sheran hart wilde rip dad and sheran i love and miss u i think about both of u every second of the day hours later , the authorities say , mr england and his friend and roommate , alvin watts , 32 , waged what city leaders believe was a racially motivated shooting rampage in the predominantly black neighborhoods of north tulsa early friday morning , driving through the streets in a pickup truck and randomly shooting pedestrians three black people were killed , and two others were wounded in the attacks mr england and mr watts , who is white , were arrested early sunday morning after investigators received tips to the state s anonymous crime stoppers line , the authorities said they will face three counts of firstdegree murder , they said , and two counts of shooting with intent to kill at a news conference in downtown tulsa on sunday , police officials said it was too early in the investigation to say precisely what motivated mr england and mr watts , and they stopped short of describing the shootings as hate crimes you can look at the facts of the case and certainly come up with what would appear to be a logical theory , but we 're going to let the evidence take us where we want to go , said the tulsa police chief , chuck jordan in tulsa a city of 392 , 000 , about 62 , 000 of whom are black the shootings shocked , frightened and angered many black residents on easter weekend and prompted an intense manhunt the authorities formed a task force called operation random shooter , made up of more than two dozen local , state and federal investigators from the tulsa police department , the tulsa county sheriff s office and the federal marshals service the federal bureau of investigation also joined the investigation jack henderson , a city councilman who is black and whose district includes all of the shooting sites , said that before the arrests , many in the area were terrified a lot of people in my community have been calling me , afraid that they could n't go outside , did n't know if they could even go to church , did n't know if they could go to the grocery store , mr henderson said at the news conference with these two people off the streets , people in my community as well as the rest of this city can feel that they are safer , he said tulsa officials said the shootings were unlike anything the city had ever seen in its modern history none of the victims knew one another , and all of them were shot within a few miles mr henderson said he had heard from constituents that in one of the shootings , the suspects had approached their victims at random and asked for directions when they turned around to walk away , they just opened fire , mr henderson said in 1921 , tulsa was the scene of a riot that is one of the deadliest episodes of racial violence in the nation s history , in which a mob of white tulsans destroyed a black neighborhood and killed dozens , perhaps hundreds , of black residents after the friday shootings , city leaders said that the anger in the black community had reached the point where people were talking about taking the law into their own hands asked on sunday if he feared any sort of uprising , chief jordan replied i have much more faith in my fellow tulsans than that i think they let us do our job chief jordan released few details about many aspects of the shootings , saying the investigation was continuing he declined to say if the suspects were cooperating with investigators , and he said that mr england s facebook postings would be part of the prosecution of the case mr england , a stocky young man with a mohawkstyle haircut , graduated in 2009 from sperry high school late on friday evening , hours after the first shooting , mr england suggested on his facebook page that he was contemplating suicide because people were accusing him of unspecified acts that i did n't do , he wrote , adding that it might be time to call it quits he wrote i hate to say it like that but i'm done if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later in the series of comments that followed , his friends tried to comfort him , with some writing that they loved him others appealed to him to remember his sister , cady , and his infant son , jacob c england ii please dont do anything stupid jake , one friend responded think about cady and the baby and everyone that loves you it was unclear if ms wilde was the mother of his son or where the baby was living by midafternoon on sunday , both suspects' facebook profiles were no longer available mr england s father was shot and killed at the comanche park apartments , not far from where the body of one of the victims was found friday mr jefferson , 39 , was never charged in the killing of the elder mr england he did tell investigators that he had been in an altercation with him that evening mr jefferson is now serving a prison sentence through october 2014 for feloniously pointing a firearm , according to the oklahoma department of corrections it is very premature to talk about hate crimes , said james e finch , special agent in charge of the fbi s oklahoma division he added there are too many unanswered questions at this stage , too much evidence that has to be analyzed and a lot of investigation still to come the three people who were killed were identified as dannaer fields , 49 bobby clark , 54 and william allen , 31 the two people who were wounded did not sustain lifethreatening injuries and have been released from the hospital , the authorities said mr england and mr watts lived together at mr england s residence in a rural part of tulsa far from downtown they were arrested at another house in nearby turley , okla a white pickup truck , which had been burned , was discovered by the authorities on saturday the tulsa world reported that the truck was registered to jake or carl england , but chief jordan declined to comment about it a woman who pulled up to the house where the two men lived called mr england a good man you do n't understand , said the woman , who did not identify herself they lost their dad now they 're going through all this now their brother s gone the two suspects have had previous runins with the law in 2006 , mr watts pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery in a case of domestic abuse three years later , he was charged with aggravated assault and battery in a case that was dismissed last year , mr england pleaded guilty to a charge of driving with a suspended license mr watts had recently broken up with his fianc e , whom he called a snake n da grass on his facebook page because she had apparently refused to let him see his son online , mr watts described himself as a christian who read the bible every night

in april 1962 the beach boys recorded surfin' safari and 409 at western recorders in los angeles the demo tape soon became their first single on capitol records the following month el gran combo formed out of the remains of rafael cortijo y su combo , a brilliant band that had come to symbolize the new puerto rican popular music black , workingclass , cubaninfluenced , tight and urban but rustic at the middle in july mick jagger , keith richards and brian jones gave their first performances , as the core of a band called the rollin' stones , at both the marquee and the ealing jazz club in london and in november the chieftains , a group of virtuosos who sought to play traditional irish music in a new way in precise , smallgroup arrangements started rehearsing at the house of paddy moloney , the group s leader these are some of the bands positioned to turn 50 in public this year and promote their golden jubilees down to the ground , through tours or new recordings or both \( all but the stones have announced their plans \) your automatic response might be the factchecking ones fifty years \? is that correct \? how many original members remain \? the second might be emotional they 're only in it for the money , or good for them they do n't want to stop the third and this is where the response gets interesting may be that s quite a list wonder what they have in common \? these are among the first living pop bands to turn 50 popular musicians have become a different species , healthier and more adaptable so have their audiences \( so have their lawyers and publicists \) there was a time when pop was predicated on the notion of being disposable listeners revised their tastes quickly now we keep our teenage ears into retirement age but we also listen more broadly too , with more power to contextualize , because of music s easy availability online , and because pop artists are putting more broadly referential art in front of us so as an experiment , at least , let s respond to the 50th anniversaries of these four bands differently from how they might like us to not by seeing them as singular phenomena but as interconnected the groups began amid redefinition , industrialization , liberation 1962 was a particularly richsoil year for the chieftains it meant the lessening of ireland s economic and cultural isolation for the stones it meant teenagers with spending money britain s postausterity explosion of style for the beach boys it meant california culture , when hot rods , surfing and summer kicks entered the mainstream and for el gran combo , staying put while many fellow puerto rican musicians had moved to new york , it meant a rapidly modernizing island , and a fully formed afropuerto rican danceband music , playing to a huge and growing diaspora they 've all been seen as standardbearers , if not for an entire culture , in the case of el gran combo and the chieftains , at least for a sound or a disposition they 're all , effectively , scholars and popularizers they 've had to negotiate nearly compulsory changes of style without abandoning the audiences that value them most and they 've all been playing both sides of the fence , working both at authenticity and , occasionally , its opposite whether that be ersatz country music \( the rolling stones' far away eyes \) , selfindulgent surrealism \( parts of the beach boys' smile \) , american pop with a puerto rican accent and boogaloo rhythm \( el gran combo s \) or fullon crossovers like the chieftains' 1995 album long black veil , which includes a jam with the stones on the rocky road to dublin , a jig that briefly breaks out into jumpin' jack flash the beach boys and the stones both played on the tami show in 1964 , a liveperformance feature film shot at the santa monica civic auditorium in los angeles and though they obviously sound different on the surface , the beach boys' set , starting with had its own indirect connections to el gran combo that song used the surfrock beat , a spedup cousin of the afrocuban habanera it had a nearly constant vocal chorus with highpitched harmonies \( brian wilson sang in a falsetto , like eddie perez , the saxophonist and background singer in el gran combo \) it used hard breaks and dropouts to drive up the energy of dancers and it drew its power from the drums dennis wilson s rude kickdrum and snare beats were rawer , but not so different in impact , from the attack of the percussionists roberto roena , martin qui ones and milton correa in el gran combo songs from the same period , like the beach boys built on sophisticated technique they had studied from afar the harmonies of the midwestern vocal quartet the just as el gran combo , as younger musicians in puerto rico , studied the arrangements of the cuban son they heard on the radio and from records in song after song both bands celebrated women or their homeland , and sometimes the two subjects at once the beach boys had california girls , el gran combo like el gran combo and the stones and chieftains too the beach boys were n't necessarily pioneers of anything as far as surf music was concerned , dick dale had released let s go trippin' about six months before surfin' safari that was a regional hit , but surfin' safari broke nationally eventually the group s songwriting brain , brian wilson , found a way to merge the sounds he learned from the everly brothers , chuck berry and the four freshmen into a fanciful , interior , harmonyobsessed sound world , in projects like pet sounds and smile el gran combo , led by the pianist rafael ithier , was the regular band on the puerto rican television show el show de las 12 , starting in 1963 cortijo y su combo had started in 1955 , one year after the beginning of television in puerto rico , and its had helped break down the kind of institutional racism on the island that kept black bands out of highvisibility jobs there had been black puerto rican pop stars before but no important black band , and none who had so effectively adapted the old puerto rican bomba rhythms into a danceband context so when the cortijo band ended after a drug bust , and mr ithier , the pianist , formed his new group with all the members but cortijo and the lead singer , ismael rivera , el gran combo s mandate was clear continue the same formula and expand also in the tami show , in mismatched suits , the stones played i'm all right , a repetition song held down with a keith richards guitar ostinato not too far in function , if you like , from an afrocuban tumbao mr jagger held four maracas , the basic unit of afrolatin percussion , and shook them , two in each hand first as a kind of proxy for his still body , then as a kind of ritual instrument to provoke the audience as he roamed the stage the young record collectors in the rolling stones drew their inspiration from black american singers and bands that had n't penetrated their own culture yet , including bo diddley , whose records , with their mixture of blues and antillean rhythm , probably gave mr jagger the idea about maracas but their greater act of liberation may have been their invention of the perfectly twofaced rock band pious toward its sources , vulgar toward its audience , amped up and on the hustle when they started playing as an interval band at the marquee , the british writer nik cohn recalled in a recent conversation , there was a lot of talk that they were trash this was in contrast to , the traditionminded harmonica player 10 years their senior , whom london blues aficionados regarded as the real deal and though the stones were in love with muddy waters and jimmy reed , mr cohn continued , it was implicit from the beginning that they were not averse to money it has been ever so on the surface the chieftains were less like the others they did n't sing and had no sex appeal they sat down when they played and used a bodhran , a single framedrum , instead of a drum set like the stones they studied their sources unlike the stones they wanted to make an oral music more streamlined and precise , less boisterous but as with el gran combo they began as an ambitious defection from another important group , ceoltoiri chualann in that ensemble and on their own , they aimed to move traditional irish music away from the common models , like the ceilidh dance band , with parts played in unison which , with its violins and flutes , has a distant afrocaribbean analogue in the cuban charanga orchestra and they got the audience they sought they were embraced by the new british bohemia \( the stones loved their early records \) the beach boys down to one original member in recent years , mike love , the lead singer have just reunited with brian wilson and al jardine they 've had steady work through the years at wineries , resorts , casinos and , but now their great lost album smile , officially released last year 44 years off schedule may yet be understood as one of the greatest pop records ever made , a puzzle of miniepisodes their influence ripples in strange directions their more experimental records lie under the conceptual , bigmelody freakery of the indierock band animal collective , and it s only a short hop from there to nonmacho stadium pop like coldplay s mylo xyloto they will begin a 50date tour including brian wilson , starting in april at the new orleans jazz heritage festival , and record new material this year el gran combo , with two original members , performed more than 260 times last year and has never stopped recording four of its albums went to no 1 on the billboard tropical album chart over the last decade in 2012 the band will tour again 50 dates , beginning in may through the efforts of both mr ithier and its current pianist and musical director , willie sotelo , its records , like 2009 s sin salsa no hay paraiso , are still excellent precise and strong , even if their broadening of style stopped in the '80s , before salsa romantic and reggaet n emerged \( the key to longevity , mr ithier said in a phone interview last week , is discipline and organization \) as the scholar frances aparicio wrote in her book listening to salsa , among puerto ricans , el gran combo is not a traditional group but musical tradition itself likewise , the chieftains ended up embodying the rootsmusic history they started out studying , through constant availability for film soundtracks and endless collaborations \( mr moloney once described them as more a than a band , perhaps jokingly , perhaps not \) their new record , with a corral of rootsy and indie guests including the carolina chocolate drops and the decemberists , comes out feb 21 on hear concord they 'll tour the united states in february and march and the stones' longterm success has been the most striking their latest album , a bigger bang , from 2005 , sold a million copies without a hit single , and their last set of shows , in 20057 , was the secondhighest grossing tour of its kind in history , with more than four and a half million tickets sold meanwhile , like the beach boys , they have parallel lives as their younger selves previously unreleased studio outtakes and live performances keep tumbling out , including the recent reissue of 1978 s some girls and the appearance late last year of , where the band is making available old concert tapes like the 1973 brussels affair this is what a 50year old band looks like a dynastic machine , in some cases more symbolic than real , producing new material from the present and the past simultaneously , collaborative and flexible , an entity much bigger than its music a well of history and a blank slate for representing the ideals of the culture we 'll see much more of this in the future plenty of new bands will be willing to keep standing when they turn 50 but whether anyone wants to prop them up may depend on whether other years are as propititious for a band to be born in as 1962
karak , jordan beneath a statue of a glowering saladin , the medieval islamic warrior , a crowd unfurled banners and began chanting protests against the country s leadership in its palaces and government offices far below the precipices of this ancient fortress town jordan s hashemite monarch , , who turned 50 last month , has had to become accustomed to such scenes as he celebrates the 13th anniversary of his rule we want social justice , the crowd chanted after friday prayers on jan 27 , reading from a handwritten list of political , economic and social grievances real elections , they shouted i'm a citizen , not a beggar such public criticism of jordan s nearly centuryold monarchy would have been unthinkable just a year ago among these tribesmen of the heartland the king s opponents among urban liberals and islamist fundamentalists have long called for change in the country s political and economic systems but the protesters here are part of the monarchy s main popular base , the tribes outside of the cities no one appeared scared , or deterred , as the secret police recorded the protesters , who belong to the same families from which the nation s security officers have long been recruited when the arab spring began , jordan initially appeared vulnerable to the protests that were roiling other nations and toppling their longserving dictators with none of the resources of its wealthy neighbors on the persian gulf , jordan struggles with rising energy costs , a water shortage , social strains and an official unemployment rate of around 12 percent with unofficial estimates of at least double that but jordan is also small , with only about 65 million people , and its king has managed to avoid the kind of turmoil that has upended other arab countries by granting modest concessions like dismissing government ministers and preserving popular subsidies and by employing the security forces those forces have proved efficient in suppressing domestic and external challenges , and human rights groups have accused them of restricting freedoms of expression and assembly the king also has tried to appease public anger over corruption on thursday , announced that the authorities had detained a former chief of the intelligence service , mohammad aldahabi , in connection with a continuing graft investigation other prominent officials and businessmen also are facing investigation the protest in karak was not intended to topple a monarchy , and at most , 150 protesters had gathered unlike in cairo or tunis , the demonstrators here called for overhauling the system , not bringing it down until this moment , we believe all the authority in the country is with the king and the people have no will , said ali dala'in , a former member of parliament who was in the crowd our main purpose is to return authority to the people and to have a monarchy similar to that in britain , a constitutional monarchy with iraq s sunnishiite tension to its east and the israelipalestinian conflict on the western border , jordan is situated precariously or , as king abdullah likes to say , between iraq and a hard place there are also tensions between east bankers , the country s original residents , who take their name from the nation s location along the river jordan , and the millions of who have arrived in successive waves and are now a majority of the population analysts say that several factors unique to jordan have contributed to its stability , including the king s promises of democratic reforms , which have led some critics to wait to see if  in a speech in the capital , amman , last week , reported by petra , the king outlined the goals of what he described as selftransformation and progressive reform fair parliamentary elections , a law guaranteeing the broadest representation , a parliament based on political parties and governments drawn from that parliament but fear is also one of the main reasons that jordan has remained calm , analysts said the bloodshed in syria dominates the television coverage here , where many families share tribal bonds with syrians it does n't suit any party in jordan east bankers , west bankers , rightwingers , leftwingers , anybody to have the regime fall , said samer tawil , a former economics minister especially with what we have seen in our neighborhood as a result of the chaos that started with the iraq war and that continued with the arab spring mr tawil also identified another factor unique to jordan the deepseated fear among both east bankers and jordanian palestinians that if jordan disintegrates outsiders may try to turn it into a palestinian state maintaining the delicate balance between the east bankers and those palestinians is a matter of utmost importance to many jordanians , and anything perceived to be a threat to that balance draws strong reaction across the political spectrum so aware are palestinians of the delicacy of the issue that when , he reassured his hosts that hamas completely rejects the notion of an alternative homeland yet discontent often simmers just beneath the surface , whether among the tribes or among teenagers in madaba , just 15 miles south of the capital last month , udai abu issa , 18 , climbed atop a government building and set fire to a portrait of abdullah the teenager was swiftly sentenced to two years in jail sitting in their cold , rundown house where the peeling paint hangs from the ceiling the teenager s relatives conceded that he had crossed a red line but his mother , thawra , said his gesture was an expression of his internal anger and vented her own frustrations that recent pay cuts had left her husband barely able to support the family on his salary of 420 a month as a hospital accountant people should be asking why the picture was burned , she said there is anger , and the way to keep this anger at bay is reform
for more than four decades most americans identified the democratic party with a social contract and safety net , equality of justice and opportunity , and progressive yes , even liberal causes sometime in the last 30 years the party of progress and change emerson s party of hope became the party of reactionary liberalism this phrase would be an oxymoron were it not for the fact that merely defending social programs , liberal programs , is reactionary those programs included roosevelt s social safety net , as expanded by johnson s great society , and the expansion of minority rights and women s rights after that they include the framework of environmental laws of the 1960s and 70s , often supported and occasionally created by what were then moderate republicans but beginning dramatically in the 1970s things changed things being globalization and foreign competition the decline of the manufacturing base petroleumproducing nations controlling the price of oil and the unsustainable costs of cold war military engagements and deployments the opec oil embargoes of 1974 and 1979 contributed to the combination of stagnation and inflation and to the flattening of household incomes for the first time since the beginning of world war ii meanwhile , the numbers of people qualifying for assistance under new deal and great society programs increased , as did the overall costs of operating those programs , especially in the area of health care the democratic party during this period had the opportunity to develop a new economic platform but failed to do so having no constructive response to a tide of economic and social revolutions , it clung to the defense of its historic social agenda , which required taxation of working class and middle income people to finance that agenda at a time when their own economic security was endangered as todd s purdum described this phenomenon recently in vanity fair , the democrats came across more and more as the crouched consolidators and defenders of past gains thomas e mann and norman j ornstein echoed this conclusion in their new book , it s even worse than it looks the democrats , they write , have become the more statusquo oriented , centrist protectors of government the democratic response of triangulation and centrism , essentially splitting the difference between reactionary liberalism and increasingly virulent conservatism , cost the party its identity a few political figures of my generation , essentially those swept into office by the postwatergate tidal wave in the mid1970s , began to fashion an alternative , comprehensive , longrange agenda built around the managed transition of the economic base of the united states from traditional manufacturing to information and communications in sum , this involved transforming our steel and auto industry into plants that produced high value products at which we could excel combining a package of tax incentives , advanced scientific research investments , computer education and workertraining programs , information highway acceleration and developing competitive free trade initiatives \( as opposed to the protectionist measures that sought , canutelike , to hold back the tide of globalization \) that would help us maintain a lead in the emerging worlds of science and technology the confusion this effort to reposition the democratic party caused in the traditional political media of the time is suggested by the fact that within a two or threemonth period i was featured in one magazine as a neoliberal and in another as a neoconservative none of this agenda lent itself to traditional ideological categories this economic transformation policy came to be combined in my case with a new foreign policy approach detailed under the label enlightened engagement and thereafter with a postcoldwar defense policy based upon carefully detailed military reforms that anticipated the coming transformation of war and the rise of irregular , unconventional conflict these initiatives were the answer to the clever debate taunt , where s the beef \? but they also resisted media insistence on soundbite compression one does not have to agree with the details of these new departures in the three major policy areas of governance the economy , foreign policy and defense to admit that they did offer a much more positive response to the revolutions in globalization , information , energy , nationalism , and the transformation of conflict than the crouched defense of the status quo and past achievements the principal theory of those of my generation who believed every bit as strongly in the social contract and care for the needy as the most ardent new dealer was that the economic pie must continue to grow to generate the revenues required to finance that contract to argue that taxes on the working middle class must continue even as incomes contracted is to virtually guarantee a revival of conservatism and antigovernment sentiments of the kind that now characterize our politics the democratic party has not only been the party of hope , the party of compassion and inclusiveness , it has also been the party of innovation by failing to innovate some 30 years ago , it has permitted itself to lapse into the defensive , if not also reactionary , posture that now plagues it a wellmotivated democratic president now struggles to move the nation forward against a conservative tide that emerged in the policy vacuum created by democratic failure to adapt and in a political climate where many people , especially young people , do not know the basic principles of the current democratic party or what it stands for
when seth macfarlane calls to talk about his directorial debut , ted , he s multitasking , of course he s just finished another day of work overseeing the three fox animated comedies he produces family guy , the cleveland show and american dad and is preparing to attend a benefit that night it s a little crazy , mr macfarlane said but i can shower and get dressed while we 're on the phone ted , due june 29 from universal , stars mark wahlberg as a man still living with the toy bear he wished to life when he was a boy mr macfarlane , 38 , not only directed the movie \( on a reported budget of 65 million \) and wrote the screenplay \( with family guy collaborators alec sulkin and wellesley wild \) , he plays the title character a living , talking , cursing , potsmoking teddy bear that he portrayed using motioncapture technology in these excerpts from that interview , mr macfarlane talks about making ted and the many responsibilities he juggles as a television producer and firsttime filmmaker q compared to some of the things you 've done on family guy , the story of an obscene talking teddy bear could almost seem conventional where did the idea for ted come from \? a it was an idea that i had for an animated series and when i decided it s probably about time for me to make a movie , that seemed like a cool idea the avatarslashlord of the rings technology had reached a point where you could create a fictionallooking character that was completely real in movement it s been in adventure films , in fantasy films where more than a comedy do you need subtle character actors \? q how much of your family guy sensibility the popcultural references the patrick stewart voiceovers did you want to have in your film debut \? a i tend to not overthink that stuff too much it s a melting pot of a million different factors you want to do something that s fresh , and at the same time , you do n't want to completely alienate your audience by doing a holocaust drama it s a balancing act between wanting to try new things and at the same time being conscious of what your fan base wants to see q in primetime network television , you have many boundaries and content restrictions how do you decide for yourself , in an rrated movie , when a joke has gone too far \? a if nobody s laughing , you know that you went too far oftentimes you 'll hear an audible groan from an audience unless you think it s the greatest joke in the world and you 'll just absolutely kill yourself if it s not in the movie if that joke just dies at 7 or 8 screenings , then it just does n't work you have to trust the audience , because that s who you 're making the movie for q do you see deeper meaning in this story of a man who cannot achieve adulthood until he parts ways with this literal artifact from his youth \? a absolutely it s a classic story in a lot of ways , but it just had n't really been told in this literal sense , with the symbol of childhood right there , next to you , smoking a cigarette but that was a conscious choice we did n't want this to be an episode of family guy q is that a criticism that gets leveled against you , that you ca n't seem to avoid cultural nostalgia in your work \? a to me there s nothing wrong with being nostalgic about pieces of pop culture that are important to you you see it in every generation certainly in film , and definitely in animation , there is that daily struggle between acknowledging that you 're an adult , and at the same time , being in a business that requires you to keep a very juvenile part of your brain alive and active , on a regular basis q the campy 1980 film version of flash gordon gets referenced a lot in ted were you a fan of that movie growing up \? a i actually was n't as a child i had a lot of friends who were but it s a film that s so absurd and so ridiculous and something that is the subject of sustained debate over whether they knew what they were doing or whether it was just a horrible accident on any give day , how many times do you reference a piece of pop culture or a brand name \? i bet it s a lot more often than we think i'm going across the street to starbucks i 'll make a xerox of it our daily lives are packed with proper nouns of the corporate kind q do you feel the stakes are particularly high because this is your directorial debut \? a there is a lot of that there s two ways to look at it one , it s my first movie so there s going to be a lot of eyes on it two , if it does n't do well , eh , it s just my first movie , i 'll get better for me , it s got to be received well enough that it does n't seem insane to make another one my first movie ca n't be ishtar q if it does n't do well , could people conclude , he s a tv guy , but that sensibility just does n't translate to film \? a yes , that is possible my god , there are plenty of worse thing to be known as than a tv guy television has been great to me and i 've had a blast doing the shows it would n't be the end of the world q are you already planning your next movie \? a
i am feeling totally cheated the new hampshire primary is over , and none of the republicans went away this is not how things are supposed to work in america every week , one contestant is supposed to be eliminated that s the way it is in politics one day you 're in , the next day you 're out well , here we are all six alleged republican presidential contenders are still with us and getting ready for the next primary in south carolina , the palmetto state you probably have some serious policybased questions not really a good question , but it s a tree a palmetto bug is a large , flying cockroach , but that is definitely not on the state flag south carolina is also known as the iodine state , but that absolutely never comes up in political commentary when five of your six candidates could not be elected president if they were running against millard fillmore , i think you can presume there will not be much serious issue discussion however , there will undoubtedly be a great deal of talk about the threat of european socialism and whether or not mitt romney is a vulture one of those venture capital vultures that , in the inimitable words of rick perry , are sitting out there on a tree limb , waiting for the company to get sick , and then they sweep in , they eat the carcass , they leave with that , and they leave the skeleton also , whether mitt romney is an obamacarepassing european socialist yes ! this is all about each state finding its own , unique answer to its own special health care issue romneycare , mitt explains , was right for massachusetts because the state was faced with the choice of requiring everyone to have health insurance or continuing to allow people without insurance to go to the hospital and get free care , paid for by the government , paid for by the taxpayers this shows you how different the situation in each state is , since it is well known that in other parts of the country , sick and uninsured people do not go to hospitals but instead are encouraged to present themselves to the nearest local nail salon all the candidates in the republican primaries seem obsessed with the idea that the united states is in danger of becoming like europe , which would be the worst thing imaginable \( rick santorum they have nothing to fight for they have nothing to live for \) the gingrich camp claimed that mitt romney was a fan of european socialism when he said something nice about the valueadded tax however , it s been mitt that s been sounding the most europhobic he s been warning that the president takes his inspiration from the capitals of europe and is attempting to turn the country into a europeanstyle social welfare state \( do you think he really means takes his from the capitals of europe \? next stop barack obama , brussels puppet \) what do you think s up with mitt \? perhaps he s afraid we 'll all start demanding free child care and freshbaked bread he did live in france for more than two years as a mormon missionary and he did n't make many converts also , he had harsh things to say about the toilets to understand newt gingrich , you have to envision a mixture of kill bill and carrie , after sissy spacek gets hit with the bucket of blood his only mission in life is getting even with mitt romney and the rich minions who paid for all those antinewt ads in iowa he is exactly like sweeney todd mixed with charles bronson in death wish and maybe a smidge of shogun assassin now gingrich has roped in a few rich minions of his own , and they 've just put out romney looks than the evil banker in it s a wonderful life it s full of hearttugging former factory workers who used to have happy homes and wonderful christmases until by the time it s over , you will want to gather up the peasants and march on one of romney s mansions with flaming torches there is nothing gingrich wo n't do to get mitt at the end of the video , there s a clip of romney speaking french ! and now newt s web site has a video that basically asks whether america will elect a president who once drove to canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car which is , of course , an excellent question
under the new foreclosure settlement , the banks have six to nine months to determine who is eligible for relief and , in all , have three years to distribute the aid millions of struggling homeowners and the still fragile economy need more help right now the best solutions are loan modifications that reduce principal balances because a lower overall debt burden both restores equity and reduces monthly payments but the settlement will help only a small slice of the millions of americans who are behind in their payments and in or near foreclosure , or the many millions more who are current but underwater and at high risk of default the best way to get help to many of them is through fannie mae and freddie mac , the governmentrun mortgage companies , which hold roughly 30 million mortgage loans , none of which are covered in last week s settlement the obama administration has recently increased the incentives for the companies to write down the troubled loans on their books but in the past , the agencies' regulator has resisted calls to engage in principal writedowns because he fears they may incur undue losses that makes no economic sense , because defaults and foreclosures are generally far costlier than timely principal reductions if the regulator continues to balk , president obama needs to directly challenge his stubbornness , and , if necessary , fight for legislation to compel the agencies' cooperation another important form of relief is refinancing , which allows homeowners stuck in highrate loans to qualify for a lower rate and lower monthly payments the administration has put forth farreaching proposals to help homeowners qualify for refinancing but the proposals would be paid for , in part , by a new tax on banks that requires congressional approval , which republicans are unlikely to provide the white house needs to challenge republicans to explain why they are more interested in protecting the banks than protecting homeowners and challenge them to come up with a better way to pay for the necessary relief too much time has already been wasted foreclosures will not be stanched and house prices will not stabilize without more help
indianapolis there were areas reserved for 17 prominent at media day tuesday , a group that included kyle arrington and matthew slater but not the player who competed on dancing with the stars , has ridden a bull and used to host a dating show on cable television why do i need a podium for \? said chad ochocinco , who , surrounded by a scrum of reporters , proceeded to answer the question i 've got three million followers on twitter that s my podium just not this week as ochocinco prepares for his first , his twitter account an engaging repository of stream of consciousness has fallen silent , just as he did in his first season in new england he caught all of 15 passes he scored one touchdown he has appeared in one play during the playoffs the transition , from flamboyant star to diminished afterthought , has humbled him it s so much bigger than what everybody else is thinking about they 're thinking about the individual , ochocinco said if i thought about all that , i would have gotten cut week 3 complaining about the ball feel me \? it s been a joy wait , what \? on further review , this was actually ochocinco the same guy who once banked 100 , 000 before a season to pay fines that he expected to accrue for excessive \( and inventive \) celebrations and not some doppelg nger impostor sent to proselytize the patriot way for so long , ochocinco craved attention and got it in new england , he shunned it he had to if he wanted to live in harmony with coach , there was no other choice as he saw it , he could either keep my mouth shut and do what i'm told or i 'd be at home watching at this point he spoke tuesday of fulfillment , of selfrealization and of personal satisfaction , and with no trace of regret that one of the nfl s most visible players had become almost invisible on the field he showed discretion , refusing to bite when deion sanders , an analyst for nfl network , mentioned that he told tom brady to throw his way on sunday asked whether he would trade a super bowl appearance for a 100catch season and no shackles on his outsize personality , ochocinco did not hesitate i 'd rather be here , he said , adding the winning experience is always great , whether you have a big role , small role , no role at all that s awesome everything this year has been something that i 've never been used to what i 've had this year is something i could grow accustomed to from the moment when ochocinco arrived in new england , it seemed an incongruous home he went from craving attention in cincinnati to shunning it with the patriots he rarely spoke with reporters , but said he realized the fears would he be able to handle himself the right way in different circumstances , when he s not that guy , when he s not the focal point \? would he be able to handle it \? acquired on the same july day as albert haynesworth another lowrisk , highreward talent sucked into belichick s vortex \( but escaped , in a november trade to tampa bay \) ochocinco , in theory , presented brady with a deep threat that the patriots lacked his longest catch , a 53yarder against the jets in week 10 , came after blown coverage he caught four passes the rest of the season if the reduced role bothered him , ochocinco did not say the offensive coordinator bill o'brien said he was very , very proud to have worked with ochocinco , and teammates lauded his work ethic and selflessness he s been a true professional this year with how he s handled everything , said slater , who added he s bought into the team concept and what we 're trying to accomplish it s not been about him or what he 'd get out of it this week is his reward and on tuesday , after waiting 11 years to participate in a super bowl media day , ochocinco enjoyed himself he spoke of an offseason soccer excursion to england and his coming nuptials \( the big dance here , the big dance there \) he also mentioned an 8foot pet alligator called emilio that may or may not be real , a nugget he revealed to jaguars running back maurice jonesdrew , who obviously represented none other than the ochocinco news network when a reporter wearing a camera stuck to his forehead asked him if he was ready to win a super bowl for mexico , ochocinco said , no , i'm ready to win a super bowl for the patriots that response illuminates an intriguing subplot will ochocinco , after being inactive for the afc championship game , even dress \? cheering from the sideline would fit the theme of his season , but , he was asked , what was he hoping for \? i hope just to have fun , ochocinco said that s what i 've always wanted and that s what i 've always done i 've always had fun
oklahoma city the hug came as the clock struck zero and the roars and streamers inside the chesapeake energy arena cascaded from the rafters a week after they appeared invincible , time had run out on the , and as embraced kevin durant near midcourt , the thunder s future had officially begun led by durant s 34 points , oklahoma city won the west with a wednesday night , dispatching san antonio after spotting the spurs a twogamestonone lead in the conference finals the spurs were quick to acknowledge the pure talent and athleticism that floored them in four consecutive games they just wanted it they played more together as a team , said the spurs' stephen jackson , who provided a lift with 23 points and made 6 of 7 3point attempts after being moribund for most of the series i'm not going to make excuses they beat us they were the better team we had our time it s just their time now the spurs looked as if they were fighting the inevitable even as they built 18point leads in the first half and fended off several thunder runs after taking a 6348 halftime lead , they scored only 36 points in the second half amid a torrent of uptempo rushes by the thunder that seemed to age the spurs by the minute their talent was just impressive , duncan said i do n't think it was lack of effort on our part i think we laid it out there and we gave all we could , but they were the better team duncan , tony parker and manu ginobili had appeared ageless as san antonio rolled to 20 consecutive victories , 10 in a row to start these playoffs they showed desperate flashes of precision wednesday night as they tried to force a game 7 parker led with 29 points and 12 assists , duncan scored 25 points and had 14 rebounds and ginobili could only muster 10 points but could not author one last stand we can talk about it all we want , but the bottom line is they outplayed us when it mattered , duncan said down , 10399 , with one minute left , clinging to a puncher s chance , the spurs reached deep and found nothing there flailing with three chances on one possession , they whiffed on every one duncan made a clutch spin move for a sure layin , but kendrick perkins flew across the lane and rejected him jackson misfired on a 3pointer and parker clanked a 3pointer the thunder grabbed the rebound and started a fast break that ended in an emphatic perkins dunk as sad and disappointed as we are , you really have to think about it s almost like a hollywood script for okc , spurs coach gregg popovich said , ticking off a roll call of the thunder s run through the playoffs as a rite of passage of sorts the dallas mavericks , the defending champions , were swept the los angeles lakers were ousted in five games the spurs vanquished in six those three franchises have represented the western conference in the last 13 finals and accounted for 10 titles and now they 're going to go and play either boston or miami , and that 'll be 11 of the last 13 championships , popovich continued i do n't know if anybody has ever had a run or gone through a playoff playing those kinds of teams it s incredible ginobili and the spurs admitted throughout the series that the thunder s youth trumped san antonio s experience we ca n't have their legs , their energy , ginobili said we 're never going to jump as high or run as fast still , the spurs recognized a mirror image of themselves , albeit a much younger one , even as they tried to extend their dynasty to five league titles since 1999 it s hard not to be optimistic about the future of their franchise , ginobili said they are great they have so much talent , and they are so athletic , and they 've got a great front office we know sam presti , he continued , referring to the thunder general manager and a former spurs executive he s a sharp guy , and he pulled this basically out of nothing they 've got a very bright future asked where the spurs might be headed in the wake of their defeat , ginobili grinned and said , same place we 've been going the last eight years we are fine we just faced a great , young team we had a great run , we just could n't beat these guys
elliott key , fla like many florida schemes , the city of islandia sprang from the delusions of land developers who imagined a rollicking resort town on an inaccessible speck of coral rock north of key largo in the end , their dreams were just another florida hustle , one the authorities are finally poised to shut down next month , more than 50 years after islandia s incorporation , the miamidade board of county commissioners is expected to take a vote to abolish its tiniest city a chain of 33 islands , reachable only by boat , with elliott key as its centerpiece islandia \( population 5 \) will not be missed , in large part because islandia \( pronounced eyelandeeyah \) never existed it was always more a developers' mirage than a spot on the map islandia has no school , no sewers , no courthouse , no shops and no road leading in or out in fact , most of it sits on national park land it once had a municipal government but that too was a ruse , a function of voter shenanigans that went unnoticed by the county for nearly 30 years since 1961 , none of the voters who chose islandia s succession of mayors and city council members actually lived on the chain of islands , a violation of state law only property owners voted , and for simplicity s sake , they elected themselves \( conveniently , city hall meetings were held inside real estate offices in the miami area \) the aspirations of islandia s city officials began to unravel in 1989 that s when the town s newly elected , but wholly unauthorized , police chief fashioned his own uniform and walked into park headquarters with a sidearm in his holster it was an unorthodox bid at legitimacy alarmed , the park rangers telephoned law enforcement and the miamidade state attorney s office , and that led to a finding that islandia s government had long been illegal the city shuffled toward its demise gradually and now suddenly for years , the state had asked the county to do away with the city , which had become a bureaucratic annoyance it was not until recently , though , that the county had a way of abolishing a city they do n't operate like a city , said commissioner dennis c moss , whose district includes islandia they do n't have any elected officials it s not a city but it has quite a colorful history , he added once a hideout for pirates , the 33 northernmost islands are now one of the florida keys' last unspoiled pockets , bypassed in the early 1900s by henry flagler s overseas railroad to key west and the overseas highway it was most endangered in 1960 when deeppocketed developers and quixotic conservationists , known as bird watchers at the time , fought one of south florida s most formidable battles over the land to everyone s surprise , the bird watchers won decades later , the ocean waters , translucent and shallow , remain a playground for lobster , fish , sharks and coral mahogany , buttonwood , gumbolimbo and mangrove trees abound boaters drop anchor to swim offshore and to fish \( and kick back cocktails \) children stay on elliott key for overnight camping trips you can get the hell out there and restore the soul , said lloyd miller , 91 , who lives not too far away in homestead and helped lead the fight to preserve the pristine archipelago you just go out there and sit in a boat and listen to the quiet it s good for the soul so few places you can do that anymore back in 1960 , the conservationists sought to protect the islands from the proposed construction of a nearby oil refinery and seaport and also from grand plans to blanket tiny , sevenmile elliott key in luxury hotels , shopping centers and beachfront homes thirteen of the islands' 18 registered voters , all of them landowners who wanted development , cast ballots \( in a ballot box ferried by boat \) to incorporate islandia , as they called it incorporation , they figured , was a sure way to skirt state and federal zoning rules and to secure a causeway that would cross the bay from the mainland luther l brooks , a politically connected former bootlegger who once described a politician as so crooked he ca n't wear his shoes , became islandia s first mayor no sooner was he elected than he began to call in favors from politicians to help develop the island his day job was collecting rent from half of miami s black population , living in segregated housing by 1963 , the landowners had persuaded the florida governor to spearhead construction of the causeway development seemed inevitable one day for sure there will be a causeway to islandia , a miami herald editorial predicted but conservationists , including juanita greene , a herald reporter \( and girlfriend of mr brooks \) pulled together their own savvy team mr miller contacted stewart udall , the secretary of the interior , a staunch environmentalist he sent aides to look at elliott key , and decided it was worth saving representative dante b fascell , the late democratic congressman , was persuaded to join the effort , and began to push for a law to turn the island and its underwater acres into a federal park then hoover arrived , said mr miller , of herbert hoover jr , the head of the vacuum cleaner company , and so did his money mr hoover had fallen in love with biscayne bay as a child , when lobster and shrimp coated the ocean floor he wanted the chain declared a national monument and underwrote the campaign nothing could slow the movement to conserve the islands , not even an announcement made in 1967 by albert c bostwick jr , an heir to the standard oil company fortune his plan to build a splashy marina with cottages , villas and dock spaces on elliott key never got off the ground in 1968 , islandia officials made one final incursion they brought bulldozers by barge to elliott key and ordered workers to cut a 125footwide strip across the island it was a makeshift road meant to scar the island enough to sour the federal government spite highway , it was dubbed , and its remnants remain today several months later , in october 1968 , president lyndon b johnson signed the bill to turn much of islandia into a national monument it later became biscayne national park today , 2 of the 33 islands remain in private hands of islandia s five residents , three are park employees , one is married to a park worker and one is a private resident deb johnson , the wife of one of the park workers , stood outside her house on tiny adams key gardening on a postcardready day butterflies and egrets alighted nearby her front yard is the atlantic ocean she has one neighbor , a park ranger she watches the sunrise from her dock every morning and sits mesmerized by lightning storms in the evenings residents here need to be hardy , though milk and bread are a boat ride away winter is perfect summer is not i have to wear a bug suit , she said it looks like a beekeeper s suit and it keeps out the mosquitoes that swarm she cannot leave the house without it during the summer it s not always paradise , she said , on a balmy , sunny february morning right now it is the place is so beautiful that the people who leave do not often do so by choice one of islandia s wouldbe developers and its final mayor , jack pyms , sought unsuccessfully for years to build hundreds of stilt homes on his island in 1990 , he lost his property to foreclosure shortly after , he moved to colorado and won the state lottery
2 chainz is 35 , tall and gangly , all awkward angles a workingclassminded interloper into a hiphop era that has largely shelved selfpresentations that are less than 110 percent polished , he juts out , tough to miss his luxury restaurant is benihana , not philippe his luxury brand is polo , not margiela he rapped for more than a decade with little to no acclaim he is nobody s sex symbol in other words , by current standards 2 chainz is all liabilities a known quantity and a work in progress who reveals the seams of hiphop ambition he is the part of themselves that rookie rappers try to hide and far more successful rappers have long since hidden in the back of their closets perhaps that s why he s so loved over the last year and a half has evolved from atlanta bit player he was formerly named tity boi , as part of the duo playaz circle to rising star , thanks especially to the embrace of his peers he s become something of a hiphop mascot , appearing on dozens of other artists' songs everyone from justin bieber to kanye west to young jeezy adding reliable jolts of candor and rangy energy based on a tru story \( def jam \) , his justreleased solo majorlabel debut album , is palpable fun , always enjoyable even if it s never innovative the production is pounding , demanding attention , and 2 chainz sticks to what he s done so well recently supremely confident notsoslick talk he s prone to stretchedout exclamations his accent is fabulous , slithery and full of words that fade into vowels and he s got a sense of humor on one song , after mentioning playing hot potato , he stops to act out what the game would sound like , and on another , he sings part of new edition s mr telephone man , terribly but endearingly on the terrific over a signature frightening plinking production by dj mustard , 2 chainz sets himself apart from the riffraff bitch sit down you got a bad atti gave her the wrong number and a bad addy you ai n't goin' nowhere like a bad navi if dave chappelle was still in the business of poking fun at hiphop s eccentrics , his 2 chainz character would be a viral sensation for the most part , though , 2 chainz does n't withstand close lyrical scrutiny his lines are short and frequently vacant , and often begin a hair after the beginning of the beat , as if he had just thought of the idea and had to shout it out quickly he likens himself to viagra in almost the same way on backtoback songs sometimes he tends toward complex internal rhyme , but just as often he s merely exulting but 2 chainz oozes with intangibles no rapper currently working conveys a sense of impending arrival the way he does every sentence of his can be roughly translated to i just got here ! and i'm thrilled ! the confidence and directness he displays make him an underdog worth rooting for his boasts can be absurd and childlike getting endorsed by baking soda , say , or might valet park a brink s truck or suicide doors ! rest in peace to my car , though , which is adorable babble many of his funniest lines are , sadly , unprintable plenty of songs on this album do n't evolve much beyond their hooks , insidiously catchy though they may be 2 chainz fills in the blanks colorfully , but not always memorably a series of 2 chainz love songs are emotionally leaden , but almost clumsily credible i love you now i do n't care about your ratchet past sometimes his seduction is unexpectedly clever pull in to that culdesac backed in , no chauffeur back seat like a sofa part of 2 chainz s strategy has been ubiquity in addition to his guest appearances , he s been taken on tour by drake embraced by mr west , who informally inducted 2 chainz into his team \( and whose close associate virgil abloh served as creative director for this album \) recruited by nicki minaj to rap on her song as well as to dance up against her in the video in the least erotic way possible all these artists appear on this album , sounding loose and festive they seem to be having fun , dropping some of the trappings that usually come with making their own songs best is mr west , who delivers some primo kanye spite on last birthday she got you a new sweater put it on , give her a kiss and tell her , do better' you can virtually hear drake chuckling during his blithely cocky verse on no lie she think i'm the realest out and i say , damn that makes two of us' oh that look like what sher name chances are it is what shername the houston veteran scarface is intense on ghetto dreams , where 2 chainz pays homage to him by emulating his sober narratives , his rare reflective moment on this album notably none of the guests , save for his playaz circle partner dolla boy on stop me now , hail from atlanta t i , so memorable on the remix of 2 chainz s is loud by his absence 2 chainz has become bigger than his city but he has not changed a bit the album begins with yuck ! a collaboration with lil wayne , energized by quick , punchy strings and full of roundabout 2 chainz wit if you on the pole , play your position i got enough dough to pay your tuition this is a brag , sure , but only 2 chainz would undercut it by including on the song guest vocals from his daughter , heaven , who is 4
r a dickey , the mets pitcher , is climbing mount kilimanjaro this month to raise awareness for the bombay teen challenge , an organization that rescues and cares for women and girls in mumbai who are at risk of being abused and exploited his posts will appear occasionally in bats the last two days of hiking have carried us over steep barren ridges and into deep gorges filled with streams of glacial runoff however , in terms of difficulty , the two days could n't have been more different the hike from barranco camp to karanga camp required us to go up the face of a mountain ridge called the barranco wall this particular ascent represented the most dangerous challenge of our trip due to the width of the ledge and the sheer steepness of the climb there is a pass along the wall called the kissing rock it got its name because the narrow ledge forces you to hug a rock that is jutting out , requiring you to keep your face next to it the whole way as if kissing it , in order to safely pass below is nothing but jagged rock at the base of the ridge although none of us were without fear and apprehension , we were all able to traverse it after the kissing rock , we were encouraged to hear from our guide that nothing from that point on would rival the barranco wall needless to say , that came as a great relief however , when we pressed our guide , he did share a story about a porter who had fallen backwards and was seriously injured the next morning , we got an early start on our way to barafu camp , the base camp for our summit attempt although this hike would take us from 13 , 000 feet to 15 , 000 feet , it was our easiest yet in terms of terrain it took us up a gradual slope for about two hours until we leveled off and ascended again we walked through fields of jagged shale and parched mountain desert it was like what i imagine a postapocalyptic picture would resemble , like a scene out of mad max when we got to barafu camp , we were treated to vistas that defied our small scope of the world and its wonders before us , thousands of feet below , stretched cumulus cloud banks that looked like a neverending field of the softest cotton one can imagine to our right sat mount meru , suspended above the clouds like a giant rocky temple to our left were the sharp peaks of mount mawenzi , another of the kilimanjaro volcanoes being exposed to such majesty is humbling and begs me to contemplate how finite i really am i think , at the very least , each member of our party is motivated to gratitude speaking of humility , when we first arrived at barafu , we were witness to two individuals being rescued from their summit attempt due to severe symptoms of altitude sickness this is a good reminder that although we are so close and can literally see the peak , we are still 4 , 000 feet away from our goal we are confident but know that our own summit attempt will be no layup tonight at 10 30 , we will be awakened to begin our final trek to uhuru peak , the very top of kilimanjaro we are all nervously excited and hopeful that our preparations have been sufficient my next entry will hopefully tell the story of a fantastic summit experience and the adversities we overcame to achieve it this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo the climbing group saw two people being rescued from a summit attempt after they developed severe symptoms of altitude sickness \( photograph by r a dickey \)
melbourne , australia when sam querrey of the united states flashed his slap forehand with a flourish monday , he overwhelmed kenny de schepper of france , a qualifier , 63 , 62 , 62 querrey s next match in the australian open will not be nearly as easy he faces the australian teenager bernard tomic chipping and slicing in a defensive maneuver that wore down and often unnerved his opponent , tomic upset the 22nd seed , fernando verdasco of spain , in the first round the fiveset match riveted tomic s fellow australians though both querrey and tomic are unseeded , tomic could be favored on wednesday off his recent showings , including a quarterfinal appearance at wimbledon querrey withdrew from wimbledon in june , nursing an elbow injury , and skipped the united states open in august but based on his play monday , a resurgent querrey is in position to beat the upstart tomic , especially if tomic finds it difficult to regain his strength after his marathon match now ranked 95th , querrey has scaled the heights of tennis before , rising to 17th in the world only 12 months ago tomic is currently ranked 38th fit and fast , querrey showed up monday on court 19 for a battle of tall men who showed remarkable elasticity in covering the court at 6 feet 6 inches , querrey found himself looking up at de schepper , who stands 68 over a stretch of about five minutes near the end of the second set , the match moved far beyond de schepper s reach querry reeled off point after point , outlasting de schepper in a string of rallies that left querry with a commanding lead , two sets to none , and all the momentum in three quick sets , querrey broke de schepper s serve five times and never lost his own , amassing a total of 92 points in a victory that showed him in some of his best form in nearly a year by the time an exhausted tomic won his upset in 4 hours 11 minutes , querrey had sauntered back to the locker room with a firstround victory that took a mere 66 minutes
la jonquera , spain she had expected a job in a hotel but when valentina arrived here two months ago from romania , the man who helped her get here a man she had considered her boyfriend made it clear that the job was on the side of the road he threatened to beat her and to kill her children if she did not comply and so she stood near a roundabout recently , her hair in a greasy ponytail , charging 40 for intercourse , 27 for oral sex for me , life is finished , she said later that evening , tears running down her face i will never forget that i have done this la jonquera used to be a quiet border town where truckers rested and the french came looking for a deal on handpainted pottery and leather goods but these days , prostitution is big business here , as it is elsewhere in spain , where it is essentially legal while the rest of spain s economy may be struggling , experts say that prostitution almost all of it involving the ruthless trafficking of foreign women is booming , exploding into public view in small towns and big cities the police recently rescued a 19yearold romanian woman from traffickers who had tattooed on her wrist a bar code and the amount she still owed them more than 2 , 500 in the past , most customers were middleaged men but the boom here , experts say , is powered in large part by the desires of young men many of them traveling in packs for the weekend taking advantage of europe s cheap and nearly seamless travel the young used to go to discos , said francina vila i valls , barcelona s councilor for women and civil rights but now they go to brothels it s just another form of entertainment to them there is little reliable data on the subject the state department s 2010 report on trafficking said that 200 , 000 to 400 , 000 women worked in prostitution in spain the report said that 90 percent were trafficked but police officials and advocates say that whatever the number of victims , it is growing thousands of women are forced to work often for even lower pay now , because of the economic downturn everywhere from fancy clubs and private apartments to industrial complexes and lonely country roads europe woke up to the problem of trafficked women in the 1990s , as young women from the former soviet union began to arrive in large numbers , and it has spent much of the last decade developing legal frameworks to address the issue but , some advocates say , this decade will test europe s commitment to enforcing its new laws the structures , by and large , are in place , said luis cdebaca , the ambassador who leads the state department s office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons now it s time to take them out for a drive fueling the boom in the sex industry in spain are many factors , experts say , including porous borders in many parts of the world and lax laws until 2010 , spain did not even have a law that distinguished trafficking from illegal and advocates say arrests of traffickers and services for trafficked women remain few the state department s report on trafficking said that according to preliminary information , the spanish government prosecuted 202 trafficking suspects and convicted 80 in 2010 more important , some advocates say , is the growing demand for sex services from younger tourists of course , there is a local market one study cited by a 2009 united nations report said that 39 percent of spanish men admitted having visited a prostitute at least once it is widely accepted here for business meetings to end in dinner and a visit to a brothel but more recently , experts say , spain has also become a goto destination for sex services in la jonquera , tucked behind an allnight gas station , is the newly opened club paradise , which , with 101 rooms , is one of the largest brothels in europe it caters in large part to young men from france , where many aspects of prostitution are illegal , and perhaps more to the point , buying sex is more expensive on a recent evening , one young man from paris stood in the parking lot of club paradise , bragging about his sexual exploits while his friends looked on the women , he said , did not talk about whether they were being forced to have sex maybe , he said but i think they are having a good time if any of them actually are , they would seem to be the exceptions thirty years ago , virtually all the prostitutes in spain were spanish now , almost none are advocates and police officials say that most of the women are controlled by illegal networks they are modernday slaves the networks vary enormously , and shift constantly some are mom and pop operations out of eastern europe , like the one that controls valentina others have far greater reach , like the nigerian organizations that first began to surface in spain in the last decade deputy inspector xavier cort s camacho , the head of the regional antitrafficking unit in barcelona , said the nigerian groups moved women through northern africa to spain , and then controlled them by threatening to rape or kill their family members back home but mr cort s said that people of maybe a dozen nationalities were involved in the trafficking until recently , for instance , the police in barcelona did not even realize that chinese mafias ran prostitution rings in the city then they began noticing more and more advertisements for chinese , japanese and korean women all of them , it turned out , chinese working in a network of about 30 brothels the working conditions were brutal , mr cort s said on wiretaps , he said , we listened to them complain that they needed to rest , they were in pain but they had to keep working one woman committed suicide after finding out she was hivpositive some of the women are sold into the business by their families , mr cort s said the police came across one case in which colombian traffickers were paying one family 650 a month for their daughter she managed to escape , he said but when she contacted her family , they told her to go back or they would send her sister as a replacement of the 1 , 605 women identified in 2010 as victims of traffickers , the biggest number about 30 percent came from the balkans many tell a story much like that of valentina , who hoped to earn enough money in spain to build a house and live in peace with her children so far , she said , she has earned a bit more than 2 , 000 but she has not been allowed to keep any of it they say i eat too much , she said they are angry if i buy something to drink in the meantime , her cellphone kept ringing , and the threats from her former boyfriend kept coming , she said the visibility of prostitution has become an issue here a battle has raged over whether to allow advertisements for prostitution in newspapers , but they remain legal and appear even in the most reputable papers after one barcelona newspaper ran a series last year on sex acts conducted in plain view near a main tourist attraction , the boulevard las ramblas , the city council said it would ban street prostitution and expand services for the women in la jonquera , mayor sonia mart nez juli says the town , population 3 , 000 , has few resources to help the women we feel completely abandoned with this problem , she said some politicians would like to see prostitution outlawed in spain , though that does not seem imminent many women s groups say that this would only force prostitution underground , making it even harder to help trafficked women for now , prostitution is legal , though not regulated , in spain but pimping is illegal , so most brothels like club paradise operate more like hotels it charges the women who work there about 90 a night for room and board jos moreno , one of the owners , said the women who worked there did so freely sometimes there is a problem with a boyfriend , mr moreno said recently , as scantily clad young women began to gather at one of the bars inside his club , readying for a night s work but that is usually cleared up quickly some weeks after the interview , however , mr moreno was convicted on charges relating to smuggling brazilian women into spain to work as prostitutes he was sentenced to three years in prison and is appealing the decision the authorities say the women can seek help , but many are reluctant on a recent evening , valentina , speaking a mix of spanish and romanian , said she was unsure where to turn she said she had already been to the local police , but had been told she had to go to the regional police in figueres , about 15 miles away a few days later , she stopped answering her cellphone and could not be found at her usual spot along the road inspector cort s said that she had indeed gone to the police in figueres but at the last minute , she refused to go to a shelter and left on her own
as television networks have covered internet companies positions against antipiracy legislation before congress this week , they have had to consider whether to disclose the positions of their parent companies virtually all of which have campaigned in favor of it such disclosures are always sensitive inside newsrooms , and especially so in this case , because conspiracy theories have taken root online about why journalists at tv networks like nbc , abc and cbs gave so little coverage to the proposed laws in december and in early january , when their parent companies had helped to convince lawmakers to support the legislation network executives privately attributed the dearth of coverage to the arcane , hardtoillustrate nature of the legislation , colloquially known as sopa , not to corporate interests all the networks were paying attention by wednesday , though , when wikipedia and a fleet of other web sites orchestrated an online protest against the legislation all three of the network morning news shows mentioned the protest , but during their initial reports none disclosed the point of view of their parent companies nbc s today show , however , did make a point of disclosing it during a conversation with marissa mayer , a google vice president after she explained google s opposition to the legislation , the coanchor matt lauer noted that comcast , the parent of nbc , is in favor of that legislation , saying it s imperative to protecting content copyrighted content and avoiding piracy he asked , so where is this going in your opinion \? we are very much worried about piracy , ms mayer answered that said , we think there are better , smarter , more targeted ways to address rogue foreign web sites than asking for broad censorship when asked if abc s good morning america or other programs would add a disclosure going forward , an abc news spokesman said , we will disclose disney s support for the bill we just added a line to an online story to that effect cbs news declined to comment an article on cbsnewscom on wednesday stated , cbs corporation , which owns cbsnewscom , is a member of the copyright alliance an industry group representing content producers that supports sopa and pipa cnn , which covered sopa earlier than other television news outlets , has been relatively diligent about disclosing that its parent , time warner , supports the legislation at the business news network cnbc , owned by comcast , wednesday s conversations about the issue on the morning programs squawk box and squawk on the street lacked disclosures , spurring the network s managing editor nick dunn to send a memo to producers as discussed numerous times we should disclose nbc s position in sopa pipa when doing story please make sure you do so , he wrote the disclosure was included on the network s afternoon program power lunch another network owned by comcast , msnbc , also lacked such disclosures until wednesday afternoon america s newsroom , a morning newscast on the fox news channel , did not mention the fact that its parent news corporation supports the legislation on wednesday , nor the fact that the company s chief executive , rupert murdoch , has been posting to twitter about the issue the liberal fox watchdog media matters asserted that fox reported the absurd spin from its parent company on sopa without noting their parent company s support for the bill other programs on fox have made clear where its parent stands shepard smith , the afternoon and evening anchor , said on tuesday during an explanation of sopa , important to note here , among the supporters is our boss , rupert murdoch , the chairman and ceo of the news corporation , which is the parent company of this network megyn kelly , another afternoon anchor , made a similar statement on wednesday time for a disclosure of our own the new york times company has not taken a corporate position on the proposed antipiracy legislation the editorial board of the new york times has stated that the house version of the bill is too broad and could stymie legitimate speech
mexico city he carried a briefcase in high school while his classmates were slinging backpacks he rose up from a lowlevel functionary to become a powerful governor through the same attention to strategy he applies while playing chess , s presidentelect , is as political an animal as they come , although he is an unknown quantity too , one with a smooth tongue and good looks even men compliment when his campaign was asked whom he considers his close friends , aides responded with a davos dinner partylike list of political power brokers and opinion makers whom he had met in the past year none said they knew him well , but all spoke favorably a few , indeed , he had met months before at the world economic forum in switzerland he was interested in how others won in campaigns in other countries , said martin sorrell , chief executive of wpp group , the world s largest advertising company , who was on the list and met in january for a wideranging chat arranged by intermediaries now those political skills will face a crucial test as he answers the big question in mexico whether he represents the old ways of the institutional revolutionary party , marked by cronyism , or a new , more humbled version of it , as he has reassured voters during the campaign at the same time , washington is waiting to hear more about mr pe a nieto s position on the drug war raging across mexico he has spoken of his desire to reduce the bloodshed that has characterized president felipe calder n s assault on traffickers , but he has also vowed to steer clear of the pacts with organized crime that were a part of the old era of the party , known as the pri the fight against crime will continue , he said sunday night as early results put him ahead of his two main rivals yes , with a new strategy to reduce violence and protect , above all , the lives of mexicans in the face of organized crime , there will be neither negotiation , nor truce the campaign has worked aggressively to rebut any impression he would go easy on drug cartels , quickly sending aides , for example , to meet with representative f james sensenbrenner jr , a wisconsin republican , after he told a house hearing last month that pri had turned a blind eye to the issue in the past for all his careful plotting , mr pe a nieto had his share of slips , often when he veered from a script , and he focuses more on the delivery than on the message he is not one to deeply study issues and , in a campaign gaffe last year at a book fair , could not name three books that influenced him \( and still could not in an six months later \) he is not a policy wonk , said javier trevi o , a party stalwart who managed his campaign in nuevo le n state but he relishes political tactics and is a passionate chess player who once delayed a strategy meeting to complete a match years ago , when he was an unknown state official , mr pe a nieto showed that no detail was too small for him in his climb up the political ladder , not even the notsominor matter of delivering escamoles , a dish of ant eggs considered a delicacy , 4 , 600 miles to the president of argentina a delegation from mexico state had decided to surprise president carlos menem with the dish , and it fell on mr pe a nieto , who was back in mexico , to get it down there , and quickly , no matter the customs hurdles how he did it , i do n't know , recalled c sar camacho , who was governor at the time but they were on time washington insiders whom mr pe a nieto met with during visits to the united states in recent months said he pumped them for details of the american presidential race , though he was careful not to betray a preference he has not met president obama , who called to congratulate him on monday , but is said to have admired his 2008 campaign the pri s own campaign tactics remain a source of ire , with allegations of fraud and spending violations young people demonstrated monday and the runnerup , andr s manuel l pez obrador , said he would not concede and would challenge the results with 99 percent of votes counted , mr pe a nieto stood at 38 percent to mr l pez obrador s 32 percent , while josefina v zquez mota , the incumbent party s candidate , had 25 percent mr pe a nieto defends the pri , which was unceremoniously dumped by voters in 2000 , in the first real democratic elections here , ending 71 years of rule that had given the country political stability and lasting social programs but had enriched party cronies and stifled political dissent the party so permeated government ranks and institutions , historians have written , that its control often extended to crime bosses although he presents a youthful face , he has not shaken off the impression that he is a proxy for the old guard carlos salinas de gortari , an unpopular former president , is said to be a backer and he learned politics at the knee of some of the party s most ardent stalwarts in mexico state he has drawn both sides of the pri , said andrew selee , director of the woodrow wilson center s mexico institute he grew up in toluca and was raised by the mother pri of old , but to his credit he has reached out to the new generation mr pe a nieto has visited the united states in the past year to give speeches and reassure lawmakers that he will make a faithful partner in a new pri unlike many recent mexican presidents , mr pe a nieto , who has a law degree from universidad panamericana and an mba from the monterrey technological institute , did not study at an american university but he was among a group of several mexican boys who attended a year of junior high school in 1979 to learn english at denis hall school , in alfred , me once he learned english , he became an honors student , said brother charles thomas , the archivist for the catholic school , now closed enrique , like his mexican friends , was fluent by christmas he played for the school soccer team and was well liked by both the american students as well as the mexicans mr pe a nieto still speaks some english , but generally sticks to spanish more recently , he has made frequent trips to a luxury apartment in miami , which the newspaper reforma has said is owned by his wife , ang lica rivera , a soap opera star on the country s biggest tv network , televisa while he was governor of mexico state , his marriage to ms rivera in november 2010 was like a royal wedding his first wife , m nica pretelini s enz , died in 2007 after a seizure he has four children , including one from outside his marriages mr pe a nieto , who turns 46 this month , was born in atlacomulco , a small city about 55 miles northwest of mexico city he was the eldest of four siblings in a middleclass family his father , gilberto enrique pe a del mazo , was an engineer for the electric company and his mother , mar a del socorro nieto , a schoolteacher people who knew him in his early years said he was fastidious in his dress and appearance and told teachers he planned to be governor of mexico state his group made a little fun of him for his naked political ambitions , said jaime del arenal , one of his undergraduate professors that look he has today is the same look he had when he entered his studies mr pe a nieto has said he caught the political bug in elementary school , when he was picked to be a class leader but he also has the lineage he is related to four former state governors , including his predecessor as governor , arturo montiel rojas , a cousin who gave him his political break he ran for governor in 2005 , selected by mr montiel , mexican journalists have written he surged past rivals with the help of friendly coverage by televisa as governor and later as a presidential candidate , he bought millions of dollars in advertisements on the network his opponents accused it of biased coverage in the presidential race , which executives have denied not much is known of mr pe a nieto s interests off the political stage , or even if he has many ignacio rodr guez reyna , a mexican journalist who wrote a profile of him for a book on the campaign , said that in quiet times the leader enjoys listening to abba and celine dion \( a frequent campaign song was a version of the disco hit gloria \) in the last month , he identified the departed and j edgar , the j edgar hoover biopic , as recent favorite movies as for other pastimes , he said right now , campaigning i do n't have another
athens as thousands of greeks walked off the job in a general strike on tuesday to protest stringent new austerity measures , there was a growing sense that the country was reaching a critical point in its efforts to survive the debt crisis greek political leaders postponed for yet another day a decision on an austerity package including 20percent cuts to base pay for workers in private companies and a loosening of public sector job protections in exchange for the billions in loans athens needs to prevent a default in march with elections looming as soon as april , the parties fear that they are essentially being told to commit political suicide to save the country if that indeed is the case , analysts here say , it is not clear what will replace them , making a potential laboratory for a volatile mix of austerity , populism and social unrest not that the old order , widely derided as corrupt and inefficient , is likely to be deeply mourned for most greek voters , the two larger parties participating in the fragile tripartite coalition of prime minister lucas papademos the socialist party and the centerright new democracy were already drained of political capital before the debt crisis by decades of selfinterest and corruption that has now been capped by two years of unrelenting austerity that has hurt most greeks but has ultimately failed to revive the system , or even change it in any significant way george kirtsos , a political analyst and the owner of city press , an athens weekly , agreed that the old order is collapsing but the problem , he added , is there are no new political parties that can express a new dynamic era with athens shut out of the private lending markets , greece s socalled troika of official creditors the european commission , european central bank and international monetary fund have repeatedly criticized the government for failing to make structural changes in its economy but their plan of tax increases , spending cuts and now wage cuts has not only helped push the country into a deep recession , but has also stripped greece s political center , weak to begin with , of its last shreds of political legitimacy with unemployment at 19 percent , businesses closing , credit scarce and the proposed new wage cuts expected to further decimate the shrinking middle class , the hard left and extreme right are rising the issue that brought the looming political crisis to a head this week is the thorniest one yet changes to the greek labor market with greek popular anger at the country s foreign lenders rising a german flag was burned in front of parliament at a demonstration on tuesday the socialists and new democracy are treading a fine line they want to push back against the troika enough to regain some political capital and keep more greeks from falling into poverty but not push hard enough to precipitate a default if the greek political leaders do not agree to accept the new austerity measures in the coming days , greece will run out of time to complete a broader deal for the voluntary writedown of greek debt before a bond comes due on march 20 if greece cannot pay the bond , it will default , which could result in its leaving the euro zone , among other ill effects after years of turning its back on its social welfare platform , the socialist party , known as pasok and greece s dominant political force since 1974 , has virtually disintegrated , falling to fifth place with 8 percent support , according to a poll that the firm public issue released on tuesday amid deep internal divisions , finance minister evangelos venizelos is expected to replace george a papandreou as party leader the poll , which questioned about 1 , 000 adults , found that the democratic left party , a moderate leftwing party , garnered 18 percent support , more support than the socialists had the radical left syriza party is holding steady and the greek communist party , which never split from moscow during the cold war , is also holding its ground both have about 12 percent support so is the extreme right thousands turned out in central athens last month for a rally by ultranationalists known for their violence against immigrants one extreme right group , golden dawn , is hovering at the 3 percent threshold required to form a parliamentary party , the poll found with the socialist party struggling for survival , mr papandreou this week asked that mr papademos s mandate be extended until 2013 , when the next national elections are scheduled , rather than this spring , when he completes his given term of negotiating a new loan agreement for greece george karatzaferis , the leader of the hardright popular orthodox rally , or laos a former opposition party that lost popularity recently by joining the government this week suggested that mr papademos appoint a cabinet of technocrats , not politicians , as prime minister mario monti did in italy the most probable winner of future greek elections would be new democracy , which held power from 2004 until 2009 , when greece s debt soared from slightly more than 100 percent of its gross domestic product to at least 127 percent its leader , antonis samaras , has been criticized repeatedly by european leaders as irresponsible , but with every new tax increase in greece , some voters are warming to his constant critique of austerity in the absence of growth measures the party is leading in opinion polls , with public issue putting its support at 31 percent of the vote to many , mr samaras is the new face of european populism he creates the impression that there are easy solutions to the greek crisis , said mr kirtsos , referring to a proposal by mr samaras to avoid layoffs by paying people a percentage of their salary not to work he can criticize the germans and create the impression that he can create easy solutions by paying you to stay at home new democracy , whose power base is among small merchants and professional guilds that have been highly resistant to liberalization , would most likely not be able to form a government on its own , and might have to form a coalition with hardright laos it would be a centerright government with a leftwing social majority , mr kirtsos said that is a recipe for disaster most greeks say they have lost what little faith they had in the

by the time midmarch rolled around in 2008 , all of hillary rodham clinton s democratic rivals for the white house except one , barack obama , had dropped out of the race a oneonone competition with mitt romney is what rick santorum would like to see now but instead , he is locked in a fourway battle in which none of the republican presidential candidates shows any sign of departing in the washington caucuses on saturday , mitt romney won 37 percent of the vote , an amount that was easily outpaced by the other three candidates put together it is possible that mr santorum might have won a headtohead matchup with mr romney in washington , giving him another victory and a shot at more delegates but it is unlikely that mr santorum will get that chance as the campaign moves ahead candidates who run out of money usually drop out quickly , clearing the path to a binary choice but the millions of dollars being funneled into super pacs supporting newt gingrich as well as mr santorum are keeping them in the race in addition , ron paul s fervent supporters continue to pump money into his movement mr paul has repeatedly pledged to stay in the race until the national convention in august normally , you beat a candidate , he loses momentum , he loses the ability to raise money , and the candidate dies , said stuart stevens , a chief strategist for mr romney we show up in these races , and we try to win that s all you can do here is a look at how the fourway republican race may continue for weeks to come super tuesday the 10 contests on tuesday have a little bit for everyone mr gingrich is counting on winning in georgia , his home state and the one he represented for years in congress a victory there , combined with millions of dollars still flowing into his super pac , would encourage him to stay in the race through march this is going to go on for a good while , mr gingrich said sunday morning on this week on abc mr romney s aides are focusing on massachusetts \( where he served as governor \) , ohio , vermont and virginia mr santorum is fighting for ohio and has said he will do well in oklahoma and tennessee mr paul is on the ballot in virginia and is hoping to do well in three caucuses the rest of march the three weeks after super tuesday could be mr paul s time there are more caucuses than primaries the kinds of contests in which he often does well because his passionate supporters turn out in big numbers victories in some of those small caucuses will most likely encourage his supporters to continue donating money alabama and mississippi will also vote in march , perhaps providing a boost to mr gingrich \( and more reasons for him to stay in the race \) he vowed to win those two southern states , which vote a week from tuesday mr santorum and mr romney are both likely to run a hard race in illinois , which holds its primary on march 20 the fact that there are few primaries in other large states the rest of the month could allow both men to recharge their campaign treasuries for april and beyond april and may more than a dozen primaries in big states in april and may will provide the first real test of the candidates financial staying power maryland , new york and pennsylvania have some of the most expensive media markets in the country a challenge for candidates who do not have a lot of money but if they have the money to compete , there are prizes for everyone pennsylvania is mr santorum s home state , and he should do well there mr gingrich has already said he is focused on southern states , and arkansas , kentucky and west virginia vote in april and may mr romney s wellorganized campaign is designed to keep him competitive across the nation texas , mr paul s home state , may move its primary to may \( or even june \) because of wrangling over redistricting delegates may still be awarded proportionally , giving just about everyone a chance to win some of them june the race may not get this far but if it does , the biggest prize is california that is enticing for all four campaigns \( they can win delegates in congressional districts \) but also daunting \( it is the most expensive state to advertise in \) utah also votes in june it is the final primary and should be a lock for mr romney , given its large mormon population
lindstrom , minn ki gulbranson owns a logo apparel shop , deals in jewelry on the side and referees youth soccer games he makes about 39 , 000 a year and wants you to know that he does not need any help from the federal government he says that too many americans lean on taxpayers rather than living within their means he supports politicians who promise to cut government spending in 2010 , he printed tshirts for the tea party campaign of a neighbor , chip cravaack , who ousted this region s longserving democratic congressman yet this year , as in each of the past three years , mr gulbranson , 57 , is counting on a payment of several thousand dollars from the federal government , a subsidy for working families called the earnedincome tax credit he has signed up his three schoolage children to eat free breakfast and lunch at federal expense and medicare paid for his mother , 88 , to have hip surgery twice there is little poverty here in chisago county , northeast of minneapolis , where cheap housing for commuters is gradually replacing farmland but mr gulbranson and many other residents who describe themselves as selfsufficient members of the american middle class and as opponents of government largess are drawing more deeply on that government with each passing year dozens of benefits programs provided an average of 6 , 583 for each man , woman and child in the county in 2009 , a 69 percent increase from 2000 after adjusting for inflation in chisago , and across the nation , the government now provides almost 1 in benefits for every 4 in other income older people get most of the benefits , primarily through social security and medicare , but aid for the rest of the population has increased about as quickly through programs for the disabled , the unemployed , veterans and children the government safety net was created to keep americans from abject poverty , but the poorest households no longer receive a majority of government benefits a secondary mission has gradually become primary maintaining the middle class from childhood through retirement the share of benefits flowing to the least affluent households , the bottom fifth , has declined from 54 percent in 1979 to 36 percent in 2007 , according to a congressional budget office analysis published last year and as more middleclass families like the gulbransons land in the safety net in chisago and similar communities , anger at the government has increased alongside many people say they are angry because the government is wasting money and giving money to people who do not deserve it but more than that , they say they want to reduce the role of government in their own lives they are frustrated that they need help , feel guilty for taking it and resent the government for providing it they say they want less help for themselves less help in caring for relatives less assistance when they reach old age the expansion of government benefits has become an issue in the presidential campaign rick santorum , who won 57 percent of the vote in chisago county in the republican presidential caucuses last week , has warned of the narcotic of government dependency newt gingrich has compared the safety net to a spider web mitt romney has said the nation must choose between an entitlement society and an opportunity society all the candidates , including ron paul , have promised to cut spending and further reduce taxes the problem by now is familiar to most politicians have expanded the safety net without a commensurate increase in revenues , a primary reason for the government s annual deficits and mushrooming debt in 2000 , federal and state governments spent about 37 cents on the safety net from every dollar they collected in revenue , according to a new york times analysis a decade later , after one medicare expansion , two recessions and three rounds of tax cuts , spending on the safety net consumed nearly 66 cents of every dollar of revenue the recent recession increased dependence on government , and stronger economic growth would reduce demand for programs like unemployment benefits but the longterm trend is clear over the next 25 years , as the population ages and medical costs climb , the budget office projects that benefits programs will grow faster than any other part of government , driving the federal debt to dangerous heights americans are divided about the way forward seventy percent of respondents to a recent new york times poll said the government should raise taxes fiftysix percent supported cuts in medicare and social security fortyfour percent favored both
chicago so much for shuffleboard , bridge and pingpong on a frigid , echoing ice rink here , a sport more frequently learned in childhood is being taken up by a group that long ago had its last gym class those in their middle years , a demographic that once tended to adopt gentler pastimes for quieter years ahead for at least some , this is what their first day of hockey 101 looks like skate , teeter , fall down , slide like a lump across the ice repeat and that is all before pucks are brought out everybody s got the fever , ken rzepecki , known here as coach ken , said not long ago as some 30 novices , including two women , stepped \( wobbled , in some cases \) onto the ice at a private indoor facility near downtown chicago a beginners' adult hockey class has grown so popular among bankers , traders , engineers , you name it , that an extra class had to be created a few weeks ago even so , a waiting list stretches on and on if hockey was once a purview of young boys on distant minnesota lakes , it is now thriving among untested adults here , where mr rzepecki , of johnny s icehouse , has seen new students in their mid50s and where 110 adult teams hold so many games that some must schedule theirs to play past midnight in part , some of these players say , times have just changed when it comes to age and sports if 40 is the new 20 , one novice here offered , why should n't ice hockey be the new golf \? they all have the heart to learn this game , mr rzepecki said , surveying his students , stuffed into the ample padding of their new sport , with new sticks \( some of which were way too long \) and new skates \( some of which were too big \) are they good yet \? asked the coach , who once played professionally , pausing politely all i can say is hockey looks easier than it is watch the stopping you 'll get a kick out of that this is not a cheap sport to dabble in the mound of gear required costs several hundred dollars , at least , mr rzepecki said not to mention that hockey is hard , really hard it did not hurt that hockey took a new , starring spot in this city s love affair with sports when the chicago blackhawks \( who practice at a johnny s icehouse \) won the stanley cup in 2010 after a nearly halfcentury wait sending even nonskaters to mr rzepecki in droves none of which is to say that any trophies are likely to be won in this weekly class soon , beyond aching backs , bruised hips and what mike mccaskey , 33 , described breathlessly on day 1 as his throbbing feet i ca n't let my kid down , said frank muscarello , the chief executive of a technology company , explaining why he was taking up hockey at age 40 his son , 6 , already plays and well , he said with hopes for a fatherson hockey camp ahead , he said he felt he needed to improve a lot , and fast what might his son think of his stick handling and skating so far \? he would laugh at me , mr muscarello said while some skaters appeared to be at ease \( and some of them confessed to being on their second goround with hockey 101 \) , others stood utterly still , unable to budge , when ordered to skate backwards while checking is banished from these classes , some students seemed to find that the only way to stop themselves was to crash , with a checklike thump , into the side of the rink and at least one student seemed to clutch his stick more like a support tool than something that might one day guide a puck but there was hope , mr rzepecki said , not to mention the possibility , in a few months , of graduation and hockey 102
the biographies of george balanchine tell us of his several wives , of his other loves , and of his devotion to the female dancer his ballets , though , make his feeling for women yet more complicated even in moments of amorous surrender one part of his women stays unreachable and one part of his men always craves , in female terms , what they cannot have on saturday afternoon , to heartening effect , four balanchine ballets joined new york city ballet s repertory , only one of which firebird had been seen earlier this year all four were to stravinsky scherzo is a frolic danced by 18 girls from the school of american ballet to brassdominated music recalling the merrymaking in stravinsky s petrouchka but there s enough structural and rhythmic complexity look here ! look there ! to make its allfemale , allyouthful fun constantly beguiling each of the four fast , elegant trios of danses is a puredance comedy for one man and two women , in which the man seems to say , in the words of the beggar s opera , how happy could i be with either , were t'other dear charmer away each woman is so lively and so demanding that he has to chase to keep up with their partnering demands in firebird \( 1949 \) the hero dances with two quite different women the mighty firebird and the bride whom he frees from a wizard s power but it s possible to feel that these heroines are like opposite halves of the same being of the many balanchine ballets probably the most admired was his complete version of stravinsky s oneact story ballet le baiser de la f e \( the fairy s kiss \) , danced between 1937 and the 1950s in that the hero was repeatedly and tragically sundered from the woman he loved by the fairy who was both his muse and his fate its pathos was underscored by an implication that the woman he loved was remote and unattainable when balanchine took stravinsky s divertimento from this ballet and choreographed it anew in 1972 , he removed both fairy and kiss , baiser and f e but the unnerving element is the now gradual and now sudden revelations of tragic fate as a psychologically internal force as the curtain falls on this divertimento from le baiser de la f e the most extraordinary of this program s four ballets hero and heroine are in separate zones of the stage , each walking backward along a different path , each looking up with arms open in a gesture that may include helpless despair and question it s a shattering image the baiser de la f e score is stravinsky s arrangement of multiple items by tchaikovsky the music for this final scene is his sublime treatment of tchaikovsky s tenderly anguished song none but the lonely heart what s fascinating is the chain of successive moments that stealthily lets us know that this divertimento which begins with an allfemale dance more amazingly intricate than scherzo la russe is not plotless but tragic some of them are achieved through solely musical terms the hero has an astonishing solo , full of selfcontradictions and helpless impulsiveness , in which his first circuit of turning jumps around the stage would seem just a puredance effect , were it not for the way the music s harmonies keep building powerfully and beautifully in tension he seems both heedless of them and driven by them and , as you listen , the spectacle of him in this series of turning pounces feels like a man dancing on a precipice the two leading roles are perhaps the best that joaquin de luz and megan fairchild dance the fullness and brio of her lower body is very fine , and the artlessness of her manner is just right too bad that her face and eyes carry nothing of the warmth and bleakness that made patricia mcbride , the role s originator , so haunting here likewise mr de luz s unaffected elegance and rapturous intensity are excellent up to a point in a role created for helgi tomasson ms mcbride and mr tomasson were like this but oh ! how much more so more onthebrink in timing , more full in texture , more beatingheart in passion in the case of firebird i never saw maria tallchief s celebrated performance of the title role except in filmed excerpts while i say that teresa reichlen is the best i 've seen since this version of the production was revived after balanchine s death in the 1980s , i do have some idea of the fierce blaze and attack she s missing but the tremendous scale of ms reichlen s line and jumps does much to make the drama arresting and , more clearly than anyone i have seen in performance , she paces the pas de deux with prince ivan as a negotiation jonathan stafford , who has often been content to perform as an amiable blank , shows , as ivan , that he can characterize with glee and charm more evidence of these virtues would be welcome amid this largely toodiscreet generation \( while speaking of performers i must apologize for speaking last week of the male dancers in thursday s world premiere of bal de couture as if ask la cour were one of its many principal dancers he , like chase finlay , is a soloist \) as the lead man of the danses concertantes , gonzalo garcia has sweetness but no wit sterling hyltin , as his ballerina , certainly has humor her lightness , delicacy and zest are all enchanting to a certain degree the meeting of dancers and choreography on saturday afternoon was happy yet these are gifted , appealing dancers who have yet to cut loose with all the incisiveness and sweep that could make them stars

austin , tex all the ingredients were there to make the inaugural united states grand prix in austin one of the most highly attended , most festive and most exciting races of the 2012 season the series had been absent from the united states for five years after struggling to find its place in america despite more than half a century of effort that it made its return was in no small way helped by the race s taking place at the first purposebuilt circuit in the united states it also probably did not hurt to reintroduce formula one to americans in austin , a city whose motto is keep austin weird a capacity crowd of 117 , 429 watched a wild and suspenseful battle between the remaining contenders for the drivers' title , sebastian vettel of red bull and ferrari s fernando alonso , on a track and at a site that delivered all of its promise and more and thanks to a circuit that permits overtaking , the series heads to brazil for the final race next weekend with the drivers' title still up for grabs vettel , who leads alonso in the standings , 273260 , and started sunday s race from the pole , led the first 42 laps of the 56lap race but he was passed by lewis hamilton in a mclaren mercedes with 14 laps left , and hamilton hung on for the win alonso , meanwhile , did everything he could to remain in contention , starting from seventh on the grid and finishing third hamilton , who has now won 21 races , also won the last united states grand prix , at indianapolis in 2007 this is one of the best , if not the best , grand prix we have had all year , hamilton said it was the first grand prix here , and i won the last one here as well , so i am massively proud vettel , who pointed out his own ties to formula one racing in the united states , including his 100th circuit race sunday and his formula one debut at the grand prix in indianapolis in 2007 , said the austin race was incredible it was a close battle with lewis he had one chance , and he took it , he added this was also a victory for austin , which went to great lengths to ensure success after the series failed to take hold at the indianapolis motor speedway from 2000 to 2007 a threeday formula one fan festival that included music , activities for children and other entertainment opened the event to more than racing fans , something few other series' sites have accomplished good weather , including 73 degrees and sunny skies for race day , certainly helped there were also almost none of the anticipated traffic concerns either , as almost 500 shuttle buses took spectators the seven miles from downtown austin to the track in elroy of course , not all austin residents were pleased one put a banner on the roof of his home in 6 and 12foot letters reading , howdy ! f1 , a reference , and complaint , to the smaller percentage of fans who opted for the more expensive helicopter rides to the circuit but formula one team directors cautioned that the grand prix based in austin and the series' latest attempt at success in the united states cannot be judged solely on this race the first year you come to a race at a facility like this , it s great to see what fantastic support it s had but it s about maintaining that support , said ross brawn , the director of the mercedes team there are things that we do during the season to monitor exposure and reaction , and we will be looking at all the factors that help us judge how much of an impression this race is making from the sporting point of view , austin delivered in a way that indianapolis failed , by providing a track built for formula one cars the result was a spectacular race of passing and competition , more akin to nascar than to the processional formula one racing of the past that could never seduce american fans the circuit of the americas , as it is named , left very little to chance performing the interviews with the drivers on the podium after the race was mario andretti , one of only two americans to win the formula one drivers' title we just witnessed an awesome , awesome race right to the end , said andretti , who won the title in 1978 to join phil hill , the 1961 champion
annandaleonhudson , ny the road to a job as a museum art curator used to be winding and haphazard now there are degreegranting programs like bard college s center for curatorial studies and art in contemporary culture , which has been processing aspiring organizers of worldchanging exhibitions for 20 years as of this summer along with other anniversary events the center is presenting a pair of exhibitions in the spacious galleries of bard s hessel museum viewed as independent shows , antiestablishment and from 199a to 199b liam gillick are remarkably enervating considering them in light of the occasion , however and that one was organized by the center s executive director , tom eccles , the other by its graduate program director , johanna burton the shows are fascinating to think about together what do these exhibitions tell us about the education of curators today \? in her brief introductory essay ms burton characterizes the model of the artist implied by antiestablishment , which she organized seemingly contrary to that title , the 13 individuals and collectives she picked are not uncompromising rebels they do little to unsettle wellestablished norms of contemporary art making but , according to ms burton , they imagine novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship some of the work is overtly political sculptures by wynne greenwood consist of pink , portable televisions equipped with strapon harnesses mainstream and queer cultures collide a duo called hens present a weakly humorous installation revolving around a pair of adultsize baby bouncer seats that you can sit in , positioned in front of a television playing a sockpuppet show the long title of this piece is worth quoting for what it says about the ennui of the citizen artist steeped in stale theory alternative pedagogy and new left daycare ii , consisting of hens worldhistorical socktragic puppet drama , marxist baby buggy bouncers , pragmatic piscenepedicure program showing the subject s passage from vulgar individualism to agonic pluralism much of the work is more selfreflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs scott lyall s opalescent , minimalist canvases , digitally covered by thousands of tiny bits of color , invite thought about painting in an age of mechanical reproduction , an installation of videos of young men dancing by brennan gerard and ryan kelly , is a response to kiss , a performance work by tino sehgal that was part of at the guggenheim museum in 2010 pam lins makes prickly , abstract sculptures out of plaster , string and other materials , which she displays on sleek pedestals a wall label notes that ms lins was thinking about a particular photo of henry moore in his studio and the parts of sculptures that are usually hidden , or better , covered up there is an exhilarating exception to the prevailing conceptualism an installation in its own gallery of abstract expressioniststyle paintings made with vibrant dayglo paints and displayed under ultraviolet light , by jacqueline humphries with their nearly hallucinatory , artificially enhanced luminosity and quicksilver shapes the paintings suggest a sudden irruption of transcendental energies into imaginative consciousness none of the artists in antiestablishment exemplify ms burton s characterization of the engaged citizen artist more completely than one who is not in her show liam gillick , the subject of mr eccles s exhibition routinely associated with the muchdebated movement , mr gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist , speaker , writer and collaborator with other international luminaries like rirkrit tiravanija and he designs shiny , quasiarchitectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries , but here the focus is on projects from the 1990s , driven more by verbal than visual thinking if you like the idea of reading news articles , letters , documents and other sorts of informational material as an art experience , this show is for you sprinkled throughout from 199a to 199b are fabriccovered panels onto which invitees all alumni of the bard center program have pinned material from magazines and other sources that caught their eyes and minds one large gallery has pushpin panels covering the lower parts of the walls all the way around tacked to them are pages from tattoo magazine and an operational manual for a large airplane a lot of uncovered pinup surface remains , so you can only imagine the flood of information that could be in store for another project mr gillick proposed that copies of all the be displayed in a gallery and made available to anyone interested here , as a compromise , they are accessible on computers via the internet one room is reserved for a project called moral maze that has yet to happen mr gillick will invite people who have been peripherally involved in activities of politically and ethically fraught import minor players in the illegal drug trade , for example for public discussions in the gallery mr gillick represents a model of the artist that is especially popular now in academic circles the activist social critic who tries to intervene in mainstream currents of contemporary complacency and awaken politically critical consciousness by any means it is easy to see the appeal of that model for today s ambitious curator , who , in turn , replaces the old model of the curator as a connoisseur of visual aesthetics the new , professional curator is a globetrotting intellectual sophisticate , attuned like mr gillick to an everexpanding field of ideas rooted in marxist gospel under the new curatorial regime art becomes an educational and participatory experience often tied to newsworthy events of the day artists whose primary concerns are social and ideological will appreciate this sort of curator those invested in aesthetically and metaphorically resonant objects of uncertain practical utility might feel excluded and misunderstood but in a few years or decades the paradigm will change , as tenured faculty retire new tread will be put on old rhetoric the marginalized will be returned to the center and the favored cast out that is just the way it goes
in a 1993 article in the times , maurice sendak , who died tuesday morning at the age of 83 , told sarah lyall grownups desperately need to feel safe , and then they project onto the kids but what none of us seem to realize is how smart kids are they don t like what we write for them , what we dish up for them , because it s vapid , so they ll go for the hard words , they ll go for the hard concepts , they ll go for the stuff where they can learn something , not didactic things , but passionate things mr sendak had a fellow traveler in his legendary editor at harper row , ursula nordstrom , who also bristled at the overprotection of children the collection of her letters , dear genius , is a treat , and includes correspondence between her and mr sendak \( he drew the illustration of her for the book s cover \) you may not be tolstoy , ms nordstrom once wrote to mr sendak after he expressed selfdoubt , but tolstoy wasn t sendak , either you have a vast and beautiful genius though he didn t publish much in recent years , mr sendak did appear in the media several times , always voicing his strong opinions about various topics last september , he spoke to the times s pamela paul about his book bumbleardy , and commented on several famous works for children , including his own where the wild things are \( children who fight back , children who are full of excitement are the kind of children i like \) and alice in wonderland it s a terrifying book it s a nightmare that to me comes as close to the world of childhood as great books do carroll was allowing for nightmare , murderous impulses i don t know why he got away from it he told the truth about childhood , about how unsafe it was in 2004 , mr sendak gave a searching interview to bill moyers , in which he discussed his family s history , the impact of the lindbergh baby kidnapping on his childhood and how his most famous book was supposed to be where the wild horses are i never set out to write books for children , he told mr moyers i don t have a feeling that i m going to save children , or my life is devoted to them i m not hans christian andersen no one s going to make a statue in the park with a lot of scrambling kids climbing up i won t have it in a muchdiscussed profile for the guardian last october , emma brockes recorded several gems from mr sendak , including this minirant about ebooks i hate them it s like making believe there s another kind of sex there isn t another kind of sex there isn t another kind of book ! a book is a book is a book but most memorable was mr sendak s hilarious twopart interview with stephen colbert , in which the illustrator talked about how he didn t write for children gave mr colbert permission to publish a wild things sequel starring vin diesel and sniffed markers telling mr sendak he wanted to get into the children s book business , mr colbert asked , what s it take for a celebrity to make a successful book \? mr sendak responded you ve started already by being an idiot in a remarkable coincidence , the children s book mr colbert described to mr sendak , i am a pole \( and so can you ! \) , was published on tuesday \( complete with mr sendak s blurb the sad thing is , i like it on tuesday , mr colbert said , maurice sendak was strikingly honest his art gave us a fantastical but unromanticized reminder of what childhood truly felt like we are all honored to have been briefly invited into his world part 1 of their interview is here part 2 is below mr sendak s publisher , harpercollins , issued the following statement we are terribly saddened at the passing of maurice sendak he was a glorious author and illustrator , an amazingly gifted designer , a blisteringly funny raconteur , a fierce and opinionated wit , and a loyal friend to those who knew him his talent is legendary his mind and breadth of knowledge equally so we at harpercollins are honored to have worked with him and published his books since 1951 we will miss him for his contributions to the world of publishing but even more for his many , many contributions to our lives every once in a while , someone comes along who changes our world for the better maurice sendak was such a man tributes from colleagues and fans of the children s book author and illustrator
protecting a 2423 lead in the final minutes of the 1973 sugar bowl against alabama , underdog  from the broadcast booth , howard cosell , in the overtly theatric tone he summoned for moments like these , bellowed into his microphone this is the dream matchup notre damealabama at notre dame , football is a religion at alabama , it is a way of life thirtynine years ago , there was a college football national championship game arranged not by computer rankings or a rubric of poll results like this season s alabamanotre dame matchup for the title , but by the kind of primitive challenge heard in a sandlot in 1973 , bear bryant , coach of undefeated alabama , sent a wily message from the traditionrich football fields of the deep south to a single footballcentric university in northern indiana bryant was taking his no 1ranked squad to the sugar bowl in new orleans , and his stated opponent of choice was a team that alabama had never played notre dame the undefeated , untied fighting irish , who entered the 1973 bowl season ranked third , had been tempted by a more lucrative offer from the orange bowl but a dare was a dare , especially one with the national championship on the line notre dame coach ara parseghian committed his team to the sugar bowl matchup , a contest immediately billed as the game of the century it was the north against the south , bear bryant against ara parseghian , the baptists against the catholics , parseghian said last week from his home in florida it had all these compelling comparisons and it was played on new year s eve , not new year s day , so we had the national stage to ourselves bryant called it the biggest game in the south s history parseghian said a host of coaches from north of the masondixon line , and across the country , called to offer encouragement none of them had gone down there and beat bear , parseghian said , laughing months earlier , when the season had begun , there had been little focus on notre dame or alabama neither was in the top five of the preseason rankings parseghian , in his 10th year at notre dame , was fortunate to have the junior quarterback tom clements a threeyear bridge between joe theismann and joe montana to lead a runoriented offense bryant hardly talked up his team , which featured one of the university s first africanamerican players running back wilbur jackson , in his third year with the crimson tide shows the coach in a houndstooth sports coat being interviewed by three boy scouts in the summer before the season one scout asks if alabama will be no 1 that season i doubt it , son , bryant said we 're inexperienced by thrashing a promising california team , 660 , and quickly climbed to no 4 in the rankings , which were split then between a coaches poll administered by united press international and a poll of writers overseen by the associated press in late october , when it beat southern california , the defending national champion , which had begun the season as the topranked team by season s end , there were three major unbeaten , untied teams at the top of the ap rankings no 1 alabama , no 3 notre dame and no 6 penn state , which was headed to the orange bowl no 2 oklahoma , with its new coach barry switzer , was unbeaten with one tie but was on ncaa probation and ineligible for the bowls rose bowlbound ohio state had dropped to no 4 when it was tied by michigan the upi poll in those days took its final vote before the bowl games it awarded alabama the national championship and placed notre dame fourth we received national championship rings , and that was nice , the allamerican receiver wayne wheeler said wednesday from his florida home but we knew the sugar bowl was the national championship and 1973 was the last time the final upi poll was announced before the bowl games notre dame arrived on new year s eve at creaky , old tulane stadium in a driving rain amid tornado warnings it was cold and rainy , and the synthetic playing surface was worn and slippery , parseghian said the field also had a big crown i recall our punter practicing in the end zone , and he called me over to show me how the crown was so high he was kicking uphill when he stood at the back of the end zone i remember thinking that if we 're stuck in this spot , we 're not going to get much more than a 30yard punt alabama had come into the game averaging 413 points through 11 games but in the first quarter , the crimson tide were scoreless alabama receiver said he thought the team was nervous pugh , one of a handful of africanamericans on the team , had good reason to be on edge he had received death threats warning him not to play we were still in the middle of the civil rights movement , pugh , now a coach at georgia state , said wednesday the threats came in a letter , and the university added security so i think we were a little uptight at first but eventually , we came roaring back alabama matched notre dame s early touchdown drive \( the irish pointafter was botched \) , but the irish s al hunter returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for another score going for a 2point conversion after the hunter return , clements called power i right , tackle trap , pass left , a parseghian favorite that faked a run to the right from a bunched , two tightend formation but instead became a pass to the left split end pete demmerle , a future allamerican , caught the pass , and notre dame had a 147 lead bill davis s 39yard field goal cut the fighting irish lead to 1410 , and in the third quarter , the teams again traded touchdowns in a game with six lead changes , alabama finally found its freewheeling offensive equilibrium early in the fourth quarter an apparent wishbone sweep to the right was actually a setup for a throwback pass to alabama s backup quarterback , richard todd , caught the ball near the left sideline and ran untouched for a 25yard touchdown and a 2321 alabama lead tricked us , parseghian said last week , still sounding a bit irked good call by coach bryant davis lined up for the extra point having converted 51 of his previous 52 attempts davis hailed from a family of kickers three of his brothers played on alabama national championship teams , and his father , woodrow allen davis , whose nickname was pig , was the first player recruited to play at alabama by bryant davis missed the extra point alabama s lead was 2 points with 9 minutes 33 seconds to play i do not know why i missed that kick , davis , who has spent the last 35 years as a dentist in athens , ala , said last week i 've thought about it for years and years , but i have no reason it was the last kick of davis s career he went to the sideline no one said anything to him or reacted in any way no coach or teammate mentioned it , nor have they ever mentioned it since , davis said he has not watched a tape of his missed kick , and when asked if it sailed to the left or right of the goal posts , davis paused and said , you know , i do not remember wheeler , the alabama end , said , most of us thought we had the game won anyway clements , who went on to have a long , , led the irish back , running three times for 25 yards and throwing a 30yard pass to dave casper , a future college and professional football hall of famer the drive , however , stalled when the alabama defense made a goalline stand with a little more than four minutes left , notre dame s bob thomas lined up for a 19yard field goal in the week before the game , the shoe company puma cut a deal with notre dame to outfit the team in goldcolored shoes that matched their sparkling gold helmets but the wet , slick field had forced parseghian to order his team at the last minute to wear black turf shoes with more traction the only person with a golden foot was thomas , who nervously tapped his right foot seven times awaiting the snap for the goahead fieldgoal attempt the kick wobbled and skirted just inside the right upright it was my most celebrated kick , but maybe the ugliest , said thomas , who had a 12year nfl career and is now an illinois supreme court justice a 1point lead left the fighting irish sideline jubilant , and the players felt more secure when their defense stopped the crimson tide just short of midfield but the notre dame elation turned to worry when the punt from greg gantt was downed at the 1 there was about three minutes to play suddenly , we felt we had the advantage , said alabama outside linebacker mike dubose , the crimson tide head coach from 1997 to 2000 and one of several players in the game who became prominent coaches we were certain to get the ball back with excellent field position sylvester croom , the alabama center who in 2004 was named the southeast conference s first black coach at mississippi state , said the offense had already gathered on the sideline and had plays called for a gamewinning drive no way they would have stopped us , croom said thursday after two runs up the middle , on a thirdand3 from the 8 , parseghian called another running play but signaled for clements to try a long count at the line of scrimmage hoping to draw alabama into a penalty we 're in the huddle , and dave casper says , ok , everybody stay onsides because we 're going with the long cadence , ' notre dame guard gerry dinardo said and what happens \? casper is the one who jumps offsides the penalty put notre dame back on its 3 cosell set the scene from high above the field as the crowd of 85 , 161 stood notre dame called a timeout parseghian was thinking about his punter kicking uphill from the end zone it was the exact spot from before the game , he said i thought if we punt , they 'll get the ball at the 30 and we lose parseghian told clements to run power i right , tackle trap , pass left are you sure \? said clements , who had thrown only 11 passes in the game and would now be flinging one from his own end zone parseghian nodded , and then , to make the play look more like a run , he replaced demmerle , the split end , with robin weber , a 6foot5 , 260pound backup sophomore who wore no 91 and was used almost exclusively in blocking situations weber had caught one pass for 11 yards in the 1973 season during lategame mopup time i did think to myself that it was wet and if clements slipped in the end zone , we would lose on this call , parseghian said but the risk was necessary with seven players lined up shoulder to shoulder and three backs behind clements , it certainly looked like a run after the fake in the backfield , casper was the primary receiver , moving right to left behind the alabama defensive linemen clearing space for casper was weber , who lined up on the left end and took off downfield with a late break toward the sideline i had tackle shoulder pads , a lineman s cage face mask , and i had never caught a pass from tom clements not even warmups , weber said last week from his home in the dallas area i had never run the play in practice i had never run any pass play in practice but when weber left the line , no alabama defender went with him we completely overplayed the run they fooled us all , dubose said casper got held up at the line , so when clements looked to his left , all he saw was weber with no one around him the quarterback lofted the ball high and deep over the alabama pass rush weber could not believe his eyes i saw the ball and realized this was for real i had to catch it now , weber said , chuckling and then the ball hit me in the hands it was no easy catch , arriving over his left shoulder as he galloped toward the alabama bench , but weber pulled it in , took a few steps and fell out of bounds next thing i know , bear bryant is walking toward me surrounded by red jerseys , weber said i got up and ran away it was a 35yard reception notre dame ran out the clock for the 1point victory interviewed on the field after the game , parseghian thanked bryant for bringing the teams together bryant appeared somewhat stunned the way we had them backed up , bryant said , if i were a betting man , i would have bet anything we were going to win bryant later visited the loud , raucous notre dame locker room he congratulated parseghian and asked for clements , shaking his hand i played a lot of football , said clements , now the offensive coordinator for the green bay packers , but i never had another coach do that it was still new year s eve and the players scattered into the new orleans night weber celebrated with his parents at pat o'brien s , the noted saloon , where he enjoyed his sudden , newfound fame , a spotlight that has followed him 39 years later the catch still comes up all the time , said weber , whose junior and senior seasons at notre dame were injuryfilled all the time thomas , the notre dame kicker whose field goal won the game , met up on bourbon street with gantt , the alabama punter whose kick to the 1 nearly won it for alabama the alabama players and fans were great to hang out with , thomas said everybody knew it had been a game that would be remembered for many years gary rutledge , alabama s quarterback , does not recall going out afterward , but the game lingers with him it was historic and a fond memory , he said i wear my 1973 national championship ring , so i probably think about that game every day bill davis went out with some friends , but he said , we did n't do much early the next morning , having breakfast with his future wife , harriet , davis read a newspaper column that suggested fans write davis because he might be feeling badly i got about 40 letters from all over the country all of them very encouraging and supportive , davis said they were from chicago , from oklahoma , a lot from alabama and one was from barry switzer i 've kept them all these years it was a miss , but i'm ok with it that morning , notre dame s dinardo was also up and about , except he had not slept i'm not necessarily proud of this , but i was just getting in from a night of celebrating and i'm sure i looked the part , said dinardo , who went on to coach at vanderbilt , louisiana state and indiana i'm waiting for the elevator in our hotel when the doors opened and out walks coach parseghian , athletic director moose krause and father joyce the rev edmund p joyce was a notre dame vice president and the principal official overseeing the football program for many years ara said hi to me and moose kind of snickered , dinardo said it was n't perfect timing but , hey , how often do you win the game of the century \? the 1973 sugar bowl had a different effect on new year s eve revelers of all sorts across the nation newspaper accounts in the days after the game related a common phenomenon the disruption of informal and elaborate holiday parties alike as people crowded around televisions to watch the riveting alabamanotre dame game the game had a 253 nielsen television rating the rating for last season s bcs title game was 140 i heard one thing over and over when i got back home , thomas said people saying , our whole party stopped to watch your kick' i guess we 'll see if alabama and notre dame can get everyone to stop and watch again
beirut , lebanon marie colvin recognized the significant story unfolding in the rebellious syrian city of homs the problem was how to get at it she had been hoping for an official visa to visit syria s capital , damascus , but with none forthcoming , she decided to sneak over the border despite strong misgivings about her safety in homs , which is suffering a constant battering from government tanks and heavy artillery i cannot remember any story where the security situation was potentially this bad , except maybe chechnya , ms colvin told me over a dinner of traditional lebanese fare on her last night in beirut a week before she was killed in homs on wednesday in her first dispatch from that besieged city , printed in the latest sunday times of london , she detailed the dangers in merely reaching her destination , which lies just across the lebanese border but now exists in a grim , deadly world apart her welcoming party in homs was ecstatic that a foreign reporter had braved the odds to reach them so desperate were they that they bundled me into an open truck and drove at speed with the headlights on , everyone standing in the back shouting , allahu akbar god is the greatest , she wrote inevitably , the syrian army opened fire she then transferred into a small car which was again fired upon , speeding into a row of abandoned buildings for cover but she found her story she described the widows basement crammed with women cowering in the only shelter they could find in a city where there is only sugar and water to feed a newborn baby among the 300 huddling in this wood factory cellar in the besieged district of baba amr is 20yearold noor , who lost her husband and her home to the shells and rockets , ms colvin wrote , etching in stark detail how the woman s husband and brother died when they went out into the streets to forage for food it is a city of the cold and hungry , echoing to exploding shells and bursts of gunfire , she wrote , her overall description evoking some of the worst sieges of world war ii there are no telephones and the electricity has been cut off few homes have diesel for the tin stoves they rely on for heat in the coldest winter that anyone can remember , the story said freezing rain fills potholes and snow drifts in through windows empty of glass no shops are open , so families are sharing what they have with relatives and neighbors many of the dead and injured are those who risked foraging for food fearing the snipers merciless eyes , families resorted last week to throwing bread across rooftops , or breaking through communal walls to pass unseen escape was virtually impossible the syrians have dug a huge trench around most of the district , and let virtually nobody in or out , ms colvin wrote she herself left lebanon for syria on feb 14 on her final night in beirut , she had been waiting around for a telephone call from the smugglers telling her where and when they would meet her and her irish photographer , paul conroy at first , the rendezvous with the smugglers had been set for monday night , feb 13 , outside the great mosque in beirut s main square , and then switched to later at her hotel then silence when i called her around 9 30 , she said she was sitting in her hotel room in black winter long johns borrowed from a male colleague joking about how the yfront would not do her much good if i take off the long johns and go out to dinner with you , they will definitely call , she told me sure enough , as soon as she changed clothes , the smugglers taking her across the border called to postpone the trip until the next morning ms colvin , 56 , was intimately familiar with risk , wearing a distinctive black eyepatch since she lost an eye while crossing between enemy lines in sri lanka in 2001 she had been raised in the town of oyster bay on long island , graduated from yale in 1978 with a degree in anthropology , and began her journalism career as a overnight reporter covering the police beat in new york for the upi news agency at 30 , she was recruited by the sunday times to report from the middle east one always bumped into her angling to get into places whose residents and almost anybody else were desperate to escape the list of wars she had covered over 25 years ringed the globe the balkans , the middle east , somalia , afghanistan , southeast asia and east timor nothing seemed to deter her , john witherow , editor of the sunday times , said in a note to the newspaper s staff on wednesday jon swain , an experienced foreign correspondent at the paper when ms colvin started work there , said that early on she showed gutsy determination , a sense of humor and the bravery that would mark her career in her commitment to document conflict , especially the horrors visited on civilians , the arab world inspired in her a particular sense of purpose she delved into the arab uprisings with zeal , and her last journalistic coups included being one of three reporters granted an audience with the libyan leader , col muammar elqaddafi , who avowed that his people loved him even as the country erupted in flames we can and do make a difference in exposing the horrors of war and especially the atrocities that befall civilians , she said in a speech last year in london honoring correspondents killed in the line of work our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice , she said we always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story what is bravery , and what is bravado \? the many difficult choices made while covering a war , she noted then , sometimes resulted in the ultimate sacrifice remi ochlik , 28 , a french photojournalist , died alongside ms colvin when bombs pulverized the building within an embattled homs neighborhood where they had been working during our beirut dinner , ms colvin reminisced about the time when we had both been stuck in the intercontinental hotel in amman , jordan , under similar circumstances in september 1996 , waiting for official visas to get into iraq while waiting , ms colvin had interviewed some iraqi refugees who went into gory detail about how the sons of president saddam hussein had killed their two brothersinlaw when the two men unexpectedly returned to baghdad after seeking asylum in jordan  when official visas for the press corps came through to baghdad several days later , ms colvin was one of the few reporters denied one i remember people griping that the story was much too bloody , but it turned out that was barely the half of it , ms colvin recalled last week the photographer she was to travel with , mr conroy , showed up late for the dinner they talked briefly about their plans and about the coming danger they recalled living under shell fire for six weeks last year in the besieged libyan city of misurata mr conroy had just received a facebook message from one of the libyan doctors who had helped them find a place to shelter in the hospital the doctor grousing that it had taken him forever to work through all the irish paul conroys on facebook before finding the right one but ms colvin told me that she had an new appointment with the smugglers in the morning , and this time she had a telephone number to call , giving her the sense that the trip to homs on feb 14 would happen before i was apprehensive , but now i m restless , she said , as we walked up the stairs back into the hotel for the night i just want to get in there and get it over with and get out read ms colvin s final report from syria   full coverage of the deaths of ms colvin and , a french photographer , and on

ariha setalvad , who is studying journalism and psychology as an undergraduate at new york university , was raised in india and graduated from bd somani international school in mumbai she is a summer intern on blog what is the most common reaction of teenagers who have decided to move to america for college \? is it a thirst to find likeminded people who share their passion for literature \? or perhaps elation at the prospect of being recruited to a school with one of the best soccer teams in the nation \? none of the above , i would argue , at least based on the experiences of some high school classmates currently in the united states for college , and of some college freshmen instead , the answer lies in the heady rush that comes with discovering that they will no longer need to devise ways to sneak out of the house at 2 am as a college freshman , i had many of the same expectations of my newfound freedom i pictured a montage set to inspirational music , one in which i powered through essays with a sober yet determined look on my face , leaving my professors awestruck at my innate skill in these daydreams , i still had the time and energy to party in a way that would put to shame the college movies i had seen among the factors that i didn t take into account were these that powering through my mountain of essays wasn t an option that my professors had seen , and thus expected , far better and that nights out required money \( often far more than i had \) and yes , that real life isn t set to music , inspirational or otherwise a tendency to be overwhelmed and carried away by a new lifestyle is not unusual in india , drinking and partying can sometimes be considered taboo , but in america , it s just part of the culture , said saif myageri , who grew up in pune and is an undergraduate at mcmaster university in canada it s easy to forget why you re here and to remember that you have to put your education first the major difference between the indian lifestyle and the north american one is that labor is cheap in india , mr myageri added in india , there are servants to keep our houses clean and drivers to drive us around , but here , you have to do the laundry and cooking things that have to be added to your schedule when an average day requires you to go to class , finish your homework , meet your friends , cook dinner , ensure you can see the floor of your room and make sure that your clothes don t smell like three days of wear well , that requires organization as bhavesh khemka , a native of rajasthan and a colorado state university student , discovered early on , the minor adjustments are often the most essential in india , there really is nothing like time management , he says you always mean about 45 minutes later than the time you say , but in america , that doesn t work people actually get really angry so let s assume , perhaps too optimistically , that you have the time management down your apartment is sparkling , your homework is done and you re ready to roll except now , there s nobody around to check out that new thai restaurant with you for those high school students in india , or in other countries , who may be headed to college in the united states or considering such a move , here are some tips for managing your time and generally not losing your mind do readers of the choice on india ink have timemanagement tips of their own to add \? please use the comment box below to let us know
east rutherford , nj there is often something cartoonish about the , whether it is their shocking decision to allow jason witten and his tender spleen to play in the season opener wednesday night , or the giggleworthy television shot of someone else apparently cleaning jerry jones s eyeglasses before delicately handing them back to him this summer , the former giants receiver amani toomer added to the comedy when he said that tony romo was a better quarterback than eli manning that , of course , is ridiculous , considering that manning is a large reason that the cowboys and romo had to endure a brief celebration of the giants' latest victory before the first game of the season began but by the time it was over , and the cowboys had won , 2417 , toomer at least had a little more ammunition for his argument , and it was time to retire one joke that had attached itself to the cowboys during romo s career now entering his ninth season , romo really can win the big game after all he has just one playoff victory in his career but no opening game could have meant more for a team than this one did for the cowboys , and romo played what might have been the game of his career , to perhaps finally silence the whispers that he wilts at the biggest moment , that the cowboys' failures have been mostly his they were not wednesday night romo moved away from the giants' defensive pressure and , with the exception of one awful interception early in the second quarter , he was nearly flawless , completing 76 percent of his passes with three dazzling touchdown passes and a handful of other spectacular throws , including a laser to dez bryant into tight coverage down the right sideline for 38 yards on thirdandone late in the second quarter , romo led the cowboys to becoming the first team to beat a defending super bowl champion since the nfl began staging a kickoff spectacular in 2004 the cowboys lost twice to the giants last season , including in the season finale , when the giants clinched the playoff spot that propelled them to the super bowl considering the weight jones , the cowboys' owner , had placed on beating the giants , this might count as dallas s biggest victory since romo s lone playoff win in 2009 in the locker room afterward , where jones held court , he proclaimed it a very significant win for our franchise then , he added i'm not so sure this was as big a deal to the giants as it was to us for the cowboys to string a few more of these together to overtake the giants in the nfc east this season , they will rely on romo more than ever they struggled to run in the first half the giants struggled the entire night and romo will be responsible for managing a gaggle of potentially highmaintenance and injuryprone receivers \( bryant and miles austin , who caught one of romo s touchdown passes \) and inexperienced projects \( kevin ogletree , the queens product who had caught 25 passes , none for touchdowns , in his previous three seasons , before catching two touchdown passes wednesday night \) the pass is the way teams win in the nfl now , with wideopen offenses and multiple receivers sets and if romo is not yet in the most elite class of quarterbacks manning is he is certainly in the top 10 this victory affirms that he still has the potential to outduel even the very best of them , especially against a giants secondary that , as it did early last season , looked injuryravaged and shaky even if romo s most important security and surest weapon , witten , acted largely as a wellpadded decoy on wednesday , romo was good enough to erase the past failures of the defense they had become famous for blowing fourthquarter leads , but with the cowboys clinging to a touchdown margin and the offensive line just called for holding , romo kept his defense off the field , completing a quick pass under pressure on thirdand12 to ogletree at the twominute warning with that , the giants' fans headed for the exits , and romo cleared some psychic space between himself and his critics after the game , romo spoke on the field to nbc about knowing that he had to disregard the interception whether you 're playing in the parking lot or in giants stadium against the world champions after the first touchdown , he said , he wanted to have a killer instinct , because he expected the giants and manning to come back they almost did but in the biggest first game the cowboys have ever played , it was romo s reputation that had the bigger revival

double in the sixth scherzer up to 91 pitches  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 18 oct 12 you are welcome , yankees fans the sablich jinx works again ! nunez lined one to left into the gap and ended up at third base with a triple yankees with a runner at third with swisher up and one out a reader asked whether or not scherzer came from the yankees in the grandersonjackson deal from the winter of 2009 scherzer did come to the tigers in that trade , but it was a threeteam deal that also involved the arizona diamondbacks scherzer , along with daniel schlereth , came to detroit from arizona , who received edwin jackson the yankees sent jackson and phil coke to the tigers and received granderson in game 4 , scherzer is pitching a nohitter , jackson is 1 for 3 with a walk and granderson is on the bench the tigers were looking to add to their lead , with runners on first and second and two outs , but rapada , who was brought in to replace eppley , got garcia to ground out i mentioned the fact that hiroki kuroda had a nohitter through five innings during game 2 on sunday , and that totally jinxed him so it s only fair that i now mention that scherzer has a nohitter through five innings tigers yanks shaping up as one of those rare ultimate sweeps in which the losing team never even holds a lead like bos stl in 2004 ws  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 18 oct 12 cody eppley is in this game in the fourth inning if that s the only thing you ve read about this game , then you know that it can t be good for the yankees sabathia pitched three and twothirds innings , allowed 11 hits and five earned runs he struck out three and walked two hey , cc was great getting the yankees into the alcs unfortunately , they they never showed up  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 with two outs , young singled on a ground ball to left field and came around to score on a home run from peralta everything that could have gone wrong for the yankees in this game has gone wrong so far i swear , the wind picked up for both cabrera and peralta 60 tigers 93 pitches for cc yankees look like the mets in august  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 a lot of the tigers hits today have not been hit hard but this one , this one was hit hard after infante hit a soft liner to center with one out , cabrera came up and crushed a ball over the leftfield wall the way the yankees have been hitting , this feels like a 120 lead , not 40 how many times have you seen a player make a bad play in the field and then come up the next inning and strike out \? oh , wait , i think i got this saying mixed up teixeira , after two poor defensive plays in the bottom of the third , struck out in the top of the fourth as part of another onetwothree inning for the yankees ibanez also struck out against scherzer , who now has seven strikeouts sabathia is over 70 pitches , but there s still a chance he ll go deep in this game , since he had an extra day off and doesn t have to worry about starting a potential game 7 thanks to the rainout texeira now has twice as many errors \( 2 \) in nine postseason games than he had in 123 regular season games \( 1 \)  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 18 oct 12 with the bases loaded , laird worked the count to 31 , but sabathia got him to fly out to right field what s more frustrating than not being able to hit \? not being able to hit and playing poor defense sabathia is not as dominant , but the tigers are not exactly tearing the cover off of the ball now would be a good time to score some runs , something the yankees have rarely done this postseason prior to the ninth inning the yankees have scored 16 runs this postseason , only eight of those have been during the first eight innings the other eight have been scored in dramatic fashion in either the ninth inning or in extra innings none of the five runs they ve scored in the alcs have been in the first eight innings in this case , better late than never is not going to cut it did they need smooth the infield dirt around first \? 2 errors , 1 for prince , 1 for tex and 1 shouldhavebeen for tex  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 peralta drove one to the track , but ichiro put it away for the second out but the next batter , dirks , chopped one to teixeira and this time , he did get charged with an error as the ball popped out of his glove with the bases loaded , garcia bounced one up the middle that nunez got to , but he had no time to throw out garcia sloppy defense in the third inning , surprisingly so from teixeira peralta comes up with runners on first and second with one out fielder singled \( though it should have been called an error on teixeira \) and young walked girardi said that on wednesday he had come up with a lineup that actually included rodriguez and chris stewart for game 4 and accidentally sent it over to tigers manager jim leyland instead of the one he eventually settled on the correct one was then sent over , he said it was a mistake , he explained i sent the wrong one i had a few i had one with stew in there because i wasn t sure russell was going to be able to play russell martin is playing through a jammed left thumb  david waldstein the yankees had their first baserunner of the game in this inning as eduardo nunez reached on an error and then stole second base then ichrio , scherzer s nemesis from the first inning , had another great atbat , working the count once again to 32 , but this time he earned a walk but with runners on first and second and two outs , swisher was called out on a third strike only good news here is that scherzer is now above 50 pitches , but the yankees are not hitting the ball hard , when they re not striking out scherzer has five strikeouts through three innings pitches piling up for scherzer mid 50s after 3 we will see the tigers bullpen today  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 ichiro , who drew 22 walks all season , has seen 17 pitches in his first two atbats he walks after 8pitch ab in the third  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 18 oct 12 after two dominant performances in the postseason , maybe the bar has been set unrealistically high , but sabathia certainly looks more human today his velocity is a bit down , hovering around 9091 miles per hour , and has already given up three solid hits \( and one infield hit \) over two innings his pitch count is already over 40 pitches cc s fastball clocked at 9192 in 1st inning result 3 hits and a run  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 with one out in the first inning , omar infante hit a weak ground ball to chavez at third base and just flat out beat the throw an reached on an infield single he would come around to score after singles from prince fielder and young it s a play chavez should have made there was no error and the throw was fine , he just reacted too slowly off of the bat this won t help keep those fans happy who want rodriguez out there so the tigers score in the first inning the yankees have no idea what that feels like in fact , all of their runs in this series \( five \) have come in the ninth inning and all are from home runs yankees will score today , i can feel it but cc has been on such a roll , you wonder if he s due an average outing  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 delmon young just drove in the first run of this game on a linedrive single to right field tigers have runners on first and second with two out delmon young is looking like manny ramirez this series another rbi against the yankees , giving the tigers a 10 lead in the first  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 18 oct 12 scherzer throws 19 pitches , but allows no hits and strikes out swisher and cano , who could not catch up to the fastball during their atbats , repeatedly fouling off heaters right down the plate scherzer is on a pitch count because he dealt with right shoulder fatigue in the later part of the season , so it s imperative that the yankees are patient at the plate , but they have to be able to hit his fastball scherzer is on a 100pitch count , and ichiro suzuki did his part in making sure he gets there sooner rather than later he worked the count to 32 before popping out , but he made scherzer throw nine pitches just moments away from the first pitch it s not raining , just like it wasn t raining before the scheduled start of the game on wednesday evening but the difference today is we re actually going to play baseball , because there s no rain in the forecast obviously , the yankees have the right man on the mound with their season on the line cc sabathia pitched a complete game in game 5 of the alds against the baltimore orioles and was one out shy of another complete game in game 1 of the same series he s 20 with a 153 earned run average and 16 strikeouts in the postseason so far , and he s 30 in three starts against the tigers this season detroit s starter , max scherzer , lasted just four and twothirds innings against the yankees in his only start against them in 2012 \( a 62 loss \) , but that was back on april 29 scherzer was much more effective in the second half of the season , going 61 with a 208 era with 80 strikeouts in 65 innings over his last 11 regular season starts it s going to come down to whether the struggling yankees offense can give sabathia some run support we all know how bad the numbers have been , but in case you re unaware , the yankees have a 200 batting average in this year s postseason and a 158 average in the alcs the lowest average they ve ever had in a postseason series was back in 1963 , when they batted 171 as a team against the los angeles dodgers in the world series girardi on hughes back and potential to pitch in a game 7 we believe he s going to be ok and he d be available to us , yes nyy  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 18 oct 12 the lineups that were announced wednesday are the same for thursday again , no rodriguez or granderson , who was 0 for 3 tuesday night and is 3 for 29 overall this postseason swisher is back in the lineup after being benched for game 3 , and brett gardner replaces granderson in center yankees 1 \) ichiro suzuki , lf 2 \) nick swisher , rf 3 \) robinson cano , 2b 4 \) mark teixeira , 1b 5 \) raul ibanez , dh 6 \) eric chavez , 3b 7 \) russell martin , c 8 \) brett gardner , cf 9 \) eduardo nunez , ss cc sabathia , sp tigers

gerald laird , c max scherzer , sp sun shining in detroit , still 90 minutes to game 4  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 18 oct 12 it now seems like a legitimate question to ask has alex rodriguez played his last game with the yankees \? with the team facing elimination , rodriguez is being benched for the third time this postseason for game 4 and there are rumors flying around baseball that the yankees already had talks with the miami marlins about trading rodriguez the trade rumors started on keith olbermann s mlbcom blog olbermann reported that the yankees had held talks with the marlins about swapping rodriguez for reliever heath bell and that the yankees would take on much of rodriguez s remaining contract olbermann claimed that he did not know how serious the talks were , but that a marlins official involved was confident that a deal would eventually get done brian cashman , the yankees general manager , said wednesday in a pregame press conference that the report was 100 percent false purely baseball related , cashman said of the decision not to play rodriguez this is all about winning , regardless of the report that is out there that is a nonbaseballrelated story rodriguez does have a notrade clause in his contract , but it is widely believed that if there s one team he d waive it for , it d be for his hometown miami marlins regardless of the marlins rumors , it seems as though the rodriguez benching has gone beyond a baseball decision , despite claims from cashman and yankees manager joe girardi , that it s based on his struggles against righthanded pitching in his press conference , cashman implied that rodriguez could get a chance against lefthanded pitchers in this series and that eric chavez was a viable alternative to rodriguez the problem with that is the tigers don t have any lefthanded starting pitchers , and when girardi had a chance to use rodriguez against the lefthanded phil coke in the ninth inning last night , he did not meanwhile , chavez is 0 for 14 so far in the postseason so what the yankees are left with is a 30millionayear platoon player , as harvey araton wrote on thursday araton writes that , whatever inhouse resentment there is for him and his contract is misplaced and grossly unfair he points out that rodriguez never forced the yankees to resign him and that , in fact , rodriguez gave the team an airtight excuse for cutting ties after rodriguez opted out of his contract during the 2007 world series is the benching of rodriguez really a baseball decision \? we very well may have seen the last of rodriguez on the field as a yankee , even if the yankees manage to win game 4 was he being punished for allegedly trying to pickup an australian model during game 1 of this series \? who knows \? the more pressing questions are was it smart to bench rodriguez in game 3 and in thursday s game 4 and should he be traded this offseason \? feel free to debate this point in the comments and i ll be back later this afternoon with live updates and analysis of game 4 in detroit
during the 2008 democratic primaries , i had a lot of success in forecasting outcomes from state to state based solely on demographic variables those projections did slightly better than the polls , although that was a low bar to clear because the polls had a lot of misses that year some readers have asked why i haven t done the same thing this year the reason is that the 2008 democratic contest was uniquely well suited to this sort of analysis , while this year s republican race is a bad fit for it the 2008 race became a twoperson contest between barack obama and hillary rodham clinton almost immediately after iowa it s much harder to make these projections when more than two candidates are involved , as in the race this year and the 2008 democratic nomination was in some ways remarkably stable mrs clinton led in essentially every national poll conducted before iowa mr obama overtook her at some point in midfebruary mr obama s lead fluctuated a little bit after that he was essentially tied with mrs clinton at his worst moments and about 10 points ahead of her at his best ones but the february shift was the only clear lead change in the national polls yes , the split between mr obama and mrs clinton manifested itself in different ways in all different states precisely the reason that demographic analysis proved valuable but results that seemed hard to explain at first became more understandable later on mr obama won iowa and he won most of the states like iowa no matter when they voted in the process mrs clinton won new hampshire and almost all of the other states that shared similar demographics there were a few anomalous results mr obama won connecticut but none of the states that surrounded it , and mrs clinton did the same in south dakota but not many in contrast , there have been 10 separate republican candidates who have led in at least one national poll at some point in this nomination cycle \( counting a few candidates who decided not to run officially \) they are , in alphabetical order michele bachmann , herman cain , chris christie , newt gingrich , rudy giuliani , mike huckabee , sarah palin , rick perry , mitt romney and donald trump they may soon be joined by an 11th candidate , rick santorum , who is likely to lead in a new public policy polling survey that will be out soon another distinction is that the demographic patterns that shaped the democratic race were relatively crisp the most relevant were probably race , gender , age and education levels , in about that order none of those characteristics are highly correlated with one another , which makes statistical analysis much easier this year , things are blurrier mr romney appears to be relatively weak among voters in the following categories evangelical christians , lowerincome voters , rural voters , voters who identify themselves as very conservative and tea party supporters he also seems to be weaker in the midwest and the south than in the west and the northeast but most of these characteristics are very strongly correlated with one another more evangelicals live in the south , rural voters tend to have lower incomes than suburban ones and so forth it is very hard to untangle all of that unless you have a lot of data sean trende at real clear politics has uncovered some interesting results by looking at data at the county level , as has seth masket , and i am going to post an analysis soon about the states where mr romney appears to be the strongest and weakest it s worth looking at this stuff but probably more as a supplement to the polls rather than as a replacement for them and some results have been hard to explain by any measure how in the world did mr santorum get 10 percent of the vote in nevada but 40 percent of the vote in colorado , just three days later \? colorado and nevada are not exceptionally similar , and the candidates applied different strategies and resources in advance of the voting in these states , but the differences are almost certainly insufficient to explain the size of the discrepancy if you exclude mormons from the nevada data , for instance , mr santorum won about 12 percent of the vote there that reduces the disparity between his nevada and colorado result to 28 percentage points from 30 , which is no help at all so while there was no entrance poll data in colorado and while mr romney may have been more organized in nevada , we can still probably conclude that voter preferences have been incredibly fickle in this primary season i don t think you can develop a successful theory about this race unless you assume that voters are changing their minds a lot some demographic groups may be more inclined to support certain candidates than others but there are a lot of swing voters , and they have been swinging that unpredictability makes a case for betting on mr santorum , who is given just a 13 percent chance of winning the republican nomination on the betting market intrade right now if the republicans were neatly coloring in the demographic and geographic lines as mrs clinton and mr obama did then the small lead that mr romney enjoys in the delegate count so far would be more definitive the eight states that have voted so far are a reasonably representative sample , so if demographics are destiny , you might be able to make some preciseseeming projections going forward if the map is more scrambled , however , those predictions have a greater margin of error there might be 15 or 20 states that lean toward mr romney and 15 or 20 that lean against him , but few are truly safe calls instead , mr romney s lead is more like the one held by a driver leading the indianapolis 500 after six laps have been completed it might be argued that he is the better driver or has the better car but the physical lead itself is not worth very much all sorts of crazy things happen when there are 33 cars on the track , and one poorly timed pit stop would be enough for him to relinquish his advantage we should have a clearer idea after michigan and arizona vote on feb 28 both can probably be classified as lean romney states better than the median state , but not giving him as decisive an advantage as states like new hampshire or nevada the thing that should worry mr romney is that colorado would have been in the same category more broadly , republicans have so far declined several opportunities to coalesce around mr romney they did not do so after he announced his candidacy , nor after mr perry sunk in the polls , nor when mr cain withdrew , nor after mr romney s apparent win in iowa and actual win in new hampshire and after big wins in florida and nevada , he is struggling yet again mr santorum is a fresher face , comparatively speaking he clearly did not get much momentum from his strong showing in iowa but his iowa surge had been largely confined to that state to begin with , and he was hurt by the fact that the next state to vote was new hampshire , a bad fit for him culturally , as well as the fact that he was not announced as the actual winner until after the new hampshire voting on tuesday , by contrast , he earned victories in three states , and he seems to be on the move in national polls as well but mr santorum will not be as easy a mark for mr romney as someone like mr gingrich the results in florida had seemed to suggest that mr romney could win a state any time he wanted to by blanketing it with advertising dollars but almost all of those ads were negative , and almost all of them attacked mr gingrich most of them on his personal failings like his resignation from congress and his ties to freddie mac mr romney s attacks on mr santorum , by contrast , have focused on more venial sins that he is a career politician who defended earmarks meanwhile , mr santorum closed strongly and outperformed his polls in several states so far , including iowa , colorado , minnesota , missouri and south carolina \( where he was projected to place fourth by the polls but finished in third \) that could indicate that voters like mr santorum the more they get to know him indeed , his favorability ratings are strong among republican voters or that his supporters are more enthusiastic either quality would be an asset going forward , allowing him to win his share of close calls against mr romney thus , it seems at least possible that mr santorum s momentum will be more sustainable to have a chance at winning in the delegate count , he will need to supplant mr gingrich as mr romney s major rival in the south the results in missouri , a borderline southern state where mr santorum beat mr romney by 30 points without mr gingrich on the ballot , suggest that he could run strongly if mr gingrich were to bow out it is certainly not a straightforward path , but nor is mr romney s at this point and so far in this republican race , betting on the underdog has yielded dividends
judging from comments on my north dakota post , there s a lot of confusion about when and why differences in scale make comparisons between economies invalid the crucial thing to get is that size per se isn t the issue it s whether what is going on in the small economy could be replicated in the large economy i mean , we all know that airplane designs can be tested with miniature models in wind tunnels , that tsunamis can be modeled in tanks that fit in a \( large \) room , and so on smallscale versions of big phenomena are perfectly ok the babysitting coop teaches us a lot about the global economic slump but when you re looking at , say , a resource boom which is what north dakota is all about you have to ask whether a comparable resource boom is possible in a much more populous state , or the united states as a whole one commenter declared that there s as much oil under california as there is under north dakota quite possibly the question is , how big a deal would extracting that oil be in a state with 50 times north dakota s population how much difference would it make to , say , the state unemployment rate \? and the answer of course is virtually none to have a north dakotatype boom in california you d have to find 50 times as much oil to have it nationally you d have to find 500 times as much not likely and this is how you want to think about other examples is iceland too small to be a useful model for other crisis countries \? well , it could be iceland s export sector is , thanks to its small size , not very diverse , and if the recovery had been all about fish , or aluminum , it wouldn t be much of a lesson to anyone else as it happens , however , that s not what it s about i guess the general point is that when trying to learn from some country or region s experience , you should always ask , is this place a reasonably good model for other places \? it s not a matter of head counts or acreage , it s about the story
while hurricane sandy might someday be looked upon as the turning point in our national discussion \( or at least a regional one \) about infrastructure and climate change , it could also be a pivotal point in a discussion about the outsize place sports has cleared for itself in our society maybe the whole firestorm over sunday , through a city freshly devastated by a giant storm , will end up being this city s squabble , quickly forgotten but in a twist of fate , it will also be the first new york city marathon televised live nationally , so the country will have a frontrow seat for the race , which is being run despite much opposition and with the sentiment among many new yorkers that this is an insane use of city resources in the middle of a disaster you could make similar arguments about the knicks' opener going ahead friday night at madison square garden or the steelers' game against the giants at metlife stadium on sunday with the because their booked hotel does not have power and they did not want to cause more trouble finding an alternative but they are not quite the tipthescales problem that the marathon is as , none of those other things are a massive undertaking involving all five boroughs , and mayor michael r bloomberg can insist in four languages that resources will not be diverted from the recovery and it will still sound as if he is insisting the world is flat and the moon is made out of cream cheese this is why there is to stop the marathon , and  yes , there is an argument to be made , as , that even when you 've taken a personal hit from a storm , sports play a nice role as a distraction and bonds people but still , should those sports be going on the stormravaged city \? or could we just as easily be distracted by something being played in california \? the giants talked about showing themselves a suitably tough team to represent a tough populace , , but there has to be the same ambivalence among those players as there is with some knicks , after all , players and people going to the games will drive through areas still without power and water and heat and pass gas stations with crazy long lines of people exhausted by the storm and its aftermath sure , the city will go on , as the mayor says , but it will go on whether the games are postponed or canceled or not somehow sports has become like the overweight uncle who now takes up three spaces at the family thanksgiving table and acts as if he is more important than everyone else how did he get so big and immovable \? this is basically entertainment , but would anyone insist on filming the next episode of two and a half men in the middle of a disaster zone \? of course not but the games must go on as a sign of our resilience \? why \? \( and yes , we know the answer is money but money should n't always be an acceptable answer \) there are plenty of things going on elsewhere to keep our minds occupied after all , it s not every day that kobe bryant steps out of his clark kent costume and says , everybody just shut up , after the lakers start 02 , and the oklahoma city thunder just climbed under a giant microscope after trading james harden and losing their home opener to the spurs at the buzzer , please , analyze and discuss or , you could join all of san diego in wringing your hands about the chargers their victory over the chiefs on thursday night might seem to help matters , but , the fact that they beat the chiefs clears up exactly nothing as , the flame under coach norv turner s seat got turned down only half a notch hey , at least in san diego they have electricity to keep that torch burning in new york , they 'd like theirs back on so they could crank up the one under bloomberg s seat
disclaimer remember , roughly 90 percent of free agents are free agents only because their last team did not want them firstclass elite none pro bowl caliber 1 vincent jackson \( last team sd , currently 29 years old \) it s easy to see why the chargers paid eight figures to franchisetag jackson last year at 6foot5 , 230 pounds and sound in the specifics of route running and ballsnagging , jackson offers about as complete a package as any receiver keeping him out of the firstclass elite category is a mild propensity to tail off against highquality coverage and a few offthefield problems to his name that said , if a team made jackson one of the five highestpaid receivers in the game , no one would bat an eye 2 mike wallace \( pit , 25 \) it s rare to see restricted free agents sign with new teams especially when they have a firstround tender but even rarer is finding a player with wallace s fieldstretching abilities a lanky frame and long stride accentuate the fourthyear pro s startling speed wallace can develop into a randy mosstype weapon in the sense that he is dangerous enough to command constant help coverage over the top he is not yet consistent enough to be placed in that top class that moss was once in , however refinements in route running , increased strength in possession and a slight softening of the hands are still needed 3 marques colston \( no , 28 \) it would be shocking if the saints let their former seventhround steal get away colston s length and supple strength make him a premier seam weapon from the slot he can also operate in the red zone teams looking to sign colston should be leery of his price tag he has put up no 1 receiver numbers \( 1 , 000plus yards in five of his six seasons as a pro \) , but he is not a genuine no 1 a genuine no 1 lines up primarily outside and commands double teams a majority of the time colston s success has been in exploiting single coverages from the inside as part of the saints highpowered machine 4 brandon lloyd \( stl , 30 \) there is something disconcerting about an insanely talented player who has been on five teams in nine years clearly , lloyd can be a headache to deal with but in the right system \( read josh mcdaniels s \) and in the right situation \( read new england \) , he can be as dangerous as anyone in the game he is an acrobat downfield and near the sidelines , possessing two of the strongest hands in the history of the position his body control is amazing , and his route running , though not talked about , can be superb quality starter 5 pierre garcon \( ind , 25 \) if we are just going by career resume , or even the past three years , garcon is not better than his former colts teammate reggie wayne but he is eight years younger and still improving thus , he presents better longterm value garcon fits in a lot of today s offenses because he can run after the catch he does so relying more on strength than speed \( though that is not to say garcon isn t fast \) polish and consistency remain small question marks , but good coaching and good quarterbacking should be enough to push the former small college star s continued development 6 mario manningham \( nyg , 25 \) some team will pay manningham 120 percent of his actual value because of what happened in the super bowl no doubt , manningham can be a biggame player and a viable no 2 but it is unlikely that going somewhere else where he can be the man will make him better than he was playing with eli manning in a familiar giants system manningham has great footwork and is devoid of any major weaknesses but he does not have the build or dazzling tools to strike fear in a defense 7 reggie wayne \( ind , 33 \) he will most likely follow peyton manning , which will inflate his effectiveness the hard truth is , wayne has slowed down considerably the past few years he does not get off the line of scrimmage with as much quickness as he once did or accelerate in his change of direction consequently , he struggles to beat elite man coverage that said , wayne can still rely on his savvy and nearperfect fundamentals to be a quality no 2 \( especially if he is with manning \) role player 8 robert meachem \( no , 27 \) he is more valuable as a saint than he is anywhere else as a saint , he can be a flyroute specialist , which is really the only thing he has done with great consistency in his career but you couldn t blame a team for rolling the dice by signing meachem as a prominent no 2 he has improved throughout the course of his career and has just enough supple athleticism to justify his original firstround draft status 9 laurent robinson \( dal , 26 \) robinson is essentially a lankier version of miles austin at least , that is what he looked like in a dallas uniform he is a risk to sign to a longterm deal because , though he was phenomenal allaround as a breakout star last season , he was an injuryprone underachiever the previous four years still , he is worth a chance given that he can go deep , play underneath and be fairly dangerous with the ball in his hands 10 jerome simpson \( cin , 26 \) an indictment on marijuana trafficking and inconsistent routes hands are major red flags but when simpson is right , he s capable of a 150yard sunday afternoon his quickness , athleticism and sheer playmaking prowess can be nightmarish for defenses , as there is really nowhere on the field he can t go overall , there is more evidence suggesting simpson will disappoint than satisfy but that is why a team can obtain his services at a bargain price other familiar names randy moss forget his behavior throughout 2010 the main reason he played for three teams that season was that he had been completely washed up there is no swiftness left in his change of direction early doucet when kurt warner left arizona , he apparently took the former thirdround pick s potential with him roy williams prone to maddening mistakes but still has good size and adequate tools legedu naanee versatility makes him valuable as a no 4 eddie royal never did turn into the next wes welker andre caldwell might still emerge as a quality no 2 receiver , though he has had plenty of chances to do so already braylon edwards has had offthefield problems and had an injuryplagued 2011 deion branch would not work in any system other than new england s and new england probably isn t pining to

what sort of thing is a presidential campaign \? maybe a campaign is like a courtship a candidate s job is to woo the electorate , to win the people s affection with charm , familiarity and compassion maybe a campaign is like a big version of american idol it is a contest over who is the most talented in this mode , a candidate s job is to endear himself to the people in the audience with likability and then wow them with his gifts maybe , on the other hand , hiring a president is like hiring a plumber voters are n't really looking to fall in love with the guy they just want someone who will fix the pipes the candidate s job is to list the three or four things he would do if elected and then to hammer home those deliverables again and again you could make a case that most campaigns are a little of all three , though the proportions vary from year to year in 2008 , obama ran an uplifting campaign that was part courtship and part american idol richard nixon , who lacked such charm , ran workmanlike , plumber campaigns , no pun intended so far , though , the 2012 presidential campaign is fitting into none of these categories it s being organized according to a different metaphor this year , both organizations seem to visualize the campaign as a boxing match or a gang fight whichever side can hit the other side harder will somehow get awarded the champion s belt so far this year , both president obama and mitt romney seem more passionate about denying the other side victory than about any plank in their own agendas both campaigns have developed contempt for their opponent , justifying their belief that everything , then , is permitted in both campaigns , you can see the warroom mentality developing early attention spans shrink to a point gone is much awareness of the world outside the campaign all focus is on the news blip of the moment answering volley for volley if they bring a knife , you bring a gun if they throw a bomb , you throw two both sides are extraordinarily willing to flout respectability to show that they are tough enough to bare the knuckles in november , the romney campaign ran a blatantly dishonest ad in which president obama purportedly admits that if the election is fought on the economy , he will lose the quote was a distortion , but the effectiveness of the ad was in showing republican professionals and primary voters that romney was going to play by gangland rules , that he was tough enough and dishonest enough to do so , too last week , on the death of osama bin laden part of the ad was bill clinton effectively talking about the decision to kill the terrorist but , in the middle , the obama people threw in a lowminded attack on romney the slam made clinton look small , it made obama look small , it turned a moment of genuine accomplishment into a political ploy , but it did follow the rules of gangland at every second , attack at every opportunity , drive a shiv between the ribs this martial , ganglandstyle of campaigning apparently makes the people in the campaigns feel hardheaded , professional and machiavellian but it s not clear that it s actually the best way to win an election that s because the style is based on a series of dubious assumptions that the harshest language is the most persuasive to voters that what feels good to you as a competitive combatant will also look most attractive to detached onlookers that over the duration of a sixmonth campaign , daily combat will continue to look compelling rather than cumulatively revolting that in a campaign dominated by super pac negativity , a presidential candidate is better served by wading into the brawl rather than separating himself from it the campaignaswarfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse it may make sense if you think today s swing voters hunger for more combat , more harshness and more attack but it s probably bad sociology and terrible psychology , given the general disgust with conventional politics if i were in the campaigns , i 'd want to detach from the current rules of engagement and change the nature of the campaign if i were obama , i 'd play to his personal popularity and run an american idol campaign likability , balance , safety and talent if i were romney , saddled with his personal diffidence , i 'd run a plumber campaign you may not love me , but here s four things i can do for you these would be very different campaigns than the ones we are seeing so far more positive psychology , less negative psychology a few big messages about fundamental change , less obsession with the daily news cycle more attention devoted to those turned off by politics , less to the hardcore denizens who are obsessed by it
around 8 30 on friday night , as the celebration died down in the home clubhouse at yankee stadium , an attendant slapped a white sheet of paper on the message board saturday report 4 30 the yankees would have only 20 hours to rest before starting the american league championship series even so , they had it easier than their opponent , the detroit tigers after finishing off the athletics in oakland on thursday , the tigers flew home to detroit , not knowing if they would stay there to face baltimore or fly to new york to meet the yankees such is life in baseball s new playoff format , which for this season , anyway came without a day off between the yankees division series and the alcs why not , right \? the yankees nick swisher said there ain t nothing better to do for the yankees struggling hitters , it is probably best not to dwell too much on the tigers , who held the a s to a 194 average in their division series then again , the yankees held the orioles to a 187 average in theirs both teams also have prolific power hitters , although none of them did much in the division series the tigers hit just two home runs , and the yankees hit four two , as fans will forever recall , by raul ibanez each team was forced to use its ace in the decisive game of the division series , and each worked nine innings the difference is that the tigers played on thursday , meaning justin verlander can come back for game 3 in detroit on normal rest and then pitch a potential game 7 on normal rest again for the yankees c c sabathia to make two starts in this series , at least one would have to be on short rest of course , that is the situation without rain , which these teams have experienced they have met twice in recent years in division series , with detroit prevailing in four games in 2006 and in five games last october a rainout in 2006 forced the yankees to face verlander in the afternoon shadows the next day , and they lost last year s game 1 was suspended by rain , altering the matchups for the rest of the series platoon pair tigers manager jim leyland adjusts his lineup based on matchups against righthanders , he uses alex avila at catcher and andy dirks in right field against lefthanders , he uses gerald laird behind the plate and the rookie avisail garcia in right garcia , 21 , started the season in class a but was 15 for 47 \( 319 \) in the regular season after his promotion on aug 31 he has a strong arm and threw out coco crisp at the plate in game 2 of the division series strikeouts galore the tigers recorded 50 strikeouts in their fivegame division series victory over the freeswinging athletics that may sound like a lot , but the yankees struck out nearly as often in their five games against baltimore , whiffing 47 times justin verlander led the al in strikeouts this season with 239 , and his teammate max scherzer , who is scheduled to start game 4 of the alcs , finished second , with 231 big fan jim leyland has managed for 21 years in the major leagues , but few players fascinate him as much as the yankees robinson cano i have as much respect for robinson cano as an opposing player as any player i ve managed against , leyland told mlbcom in march i just think he s so special i m not going to get into some formal dissertation about it i just think he , to me , is a great , great , great player i ve just never seen anybody just a flick of the bat , the ball s in the upper deck he just flicks the ball , and it s coming over there like a missile and he does it so smooth , so easy it s almost like it s effortless brown and blue the tigers have different versions of their old english d logo on the cap and on the home jersey , and max scherzer has different eye colors one brown , one blue during the tigers champagne celebration in oakland , he wore specialized goggles one dark lens , one light lens he s due prince fielder headed into the alcs with a 192 career playoff average , yet he has homered at least once in all four series he has played in his father , cecil , also made the most of his hits in the postseason as a yankee in the 1996 alcs , cecil fielder batted 167 but drove in eight runs in a fivegame series victory over baltimore familiar opponent anibal sanchez is scheduled to start game 2 for detroit on sunday that would be the first time he has pitched in the bronx since june 25 , 2006 , when he made his major league debut for joe girardi s florida marlins in the second game of a doubleheader at the old yankee stadium sanchez shut out the yankees over five and twothirds innings to win that night , and he threw a nohitter that september sanchez had a 374 earned run average in 12 starts for the tigers this season after he was acquired in a trade with miami in july triple threat this may be no surprise , but the triplecrown winner miguel cabrera has hit very well against some of the yankees cabrera is 9 for 22 \( 409 \) with four homers off phil hughes in his career , 4 for 9 \( 444 \) with two homers off hiroki kuroda and 10 for 28 \( 357 \) with two homers off c c sabathia only two players magglio ordonez and torii hunter have more career runs batted in off sabathia than cabrera , who has 12 common alumni each team has a lefthanded reliever who has played for the opponent the tigers phil coke and the yankees clay rapada john flaherty , a yes broadcaster , played for both teams , and so have prominent outfielders like johnny damon , curtis granderson and gary sheffield several players have toiled in the postseason for both teams , including doyle alexander , mike heath , aurelio rodriguez and kenny rogers , among others before he led the yankees to the world series in 1976 and 1977 , billy martin steered the tigers to the alcs in 1972
tokyo after years of watching its international influence eroded by a slowmotion economic decline , the pacifist nation of is trying to raise its profile in a new way , offering military aid for the first time in decades and displaying its own armed forces in an effort to build regional alliances and shore up other countries' defenses to counter a rising  already this year , japan crossed a littlenoted threshold by providing its first military aid abroad since the end of , approving a 2 million package for its military engineers to train troops in cambodia and east timor in disaster relief and skills like road building japanese warships have not only conducted joint exercises with a growing number of military forces in the pacific and asia , but they have also begun making regular port visits to countries long fearful of a resurgence of japan s military and after stepping up civilian aid programs to train and equip the coast guards of other nations , japanese defense officials and analysts say , japan could soon reach another milestone beginning sales in the region of military hardware like seaplanes , and perhaps eventually the stealthy dieselpowered submarines considered well suited to the shallow waters where china is making increasingly assertive territorial claims taken together those steps , while modest , represent a significant shift for japan , which had resisted repeated calls from the united states to become a true regional power for fear that doing so would move it too far from its postwar pacifism the country s quiet resolve to edge past that reluctance and become more of a player comes as the united states and china are staking their own claims to power in asia , and as jitters over china s ambitions appear to be softening bitterness toward japan among some southeast asian countries trampled last century in its quest for colonial domination the driver for japan s shifting national security strategy is its tense dispute with china over uninhabited islands in the east china sea that is feeding japanese anxiety that the country s relative decline and the financial struggles of its traditional protector , the united states are leaving japan increasingly vulnerable during the cold war , all japan had to do was follow the us , said keiro kitagami , a special adviser on security issues to prime minister yoshihiko noda with china , it s different japan has to take a stand on its own japan s moves do not mean it might transform its military , which serves a purely defensive role , into an offensive force anytime soon the public has resisted past efforts by some politicians to revamp japan s pacifist constitution , and the nation s vast debt will limit how much military aid it can extend but it is also clear that attitudes in japan are evolving as china continues its doubledigit annual growth in military spending and asserts that it should be in charge of the islands that japan claims , as well as vast swaths of the south china sea that various southeast asian nations say are in their control japanese leaders have met the chinese challenge over the islands known as the senkaku in japan and the diaoyu in china with an uncharacteristic willingness to push back , and polls show the public increasingly agrees both major political parties are also talking openly about instituting a more flexible reading of the constitution that would allow japan to come to the defense of allies shooting down any north korean missile headed for the united states , for instance blurring the line between an offensive and defensive force the country s selfdefense forces had already begun nosing over that line in iraq and afghanistan , where japan backed the united statesled campaigns by deploying naval tankers to refuel warships in the indian ocean japanese officials say their strategy is not to begin a race for influence with china , but to build up ties with other nations that share worries about their imposing neighbor they acknowledge that even building the capacity of other nations' coast guards is a way of strengthening those countries' ability to stand up to any chinese threat we want to build our own coalition of the willing in asia to prevent china from just running over us , said yoshihide soeya , director of the institute of east asian studies at keio university in tokyo or , as the vice minister of defense , akihisa nagashima , said in an interview , we cannot just allow japan to go into quiet decline the united states has generally welcomed such efforts by japan , which are in line with its own strategy of building up asian nations militarily so they can stand their ground against china , as well as expanding an american military presence in the region china , which itself suffered mightily in imperial japan s 20thcentury territorial grabs , has reacted with warnings that japan is trying to overturn the outcome of world war ii by staging a military comeback at a defense conference in australia last month , lt gen ren haiquan of china warned his hosts against allying more closely with what he called a fascist nation that once bombed the australian city of darwin in a measure of the geopolitical changes roiling the region , however , concerns about any resurgent japanese militarism appear to be fading in some countries embroiled in their own territorial disputes with china , like vietnam and the philippines , the scene of fierce fighting during the war analysts there and elsewhere in the region said their countries welcomed , and sometimes invited , japan s help we have already put aside our nightmares of world war ii because of the threat posed by china , said rommel banlaoi , a security expert at the philippine institute for peace , violence and terrorism research in manila on a recent morning , 22 coast guard officials from a dozen asian and african nations joined a training cruise around tokyo bay aboard a sleek , white japanese coast guard cutter the visitors snapped photos of the engine room , the electronicsstudded bridge and the 20millimeter cannon before the cutter left port , the foreign contingent and the japanese crew stood at attention on deck facing each other , then bowed deeply japan is joining the united states and australia in helping us face china , said mark lim , an administrative officer from the philippine coast guard who joined the cruise japan is widely viewed as being the only nation in the region with a navy powerful enough to check china although japan s military spending has been shrinking , the military budget is , by many measures , the sixth largest in the world in keeping with its pacifist stance , japan has none of the longrange missiles , nuclear submarines or large aircraft carriers necessary for projecting real power but its dieselpowered subs are considered the best of their type in the world the japanese navy also has sophisticated aegisequipped cruisers capable of shooting down ballistic missiles , and two large helicoptercarrying destroyers that could be retrofitted to carry fighter jets that can take off vertically the japanese navy took a big step toward opening up in 2009 by holding a joint military drill with australia its first such exercise with a nation besides the united states it has since joined a number of multinational naval drills in southeast asia , and in june held its first joint maneuver with india analysts and former officials say japan s military has so far been careful to offer assistance in noncombatrelated areas like disaster relief , antipiracy and health care but even these limited steps build ties between military forces one plan now under negotiation is to train medical personnel from vietnam s navy next year to care for the crews on that nation s newly purchased russianbuilt submarines our strategy is to offer hardware and training to create minijapanese coast guards and minijapanese selfdefense forces around the south china sea , said tetsuo kotani , a researcher at the japan institute of international affairs in tokyo under the decadeold civilian aid program to build up regional coast guards , japanese officials say they are in the final stages of what would be their biggest securityrelated aid package yet to provide the philippine coast guard with 10 cutters worth about 12 million each ministry officials say they may offer similar ships to vietnam japan s ministry of defense said it planned to double its military aid program next year to help indonesia and vietnam vietnam could also be among the countries that japan would allow to buy its submarines , according to a former defense minister , toshimi kitazawa , who named australia and malaysia as other possible buyers japan has been insensitive to the security needs of its regional neighbors , mr kitazawa said in a recent interview we can offer much to increase their peace of mind
fayetteville , nc concluding that racial bias played a significant factor in a death sentence here 18 years ago , a judge on friday ordered that it be changed to life in prison without parole , the first such decision under north carolina s controversial  the landmark ruling could be the first of many under the law , which allows future defendants and current death row inmates to present evidence , including statistical patterns , suggesting that race played a major role in their being sentenced to death it is also likely to influence the nation s enduring discussion over capital punishment , particularly with an increasing number of states deciding to repeal the death penalty outright this opinion will profoundly shape any ongoing debate about this , said douglas a berman , a law professor at ohio state university who runs the blog in a weird way , this ruling vindicates critics of racial justice acts , because they tend to say when we start opening up old cases it will be too easy for the defense bar to prove some kind of racial injustice and therefore stop the death penalty altogether nearly all of north carolina s 157 death row inmates have filed claims under the act as both the defendant , marcus reymond robinson , and relatives of the man he killed sat motionless and silent , judge gregory a weeks of cumberland county superior court declared his finding that race was a materially , practically and statistically significant factor in the jury selection process not only in mr robinson s trial but in trials across the county and state mr robinson s guilt was not at issue the judge called his crime kidnapping 17yearold erik tornblom , shooting him and stealing his car and 27 in his wallet unspeakably horrendous but a statistical study of racial disparities during jury selection revealed strong enough findings to support a conclusion of intentional discrimination at every level , judge weeks said in his 167page ruling prosecutors said they would appeal the decision the ruling comes as states around the country are reevaluating execution as a means of punishment a week ago , connecticut s legislature the death penalty , the fifth state in five years to do so californians may soon vote on the issue in a referendum a group of current and former federal and state prosecutors for a suspension of the death penalty in kentucky , the only state that has a similar though narrower racial justice act prosecutors in north carolina have strongly opposed the act since its passage in 2009 , arguing that the law is far too broad , that it would be extremely costly and that it is little more than an indirect moratorium on the death penalty this is not about racial justice , said tom keith , a former district attorney in forsyth county the real purpose is to end the death penalty , to make it so complicated and so expensive that they win by attrition supporters of the law disagreed with that reading i do n't think that s true at all , said tye hunter , executive director of north carolina s and one of mr robinson s lawyers what the law does hold , he said , is that we ca n't continue to have a death penalty that depends on discrimination against africanamericans the newly republican state legislature passed a bill that would have significantly limited the scope of the law , but gov bev perdue , a democrat , vetoed it republicans are planning to pass a similar law , possibly this year by coincidence , friday s decision came down two days before the 25th anniversary of the united states supreme court decision , in which the court ruled 5 to 4 that statistical evidence of a significant racial disparity in death sentences in georgia was not sufficient reason to overturn a georgia man s death verdict toward the end of his decision , justice lewis f powell jr said that state legislatures were more qualified to decide how statistics should be used in such cases north carolina s law allows a defendant to argue that race was a significant factor in his death sentence by presenting evidence along any of three lines that a death sentence was more likely to be sought or imposed on defendants of one race , that it was more likely when the victim was a certain race or that racial bias influenced jury selection mr robinson is black and his victim was white a fact that was pointed out in closing arguments by prosecutors , who described mr robinson as racially biased for a violently antiwhite statement he made before the murder but this hearing concerned bias in picking jurors , as opposed to the race of the defendant or the victim there are three other racial justice act claims now being heard , and in one of the cases the inmate is white in the section of the law that has been most hotly disputed , a defendant is allowed to use statistics to prove that bias was a factor in death sentencing in the county where he was tried , or in the district , or even statewide in mr robinson s hearing , by researchers from michigan state university , examined jury selection in at least one proceeding involving every inmate on death row in 2010 , for a total of 173 capital trials the study found that prosecutors used peremptory challenges to remove blacks from juries at a rate more than twice that of whites , a disparity even more pronounced in the trials the researchers examined in cumberland county and in mr robinson s trial in particular the disparity remained significant , the researchers said , even when the study controlled for other variables , like a potential juror s feelings about the death penalty factors such as having previously been accused of a crime or expressing reservations about the death penalty were strong predictors of being struck by the state , the study read , but none could account for the effect of race prosecutors challenged the methodology of the study much of the testimony at the hearing was a debate over statistics but most pointedly they argued that jury selection is a complex discretionary system , with thousands of possible reasons to remove a potential juror kent scheidegger , the legal director of the , criticized the study and judge weeks s ruling in an email , saying that the nuances of picking jurors that cannot be captured so simply a difference in raw numbers between racial groups is not proof of discrimination , he wrote it is not even probable cause for a suspicion of discrimination prosecutors in north carolina made similar arguments , but with a further undercurrent of indignation , as such suspicions are essentially implications of their own work they do not have some secret society of prosecutors maniacally plotting to remove people from juries , rob thompson , an assistant district attorney in cumberland county , said in his closing arguments they do not have any of that because there is no such evidence it does n't exist they have numbers but robert p mosteller , a professor at university of north carolina law school , said it would be wrong to simply dismiss the idea of racial bias in jury selection after a decision finding evidence of intentional discrimination on so many levels if anything , he said , judge weeks s decision should prompt similar largescale studies in other states it s illegal and people do it , professor mosteller said it s wrong and he found it
opponents of the relocation of the barnes foundation and its worldrenowned art collection from a philadelphia suburb to a downtown museum quarter have asked a pennsylvania court to reopen the case allowing the relocation , citing a comment made by the foundation s former director , the philadelphia inquirer reported  the 2004 ruling by stanley r ott of the montgomery county orphans court permitted the foundation , which had struggled financially , to go against the wishes of albert c barnes , who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent , sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in merion , pa judge ott said at the time that he considered the move the only viable alternative to save the barnes from bankruptcy , but opponents argued that the foundation s troubles had been overstated in a new petition to the court on monday , the friends of the barnes , which opposes the move , said the case should be reopened because the court was given inaccurate information about the foundation s financial health when it made its decision the group cited a recent blog post by kimberly camp , the barnes s president and chief executive officer from 1998 to 2005 bankruptcy was not the reason we filed the petition to move the foundation to the city , ms camp wrote at the time the petition was filed , the barnes foundation had a cash surplus and we had no debt none but , saying so made the rescue so much more gallant ralph wellington , the foundation s lawyer , told the inquirer that everything ms camp and other barnes officials said in court at the time of the original decision was completely true and accurate the barnes had no debt only because of stopgap financing provided by several charitable foundations to keep it solvent , mr wellington said , and the cash surplus it had could not be used for operations all of the financials were completely public and in the record , he added the barnes opened to the public in its new home , designed by tod williams billie tsien architects , in may
in the summer of 1995 , six foreign tourists were kidnapped in a meadow in kashmir by a group calling itself al faran one , an american , escaped a second , a norwegian , was found with his head severed from his body the other four have never been found , despite a massive crossborder effort involving politicians and intelligence bureaus from the united states , britain , germany and india rather than working for the hostages release , the indian government , indian intelligence agencies and indian military prolonged their capture and sabotaged negotiations with the kidnappers , a new nonfiction book called the meadow alleges indian officials actions were part of a larger plan to present pakistan , and the pakistanbacked insurgency in kashmir , in as harsh a light as possible to the world at large , the book says ultimately , the men were killed by a second group , funded and controlled by the indian government , the book alleges the book is based on years of research and hundreds of interviews by authors adrian levy and cathy scottclark , who worked in south asia during the kidnappings and for many years after it uses a combination of named and unnamed sources , journals and official files and transcripts to build its case all the time new delhi said it was trying to crack al faran , a group within intelligence and the stf \( special task force , an indian police division \) was letting them dangle , happy to let the militants portray themselves as savage criminals , one police detective who worked on the case tells the authors a spokeswoman for india s ministry of home affairs , which oversees india s intelligence bureaus , said there was no way that the ministry could comment without reading the book an email with specific questions about the book s premise was sent to the home ministry earlier this week , and the spokeswoman said a response could be expected after april 17 the book contains blowbyblow descriptions of the negotiations for the hostages release between an inspector and the kidnappers , which seemed to be nearly completed several times , only to be blown apart when the agreed terms of the negotiations were leaked to newspapers , including the hindustan times , infuriating the kidnappers at times when the indian government claimed the kidnappers and their hostages were untraceable , the book said , they were being watched and photographed by an indian army helicopter despite a government precedent of releasing prisoners in exchange for kidnapping victims , in this instance officials refused masood azhar , a pakistani cleric jailed in india whose release was the kidnappers top demand , was let go by indian officials four years afterward , after an indian airlines plane was hijacked to afghanistan a member of the crime branch team who worked on the case describes the dawning realization that their desire to solve the crime was at odds with the goals of some senior figures in the military and the intelligence services , who could have saved the hostages but chose not to the book points fingers at the central government right from the beginning the strings were being pulled from new delhi , said altaf ahmed , a police security official who worked with the security adviser to the government of kashmir those of us dealing with the hostagetaking on the ground in srinigar were not in control india s top officials aren t the only ones the meadow lays blame on woven into the nearly 500page book are a number of blunders and miscalculations allegedly made by indian and foreign officials the area in kashmir was not cleared of backpackers after the first kidnappings because of a religious pilgrimage in the area a woman s sighting of german dirk hasert s kidnapping was not reported immediately because the indian army officer the woman approached sexually assaulted her and the army was trying to hush that assault up instead of allowing escaped hostage john childs to lead police to the kidnappers , as he wanted to , american officials whisked him out of the country on christmas eve , 1995 , the four remaining hostages were walked into heavy , deep snow behind the lower village of mati gawran , shot and buried , an eyewitness to the killings said , the book reports there was only one end for them , and we all knew it , he said no one could risk the hostages being released and complaining of collusion , having seen uniforms and stf jeeps , he said \( stf is the special task force of police in kashmir \) arun joshi , a reporter with the hindustan times and who covered the story at the time , has also not read the book but expressed skepticism about its claims personally i don t think it correct , i was there , i followed the story when it happened , he said in a telephone interview the story was not mysteriously leaked by intelligence to the hindustan times , mr joshi said instead , he said , he pried some details out of the inspector conducting the negotiations when the official was completely drunk the 1995 kidnappings quickly snuffed an already waning flow of foreign tourists to kashmir , once a popular destination in recent years , after years of violence , tourists have tentatively started to return , mostly from india the book s claims echo some of the darkest fears brewing in the international intelligence community after the hostages , or their bodies , failed to surface month after month almost a year after they were taken , the fate of the hostages was still uncertain , despite diplomatic appeals and secret military operations from the united states , united kingdom and germany , the new york times reported so far none of these efforts have come close to ending the drama , whose ambiguities and illusions and hopes deceived have baffled a succession of antiterrorism experts sent by the federal bureau of investigation and by scotland yard , john f burns wrote from kashmir in may of 1996 he writes nobody can even be sure whether the kidnappers , who call themselves al faran , are real insurgents or , as many better known kashmiri guerrillas assert , are indianbacked renegades who have set out to discredit the entire movement there are many bizarre things about this entire business , a senior diplomat said but the diplomat added that india , while gaining politically from the bruising that the hostagetaking had given to the image of pakistan and to the insurgents , had nonetheless dealt honestly in attempts to free the men still , the diplomat added , there are crosscurrents here that have troubled us deeply
the olympic roster for the us men s basketball team currently in something of an infant state has already been plagued by injury star center dwight howard had surgery to address a herniated disk in his back , and will be unavailable for the summer games just days ago , we saw derrick rose s gold medal aspirations mirror his crumpled form on the hardwood floor downed and folded due to a torn acl roster hopefuls lamarcus aldridge \( labral tear \) and chauncey billups \( torn achilles \) also underwent surgery to deal with their respective ailments , cutting team usa s 20man roster down to just 16 available players as such , after various reports had linked talented young players from across the nba to team usa \( including sacramento s demarcus cousins , detroit s greg monroe , washington s john wall , and cleveland s kyrie irving \) , program director jerry colangelo announced on friday that oklahoma city s james harden and outgoing kentucky wildcat wunderkind anthony davis will be officially added to the full roster of olympic team finalists that said , such additions hardly seem like anything more than token replacements for training camp s sake as talented and productive as davis and company are , we have every reason to believe that the final 12man roster will be comprised of players from usa basketball s remaining 16 an elite grouping of program mainstays with international basketball experience and altogether superior nba r sum s here are a few factors to consider as usa basketball makes its various injury replacements , and ultimately decides its final roster forget positions  the collective understanding of basketball relies on the notion that there are five stable positions , and yet over the past halfdecade , team usa has proven to be one of the more intriguing grounds for positional innovation years before carmelo anthony was moved to power forward for the new york knicks , he was playing that same position for team usa while jason kidd was the nominal point guard in 2007 and 2008 , lebron james was the team s functional playmaker in 2010 , kevin durant brought the ball up the court , operated from the wing , and defended opposing bigs over the course of a single minute if the general trajectory of the sport at large hasn t done so already , the talent and versatility on usa s roster renders traditional positions obsolete there s still a need for players capable of performing certain tasks , defending particular opponents , and operating from specific spaces on the floor , but the positions as we know them are so bungled on this roster as to lose any remote relevance it s highly likely that players like james , anthony , and durant will slide all around the court depending on the team s specific aims , regardless of the fact that all three of those players are typically considered small forwards missing the point derrick rose was set to be a huge part of team usa s gold medal defense , but the basketball gods clearly had other designs that said , in light of this team s aforementioned positional flexibility , don t think for a moment that rose s otherwise guaranteed roster spot should be filled with another point guard chris paul , deron williams , and russell westbrook look like virtual locks to make the final team as it is , and if we also include lebron james and dwyane wade among the likely ballhandlers , team usa should be sufficiently loaded with talented playmakers to initiate their offense instead , rose s slot makes more sense for a utility player of some type , and andre iguodala would make for a fine choice iguodala seemed likely to be nudged out of the final 12 due to a numbers game of elite players , but in rose s absence , his impeccable defensive work could be a welcome addition on a team with ample use for prevention and disruption  how essential is size \?  team usa s biggest competition in the 2012 olympic games is a familiar foe the spanish national team that earned silver medal honors both at the 2010 fiba world championships and the 2008 games in beijing spain is built around the strength of nba fixtures pau and marc gasol , and with the relatively recent addition of oklahoma city thunder big man serge ibaka , they boast both impressive size and a committed interior focus colangelo and usa head coach mike krzyzewski would be wise to keep that particular opponent in mind as they go about constructing their own roster , but it s also important to consider the more specific implications of size and skill as they relate to this particular pool of players beyond tyson chandler a sure inclusion based on his defensive success for team usa in 2010 team usa lacks the traditional center options to contend with spain s big men in a conventional manner but lest we forget in both 2008 and 2010 , it was team usa s collective , swarming defense that allowed the americans while at times undersized to take the gold onball post defense is obviously important considering the gasol brothers savvy on the block , but the urge to add more height doesn t necessarily suit the best interests of this uniquely functioning team flexibility and mobility are at a premium with this kind of roster , and although there are some talented big men being considered for both the finalist pool and the usa select team \( the pipelined group of alternates , if you will \) , none boast both the strength and defensive acumen necessary for them to be considered particularly compelling candidates the international game is physical and the gasols are skilled if usa is to bring along an additional center for the sole sake of defending that pair , they had better be an ideal counter otherwise , that roster spot would be better used on the likes of mobile , multipurpose bigs like kevin love or chris bosh
miami deron williams had ice strapped to both knees , his left thigh and his right wrist , none of which ached as much as his battered selfesteem ' offense had disintegrated late saturday night in to the miami heat , and williams , their allstar point guard , had been helpless to stop it shots failed , passes went awry and williams was left to ponder once more how to put his game back together it s not my wrist , man , it s my confidence , williams said in a reflective moment , after finishing with 10 points and a 3for11 shooting performance i just got to play better injuries or not , i got to play i ca n't keep having 10 points , not being aggressive i just got to find a rhythm it s just tough the transformed , transplanted nets have much to be proud of after a month of games under the brooklyn banner they set a franchise record with 11 wins in their first 15 games they took down three top teams the knicks , the boston celtics and the los angeles clippers along the way they are most certainly ahead of schedule as a rising force in the eastern conference but saturday s defeat was a notsogentle reminder of the work that remains to join the nba elite , and of a simple truth the nets will only go as far as williams can take them so far , even a bangedup , slightlyoutofrhythm williams has been enough he has had seven games with at least 10 assists , including a masterful 14assist performance in the nets' overtime victory over the knicks last week he has been a steady , poised leader throughout this young season , on good nights and bad yet williams is shooting 382 percent from the field and 268 from 3point range the worst percentages in his eightyear career his scoring average , 154 points per game , is the lowest since his rookie season he has converted at least half of his shots in only two games , the last time on nov 13 the nets can , and have , won a lot of games without williams s scoring touch but the early trends are troubling for a star who has visions of leading his team deep into the spring i definitely need to play better for us to make that jump , williams said we can be a great team you 've seen us we won five straight , and i have n't shot the ball well and we 've had some good wins the source of williams s struggles is somewhat elusive , but injuries including a bangedup right \( shooting \) wrist and sore right elbow have surely played a role he also has a leftankle injury that will probably require surgery next summer williams said it is not the bumps and bruises , but his general comfort level , that is to blame he is still recalibrating his game to a revamped lineup that includes two other potent scorers , joe johnson and brook lopez , and an entirely new cast of bench players coach avery johnson wants lopez involved early and often , and the nets are also working to get johnson untracked williams s own game has been a lesser priority i 've definitely been turning down some shots , to get other guys shots , williams said but i just have n't found a rhythm in this offense yet i have n't found where i'm going to get my shots from consistently i'm not a guy that likes to go oneonone every play so it s been difficult he added , i feel like i'm letting my team down i feel like i'm not doing enough to help us win the heat disrupted williams in the second half saturday by blitzing the pickandroll , his goto play , leading to a flurry of turnovers , missed shots and heavy sighs they 're just taking a lot of stuff away from me , he said afterward the hope was that johnson , who was acquired in a july trade , would relieve williams of some of the ballhandling and scoring burdens so far , the nets' allstar guards have struggled to find the right balance johnson is also having one of his worst shooting seasons \( 409 \) , although he has been much better over the last six games , making 42 of 87 shots \( 483 \) we 're still trying to figure this thing out , man , johnson said how we can get him going , get him in a rhythm we just have to learn on the fly jerry stackhouse , the nets' elder statesman , said williams might have to settle some nights for being the bait guy , drawing in defenses while others carry the load it all starts with his greatness , being able to create all that , stackhouse said once he accepts that and understands that , we go to another level the good news it is still early , and the nets are 115 , despite the shooting woes of their backcourt , despite playing seven games without gerald wallace and despite playing the last two without lopez wallace missed the nets' first loss to the heat , a 30point rout lopez was out saturday , when the nets blew a 14point lead to the defending champions afterward , a defiant wallace refused to acknowledge any gap between the teams because of a scheduling quirk , the nets will only get one more chance to test the premise , when the heat visit brooklyn on jan 30 in the meantime , the fatigued nets are looking forward to a light week three games in the next eight days and a chance to heal i need this rest as much as anybody , williams said before unstrapping his ice bags
andy benoit , a regular contributor of film analysis to the fifth down , takes a look at ninerssaints , broncospatriots and ravenstexans the most impressive thing about alex smith s gamewinning \( and imagechanging \) touchdown strike to vernon davis on saturday was that smith passed up an easy dumpoff completion to a wideopen justin peelle on the play instead of hitting peelle and playing for the tie , smith trusted his arm and his top target and lasered the ball through a tight window for the win the niners wound up beating the saints at their own game san francisco never actually established the run frank gore had just 13 carries , none of them dynamic save for his 42yarder late smith threw 42 times , finishing with 299 yards and 3 touchdowns his lategame heroics overshadowed the fact that he and his offensive line actually struggled to recognize many of new orleans s safety blitzes throughout the afternoon of course , you can t construct a sentence that includes the words struggled and new orleans s safety without mentioning the beating vernon davis put on the man coverage of malcolm jenkins and roman harper davis s catches of 49 , 20 , 37 and 47 yards against the unit that led the league this season in 40yard completions allowed were the difference in the game also making a difference were the saints turnovers true , the saints had a minusfour turnover differential when jimmy graham scored a goahead touchdown with 1 37 to play but new orleans s five total turnovers don t just represent field position swings and easy points for san francisco they also represent lost opportunities for scoring drives from those turnovers the saints weathered the 49ers storm but in the process they robbed themselves of a chance at creating their own storm or , perhaps more accurately , the 49ers prevented the saints from creating a storm we tend to think of turnovers as miscues by the offense but often , they re great plays by the defense that was the case with dashon goldson s interception \( fantastic range and route recognition by the free safety he outsmarted drew brees on that play \) , tarell brown s interception \( nice ball skills downfield \) and the pierre thomas fumble \( caused by one of donte whitner s many thundering hits \) the 49ers led the league in forced turnovers this season that has taken them all the way to the nfc championship game patriots 45 , broncos 10 over the years , tom brady has proved scores of doubters wrong , has motivated teammates , has said all the right things and has won against all odds but because his blessings also include arm strength , precision accuracy and the ability to read coverages and his name isn t tim tebow many newcomers to the game find nothing inspiring about the guy brady threw for 363 yards , his first 300yard postseason game since 2005 it would have been a 500yard game if denver s stagnant offense hadn t kept giving new england the ball near midfield masterful as the patriots offense was , it was the defense s performance that really had jaws dropping true , the broncos did not pose a serious threat to what was one of the league s worst units during the regular season but to force an opponent into 14 negative plays \? outstanding no defense has looked better coached from start to finish of a game this season gashed on the ground in the first meeting , the patriot front seven set the edge outside with aplomb \( especially rob ninkovich , who shined bright after floundering in week 15 \) and bottled up the broncos running lanes and option players inside \( jerod mayo and brandon spikes were monsters \) after devin mccourty was picked on mercilessly down the stretch , the patriots wisely moved him from corner to safety on passing downs for this game that created a personnel upgrade at two positions , as sergio brown at this point is superior to mccourty in cornerback coverage , and mccourty is superior to whichever wide receiver the patriots might have thought about using at free safety the return of base free safety nickel strong safety patrick chung also helped now the patriots are essentially at full strength and hosting the afc title game , while the broncos and their young quarterback can finally get started on that super exciting offseason we ve heard so much about snarky as some of us analysts have been regarding tebow \( yours truly included \) , we do owe him a world of thanks his personality and validating performance against the steelers have brought legions of new fans to the table , which is great for the game ravens 20 , texans 13 hey , a win s a win the ravens will take it but they re somewhat fortunate to get it yes , their defense gave up only 13 points and intercepted tj yates three times \( and it could have been more ed reed had two drops and ray lewis had one \) but the ravens offense only scored its two touchdowns because of the jacoby jones muffed punt return and lardarius webb s interception at houston s 34yardline given that the ravens did not get any passrush pressure on yates and gave up a genuine 132 yards rushing to arian foster , you could argue that theirs was actually the secondbest defense on the field sunday joe flacco proved prophetic we in the news media indeed aren t giving him any credit for this victory that s what a 52 percent completion rate , 65 yards per attempt and five sacks will do for a quarterback flacco needs to get better in the presnap phase too often he failed to recognize houston s passrush or blitz concepts , which was reflected in his poor pocket movement what s also concerning is how easily the ravens passing game can lose its rhythm whenever a quality corner in this case johnathan joseph eliminates speedy wideout torrey smith that actually hasn t been hard to do this season , as smith , though explosive , is still very raw the ravens will chalk up this kind of critical analysis to getting no respect and having naysayers and doubters and whatever other clich s supposedly motivate professional athletes these days that s fine , as this week they ll also scramble to correct the problems we ve talked about in the end , the ravens won with forced turnovers , which is what general manager ozzie newsome built this team to do the question is whether the defense can continue to make enough big plays to compensate for the team s flaws andy benoit and founder of nfltouchdowncom he can be reached at andybenoit nfltouchdowncom or
ciudad ju rez , mexico returning to the soccer stadium here , i feel like an archaeologist on a dig fine brown sand dusts the stadium s concrete steps and concourses pigeons roost in the rafters , pollocking plastic bucket seats that spell out indios , the name of the team that no longer plays here , that no longer even exists worshiped in their time , the indios lie dead , entombed in mexican memories like moctezuma himself on an early spring afternoon , a torn advertising banner flaps in the wind a rectangle of grass sits netless and unlined , the groundskeeper let go when the team folded in december i climb up to benito ju rez olympic stadium s one luxury box , my sneakers slipping in the dust the door to the box is unlocked , and the room has been looted gone is the cooler that chilled beers and sodas on game days no glassware remains in the bar everything of value has been hustled away or almost everything on one wall still hangs an artifact of some importance it is a framed photograph of tom s campos , an indios defender i got to know during the season i followed the team in the photograph , campos lifts over his head a silver trophy that indicates the indios had just won a spot in the primera , mexico s major soccer league i know that the photograph was taken in 2008 , after a championship game in le n and that the trophy ceremony was the start of the indios' unlikely moment in the sun the improbable miracle run may be the dominant story line in sports the underdog who wins , the mutt who knocks a pedigreed athlete off the podium there was butler coming within a rim shot of a national basketball championship of course there was the united states olympic hockey team icing the russians in lake placid , ny here on the border with el paso , it was a squad of castoffs and career minor leaguers who climbed into the top echelon of mexican soccer as its city was descending into horrific violence on the day campos lifted that trophy in le n , thousands of fans in ju rez spilled into the streets to celebrate their team s triumph , defying a warning to stay indoors issued by one of the drug cartels fighting for control of the city , a strategic port of entry into the lucrative united states market the indios' miracle run captivated much of the world espn publicized it , as did and television outlets in the united states , england , spain , argentina and asia this plucky soccer team , it was reported , gave hope to a depressed city , which is another story line common in sports think of the new orleans saints winning the 2010 after or japan winning the women s world cup last year soon after the tsunami in 2008 , the year the indios joined the primera , 1 , 600 people were murdered in ju rez the next year , the death toll rose to 2 , 700 , out of a remaining population of maybe a million indios was the only positive thing about the city , said the former goalie alonzo jim nez , a ju rez native indios brought families together , put a smile on many people s faces and made them forget about their problems even though it was only 90 minutes a week by the time i moved here , the indios were no longer quite so positive , or at least they were no longer a cinderella story the team was seriously struggling at the top level and appeared doomed to descend back to the minor leagues from which it had so gloriously escaped i embedded with the indios for the spring season of 2010 , which turned out to be their last in the primera as i followed every home game and practice , and as i traveled with the players to games in guadalajara , canc n , puebla and san luis potos , i watched the team lose and lose ultimately the indios streaked to 29 games without a win , making them officially the worst team ever to play in the primera at first , i was bummed by all the failure can you guys please get back to your miraculous ways \? but as i learned more about ju rez , i recognized in the indios' struggles a metaphor for the city at large things were bad on the border and getting worse i found two dead bodies in the drivethrough lane of a convenience store a decapitated torso hung from a fence near my local burrito joint as many as 25 juarenses were being murdered in a single night that year , according to government statistics , the body count topped out at 3 , 951 dead i moved back to the united states after a car bomb exploded way too close to a bar where i was watching a game on television the indios accepted assignment back in the minors everybody in ju rez identified with the team , said ram n morales , the former head of the indios' press office even when they were losing , the indios got up early and worked hard , which is what we do in ju rez the club represented all of us here who are fighting against the wind to survive the team s collapse continued at the lower level , and it was painful to watch , even from afar i would log online to track dispiriting 00 ties and then a new streak of shutout losses players grumbled to local reporters about not receiving their pay for months the city s murder rate remained sky high in the spring of 2011 when the indios' owner , francisco ibarra , sold the team , something he had told me repeatedly that he would never , ever do the buyers were not identified , though , and it appeared that ibarra was still in charge his name remained on the contracts the players signed , the ones that said they would , eventually , be paid for their labors the final time i saw the indios play in person , in september , it was clear the team was on its last legs , dying in front of my eyes at the stadium , only a handful of fans were scattered among the oncepacked seats on the field , the stillunpaid indios players shuffled listlessly to another 10 defeat in the stands , a few of the aspiring hooligans who call themselves el kartel still sang their songs they drank their beers and played their drums , too , but their enthusiasm seemed forced , and sad before the game , i had visited ibarra at his house in ju rez , where he likes to spend weekends \( he lives in el paso during the week , for his safety \) he took me into his trophy room from a table supporting the silver trophy that tom s campos hoisted , ibarra plucked two medals awarded to the players after the indios qualified for the primera the medals are rare and valuable , bigtime collectibles to a fan of mexican soccer when he handed me the medals , i felt more than a little spooked by his gift i could n't help but think of a college classmate who gave away his stereo and television right before committing suicide three months later , the indios were dead ibarra accused the various governments that oversee ju rez of failing to deliver promised financial support the ministry of finance responded by charging ibarra and two other indios executives with tax evasion and that was that in late december , national soccer officials declared the team insolvent ciudad ju rez s membership in the mexican f tbol federation was rescinded there has not been a professional soccer game in the city since players and coaches scattered like the thousands of juarenses who have fled the killing campos announced his retirement striker maleno fr as , a ju rez native , tried out with the colorado rapids of major league soccer , though he failed to catch on with the club he now plays in an el paso recreational league the head coach when i followed the indios is a bench assistant in guadalajara jim nez , the goalie , has returned to odessa , tex , where he went to high school and where he is hoping to be chosen by an mls team in the june draft even a reporter friend of mine who covered the indios for a ju rez newspaper has moved to nevada , telling me his wife was tired of the violence that violence is not nearly as bad as it used to be the number of murders a day has dropped to around three president felipe calder n has drawn back the thousands of federal police officers and soldiers who made the city look as if it was under siege mayor teto murgu a tells foreign reporters about crowded restaurants and hopping nightclubs driving around the city , i do not feel as threatened as i used to when i stopped by ibarra s house in ju rez , i was not frisked for weapons by a security guard , as i had been in the past i can confirm , via firsthand field research , that people are indeed drinking margaritas in the kentucky club until closing time , at least on weekends in the neighborhood where i usually stay , i see packs of young girls circling the streets on pink bicycles boys kick soccer balls in a dusty park , right out in the open yet it is not as if ju rez is fixed murgu a and his press secretary continue to live in el paso even with the improved murder rate , ju rez remains one of the most deadly cities in the world \( the morbid joke in ju rez is that they have killed so many people in the past five years they are running out of fresh bodies \) there have been 10 , 000 unsolved murders since 2007 , virtually none of which are likely to be investigated with all those ghosts haunting the city , the mayor ca n't simply hit the reset button , claiming all is now well because the city remains violent , the indios' absence hurts all the more vendors in the downtown market come up empty when i ask them to dig around for an indios hat or maybe an old replica jersey i suffer a small gut punch when i see the patches of glue where indios stickers once clung to car bumpers and rear windows even as the indios struggled , we would talk about what the team needed to do to get better , about how long it might take to return to the primera , and daydreaming a bit imagining how sweet it would be when a team from ju rez won the primera championship i can get cynical about sports and about how much supposed good they can do for a city ask me about the miami marlins' multibillionpublicdollar new stadium sometime yet even i will validate the clich when it comes to the indios , that the team was something a troubled city could rally around the indios were undeniably positive it s like there s a hole in our lives , said my friend saul luna , a member of el kartel every 15 days , we 'd get together for a home game that was our thing now we do n't have anything to look forward to i still find a few relics of the indios scattered around town i 'll spy a rutera school bus painted indios red , white and black there s an el kartel slogan painted on a concrete wall along the john paul ii highway , facing texas casa de los indios says a banner still hanging outside the team s old stadium the benito , as it is sometimes called , remains open to the public , and it is still one of my favorite places in the city i like to climb to the top row of seats on the stadium s west end and take in el paso , right across the river in the afternoons , sun glints on the tall buildings of downtown , and beyond them the cinnamon pyramid of franklin mountain my united states cellphone picks up a signal when i'm so close to texas , so i usually make a few calls and check my email today , i lean back against a concrete wall and watch runners from the university take slow laps around the olympic track that circles the field few clouds dot the blue sky the sunshine , as i walk down to the track , feels warm when the indios dropped off the sporting map , attention turned to other teams enjoying their own miracle moments in soccer , for a while , it was lowly levante in spain outplaying real madrid and barcelona to take first place in la liga after that , it was unheralded apoel nicosia advancing to the champions league quarterfinals soon enough , and as always , levante and apoel dropped back to their traditionally low stations in life miracles are rare that s why they are news far less attention is paid to the end of the miracle , to the return to real life with its struggle and failure , to the inglorious striving that defines all but the most rarefied lives there is talk of a new team coming to ju rez the owner of chivas in guadalajara speaks of maybe placing a minor league feeder team here at the benito that would be better than nothing most fans on the border hope for a more local savior , someone who will finance an independent team with a chance to again return ju rez to the primera that is what i'm hoping for , certainly i retain a somewhat irrational conviction that it will happen , just as i choose to believe that maybe , someday , things will truly get better in this city that perhaps , if we 're lucky , if we have faith , we 'll witness another miracle
as in all things , 19thcentury new orleans was a world apart from much of the rest of the south when the civil war began , it had a large population of socalled free men of color , citizens descended from french and spanish men , on the one side , and slave women on the other colonialera slave codes granted them complete equality the hommes de couleur libre could own land , businesses and even slaves they could be educated and serve in the military they created a niche for themselves in the crescent city s multicultural society and became important to louisiana s defense , maintaining their own militia units that served in various indian wars and against the british during the revolutionary war after the united states acquired louisiana in 1803 , the status of the free men of color changed significantly louisiana s constitution of 1812 specifically restricted the right to vote to white men who owned property the free men of color could still own property and serve in the militia , but they were left out of politics , and their status began to decline nonetheless , they once again volunteered to defend their homes during the war of 1812 and bravely fought for andrew jackson at the battle of new orleans a week after civil war erupted in april 1861 , some of new orleans free men of color offered to form military companies to protect the state against the union in an announcement published in the daily picayune , the men declared that they were prepared to defend their homes against any enemy who may come and disturb its tranquillity the daily crescent newspaper declared our free colored men are certainly as much attached to the land of their birth as their white brethren here in louisiana they will fight the black republican with as much determination and gallantry as any body of white men in the service of the confederate states soon afterward , hundreds of free men of color gathered in the street to show their support for the confederacy a regiment known as the native guards was soon formed and mustered into the state militia , but the confederate government refused to accept them into the national army all of the regiment s line officers were of african descent , although gov thomas o moore appointed a white officer to command it popular history clams that many of the native guards were wealthy slave owners who were members of new orleans upper class , but that is not true while a few might have been welltodo and owned slaves , and some certainly were related to prominent citizens , the 1860 census shows that a vast majority were clerks , artisans and skilled laborers lower middle class at the time the black militia disbanded when union forces occupied new orleans in the spring of 1862 after the battle of baton rouge in august , gen benjamin f butler , the union s military governor of louisiana , requested reinforcements to defend new orleans , but none were forthcoming in desperation , butler informed secretary of war edwin m stanton that he planned to raise a regiment of free blacks on sept 27 , 1862 , butler mustered the first regiment of louisiana native guards into union service , making it the first sanctioned regiment of africanamerican troops in the united states army it has generally been assumed that the africanamericans who joined butler s native guards were the same ones who had served earlier in the state militia regiment by the same name butler , in fact , claimed that was the case as a result , historians have questioned the sincerity of the black militiamen who volunteered for confederate service in 1861 their supposed change in loyalty seems to indicate that their offer to fight for the south was made only to protect their economic and social status within the community to not volunteer would make white neighbors suspicious and possibly lead to retaliation some native guards said as much to butler and others military service records , however , call this assumption into question despite butler s claim to the contrary , a vast majority of his native guards were not free men of color but slaves who had made their way into union lines james g hollandsworth jr , a professor at the university of southern mississippi who wrote the definitive study of the native guards , found that only 108 of the 1 , 035 members of the louisiana militia regiment , or about 10 percent , went on to serve in the union s native guards this would seem to indicate that a large number of the black militiamen were indeed sincere in their desire to fight for the south and defend their homes against invasion \( that s very different , of course , from saying that a large number of africanamericans voluntarily served in the rebel army , a claim made by some the men of the first native guard had unique circumstances and motives that should be understood in their specific context , and not extrapolated to the entire black free and enslaved population one extensive study of louisiana s 65 , 000 confederate soldiers identified only 15 who were known to be of african descent \) while most of butler s louisiana native guards were runaway slaves , some were free men with connections to prominent white families during an inspection , the native guards white colonel told another officer sir , the best blood of louisiana is in that regiment ! do you see that tall , slim fellow , third file from the right of the second company \? one of the exgovernors of the state is his father that orderly sergeant in the next company is the son of a man who has been six years in the united states senate just beyond him is the grandson of judge and all through the ranks you will find the same state of facts their fathers are disloyal but these black ishmaels will more than compensate for their treason by fighting it in the field later , the second and third regiments of native guards , likewise made up overwhelmingly of former slaves , were mustered into service in july 1863 , the three regiments were brigaded together in what became known as the corps d afrique all three regiments had white colonels , but the line officers in the first and second regiments were black , while the third regiment had both black and white officers these louisianians were the only black officers in the union army , but their racist superiors eventually purged most of them to weed out incompetence , all officers in the army had to pass an oral examination given by a board of experienced officers those who failed either resigned or were stripped of their commissions army examiners routinely failed black officers or harassed them to make them resign their commissions by war s end only two africanamerican officers remained on duty in the entire army , and both were with the louisiana native guards like all africanamerican soldiers who served in the civil war , the native guards suffered from blatant discrimination not only were they paid less than white soldiers , they were also issued inferior arms and rations , and white soldiers often insulted and harassed them despite their poor treatment , the men served well , and they became the first black soldiers to see combat in a major battle when the first and third regiments attacked the confederate defenses at port hudson , la , on may 27 , 1863 most of the men fought bravely in their baptism of fire , and the native guards suffered 169 casualties in the attack afterward , the bodies of the dead were left to rot between the lines why that happened is a matter of dispute in her book this republic of suffering , the harvard historian drew gilpin faust claims that confederate sharpshooters prevented union soldiers from retrieving the native guards dead during a truce that was arranged for that purpose the next day on the other hand , the historian lawrence lee hewitt , from southeastern louisiana university , and the late arthur w bergeron jr , the former manager and curator of port hudson state commemorative area , wrote in their book louisianians in the civil war that the union soldiers inexplicably failed to collect their dead on that part of the field the stench of decaying bodies became so great that the confederates finally requested permission from union gen nathaniel p banks to bury the dead native guards themselves according to hewitt and bergeron , banks refused , claiming that he had no dead in that area northern newspapers and magazines wrote extensively about the black soldiers bravery at port hudson , although they greatly exaggerated their success a harper s weekly illustration showed the native guards mounting the rebel breastworks and engaging in handtohand combat but in fact , none of the black soldiers got anywhere near the confederate position , and their entire attack may have lasted only 15 minutes in contrast to the native guards heavy casualties , the confederates who turned back their assault did not lose a single soldier rather , the most significant contribution the native guards made at port hudson was demonstrating to their white comrades and superiors that africanamericans would fight as well as white soldiers in the days following the doomed attack , many officers and men made note of the native guards bravery and heavy losses general banks told his wife , they fought splendidly ! col benjamin h grierson wrote , there can be no question about the good fighting quality of negroes , hereafter , that question was settled beyond a doubt yesterday largely because of the native guards service at port hudson , union officers began recruiting africanamericans for combat roles the three native guards regiments went on to further glory in the war after serving in the 1864 red river campaign , they were redesignated the 73rd , 74th and 75th united states colored infantry when the union army attacked and captured fort blakely , ala , in april 1865 , it was the native guards who led the charge afterward , one union

the opponent was a highflying crew known for airborne pyrotechnics , rimbending dunks and a cute nickname , none of which were likely to match friday night their response was decidedly basic , wholly unspectacular and fantastically effective the nets were never going to beat the in highlights , so they simply wore them down with persistent , annoying defense , patient offense and a long , steady stream of brook lopez baskets the night ended with a standing ovation , a booming chorus of brooooklyn chants and an 8676 victory , easily the nets' biggest win of this young season the clippers \( 84 \) arrived as one of the top teams in the west , with one of the most potent offenses in the nba the nets \( 74 \) held them to season lows in points and fieldgoal percentage \( 403 \) , while holding blake griffin and chris paul \( 14 points each \) in check it was impressive , lopez said i was talking to marshon on the bench i was like , man , we 're just getting stop after stop , he added , referring to marshon brooks lopez led the way , scoring 26 points on a variety of jump shots and timely drives to the basket he dunked five times , more than griffin and deandre jordan combined he also blocked three shots as the nets robbed the clippers of their lob city persona brook was a monster tonight , said deron williams , who had 11 points and 8 assists while dueling paul , his longtime friend and rival the only highlightworthy play from griffin was his firstquarter block of williams s dunk attempt the victory ended the nets' twogame losing streak and provided a nice start to this threegame homestand , which culminates monday night with their first game against the knicks the nets momentarily solved some nagging issues friday joe johnson scored 19 points and snapped out of his shooting slump , making 8 for 12 shots , including a key 3pointer in the fourth quarter the nets also shook off their habitual thirdquarter blues and played one of their best second halves of the season , outscoring the clippers , 4629 they closed the game on a 122 run i thought our guys , they were locked in from start to finish , coach avery johnson said it took some serious tweaks to the rotation johnson rode his starters deeper into the third quarter to keep the momentum going he used keith bogans and jerry stackhouse , his two oldest players , for a combined 21 minutes to strengthen the defense he benched brooks , the onetime sixth man , for the entire game he played his reserves for a long stretch of the fourth , keeping his starters fresh for the final minutes and he played reggie evans , the indefatigable reserve forward , for 22 minutes , using him instead of kris humphries for the final 6 minutes 42 seconds bogans and gerald wallace effectively contained jamal crawford \( 13 points \) , the league s premier sixth man , who had been averaging 20 points evans , a former clipper , kept a body , a forearm and anything else available on jordan and griffin he finished with 12 rebounds and 6 points , but his contributions were so much greater than the box score revealed the sellout crowd of 17 , 732 saw it , however , and rewarded him with chants of reggie evans in the fourth quarter that just shows that they appreciate bluecollar players , appreciate hard work , evans said and sometimes you do n't have to be the scorer or the franchise player to get that from a crowd the arena was as energized as it has been in this inaugural season in brooklyn it was also one of the more starstudded crowds , with jayz , beyonc , kelly rowland , ray romano and the longtime clipper fan billy crystal in the stands the nets pulled away late in the fourth , when lopez scored twice in 30 seconds , on a driving layup and a tough fadeaway jumper from the baseline joe johnson followed with a 3pointer from the corner \( on a feed from evans \) , and broooklyn chants filled the air paul had a strange night , fouling out with 513 seconds left after committing all six of his fouls in the fourth quarter that was crazy , huh \? paul said i have not been called for that many fouls unless it was a video game he added , in a comment that could draw a fine the last two fouls were clear fouls , but that was n't good officiating rebounds if reggie evans had any thoughts on being fined 5 , 000 for flopping , he was in no mood to share them he responded to questions friday with a series of non sequiturs about the clippers , his former team shoot , just getting ready for the clippers , man , evans said the first time asked about the fine again , evans said , man , you know what , it s going to be so fun playing against my old teammates asked if he was worried about the league s crackdown which could include a suspension after five infractions evans said , why should i be worried about playing against my former team \? avery johnson did hint at some concern , however i think we 'll have another conversation if there s a warning or another fine , he said
east rutherford , nj before practice wednesday , coach addressed an occasional reality in the nfl what happens when one unit of a team may just be a lot better than the other \? ryan is aware of the team s widening division his hope is that eventually it will develop a balance but the jets' reality after three preseason games is that their fate would appear to rest heavily on the ability of their sluggish offense to rise to the performance level of the defense there was some expectation that the jets' third preseason game against the on sunday , in which the starters were set to play the bulk of the time , would reveal some previously cloaked offensive identity , after two ugly showings that had yet to produce a touchdown instead , the action in the jets' 1712 loss played out in a familiar fashion a lot of settling , a lack of touchdowns and plenty of boos for a scoring unit that cannot seem to find a way to produce touchdowns there s work to be done , clearly , ryan said of being ready for week 1 i really think we 're going to get this thing turned by then obviously we have to the jets' firstteam defense held up its end , forcing three fumbles \( recovering one \) , recording two sacks , intercepting a pass and largely containing cam newton , the panthers' mobile quarterback but the offense was held out of the end zone for a third time the jets' best scoring opportunity in the first half came as a result of a fumble by newton , who was sacked and stripped by the rookie defensive end quinton coples bart scott recovered the ball on the panthers' 12yard line then the offense took over and did nothing but add 3 points with a field goal you want to knock that thing in there , ryan said without question , you want to find ways to score so it goes for a refurbished unit led by a new offensive coordinator , tony sparano , whose system so far has provided ample opportunities for the kickers but nothing truly worth celebrating sanchez played sufficiently , connecting on several deep passes and finishing 11 of 18 for 123 yards he threw an interception , but the pass was a strike to receiver stephen hill that slipped through his hands and was caught and returned 16 yards by panthers cornerback captain munnerlyn to the jets' 31yard line that set carolina up for its first touchdown , on a 3yard pass from newton to louis murphy that was me trying to run before the catch , hill said the jets began their first drive with 20yard completions to tight end dustin keller and receiver patrick turner , lending some promise that this might be the night the offense finally let loose but the momentum quickly stalled three minimal gains later , the jets settled for a 46yard field goal by nick folk on the second drive , sanchez was sacked by linebacker thomas davis on third down , the 13th sack the team had allowed in the preseason during the week , the jets attempted to mend one of their most glaring problems , replacing the maligned right tackle wayne hunter with the younger austin howard , who started sunday s game howard played serviceably against the panthers star defensive end charles johnson , and over all the offensive line looked improved after having surrendered seven sacks against the giants but an upright sanchez still could not find a way to score the way i see it , we 're saving our best stuff for the regular season , sanchez said , cheerfully he added tonight , we 've just got to hang onto the football unfortunately , we did n't execute to the best of our ability that s the way it goes sometimes the jets' firstteam offense played one additional , nonscoring drive in the third quarter before being replaced by the backups quarterback tim tebow had a few entertaining scrambles , and he led an exciting late drive , but he finished 4 of 14 for 55 yards passing and an interception he ran for 45 yards on 5 carries meanwhile , the touchdown category on sanchez s statistical line remains conspicuously empty preseason numbers , of course , can be viewed skeptically the games do not count but the visual returns show that the offense is far from smooth ryan , who was the defensive line coach for the 2000 baltimore ravens , widely considered one of the worst offensive teams to win the , has continually had to answer for the team s lack of productivity he dismissed any insinuation about a lockerroom rift pitting a loudmouth defense against the underperforming offense linebacker bart scott did , too there were games last year where they saved us , games where we saved them , scott said it s about being a team that s what you do , you pick each other up the gulf in competence , though , looks deep and wide , and the potential for resentment from one side toward another grows when a bumbling offense cannot capitalize on defensive success , like the secondquarter turnover after a turnover like that , it s a change in momentum , cornerback darrelle revis said we want to see the offense score am i frustrated \? no it s the preseason right now after three games , however , the jets still do not have much to celebrate extra points tight end dustin keller \( hamstring \) , linebacker david harris \( ankle \) and tight end josh baker \( right knee \) were injured during the game , and none returned carolina running back jonathan stewart \( ankle \) also left the game safety yeremiah bell \( knee \) and defensive end mike devito \( calf strain \) were scratched , as were defensive end sione po'uha \( back \) and tight end jeff cumberland \( concussion \)
eugene , ore maria michta has achieved a lot in her 26 years racewalking champion , college valedictorian , doctoral candidate in biomedical medicine now she can add olympian to the list at a chilly hayward field on sunday , michta held off a furious challenge from miranda melville and erin gray in the women s 20kilometer racewalk to earn a trip to the london games michta finished in 1 hour 34 minutes 53 seconds , with melville 3 seconds behind gray faded in the last few laps and finished in 1 hour 35 minutes 40 seconds all three times met the olympic b standard , but none of them surpassed the a standard of 1 hour 33 minutes 30 seconds as a result , only michta , the winner , qualified for the olympic team i was 10 years old and watched the olympics on tv and wanted to be an olympian , michta said after the race i found racewalking , and the reality is now i m going to be an olympian michta , who started racewalking at 14 , had the fastest time this year heading into the race in march , she took a leave of absence from her doctoral work at the mt sinai school of medicine so she could train full time for the trials now she will have to extend her leave until august so she can compete in london for the first twothirds of the 50lap race , michta and gray , who lives in oregon and drew many of the fans who made it to hayward field for the 7 30 am start , were walking strideforstride with 10 laps to go , michta went in front seemingly out of nowhere , melville made up an 11second gap in about two laps time , creating a threewoman race i wasn t quite sure how much i had left in me , melville said i knew i wasn t going to give up on this goal to represent your country with about six laps left , a heavy mist enveloped the track looks like we re getting a little bit of oregon sunshine , the public address announcer said as many of spectators in the bleachers ran for cover at that point michta and melville motored ahead , and gray started to fade sensing a race to the finish , the announcer reminded the crowd that judges can disqualify racewalkers in the last 100 meters without the usual two warnings in fact , michta pulled away only on the final straightaway but kept her form throughout it is unlikely that michta will be able to win a medal in london athletes from russia and central america dominate the sport but even finishing in the top half , she said , would be satisfaction enough i just want to make our country proud , michta said
los angeles on its face , the s subscription concert at walt disney concert hall on thursday evening might have seemed routine the program , conducted by , followed an old formula overture , concerto , symphony and the repertory was familiar dvorak s carnival overture and his cello concerto , with as soloist , followed by shostakovich s fifth symphony but far from being routine , the program called further attention to a new vitality in the classical music scene of los angeles , for the related concerts this weekend will be transformed , sandwiching different cello works and soloists between the overture and the symphony saturday night will play shostakovich s first cello concerto and a transcription of a tchaikovsky aria sunday afternoon will play tchaikovsky s variations on a rococo theme and respighi s adagio con variazioni los angeles , it seems , is awash in cellists at the moment , and if mr kirshbaum was crowded out of those concerts , he has only himself to blame the occasion is the first , which mr kirshbaum organized to succeed a series of cello festivals he founded in manchester , england , in 1988 and directed until 2007 the texasborn mr kirshbaum , 66 , who taught at the royal northern college of music in manchester for 35 years , took over the chair in cello at the thornton school of music of the university of southern california in 2008 , a distant successor to that old cello wizard himself , who died in 1976 mr kirshbaum relocated to the united states in 2010 and has now inaugurated the festival as an outgrowth of both his english festivals and the longstanding piatigorsky seminars that became part of his new charge never one to hog the spotlight , and undoubtedly swamped with logistical difficulties , mr kirshbaum is playing relatively little at the festival , which began on march 9 and ends on sunday though a persuasive champion of bach s unaccompanied cello suites , he turned them over to six other players last sunday but he took on the choice dvorak assignment as a sort of centerpiece and pulled it off with aplomb of the cellists of his age group , his elder colleague janos starker of mr kirshbaum , he speaks the language of music with the least theatrics listeners used to having cellists try to overpower them with the dvorak concerto s bravura proclamations , or dazzle them with its virtuosic flights , found something different a cellist with a warm , wellcentered tone trying to make the best musical sense of the whole bravura and virtuosity were all in place , to be sure , but were well integrated into a reading perhaps more compelling for its lyrical and thoughtful moments and to judge from the clamorous ovation mr kirshbaum received , he had drawn the audience into complete sympathy with his more intimate approach here , surely , was a place for a movement of bach as an encore that none of today s young lions would have missed , but that is not the kind of artist mr kirshbaum is he had done justice to dvorak , and that was enough of a night s work for a belated firsttime visitor to disney concert hall \( which opened in 2003 \) , the evening held other fascinations from the splashy opening of carnival to the hammering ending of the shostakovich symphony , the hall showed an ability to yield bright , reverberant sonorities in wideranging dynamics and an equal ability to blend and contain them the most impressive sounds in some ways were the quietest midway through the largo , shostakovich breaks out of a clamor with quiet tremolos in the violins that sounded subdued and distant , yet so vital that they seemed to emanate from the walls this was sustained through beautifully played solos on oboe \( by ariana ghez \) , clarinet \( michele zukovsky \) and flute \( david buck \) the violins finally grew even quieter , as the merest thread of sound behind the celesta \( joanne pearce martin \) the stunning effect spoke well for the ability of the veteran maestro mr jarvi and the players to trust one another , and for the ability of the hall to deliver the faintest of sounds here was a level of mystery and atmosphere that was never quite achieved in the of the work at carnegie hall last week

no one really knows whether the new orleans saints can overcome the distractions and fallout of the bounties scandal their situation coach sean payton suspended for the year , the interim head coach joe vitt suspended for the first six games , general manager mickey loomis suspended for the first eight is unprecedented in the nfl until wednesday , it was still unknown who , exactly , would be in charge for the first month and a half of the season while vitt was away \( the saints chose offensive line coach aaron kromer \) that said , the saints have had time to prepare for this mess and , as you d imagine , they re approaching the 2012 season with a make no excuses , let s rally together attitude their journey will be uphill it s just a matter of how steep the incline turns out to be the saints , of course , are confident they can make it in the spirit of optimism , here s a case for why they can sean payton was \( is \? we ll say was for now \) very valuable to this organization but not because he was a great gameday coach \( which he was \) and certainly not because he was a shrewd playcaller in fact , last season , in the 10 games in which payton turned the playcalling over to offensive coordinator pete carmichael , the saints averaged 476 yards and scored over 40 points six times payton s value stems primarily from the offensive system he has designed that system won t just disappear while he s away and the main man executing it , quarterback drew brees , isn t going anywhere now that he has \( finally \) been given the richest guaranteed contract in league history \( 60 million \) brees and most of his current core weapons and their coaches have been together for several years now payton s presence will surely be missed in meetings and film study sessions during the week , but brees has always played an integral role in those meetings and most of the saints assistant offensive coaches have been in the program for at least five years on the other side of the ball , the bounty scandal may have involved the saints defense , but the fallout from it is mostly irrelevant to this current d by the time the axes fell , gregg williams had already joined the rams , and saints defensive players were already learning new coordinator steve spagnuolo s vastly different scheme suspended linebacker scott fujita had already joined the browns suspended defensive end anthony hargrove had already joined the packers and suspended linebacker jonathan vilma was reportedly already being phased out of the plans , which is why loomis signed his replacement , the falcons free agent curtis lofton , to a longterm deal \( five years , 275 million \) so , really , the scandal s only true impact on this 2012 defense is the loss of end will smith for four games and linebackers coach joe vitt for six painful \? maybe a little devastating \? not even close so no looking back the 2012 season is here sean payton is not but the saints can keep marching offense to understand why the saints offense can function just fine with coordinator pete carmichael handling most of sean payton s duties , you must understand what makes the saints system so effective for starters , quarterback drew brees has mastered it he has good , but certainly not amazing , natural tools his arm strength is respectable but not astounding he s mobile but not in a frightening way he s strong in the pocket but , at 60 , not always able to easily see over the line none of these limitations are a problem , though , because brees has perfected all of the quarterbacking traits that don t come directly from god he processes information before and after the snap as swiftly and effectively as any passer in the game this is one reason he s so accurate another is he s mechanically sound , particularly in the pocket , where his footwork and balance always mask new orleans s iffy front five with a maestro like brees under center , the saints system has grown into arguably the most variegated in the nfl a lot of people think of it as a speedoriented spread , but it s not especially since the emergence of tight end jimmy graham and addition of running back darren sproles , the saints have become largely a base personnel offense that s what makes them magical defenses have no idea how to treat graham and sproles because both players can be explosive out of their traditional spots or in any of the wide receiver slots having versatile base personnel allows new orleans to use a panoply of different formations it s not uncommon for them to line up 15 different ways on the first 15 plays there simply isn t enough time during the week for defenses to prepare for everything the saints throw at them so defenses must instead prepare for general concepts , which can sometimes water down their own scheme and make players passive even if the defense can correctly identify the saints concepts , there s still no promise of getting a stop brees processes information so quickly that he can work through as many as five reads on one dropback , which makes every eligible saint a genuine threat new orleans s play designs are cutting edge and fairly easy to execute most of the pass plays are built to hit the inside receiver , which is why so many of the outside routes aim to stretch the defense \( either vertically or horizontally \) the saints are very hard to play zone against of course , they re also hard to play man against , not so much because they have great players but because the formation diversity naturally creates a lot of mismatches and favorable angles keep in mind , everything the saints do is at an accelerated pace that helps them immensely they don t technically run a hurryup , though , because they change personnel so frequently that s the other key the personnel just because the saints frequently operate out of base doesn t mean they re always using the same group of guys this team is deeper than socrates \( your forgiveness , please \) the saints have perhaps the game s best tight end in jimmy graham he s involved in virtually every package behind him , there s a flexible movementoriented blocker and shortarea receiving weapon in david thomas thomas can line up as a traditional tight end , as a fullback , as an hback or even as a shallow slot receiver the saints also added a tough blocking tight end in daniel graham , who , if he beats out the lighter mike higgins for a roster spot , will boost the goalline package and maybe even supplant backup offensive tackle charles brown in the frequently used sixolinemen sets \( which the saints effectively run and throw from \) new orleans s depth is even more impressive in the backfield darren sproles is the weapon who keeps defensive coaches up at night , but mark ingram and pierre thomas are the focal points in the ground game many are expecting big things from ingram coming off a rookie season that was hindered by injuries if healthy , ingram has the power and subtle interior elusiveness to set the tone of , and close out , games week in and week out he mainly plays in twoback sets with either starting fullback jed collins or , occasionally , backup korey hall which is why it s important he get sharper at reading his blocks and timing his bursts thomas often gets the nod in singleback sets he doesn t have the quicktwitch prowess to consistently create his own space , but in the flow of a play that involves movementoriented blocking , he can be very good his passcatching ability is also a plus , particularly on screens , which the saints love to run of course , for primary receiving duties , the saints turn to the devastatingly shifty sproles , who does have the ability to create space sproles s 86 receptions last season were second most on the team to graham s 99 , but that doesn t mean the eighthyear running back is brees s secondfavorite target wide receiver marques colston is a lot of new orleans s offense is centered on drawing oneonone matchups for the 65 colston inside as a former seventhround pick , colston doesn t quite have dynamic enough athleticism to consistently win battles outside , though he is still more reliable on the perimeter than speedster devery henderson  with robert meachem leaving in free agency , the saints spent a fourthround pick on wisconsin s nick toon the son of former jet al toon is physical and has good size if he can get over a foot injury , he ll probably take the for no 4 duties away from the lanky adrian arrington , who recently had knee surgery the no 3 duties will go , in full , to lance moore , who isn t a star but , being one of the best zonebeating intermediate route runners in the nfl , is perfect for this system the saints front five is built to accommodate , not carry , the offense because brees is short and so good at stepping up in the pocket , the saints have taken the unusual approach of investing heavily at guard and just modestly at tackle there s a limit to their interior spending , though threetime pro bowl right guard jahri evans was given a sevenyear , 567 million contract in 2010 , but this past offseason , loomis wouldn t break the bank to keep twotime pro bowl left guard carl nicks he , did , however , spend 36 million over five years to sign former raven ben grubbs grubbs doesn t have nicks s size , but he s a physical , athletic allaround force who should be able to get almost as much movement in the run game as his predecessor between the two guards is decentsized but unexciting center brian de la puente  as for the tackles jermon bushrod earned pro bowl honors last season , but that was because the nfc was thin at left tackle and fans are uneducated voters yes , bushrod improved his footwork \( especially in the ground game \) , but he survived in pass protection only because he was given a lot of chipblock help and his quarterback has perfect pocket mobility and ballrelease timing at right tackle , it s the same story with zach strief , only without anyone voting him to the pro bowl the hope was that charles brown would have claimed strief s job by now , but the 2010 secondround pick has poor body control and passblocking mechanics defense some have used the phrase night and day to characterize the differences between gregg williams s system and steve spagnuolo s in short , williams s system is largely manbased , while spagnuolo s is largely zone the zone concepts should help the saints secondary \( especially strong safety roman harper , who is an excellent player when not having to play deep mantoman \) but one of the reasons williams played so much man coverage was he blitzed a lot williams blitzed a lot because his defensive line could barely generate a lick of passrushing pressure on its own this will be a problem for spagnuolo his system worked wonderfully when he was coordinating a giants defense that had one of the best fourman pass rushes the league has ever seen it worked only modestly well when he had a middletier front four in st louis how will it work here , where his front four is clearly a cut below that of the rams \? the first month of the season could be particularly rough with will smith serving his suspension the tireless smith is new orleans s only respectable pass rusher , and he s actually more of a rundefending type smith had just 65 sacks last season after recording just 55 in 2010 to buttress this front four , new orleans spent a firstround pick last year on cameron jordan thus far , the early indication is jordan will be , at best , another version of smith he plays hard and has good lateral strength against the run , but he hasn t shown the moves to penetrate or the speed to turn the corner he started 15 games last season , but his first sack this year will be just the second of his young career the saints do have a somewhat explosive passrush specialist in junior galette , but they ll most likely use the more wellrounded turk mcbride as smith s fillin starter also in the mix is last year s thirdround pick , martez wilson , but having played linebacker in college , he s little more than a subpackage niche player at this point inside , the prospects aren t much better sedrick ellis has been underwhelming since being drafted in the first round five years ago newcomer broderick bunkley is coming off a stellar season in denver , but he s a firstand seconddown runstuffer , not a quarterback chaser that description could also be issued for thirdround rookie akiem hicks someday for now , the 325pounder from regina is presumably too raw to see anything more than spotduty in 2012 in fact , don t be surprised if wideload veteran remi ayodele gets the top backup job the good news is , unlike most zonebased 43 defensive schemers , spagnuolo is not at the complete mercy of his front four he is one of the shrewder blitzcallers in the nfl yes , a tepid defensive line isn t favorable , and yes , spagnuolo is not as aggressive in his blitzes as the venomous williams was but that doesn t mean he s not crafty and proactive spagnuolo does a great job of creating advantageous oneonone matchups against running backs in pass protection , and many of his attacks involve six rushers , which means , if executed properly , defenders will have chances at clear paths to the quarterback in new orleans , spagnuolo has some of the best backseven blitzers in the business strong safety roman harper led the saints with 75 sacks last season harper is very swift and very instinctive near the line of scrimmage nickel linebacker jonathan casillas has tremendous downhill burst when playing in a straight line and no 2 backup linebacker will herring isn t slow free safety malcolm jenkins can also go after the quarterback as a former firstround cornerback , jackson is capable of lining up in and defending the slot that s important because one of spagnuolo s hallmarks is using nickel star blitzes , which involve a linebacker and the slot corner attacking blitzing in front of zone coverages should , theoretically , lead to more interception opportunities , as quarterbacks will be forced to make hasty decisions against defensive backs who can keep an eye on them at all times this in mind , it s a little surprising that the saints didn t work harder to resign tracy porter especially considering porter wound up getting only a oneyear , 4 million deal in denver an optimist might say that the decision to let porter leave suggests the saints like what they have in 2011 thirdround pick johnny patrick  patrick , the new nickelback , is essentially the man replacing porter , given that 2010 firstrounder patrick robinson already got a lot of first unit snaps last season robinson , who is primarily an outside defender , is developing nicely after a somewhat slow start he s still honing his allaround coverage instincts , but he has already become a top bubble screen and quickstrike stopper opposite robinson will be jabari greer , a perpetually underrated shadowman defender who should be just fine in this new scheme it helps all these corners that the man behind them , malcolm jenkins , has perhaps the best range of any free safety in the nfc as far as the middle of the defense goes , the saints will endure a bit of a downgrade with curtis lofton replacing jonathan vilma lofton isn t a stiff , but the falcons let him go because he lacks range and fluidity in coverage against the run , he doesn t quite have vilma s instincts , but he s smart enough and will be more effective than his predecessor in congested areas if lofton is out \( he has missed some time battling a high ankle sprain \) , either newly acquired barrett ruud or fourthyear pro ramon humber will fill in either player would be a significant downgrade outside , scott shanle returns on the strong side , while former seahawk david hawthorne takes over on the weak side both are proficient north south players who show hints of limitations when going east and west of the two , hawthorne is clearly the most dynamic special teams kicker john kasay was resigned to compete with garrett hartley , who missed all of last season with a hip injury punter thomas morstead has a big leg but won t be needed often darren sproles handles kick and punt returns , which is a little surprising sproles is certainly lethal in this role , but he has become very valuable to the offense if the saints want to preserve him , they can turn to courtney roby  bottom line the saints clearly have great pieces on offense it s just a matter of how well they can be organized in payton s absence don t expect too much trouble there more concerning is the defense , which may not have enough firepower to fully run

news corporation was prepared for severe criticism in the parliamentary report released tuesday in great britain but rupert murdoch was taken aback by the personal nature of the committee s findings , which labeled him unfit to lead a major corporation rupert is still in denial about how quickly his influence and prestige in the uk has gone down the drain , said one person close to the company and mr murdoch who could not publicly comment on private discussions the report could influence a british regulator to find that mr murdoch is not fit and proper to head bskyb , the satellite broadcaster partly owned by news corporation the broadcaster reported record ninemonth revenues wednesday and the company s chief executive , jeremy darroch , told reuters i would emphasize that it s important to remember that sky and news corporation are separate companies and the report hinted at further developments in the criminal investigation of journalists at the nowshuttered news of the world dotted through its 121 pages are references to sealed documents and an audio tape which contain possibly unrevealed names of those involved in illegal acts , writes ravi somaiya  the report also singled out several former associates and employees of mr murdoch for being evasive in their answers before parliament and for covering up the extent of hacking inside news of the world in a plot twist worthy of a corporate thriller , one of the those employees , colin myler , is now the editor of the daily news of new york , the hated archrival of mr murdoch s new york post if that would seem to put the daily news s owner , mort zuckerman , in an awkward position , he s having none of it in an interview with jeremy w peters , mr zuckerman said he had total confidence in mr myler , whom he believes will be vindicated in the scandal it s not the only report that will be out , mr zuckerman said , declining to be more specific several fellow members of the corporate titan club leaped to mr murdoch s defence barry diller , the chairman of iac interactivecorp who worked closely with mr murdoch throughout the 1980s and 1990s when he created the fox broadcasting company , called the report s description of his old partner outrageous i think it s terrible to put him in the position of having to justify his fitness to lead a company when he hasn t been indicted or charged with anything , he told amy chozick others who offered support for mr murdoch include jack welch \( whose former company general electric was an occasional target of mr murdoch s fox news \) and donald j trump in nonmurdoch news comcast reported a 30 percent increase in profit in the first quarter on revenue of 149 billion the results were helped by the nbc network , which had improved advertising revenues because of the super bowl broadcast and its hit show the voice tuesday , cbs reported its strongest first quarter since it was spun off from viacom six years ago the company was supposed to be the weak sister in the viacom family but a growth in nonadvertising revenue from , for example , online streaming and retransmission fees , helped bolster the results and even the newspaper industry had some good news with the release of the audit bureau of circulations report newspaper circulation is essentially flat for daily editions but sunday circulation rose by 5 percent , led by the new york times , which introduced its pay subscription model last year the result was a nearly 50 percent increase in sunday circulation and just over 73 percent for the daily paper the largest newspaper during the week remains the wall street journal \( ok , that is murdoch again \) with an average circulation of 2 , 118 , 315 read the full abc report here
andy benoit takes a quick tour through sunday s week 12 games share your thoughts 49ers 31 , saints 21 fox sports was determined to make alex smith or colin kaepernick \? the story of this game it s not often that the league s thirdhighestrated passer and leader of a 721 team is benched for a secondyear player from the western athletic conference clearly , though , san francisco s offense has more dimension and explosiveness with kaepernick at the helm he s a better athlete and raw passer than smith some might argue that smith is a smarter player , but if smith s football iq was truly anything beyond ordinary , the niners would not have kept him confined to such a rudimentary system having the rudimentary system makes the transition to kaepernick that much easier kaepernick really wasn t the story of this game , though san francisco s defense was specifically , safeties donte whitner and dashon goldson as they have all season , they played phenomenal twodeep coverage on sunday , keeping the lid on new orleans s downfield passing game and allowing the niners front four enough time to reach the nearly unsackable drew brees five times more impressive was the speed and ferocity with which goldson and whitner hit receivers in the open field \( which was a major facet in the divisional round win over the saints last postseason \) the tone those hits set was best illustrated on brees s second picksix wideout marques colston , understandably concerned about goldson striking him low over the middle , wound up tipping a high ball that he normally catches whitner snatched the tip and , this time , got to show off his speed with the ball in his hands ravens 16 , chargers 13 , ot ray rice s conversion on fourthand29 will be shown again and again more surprising than rice turning the dumpoff pass into a first down was that rubberarmed joe flacco threw a dumpoff in that situation perhaps flacco knew that those kinds of improbable conversions just seem to happen for 92 teams and against 47 clubs watch now as san diego fans find a way to blame norv turner for all the missed tackles on that play rice wasn t the only raven with a big conversion with 2 27 left in overtime , torrey smith made a tremendous backshoulder adjustment on a thirdand10 throw to pick up 31 yards against the tight coverage of veteran corner quentin jammer smith s seventh catch of the day set up the gamewinning 38yard field goal that ultra reliable rookie justin tucker nailed rams 31 , cardinals 17 in week 5 , the cardinals held sam bradford to seven completions on 21 attempts but lost the game on sunday , they held bradford to eight completions on 17 attempts and lost the game again in both contests , bradford s completions gained an average of more than 20 yards but still , it takes a special losing effort to be 02 after your opponent connects only 15 times through the air sunday , that effort was turned in by the cardinals rookie quarterback ryan lindley , who more than doubled bradford s total completion numbers for the season series but also threw four interceptions , two of which were returned by the rookie janoris jenkins for touchdowns bears 28 , vikings 10 mike tice s critics won t have anything to talk about this week the bears offense was masterfully prepared for the familiar twodeep zone coverages of the vikings quarterback jay cutler s ability to extend the play helped a lot it allowed for twoman route combinations even when the vikings kept seven defenders in coverage sending only two men on routes allows for extra blockers , which is vital when you have an unathletic offensive line that has recently undergone personnel changes at left guard and right tackle another key element to chicago s game plan was brandon marshall normally receivers have to find the voids against zone coverage marshall has a rare ability to win physical positioning battles against tight coverage he essentially posted up on about half of his 12 receptions that approach nullifies the effects of zone coverage , as marshall doesn t have to bother with finding the voids against the vikings , it was as if he got to face slightly outofposition man defenders all afternoon bengals 34 , raiders 10 the 38 raiders have given up 169 points in their fourgame losing streak credit their defense s inability to stop the run the poor discipline and awareness of oakland s linebackers is especially problematic considering none of those players have the athleticism to recover from their mistakes that was evident sunday , as the resoundingly average bengals rushing attack carved up this defense up for 221 yards \( benjarvus greenellis had 129 of them \) cincinnati was able to run because it established an early lead thanks to several big plays through the air \( another raiders specialty \) browns 20 , steelers 14 the steelers must feel sick about limiting trent richardson to 85 yards on 29 carries \( 29 average \) yet still losing to the browns that s what happens when you commit eight turnovers it s easy to focus on the perils of thirdstring quarterback charlie batch , who was culpable for three of those turnovers but what about pittsburgh s run game \? it was even less effective than cleveland s jonathan dwyer had 19 yards on nine carries isaac redman and rashad mendenhall combined for 13 yards on six carries and despite a close score throughout , pittsburgh went to the ground just 20 times , while batch who was playing without receivers antonio brown and jerricho cotchery dropped back to throw 35 times was offensive coordinator todd haley really that concerned about cleveland s hotandcold run defense \? colts 20 , bills 13 andrew luck now has more passing yards \( 3 , 205 \) through 11 games than any rookie in history his receivers have a lot to do with that thirdround rookie ty hilton gets better by the week , giving the colts an increasingly significant speed threat outside hilton had a 75yard punt return for a score on sunday \( the second week in a row buffalo s special teams have given up a return touchdown \) and caught an 8yard score to cap a 15play secondhalf opening drive more impressive than hilton has been reggie wayne , the 34yearold veteran , who has redefined his style of play in bruce arians s new offense playing on the move and more in the slot , wayne , who finished with eight catches for 102 yards against the bills , leads the nfl in receptions with 84 he has given luck the type of reliable outlet that most rookie quarterbacks chosen within the first few picks never even dream of broncos 17 , chiefs 9 remember knowshon moreno \? denver s firstround scatback who used to jump over defenders at georgia \? after spending most of this season working with the practice squad , the fourthyear veteran has been pushed back into a starting role thanks to willis mcgahee s regular seasonending knee injury moreno responded to his promotion \( or dedemotion \) by gaining 85 yards on 20 carries against the chiefs it s surprising so many touches went to him considering thirdround rookie ronnie hillman had been assuming a larger role in recent weeks hillman , however , is just 59 , 200 \( soaking wet \) , and may be viewed as a longterm thirddowntype back time will tell for now , the broncos seem to have found a dependable bandage in the backfield bandages are easier to come by when your quarterback has an almost computerized ability for audibling to the perfect run call at the line of scrimmage dolphins 24 , seahawks 21 a tough crosscountry earlywindow game wasn t the seahawks most crucial loss on sunday according to multiple reports , cornerbacks brandon browner and richard sherman are facing fourgame suspensions for violating the league s policy on performanceenhancing drugs some fans will say , so that s why both guys are such strong press defenders perhaps but it s impossible to pinpoint how , exactly , browner and sherman may have benefited from whatever they may have put into their system what is possible to pinpoint is how much trouble seattle s defense is in a lot without its lockdown corners , pete carroll s group will most likely have to play more twodeep coverages behind conservative zones that s the quickest way to expose the mediocrity of any overachievers falcons 24 , bucs 23 for the fifth time this season , matt ryan led the falcons on a gamewinning drive in the fourth quarter if the falcons are going to continue playing close games and they probably are , given that they have regularly done so since ryan and mike smith arrived in 2008 they ll need a dependable rushing attack , particularly down the stretch they know this that s why they ve limited 30yearold michael turner s carries , to try to keep him fresh turner didn t look particularly fresh sunday , mustering just 17 yards on 13 carries it was the fifth time in six games that turner averaged less than 32 yards per rushing attempt the hope is that turner can benefit as opponents get accustomed to defending 56 , 196pound teammate jacquizz rodgers rodgers is a better pass blocker and receiver than turner , which makes him an excellent fit in atlanta s hurryup offense and threereceiver sets the falcons did a good job of getting their shifty secondyear pro involved early at tampa bay rodgers finished with 49 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries , and had two receptions for 30 yards jaguars 24 , titans 19 quietly because everything happens quietly in jacksonville the blaine gabbert experiment may have come to an end even before gabbert was lost for the season with a forearm injury , mike mularkey had apparently decided to bench him for chad henne henne was tremendous in relief duties against the texans last week he followed up that 354yard performance with a 17 26 , 261yard , twotouchdown outing in sunday s win over tennessee it should not be a complete surprise that the exdolphin has given jacksonville s offense a jolt people forget what a strong pocket passer henne was before injuries and inconsistent decisionmaking felled him in miami now he s genuinely auditioning for jacksonville s starting job in 2013 giants 38 , packers 10 with kenny phillips returning to the lineup , the giants went back to their big nickel defensive package that s the package they rode to the super bowl last year in it , antrel rolle slides to the slot , giving the giants more flexibility in the box rolle is a slithery run defender and adept blitzer also , as randall cobb learned sunday night , he s extremely physical in underneath coverage inside in a cruel twist of fate , phillips reinjured his knee in the second half , although he said it was not serious instead of shifting back to their basic nickel look \( with jayron hosley in the slot \) , the giants opted to bring in 2011 sixthround pick tyler sash at safety that may have been a function of defensive coordinator perry fewell wanting to maintain the game plan we ll know next week as for the packers , no worries they just need to figure out their pass protection and they ll be fine those who saw marshall newhouse and tj lang trying to block the giants defensive ends on the edges may find that to be a tall order , but the packers have dealt with similar issues before all of their remaining opponents play a similar brand of defense twodeep zone if the packers , who will get greg jennings back soon , can find a few trusty concepts for beating that coverage , they will reestablish their rhythm follow andy benoit email andybenoit nfltouchdowncom
over the last couple of days , two nhl figures krys barch , an active journeyman , and wayne gretzky , the best player of all time have made what at first blush seem like disturbing references to guns , but on deeper inspection turn out to be fascinating glimpses into how long the players can hold out in the current lockout and the odd thing is , it is barch who makes the more vivid case on monday , gretzky , after speaking at a toronto seminar on personal investment , told the national post he would have shot myself during his playing career if he had to miss a year because of a lockout alarming , perhaps for a moment , but it comes into perspective when he explains further there s no way i could have taken a year off because there is no way i would have known what to do in the middle of my career taking a year off , gretzky said that was my life gretzky lived through one brief players strike and one owners lockout that cost half a season , so he knows of what he speaks \( and he still has the common touch , as dave bidini shows in an account of meeting the great one in new york last month \) but while he merely said it would have been difficult to sit out a year , former players who experienced the 20045 fullseason lockout , like mike modano , bill guerin and dave andreychuk , have said missing a year simply was not worth it it s money you feel you never get back , modano told espn last month everybody thought let s not let each other down let s do it for the future of the game blah , blah , blah you re only in the game so long not exactly a tothebarricades prounion view the same for guerin , who said last year of the 20045 lockout that burning a year was ridiculous and that the nba players , like the nhl players , are in an owners league and you are going to play when they want andreychuk advised the lockedout nba players last year to settle quickly because if players think it s better to sit out the season , let me tell them , it s not it s just not on saturday night , barch , a fourthline enforcer who signed last summer with the devils , put out on his twitter account what amounted to a soulbaring 625word cri de coeur about the lockout in which he confessed to have been drinking eight old vienna beers and a bottle of port while listening to neil young sometimes wondering if i should have existed when a word and a gun solidified and solved all problems , he wrote but the rest of barch s essay \( ably translated into regular paragraphs by usa today \) makes a deeper point he speaks as a fiveandahalfyear nhl veteran on a 700 , 000 salary who makes his living through sweating , bleeding , cut achilles , broken hands , concussions , broken orbital bones , eight teeth knocked out , etc he s got two kids and a third on the way , wondering what he s going to do to get our family ahead it sounds as if he is going to explain why he wants his union to accept a quick settlement , but no i wonder if the owners of boston , new york , washington , etc etc have endured any of the injuries that i or any other player in the nhl have endured , barch wrote still they probably sit there smoking the same brand of cigar , sipping the same cognac , and going on vacation to one of the five houses they own while we sit here knowing they want to take 20 percent of our paychecks then barch tackles the revenuesharing proposal rejected by the league if the nhl wants to keep teams in the south in struggling markets , then the players , along with the financially welltodo teams , need to start working together or they need to start to move teams to the north where they will make money finally , barch sums up with as eloquent an oldfashioned call for union solidarity as anyone could muster the system allows the owners to continually take money from the players , contract after contract , where eventually over 40some years , the owners will have 80 percent of the revenue , he wrote the only way to stop the work stoppages long into the future is to fix the root cause of the problems let the league and the players come together to fix the mistakes that have been made and make sure none are made in the future perhaps when this lockout is over , barch will be as bitter about his experience with trade unionism as modano , guerin and andreychuk are now or perhaps he will have gretzky s take , that sitting around idle would make him stircrazy but right now at least , barch is the prounion bard of the 2012 nhl lockout
sanford , fla a tall , lanky redheaded lawyer named mark o'mara appeared in court here on thursday , standing next to his newest client , george zimmerman , one of the most recognizable defendants in the country but a man he had met for the first time only the night before at the county jail mr zimmerman , 28 , has become known to millions as the neighborhood watch organizer who shot and killed , an unarmed black teenager , six weeks ago , but who was initially not charged with any crime unleashing a nationwide protest mr o'mara , a new yorker by birth and a criminal defense lawyer for nearly three decades , is perhaps best known in central florida as a lowkey legal analyst on television who frequently commented on the trial last year of casey anthony , who was accused and acquitted of killing her young daughter it was mr zimmerman s first moment in court , and he looked wideeyed and grim in a onepiece bluegray prison uniform , a couple of day s growth on his face mr o'mara said that his client would plead not guilty and that he would try to get him out of jail within the next couple of weeks until then , mr zimmerman , who was charged with seconddegree murder on wednesday , is being held in protective custody a conviction could result in a prison term of 25 years to life after seeing his client on thursday , mr o'mara said in an interview that mr zimmerman was distraught he is stressed and tired after long weeks of not being able to go out in public , mr o'mara , 56 , said in the best of circumstances , he was dealing with the reality that he caused the death of somebody , and that weighs on you saying his client has no money , mr o'mara said that he was not charging mr zimmerman and that he hoped to secure a low bond mr zimmerman and his family have maintained that he was trailing mr martin because the young man appeared suspicious mr martin then disappeared from view , only to reemerge , confront him and assault him , they say in the fight , they contend , he shot mr martin in selfdefense florida s expansive selfdefense law , stand your ground , was cited initially as a reason why no charges were brought in a fourpage charging affidavit filed in court on thursday , prosecutors added little to the known facts in the case but the affidavit contradicted the zimmerman family account in at least one crucial respect martin attempted to run home , it said , but was followed by zimmerman who did n't want the person he falsely assumed was going to commit a crime to get away before the police arrived zimmerman confronted martin and a struggle ensued , it stated it also asserted that mr zimmerman profiled mr martin mr o'mara said selfdefense cases were not new to him he said that he had handled dozens , but that none had gone to trial as stand your ground cases he has also tried highprofile deathpenalty cases he said that selfdefense would probably be a facet of mr zimmerman s defense last month , mr o'mara told a local television station that mr martin s shooting could be legally justified under the law , which allows people to use deadly force if they feel endangered other people call it the license to murder statute because it does n't require actions to avoid the confrontation , mr o'mara said in the appearance he was critical of the law on wednesday , however , saying it has some troublesome portions to it but , he added , right now it s the law of florida and that will have an impact on this case mr o'mara , who grew up in rosedale , queens , the son of a battalion chief in the new york city fire department , came to this case suddenly , after another wellknown lawyer , mark nejame , referred him and four other lawyers mr nejame , who said mr zimmerman had consented to his speaking , declined a march 13 request by mr zimmerman to take his case because it would have required too much time away from his family on tuesday , mr zimmerman s original two lawyers held a news conference to resign , saying that they could not get in touch with mr zimmerman and that he was acting erratic mr nejame got a call a day later from a close family friend of the zimmermans he gave the friend a list of the five lawyers they chose mr o'mara i thought mark had strong attributes like being compassionate , extremely smart , media savvy and very professional , mr nejame said mark has a measured approach and by bringing him in , it would help keep unbridled passions contained the martin family expressed relief on thursday over the charges exhausted by the ordeal , mr martin s mother , sybrina fulton , said she had misspoken on a news program earlier in the day when she used the word accident to describe the shooting it was not the shooting that was the accident , she said it was the encounter between mr martin and mr zimmerman the accident came when zimmerman exited his vehicle and they met , she said asked whether he would use her words in court , mr o'mara displayed his flair for discretion they went through a horrible tragedy , he said they lost their son we 're not going to be talking about using words against the mother of a deceased child
boston he had become , through some fault of his own , the poster boy for the ' historic september swoon of 2011 the boston righthander josh beckett ate chicken and drank beer in the clubhouse while his teammates were on the field he was neither repentant nor remorseful for the activity , though a few of his teammates , not to mention pretty much all of red sox nation , felt otherwise thus , it came as little surprise that beckett received more than just a smattering of boos when his name was announced as the starting pitcher friday in the red sox' home opener on top of his questionable september behavior , which came during the team s 720 collapse , beckett had been rocked last week in his season debut in detroit , surrendering five home runs on the eve of his second start , he said defiantly that he would pitch for his teammates , if not for the fans in the end , he did both , calming some jittery nerves after the red sox began their season by dropping five of their first six games beckett put aside what he called a lot of exterior distractions and stifled the over eight innings , as the red sox won their eighth straight home opener , 122 he was denied the satisfaction of a complete game , or even a captipping exit to the sellout crowd of 37 , 032 , when the red sox scored eight runs in the bottom of the eighth to take a 121 lead even the beleaguered red sox bullpen can hold a lead like that just what the doctor ordered , said the red sox manager bobby valentine , who also heard a few boos when he was introduced he shared that distinction alone with beckett no one else came in for a jeering , although john lackey , out for the season with an arm injury , was not introduced he and beckett had been the chief chicken and beer culprits we were wondering and hoping , and he relieved all doubt , valentine said of beckett threw great curveballs had terrific control threw all his fastballs over 90 miles an hour that s the performance we were looking for home opener and everything else combined , that was a terrific outing the only downer for the home team was a rightshoulder injury to their allstar center fielder jacoby ellsbury he had to leave the game in the fourth inning after shortstop reid brignac fell on the shoulder during a double play ellsbury was taken to massachusetts general hospital , and the red sox said he would undergo further evaluation while beckett had been hammered in detroit , history suggested he would be the polar opposite on friday and he was beckett has been nearly invincible in home openers since he came to the red sox in 2006 , compiling a 40 record with a 241 earned run average in five homeopening starts in those five starts , the red sox have scored 45 runs beckett allowed three hits to the first six tampa bay hitters , giving the rays a 10 lead in the second inning tampa bay had a runner on third with only one out but beckett got out of the inning without further damage and allowed only two more hits , both twoout singles , over the next six innings he threw 94 pitches , the 90th being a curve ball to carlos pena , which led to his only strikeout of the game that extended beckett s strikeout string to 281 games \( since sept 4 , 2001 \) the longest active streak in the majors and the second longest to begin a career dwight gooden had a strikeout streak of 349 games from 1984 to 1997 beckett has also owned the rays over the last twoplus seasons he is 40 with a 084 earned run average against tampa bay in his last six starts dating to sept 12 , 2009 but none of that mattered on a sunsplashed afternoon at fenway park , a week before the ballpark s official centennial celebration the last time the red sox played here , sept 21 , 2011 , beckett was the losing pitcher and the team was booed off the field now , seven months later , the red sox were reeling , beckett had a 1350 earned run average after his detroit outing and the rays had their ace , david price , on the mound it s kinda tough , beckett said of the atmosphere as well as the expectations you have n't been home in six weeks going to detroit , obviously , the fans and that team are very , very excited with what they 've done in the offseason those guys were extra locked in it s tough to start in a place like that the rays can relate they are 210 in visiting home openers , and they could do nothing against beckett the red sox , meanwhile , got production from everyone , with exrays catcher kelly shoppach reaching base four times , driving in two runs and collecting his first stolen base in 464 career games adrian gonzalez had 3 of the team s 16 hits and kevin youklis , who came into the game with 2 hits in 20 atbats , matched that hit total in 4 atbats
league city is a tough act to follow , and the major republican candidates running to replace him in congress are not even trying it is hard enough to get voters to remember their names there are nine republicans running in an election that is rife with confusion because of a delayed primary date and redrawn boundaries and for all the hero worship mr paul has cultivated among a small but vocal subset of the electorate , nobody is rushing to imitate dr no i do n't get a sense that people are looking for the next ron paul , said jay old , a beaumont lawyer and the top fundraiser in the crowded field i think they are looking for people who want the very best for the district partisan gerrymandering often turns political jurisdictions into zigzagging monstrosities , but the redrawn congressional district 14 is straightforward and compact it starts at the southeast corner of texas , along the louisiana border , and going west picks up two whole coastal counties , jefferson and galveston , and about half of another , brazoria it was not what mr paul , the 76yearold physician , had in mind the district lost much of its rural character , and he faced the daunting prospect of introducing himself to about 300 , 000 people who were not in the old version of the district though he is running for president , mr paul could have also legally sought reelection , as he did in 2008 mr paul is now in his 12th term he quit instead , and the race to fill his republicanleaning seat has become a freeforall among republicans if none of the nine candidates wins half of the vote outright on may 29 , the top two will face off in a july 31 runoff that appears to be the most likely scenario whoever emerges will probably face former united states representative nick lampson , democrat of beaumont , who has strong ties to the area and an even stronger conviction that the seat will be competitive in the fall there are 11 major party candidates altogether , plus zach grady , a libertarian , running for the seat there are four republican candidates whose money and political connections give them the best shot at making a runoff mr old has raised the most money and had 308 , 000 on hand as of the last reporting period , which ended in april he is already running tv ads , but his history of voting in past democratic primaries and his donations to democratic candidates have prompted criticism from his republican opponents mr old , 48 , said that democrats traditionally dominated elections in his native jefferson county , and that when there were no options in the republican primary , that means you pick the most qualified , most conservative candidate the other side offers michael truncale , another wellfinanced republican from beaumont , is stressing his grassroots appeal and political reach as a state republican executive committee member at last count , mr truncale , 54 , a lawyer and former texas state university system regent , had 149 , 000 in the bank one possible factor working against both men is their home county its tradition of voting for democrats means republican turnout could be much lower there than in the western part of the district that is one reason state representative randy weber of pearland is expected to make the runoff the owner of an airconditioning company he started in 1981 , mr weber takes pride in his 2009 designation as the most conservative member of the texas house , as scored by the texas conservative coalition he also picked up gov rick perry s endorsement i have a track record of conservative action , said mr weber , who traces his political activism to former president ronald reagan s reelection bid i do n't just know all the talking points i 've lived them for 29 years mr weber had raised 282 , 000 for the race and had the secondhighest cashonhand figure in the republican field 227 , 000 , as of the last reporting period mr weber , 58 , did not initially live in the district after it was redrawn , but he moved into it after questions were raised about his residency representatives must inhabit the state they represent , but living outside a district s boundaries often provides fodder for opponents another republican in the race , felicia harris , a pearland city council member , lives a few miles outside the district but said that had had no impact she said she would move into it if she were to win ms harris , 42 , who has raised less than half the money mr weber has brought in , said her experience as a lawyer in the energy and petrochemical industries made her a natural fit for the coastal district , which has five ports she does not shy from distinguishing herself from mr paul and proudly notes that she is the only woman in the race i think most people are ready for a younger voice and a fresh face , she said just look at me i'm not dr paul ms harris said there was no shame in seeking federal money for the district a break from the porkhating mr paul particularly with so many ports to maintain this is a district that requires federal support it requires federal attention , said ms harris , who had 77 , 000 in the bank , according to the most recent disclosures one darkhorse republican candidate , robert gonzalez of clear lake , had raised less than 10 , 000 at last count , but his strong credentials give him an outside shot at making the runoff while the republicans duke it out in their hotly contested race , mr lampson is considered a shooin for the democratic nomination he raised 316 , 000 and had 272 , 000 on hand at last count mr lampson , 67 , argues that he has a decent shot at winning in november because of his recognizable name , his deep ties to the coastal region and a newly configured district whose votingage population is now 40 percent minority he acknowledges , though , that he will be swimming upstream when it comes to defending president obama in a republicanleaning district i doubt very seriously if he will carry district 14 , mr lampson said i'm not going to run away from president obama , but i think i will be judged on what i stand for

baltimore in recent years , the most surefire route to a victory in the was to compete in the first twentyfive of the last 28 winners of the preakness , the second jewel of the , ran at churchill downs on the first saturday in may if the new shooters , as they are called , were topflight 3yearolds , they would have shown up in the derby of course , there have been exceptions the filly captured the kentucky oaks before trying the boys and winning the preakness en route to earning 2009 horse of the year honors bernardini was a late bloomer who won the preakness in 2006 and went on to become 3yearold champion but none of the newcomers this year have shown that caliber of talent six derby starters are here , including the winner , i 'll have another , who is 52 in the morning line , and the secondplace finisher , bodemeister , who is the favorite at 85 both earned their low odds both will be heavily bet neither , however , appears to be head and shoulders above two other derby horses in this field who endured brutal , groundlosing trips went the day well was perhaps closing fastest of all in the derby after breaking poorly and getting pushed way outside at the quarter pole he finished fourth , two and a half lengths behind i 'll have another creative cause finished a halflength behind him in fifth place after bulling his way through traffic in the backstretch only to be kicked eight wide turning for home both will benefit from a compact preakness field of 11 , which eliminates the traffic troubles that caused them to lose too much ground in the derby instead , went the day well and creative cause will be positioned in midpack , where their jockeys , john velazquez and joel rosario , can watch what promises to be the catandmouse game ahead of them between bodemeister and i 'll have another bodemeister needs the lead because there are no other true frontrunners to challenge bodemeister early , i 'll have another must go with him and not let him steal away to an easy , energysaving lead if bodemeister and i 'll have another go too fast , they risk burning each other out if they go too slow , went the day well and creative cause should be right there turning for home with them in the derby , bodemeister ran a fast , brave but ultimately taxing race can he recover with two weeks between races \? i 'll have another had a perfect trip can he get another \? with clean trips , can went the day well and creative cause pass both of them \? at 61 for each in the morning line , it s worth a few bucks to find out
blackrock , the giant money manager , said it would have no choice but to shift some of its business away from certain wall street firms if moody s investors service went ahead with its threat to downgrade some of the country s biggest banks i think this has serious implications , laurence d fink , the firm s chairman and chief executive , said in an interview on wednesday following the release of blackrock s first quarter earnings if moody s does indeed downgrade these institutions , we may have a need to move some business around to higherrated institutions the move , mr fink said , is not something he wants to do but as a giant asset manager , blackrock has trading agreements that require it to maintain highly rated counter parties that s not my wishes , he said , in reference to shifting business to other firms we have to respond to contracts we have moody s , one of the country s two big ratings agencies , has said it will decide in the next two months whether to lower its ratings for 17 global financial companies the threat has a number of wall street firms on edge banks that trade need the confidence of their counterparties , so maintaining a sterling credit is critical in many cases , keeping a high rating is written into trading agreements and already the specter of a downgrade has pension funds and money managers like blackrock assessing their contractual relationships with these institutions mr fink did not say which banks blackrock was concerned about , but a downgrade would no doubt affect some firms more than others morgan stanley appears to be the most vulnerable as moody s is threatening to cut the bank s ratings by three notches , to a level that would be well below the rating of some other rivals citigroup and bank of america will fall to the same levels , but both institutions are helped by having higherrated subsidiaries where large chunks of their trading business is housed in the run up to moody s decision , many on wall street are questioning the wisdom of a potential downgrade moody s , of course , came under criticism for keeping rosy ratings on toxic securities before the financial crisis and on wednesday , mr fink said a move to downgrade some big banks was misplaced i do n't understand the thinking by moody s , he said he noted that banks had set aside deeper capital cushions , a sign of strength that could prevent a crisis of confidence from ensnaring the firms his comments echo those of goldman sachs s chief financial officer , david viniar , who criticized the rating agency on tuesday when speaking to analysts about goldman s firstquarter earnings we think that if you look at every single credit metric there is for goldman sachs , and frankly for many of our competitors , none of the actions they have talked about are warranted , he said as for moody s , it says the banks are in businesses that may no longer deserve a high credit rating in recent reports on the bank , the agency has raised flags about the vulnerabilities of capital markets businesses , including the confidencesensitivity of customers and funding counterparties , risk management governance challenges , and a high degree of interconnectedness and opacity additionally , these institutions are exposed to large and rapidlychanging risk positions that expose these firms and their creditors to unexpected , sometimes outsized losses , moody s has said in its reports morgan stanley declined to comment a morgan stanley spokeswoman had said previously that only about 8 percent of its overthecounter derivative trading contracts would be affected by a threenotch downgrade she added that the company had spent more than two years overhauling its business so that it was less risky and less capital intensive , something that should help its rating this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
indianapolis a common question being asked of players on the giants and the new england patriots this week is an obvious one what are the similarities between this season s teams and the ones that played each other four years ago in super bowl xlii \? if you ask running back brandon jacobs , the current giants are quite different none at all , jacobs said wednesday when asked about the similarities to the 2007 squad it s tempting to compare the way the giants , who not that long ago were 77 , made their surprising run through the playoffs this season , and the way they advanced in the 2007 season , when they pulled off upsets against the dallas cowboys and the green bay packers before slaying the biggest beast of them all , the 180 patriots that team in 2007 we made it there and we played , and we played hard , jacobs said we took advantage of opportunity this time , we knew we could win the games that we won , and we knew we could make it here , and we re confident in saying that we re going to win this one , too he added , it s just a different team
kabul , afghanistan insurgents hiding outside the heavily fortified air base fired a pair of rockets early tuesday that damaged the parked c17 transport plane used by gen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , american and afghan officials said general dempsey was in quarters asleep when the rockets hit the airfield , which is 35 miles north of kabul , said col david lapan , the general s spokesman he was not nearby and not in danger two base service members were slightly wounded , and the damage to the c17 was enough to force general dempsey and officials traveling with him , none of whom were hurt , to leave afghanistan a few hours later than planned on a different aircraft the airplane was not directly hit , but flying shrapnel struck the crew door , the fuselage to the left of the door and one engine cowling , said colonel lapan , who was on the trip a helicopter at the base was also damaged a taliban spokesman , zabiullah mujahid , said militants planned tuesday s rocket attack with precise intelligence provided by someone inside the air base but jamie graybeal , a spokesman for the americanled nato coalition , said there was no indication that general dempsey was the target or that militants knew the c17 was his plane he said rockets or mortar shells strike the airfield about twice a month , usually to little effect it s a common occurrence up there , mr graybeal said , adding that the two maintenance workers suffered very minor wounds , cuts and bruises but the attack underscored what some officials describe as deterioration in security in the shomali plain , where bagram sits the plain has been a continually foughtover strategic link between the north of the country and kabul during decades of war , dominated by different afghan factions at various stages just a few years ago , the region experienced surprising gains in prosperity and security , driven in part by commerce around the massive air base and by nato s desire to keep the region stable the area is important because of the airfield and because the main road that passes north through bagram and the salang tunnel , and eventually into uzbekistan , is an indispensable resupply corridor but in the past few years some gains have deteriorated , with the taliban and the militant group hezbiislami gaining strength in parwan , the province where the base is parwan s police chief , gen akram khan behzad , blamed taliban militants for the recurring rocket fire they use the dense trees outside the base to evade capture we have not been able to clear up the area from insurgent activity because we lack the personnel , he said nato officials said they did not know what weapons had been used in the attack or from how far away they had been fired but the afghan police chief for bagram district , alhaj ezmarai nasiri , said the rockets were most likely from a bm12 launcher or similar model , which has a 12tube array and can fire 107millimeter rockets five miles insurgents have been known to strip off and use just one rocket tube , which can be carried in a car trunk the attack came after general dempsey met senior american and afghan leaders to discuss the growing crisis in which afghan police officers and soldiers were gunning down american and nato troops in socalled greenonblue or nato officials worry that the killings 40 american and nato troops have died from such attacks this year could undermine the exit strategy of steadily training and turning over security to afghan forces during the next two years , before a neartotal withdrawal of western military forces president obama also said he would confer with president hamid karzai to express his concern about the killings and there were signs on tuesday that american pressure might be having an effect the police chief of kandahar province fired the district police chief of spinbaldak , a town bordering pakistan , for failing to prevent an afghan national policeman from killing an american soldier on sunday in the most recent fatal greenonblue episode but it was not clear whether the firing truly signaled plans to get more serious jawed faisal , the spokesman for the kandahar governor , said , any security official who fails to prevent such attacks will be sacked but he acknowledged that no one had been fired in zhare , a district of kandahar where another greenonblue shooting wounded two american soldiers on friday he said that investigation had not been completed
i think i can see the whole destiny of america contained in the first puritan who landed on those shores , the french political thinker alexis de tocqueville wrote after visiting the united states in the 1830s was he right \? do presentday americans still exhibit , in their attitudes and behavior , traces of those austere english protestants who started arriving in the country in the early 17th century \? it seems we do consider a series of experiments conducted by researchers led by the psychologist eric luis uhlmann and published last year in the journal of experimental social psychology in one study , they investigated whether the work habits of today s americans reflected the socalled protestant work ethic martin luther and john calvin argued that work was a calling from god they also believed in predestination and viewed success as a sign of salvation this led to belief in success as a path to salvation hard work and good deeds would bring rewards , in life and after in the study , american and canadian college students were asked to solve word puzzles involving anagrams but first , some were subtly exposed to \( or primed with \) salvationrelated words like heaven and redeem , while others were exposed to neutral words the researchers found that the americans but not the canadians solved more anagrams with salvation on the mind they worked harder professor uhlmann and his colleagues also conducted an experiment to see if americans shared the prudishness of the puritans they found that american students judged promiscuous women more harshly than british students did in a third experiment , the researchers asked asianamericans to rate their support for a school principal who had canceled a prom because of sexually charged dancing and also to rate their support for a school that had banned revealing clothing but first , the researchers primed the participants with thoughts of either their asian or their american heritage , as well as with thoughts of work or another topic they found that the participants showed increased approval of the prudish school officials when primed with thoughts of work if they had been primed with their american heritage , but not when primed with their asian heritage these results suggest a tight puritanical intermingling of work , sex and morality in the american mind in none of these studies did the results hinge on the participants' religious affiliation or level of religious feeling whatever these americans explicitly believed \( or did n't believe \) about god , something like puritan values seemed to be guiding their moral judgments protestant attitudes about work may also influence how americans treat their coworkers calvin argued that socializing while on the job was a distraction from the assignment god gave you the psychologist jeffrey sanchezburks has found that protestants but not catholics become less sensitive to others' emotions when reminded of work , possibly indicating a tendency to judge fraternizing as unproductive and unprofessional he and collaborators have also found that americans have a culturally specific tendency to view family photos and other personal items as unprofessional presences in the office not all of the legacy of puritanism suggests moral uprightness studies since the '70s have also found that americans who score high on a protestant ethic scale \( emphasizing selfreliance and selfdiscipline \) or similar metric show marked prejudice against racial minorities and the poor hostility toward social welfare efforts and , among obese women , selfdenigration why the persistence of puritanism in american life \? new england exercised a disproportionate influence on american ideals , the historian john coffey says , thanks to a powerful intellectual tradition disseminated through its universities , its dynamic print culture and the writings of its famous clergy he also notes the power of evangelicalism as a carrier of puritan values and america s resistance , compared with other largely protestant nations , to secularization it s hard to say for sure that any given element of the american psyche results from our puritan founders the direct lines are few , stresses david d hall , a professor of new england church history , mostly because of industrialization and immigration and other factors that have led to immense social change but were tocqueville to land on our shores today , with a bit of squinting he would probably see some of the same evidence of our puritan destiny as he did nearly two centuries ago
responding to intensifying criticism about the from a health care program for lowincome women a move that the federal government considers illegal gov said at a news conference on thursday that the state would use its own money to operate the program if washington stops financing it this program is not going away , he said the , which serves 130 , 000 women , receives 35 million in federal financing every year and hands it out to many clinics , including some run by planned parenthood none of the clinics are allowed to perform abortions but planned parenthood provides the procedure elsewhere in the state , and mr perry and republican lawmakers pushed for a new rule to keep the organization from receiving any of the money that goes to the women s health program the obama administration has said that as of march 14 , when the new rule takes effect , the federal government will suspend its financing of the program if texas persists in excluding a planned parenthood that would shut down the women s health program , which gets 90 percent of its financing from the federal government the program , also provides birth control , breast cancer screenings and pap smears mr perry said thursday that he would not rescind the rule barring financial assistance to planned parenthood he did not say where he would find the 35 million to keep the program running if the federal support ends , or whether the program would still serve women on medicaid
you did not misread the headline and it s not just a truism about mr gingrich s political orientation , i mean he s correct that florida s winnertakeall primary system isn t fair according to republican national committee guidelines , all contests held prior to april 1 must allocate delegates proportionally but florida , not wishing to change procedures or fall behind other states , decided to flout the rnc rule , which means that mitt romney will get all 50 of its delegates mr gingrich who came in second will get none under a proportional system , mr romney would receive 23 and mr gingrich 16 not only that , npr has calculated that mr gingrich would currently be leading his rival 39 to 32 overall \( new hampshire plus south carolina plus florida \) , if delegates were allotted proportionally mr gingrich s campaign , which has surely done the same math as npr , has complained to the florida gop , and consequently left me in a rather unfamiliar position for perhaps the first time in my life , i completely agree with the former house speaker and future moon colonist mr gingrich might have raised this issue before the florida primary , when some polls suggested he could eke out enough of a plurality to benefit from the winnertakeall system i doubt he would care about the rnc guidelines if he d managed to win , and i doubt florida s delegates will be instrumental in determining whether mr romney or mr gingrich earns the gop nomination but the point is that a candidate in a twoperson , winnertakeall primary could get 499 percent of the votes , and receive no delegates , and that s not right as our editorial board has said many times , both parties rules should be rewritten to guarantee that the number of delegates a candidate receives accurately reflects his percentage of the popular vote now , it s onward to nevada , which on saturday holds caucuses they re not a democratic way of choosing a nominee no matter how you allocate the delegates
dalian , china just a few weeks before his dramatic fall from power , wrote an inscription in calligraphy , praising the chongqing water assets management company , and urging support for its operations what he did not say was that a foundation controlled by his younger brother , bo xicheng , had acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the water company mr bo had done something similar in 2003 , while serving as governor here in liaoning province he said his province would make supporting the dalian daxian company , a conglomerate engaged primarily in electronics manufacturing , one of the most important tasks of the next five years a few years earlier , another company controlled by the same younger brother was listed as the owner of nearly a million shares in dalian daxian , worth about 12 million it is not clear whether mr bo knew of the indirect stakes in the companies , or whether his brother profited from his pronouncements but now , in the aftermath of mr bo s , on and accusations that his wife arranged the , there are mounting questions about whether mr bo , who was most recently the party chief in the city of chongqing and a member of the politburo , used his enormous political clout to enrich himself and his closest relatives for much of the last decade , while bo xilai was busy moving up the ranks of the communist party , and even striking populist themes aimed at improving the lot of the poor , his relatives were quietly amassing a fortune estimated at more than 160 million his elder brother accumulated millions of dollars' worth of shares in one of the country s biggest stateowned conglomerates his sisterinlaw owns a significant stake in a printing company she started that was recently valued at 400 million and even mr bo s 24yearold son , now studying at harvard , got into business in 2010 , registering a technology company with 320 , 000 in startup capital bo xilai s downfall this spring has also cast a sharper spotlight on the hidden wealth and power accumulated by the communist party s revolutionary families , and by the sons , daughters , wives and close relatives of the nation s highranking leaders this could really open a can of worms , says bo zhiyue , a senior fellow at the national university of singapore s east asian institute the relatives of other party leaders are also doing lots of business deals , and people will begin to ask what about them \? was the bo family the only one doing this kind of thing \? mr bo was suspended from his politburo position and his leadership of chongqing , a large metropolis with province status , in recent weeks amid accusations that , among other things , he interfered with an investigation into the death of a neil heywood , a british businessman whose body was found in a chongqing hotel room on nov 15 his death was initially attributed to alcohol poisoning mr bo s wife , gu kailai , and zhang xiaojun , the family s 32yearold orderly , were named as the main suspects , with officials saying ms gu and her son , bo guagua , had with mr heywood over economic interests the case has also raised questions about how the bo family was able to afford to send their only son to study in england at harrow and oxford university , as well as now at harvard , for graduate school staterun media reports have hinted at the possibility that the bo family had been transferring illicit assets overseas and soon after mr bo was dismissed from his posts , xu ming , one of china s wealthiest businessmen , with close ties to mr bo and his family , was detained , possibly here in the city of dalian , where mr bo had once served as mayor none of the extended family members have been accused of illegality but the circumstances surrounding mr bo s actions in support of companies where family members had an interest suggest that he may have used his influence to help increase their wealth corporate records in hong kong and china show that the siblings of both mr bo , who also served as commerce minister in the national government , and his wife have been exceptionally active for years in forming investment companies and setting up offshore entities moreover , sometimes mr bo s family members have held their stakes using an alias two of ms gu s sisters gu wangjiang and gu wangning have earned millions of dollars in publishing , real estate and other ventures together they own about 120 million worth of shares in the tungkong security printing company in eastern china the tungkong web site says the company has contracts with some of china s biggest stateowned enterprises and government agencies , including the tax authorities and the central bank gu wangning also helped bo guagua establish a technology company in beijing in 2010 the guagua technology company s supervisor is listed as mr zhang , the bo family aide accused along with ms gu of being involved in mr heywood s death two of bo xilai s three brothers are wellestablished businessmen with close ties to state companies his elder brother , bo xiyong , 64 , has invested over the years , according to hong kong records , in a series of offshore investment vehicles like advanced technology and economic development , partly owned by a british virgin islands entity , and far eastern industries but little about the companies is publicly available bo xiyong is also vice chairman of china everbright international , a division of the everbright group , a giant stateowned company his annual salary is about 200 , 000 and his stake in the company during the past decade is about 10 million , based on shares he has sold and the value of his current stock options , according to public filings in addition , bo xiyong is a deputy of the chinese people s political consultative conference , a government advisory body , and until recently he served as deputy chairman of hkc holdings , a hong kong company controlled by the family of an indonesian billionaire in 2010 , the big american private equity firm tpg invested about 25 million in hkc , which specializes in infrastructure and alternative energy projects in china and has won numerous state contracts bo xicheng , the younger brother with the foundation , has ties to several companies that operated in dalian and chongqing , the two cities where bo xilai served as a highranking official his charitable foundation , the beijing xingda educational foundation , has on its board of directors the heads of two real estate developers , the dalian huanan group and chongqing tianyou , as well as weng zhenjie , the chief executive of the chongqing international trust company earlier this year , a chongqing business tycoon , zhang mingyu , accused bo xilai s police force of threatening him and protecting mr weng , who mr zhang said was a former business partner who had quarreled with him in chongqing among the advisers to the foundation , which has already raised more than 20 million , are two academics from the chinese academy of social sciences who publicly supported bo xilai s chongqing model of development the foundation owns a 2 million stake in chongqing water group , a company now valued at about 5 billion bo xicheng has served as a director of several big stateowned companies , including citic securities , one of china s largest investment houses he is also the founder of a small company that makes fire extinguishers and other equipment , called beijing liuhean firefighting science and technology , whose products are used in government agencies , luxury hotels , power plants and in tiananmen square in beijing less is known about bo xilai s wife , gu kailai , except that she opened her own law firm , with offices in various countries , and also set up several consulting firms with foreign businessmen there is also a great deal of mystery about mr bo s son by his first marriage , li wangzhi like the children of so many highranking chinese leaders , mr li , 34 , has worked in private equity and held a job at citigroup he invested in companies in dalian , on his father s turf , according to corporate filings he has been known alternatively as brendan li and li xiaobai whether bo xilai was aware of all this family dealmaking is unclear but it has become increasingly clear that the relatives of highranking leaders are in demand they are sought after because they are considered conduits of power , says laurence brahm , a former lawyer who has written books on china s economy and political scene by virtue of the fact that they are a son or daughter of someone , when they visit the provinces they 'll get red carpet treatment from the leaders there the businesspeople can tag along
omaha mitt romney rarely passes on an opportunity to respond to president obama or the actions of the white house but that is precisely what he did here on thursday as mr romney addressed hundreds of supporters while campaigning in nebraska , one of the nation s most reliably republican states , the topic of samesex marriage did not cross his lips he urged voters to focus on health care , the expansion of government and the country s debt burdens i m concerned about where we re headed with this president , said mr romney , whose message echoed republican leaders back in washington who were intent on not becoming distracted by the president s newfound declaration of support for samesex marriage since becoming the presumptive republican nominee , mr romney has struggled to keep the campaign conversation focused squarely on the economy his economic speeches have been overshadowed by a series of unrelated events , including the anniversary of osama bin laden s killing and now , the gay marriage debate in a 10minute speech along the missouri river at rick s caf boatyard and during a separate luncheon fundraising event , mr romney railed against the administration on a variety of topics marriage did not make his list but during a thursday interview on the fox news channel , as well as in a series of local television interviews , the subject could not be avoided he said that he respects the president s decision and acknowledged differing viewpoints on gay marriage , adding , this is something you can t really convince someone about as the president and his reelection team celebrated and sought to rally campaign donors to contribute money in wake of the gay marriage announcement , mr romney said , i don t think the matter of marriage is a fundraising matter and he implored voters to avoid distractions from shiny objects held up by mr obama and his advisers you have positions you describe what they are , mr romney said in the fox news interview hopefully , people are focused on the major issues of the day in the television interview , he called the marriage issue tender and sensitive , and renewed his objection to samesex marriage he called for a national standard to define marriage between a man and a woman he said that he supported allowing gay couples to adopt children , but said that he did not view the gay rights cause as a civil rights issue in a halfdozen interviews with republicans who came to see mr romney , not a single person voiced an objection at his decision not to dwell on the issue of samesex marriage they said the election would be decided on the economy , health care and mr obama s first term it s none of my business we don t need to talk about it , said mo birkel , 70 , a retired custodian from nearby papillion , neb , when asked about gay marriage i can t say if i m for it or against it because i don t know what my grandkids will be hal daub , a former member of congress from nebraska and an enthusiastic supporter of mr romney , said that it was wise for republicans to avoid falling into what he called a trap being set by democrats he said that he hoped republican activists followed party leaders and did not become distracted by gay marriage debate there is a more tolerant viewpoint in the republican party , mr daub said you can see that here in nebraska

andy benoit wraps up his analysis of the nfc north with a look at the packers he reviewed , and earlier this week he is picking the packers to win your forgiveness , please , if you think it s inappropriate to present a team as a dynastyinthemaking when that team is coming off an 01 postseason this is not meant to promote hyperbole or incite reaction \( we have espn s first take for that \) it s true , the word dynasty gets preemptively thrown around way too often these days \( thanks a lot , miami heat \) and yet , what would you say is a more accurate way to depict the 2012 green bay packers \? just because they lost to the whitehot giants in the divisional round last january doesn t mean they re looking to avenge anything that loss wasn t a case of their hidden weaknesses catching up to them , it was just an off day coming at the worst time in that game , aaron rodgers missed a few throws he normally makes there were eight dropped balls by packers receivers the offensive line could not independently hold up against a dominant giants pass rush and the packers defense was uninspiring and sloppy in a few very costly ways \( see endofhalf heave , for one \) none of these were pervasive issues throughout the year , though remember , before that illtimed bad day , this team was 151 yes , the packer defense took a step back after ranking fifth \( in yards allowed \) en route to a super bowl title in 2010 , it ranked 32nd in 2011 opponents averaged a leaguehigh 2998 yards per game throwing against dom capers s unit the data are a bit misleading , though , as the potency of green bay s offense led to a lot of garbage time or shootout games yes , green bay s defense must bounce back this season , but it doesn t have as far to bounce as you d think if it did , the packers would not have gone 151  it is green bay s glistening offense that makes the dynastyinthemaking talk sensible the reigning mvp rodgers , at 28 , is now regarded by his peers and more than a few analysts as the best player in the sport he has a cavalcade of bigplay receivers , an innovative designer of offense in mike mccarthy and a stable supporting cast that allowed this unit to post a staggering 35 points per game last season general manager ted thompson did not make many moves during the offseason because he did not have to he used his firstround draft pick on the southern california pass rusher nick perry , hopefully filling the closest thing this team had to a hole he replaced the veteran center scott wells with a cheaper , older model , jeff saturday he signed a few backup defensive ends to compete with the secondround pick jerel worthy and he made a few shuffles to the coaching staff most notably promoting the quarterbacks coach tom clements to offensive coordinator , where he will replace joe philbin , who left to become the head coach in miami this sort of runofthemill offseason is what happens when a front office constructs a sterling , longterm roster and manages the cap well no drama , no hoopla , no story lines and so that leaves dynasty talk to define the angle on the 2012 green bay packers there s not a more accurate approach the packers are young , wellmanaged and clearly the super bowl favorites let s examine this dynastyinthemaking offense first off , let s just get the aaron rodgers paean out of the way you already know about his physical tools rodgers has a strong , lively arm he does not just have great accuracy , he has great precision accuracy that s the primary reason packers receivers post such hefty runafterthecatch numbers also , rodgers s athleticism shows up every time he scrambles and throws darts on the move \( which he does quite well \) he does not rely on his legs , though , because he is so mechanically sound and poised in the pocket , even with bodies around him \( which is where the bulk of great quarterbacking takes place \) that s rodgers from a physical standpoint mentally , he s just as good he works through his progressions as quickly and decisively as any quarterback in the game he s bobby fischer at the line of scrimmage he doesn t just identify defenses , he manipulates them he has mastered the art of subterfuge before the snap , and he has mastered subtle , deceptive body language after the snap it may not matter that ted thompson could not keep the backup matt flynn \( he commanded midlevel starter s money as a free agent \) going with the untested graham harrell \( or the seventhround rookie bj coleman \) is all the same because thompson knows , as the former colts czar bill polian knew , if his starting quarterback is out for an extended period , his team is finished anyway the packers have not just put rodgers in a great system \( more on that momentarily \) , they have surrounded him with great weapons wide receiver greg jennings is a firstclass route runner who , despite having certainly good but not quite elite speed , quickness and body control , is nearly impossible to cover oneonone opposite him , jordy nelson is coming off a season in which he scored 15 touchdowns and caught 68 passes at 186 yards per pop nelson can stretch the field and , more important , make sinewy adjustments to a ball in flight behind nelson is the sagacious 37yearold veteran donald driver , who has not lost nearly as much speed as you would guess inside , if tight end jermichael finley s raw athleticism were a form of currency , he would be about 10 times richer than he is even after having signed a new twoyear , 14 million contract the reason green bay did not give the 25yearold a longer , more lucrative deal is that he has struggled a bit with injuries , mental lapses and dropped passes but it is possible , perhaps even probable , that finley is still improving that s scary finley can serve as a slot receiver , though if they want , the packers have a real slot receiver in james jones sloppy mistakes have skewed jones s image a bit , but if you look at his skills , he can be as dangerous a bigplay threat as just about anyone so can the man gunning for his job the secondyear pro randall cobb \( who is similar in style to former steeler and redskin antwaan randle el antwaan randall cobb \) there s not an offensive coach in pro football who would not yearn to have a receiving corps like green bay s what makes this one particularly dominant is the west coast style spread system it operates in mike mccarthy is superb at creating mismatches through entangled route combinations and formation variation he remains several years ahead of his time in designing plays out of the increasingly popular 3 x 1 sets mccarthy is also terrific at capitalizing on the flexibility of his personnel generally , finley is the xfactor defenses must decide whether to treat him as a tight end or wide receiver he is a much better passcatcher than blocker at this point , but defenses can t always treat him as a receiver because mccarthy has shown a commitment to using base personnel and multitight end alignments that s commendable given how tempting it must be to sling it to these wideouts all day but slightly fewer touches for the wide receivers in the name of a balanced attack would make this a much better offense in the grander scheme of things the packers are willing to throw from their heavier sets , and they have a bounty of niche players to incorporate here tight end andrew quarless is effective working off the line of scrimmage inside , and he showed during an injured finley s absence in 2010 that he is capable of occasionally splitting into the slot \( he is , however , coming off a serious knee injury and may be limited early \) hback tom crabtree is a serviceable redzone target , though mainly because defenses expect him to be a motion blocker crabtree will try to keep fending off the athletic 2011 seventhround pick ryan taylor for playing time he also has the more athletic receiving hback dj williams \( fifthrounder , 2011 \) behind him out of the backfield , james starks is adequate in the screen game \( a tactic the packers make good use of \) fullback john kuhn is surprisingly softhanded in the flats additionally , some in the organization believe that the man with the best hands on the team is the undrafted secondyear running back brandon saine , who is in line for an elevated role this season saine shows decent tempochanging ability with the ball in his hands , which could earn him touches in the running game this is one area where the packers can stand to improve in the playoff loss , the giants pass rush forced green bay s passing attack to go maxprotect and be predictable in its quick strikes most offenses would have tried to weather this storm by pounding the rock the packers , however , very clearly did not have a formidable enough ground game to rely on starks will likely be listed as the starting back heading into week 1 , but that s only titular this will wind up being a committee starks does not have the consistent burst to handle everydown duties perhaps last year s thirdround pick , alex green , will , though he must bounce back from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that wiped out most of his rookie season green , like his predecessor ryan grant , is a onecut runner who will most likely need quality blocking in order to thrive \( green will likely show a better initial burst than grant , though \) with every great offense , there is a tendency to assume that the front line is good \( that s how an undeserving saints offensive tackle has made the pro bowl each of the past two years \) really , though , in today s nfl , great offenses often have mediocre front lines that are masked by a great quarterback the packers are this way right guard josh sitton , though less impressive last season than he was in 2010 , is tremendous in all facets , but he is the only stud up front at right tackle , the thirdyear pro bryan bulaga is dependable but not yet dynamic at center , jeff saturday will prove unable to move powerful players out of a phone booth but at least he won t make any mental mistakes at left guard , tj lang will fill in the blanks , but don t expect many running plays to be designed around his pulling at left tackle , marshall newhouse will probably beat out last year s firstround pick , derek sherrod \( who suffered a gruesome broken leg in december \) , and he ll need plenty of chipblocking help against quality edge rushers or maybe he won t , because his brilliant quarterback will understand the offensive line s limitations and adjust accordingly after all , that s exactly what rodgers did last season defense the difference between the 2011 packers defense and the 2010 packers defense was that the 2011 packers defense gave up a ton of big plays that s the risk the coordinator dom capers takes with his multidimensional , often byzantine zoneblitzing scheme the big plays given up are often a consequence of the pass rush and blitzes not functioning properly the packer pass rush was inconsistent and underperforming that became painfully apparent whenever superstar clay matthews got tied up \( which happened just a tad more than usual with matthews battling minor injuries \) to correct the problem , ted thompson drafted nick perry , whom he hopes will become the second usc trojan in four years to light it up at outside linebacker scouts love perry s fluid explosiveness and violent hands he left college early and only started for one and a half seasons if his initial learning curve proves too steep , frank zombo \( a decent speed guy but not an explosive athlete \) and erik walden \( an able but slightly limited allaround player who can occasionally cover tight ends \) will see plenty of snaps or , perhaps the fifthround rookie terrell manning could get a look , though he , too , left college early and , though athletic and capable of bulking up , figures to have a challenging early transition ahead of him \( plus the packers seem more inclined to make him an inside linebacker in his first year \) a staple of any zoneblitzing defense is the firex blitz , which involves both inside linebackers rushing the agaps the packers have one of the game s best firex blitzers in desmond bishop , a former sixthround pick who is also a solid pass defender with improving instincts against the run bishop has clearly supplanted the resoundingly average aj hawk as the primary inside linebacker hawk has been a disappointment for a former no 5 overall pick , though keep in mind , average does not mean poor he is still a better option than the backups dj smith or rob francois , both of whom had good and bad moments as fillin starters last season also of note is the former starter brad jones , who is moving from the outside to the inside hawk plays a lot more snaps in green bay than he would anywhere else because in a lot of their nickel packages , the packers substitute a defensive lineman and keep four linebackers on the field in fact , the 245 is really their base defense they played that on 61 percent of the snaps last season , as opposed to just 27 percent of snaps in a 34 a twoman defensive line can often suffice when one of the men is bj raji though the 09 firstround pick was a little more upanddown last year than you would like to see , there is no reason to worry raji accentuates his 340 pounds worth of raw power with the type of uncanny quickness and agility of baltimore s haloti ngata it s just a matter of exhibiting those traits on a slightly more regular basis raji , who almost never comes off the field , plays nose tackle in the 34 flanking him is a deep rotation of ends that , the packers hope , will one day be headlined by the secondround rookie jerel worthy and possibly even the fourthround pick mike daniels coming out of michigan state , where he matured greatly between his sophomore and junior seasons , worthy drew comparisons to green bay s current end , ryan pickett if he can play to pickett s level , and show even just hints of pickett s versatility , he ll be a successful pick if he is underwhelming , as he was at the scouting combine , he ll be the next mike neal \( green bay s 2010 secondround pick \) as for daniels , he weighs well under 300 but possesses good quickness it will probably be tough for the rookie to get a lot of snaps , though , considering that the incumbents jarius wynn and cj wilson are both experienced in this scheme the packers also added the free agents anthony hargrove and phillip merling , both of whom offer upside and little risk hargrove \( who is suspended for the first eight games for his role in the saints bounty scandal \) lacks quickness but has always had a knack for making overachievers types of big plays merling , if finally healthy and focused , can be a lissome bruiser what makes capers s system great is its chicanery and flexibility often best exhibited before the snap the notsosecret ingredient is charles woodson he s the primary reason the packers spend so much time in a 245 with him , the packers are one of the few teams in football who do not feel unbearably vulnerable to the run when in nickel and woodson is such a good blitzer that , occasionally , offenses find themselves back on their heels , calling plays in reaction to what this defense is doing it s not so much that woodson knows how to get near the football \( though he does \) , it s that he knows how to influence where the football goes he attacks spots and angles better than any defender in the game though he turns 36 in october , woodson has not shown any signs of decline if he does start to leak or gets dinged , the backup jarrett bush has proved capable of filling his role in short spurts \( the second half of super bowl xlv comes to mind \) bush is not woodson s planned successor , though the packers drafted davon house in the fourth round last year and casey hayward in the second round this year \( you may have noticed that thompson is pretty prudent about investing in the future \) house projects to be a manpresstype corner , while hayward is considered to be a better zone player both could evolve into versatile forces they will be learning behind a possible future hall of famer what is amazing is that woodson can also still play man coverage from the slot and , if need be , outside the packers have two other very adroit outside man defenders in sam shields and tramon williams \( who is hoping to rebound from a shoulder injury that hindered him in 2011 and ate up most of his offseason \) at strong safety , charlie peprah was released after a failed physical undrafted secondyear pro md jennings will be his primary replacement , though when green bay slides into a traditional 34 look , woodson will move to strong safety in center field \( though also capable of playing the strong side , if need be \) is the thirdyear pro morgan burnett he is no nick collins , but the packers don t necessarily need him to be they do , however , need him to be less reactive to pump fakes and duplicitous deep route combinations with peprah gone , the top backup safety becomes the fourthround rookie jerron mcmillian  special teams in 2011 , mason crosby made more than 80 percent of his field goals for the first time in his fiveyear career the packers trust him in just about any situation tim masthay averaged a respectable 456 yards per punt last season in the return game , antwaan randall cobb is dynamic but tends to offset his big plays with big mistakes the packers are willing to live with that , though , because they believe a \) cobb will grow out of it and b \) the big plays can still outweigh the big mistakes bottom line as long as aaron rodgers is healthy , this offense will be nearly impossible to stop the defense seems too loaded at all three levels not to bounce back from a subpar year

this is a continuation of yesterday s post finding a bahrain different than the one i expected manama , bahrain there were six of us three friends who were sports journalists and three friends who were bahraini formula one fans we met at the tgi friday s restaurant in the juffair district of manama after a long day at the track the bahrainis had contacted my friend , joe saward , a longtime f1 journalist with a widely read blog , and asked if we could meet to talk about f1 and life in bahrain the other journalist was david tremayne who writes about f1 for the independent newspaper in london as sports journalists with no particular qualifications to write about the political situation in bahrain but thrown into the middle of the 14month uprising as we covered the grand prix here we were not unlike our new bahraini acquaintances that is , if they were who they said they were ahmed almahri works in a bank , hasan emad in a real estate business , yacoub alslaise is a university lecturer in information technology two of these men are sunnis , the other a shiite they said they were so close that they were like brothers we spoke mostly about formula one at the restaurant frankly , to a degree that might make a nonfan leave then , they suggested we move on to starbucks to have a coffee or tea we all had suspicions that the trio might be government plants , sent to try to sway foreign media research afterwards revealed that at least two of them were active in social media one was adept at twitter with 21 , 000 followers and another wrote letters or comments on many web sites and twitter as an average bahraini whose life was being obstructed by the uprising but , as i wrote yesterday , even among the journalists , our own feelings about life in bahrain , the uprising and formula one s coming to this country despite widespread disapproval , including among many fans were beginning to be informed by our presence in the country  we decided to hear the men out none defended the government s excesses or abuses , including the killing of a demonstrator on friday night on monday , long after our talk , more protestors filled the streets during the funeral of the victim , salah abbas habib , and on tuesday , opposition leaders held a press conference showing pictures of body riddled with shotgun pellets but none of those images had surfaced as we sat in a starbucks that could have been anywhere in the world what was most interesting for the journalists was to hear from these people who called themselves the equivalent of the silent majority they are neither members of the ruling family nor demonstrators but they clearly feel torn between the two groups they also feel that they have a great deal to lose if an islamic republic or some other form of religious state is imposed in the course of our conversation , we learned why it was important to this particular segment of society that the race take place , despite international and domestic opprobrium when i heard the announcement that bahrain was going to hold the grand prix in bahrain , i could not believe it , said hasan honest to god i had tears in my eyes i couldn t believe it that this thing could happen and i could see the cars in front of me but what did the race bring to them \? because now you are here and you are getting to know what is going on in the country , said hasan if we didn t have an f1 here , you wouldn t come to bahrain yacoub pointed out that the race was much more popular this year he said that in the past people asked around their companies or friends to see where they could find free tickets , but this year , there were lots more people buying their own tickets yacoub said , from the outset of our talk , that bahrainis have been protesting because the wheels of reform are grinding too slowly i agree with that , especially we have the bici report , and the national dialogue in july , yacoub said but we are not feeling the results of this some steps have been taken but it is not as fast as people want but at the same time , because there is escalating violence it is not realistic to do it , he said referring to implementing faster reforms despite the division between the shiites and sunni , ahmed , who is shiite , spoke of the love at least some people have for the rulers the crown prince and the prime minister are idols for us , he said the crown prince is highly targeted , same as a prime minister but the prime minister has a long experience in the country i am not saying he is perfect there have been many voices here and there say he is no good , and all the rumors but the thing is that the people in bahrain , most people , they don t want him to leave they love this man , the honor of this man , and we respect him what these men fear the most , they said , is the alternative that is being offered and suggested and fought for by at least some of the demonstrators the danger of this is that a very large portion of them follow the ayatollah who openly says he wants a theological system similar to what is in iran , said yacoub , referring to and bahrain as a modern arab country it is a multicultural country , and it has islam , sunnis , shias , a jewish community , a christian community we have people from asian backgrounds and bringing a theological system to such a multicultural country is a big joke , said ahmed for me personally i think , yes , we need to push towards more freedom , more democracy , but you need to do it in phases , yacoub continued i cannot jump right into an elected government especially with a community or society like bahrain that because of the events has turned into a sectarian monster if a shiite majority government comes into power and creates a government , i cannot trust them politically i cannot trust them because i have other examples right in front of me i have iran the three journalists left the evening having heard another side of the story , one from three friends who lead a normal , middle class existence at neither end of the extreme , but who are frustrated that their voice is not being heard by the international media but we also felt that we had now understood just how complex the situation was in this country , and that no quick fix will be possible and we left still with serious questions as to the wisdom of formula one staging its race in a country suffering such division and violence only another year passing will tell how things work out on both sides , and whether we will again meet up with our three new friends in bahrain
yes , that s what i like about me , at least one of the things , that i can say , up the republic ! , for example , or , sweetheart ! , for example , without having to wonder whether i should not rather have cut my tongue out , or said something else samuel beckett , malone dies what is character \? ordinarily , we envision character as a set of stable and unified dispositions we expect the timid employee to be shy on a regular basis , not just on some days , and we picture him as a mellow father , not as a tyrant at home since we suppose that characters are unified in these ways , we are almost invariably surprised when it turns out that the different aspects of someone s personality stand in tension with one another it is news to us that tolstoy s attitude toward his own illegitimate son was worse than aloof , notwithstanding the humanism and sensitivity of tolstoy s writings , or that richard nixon was rather a good father and husband despite his mendacity in other contexts in art , this type of incongruence between reality and expectations is often used to generate a comic effect , as when the powerful ceo who is feared by all his underlings and appears to respect no authority gets a call from his mother and , with the intonation of a 10year old schoolboy , says , yes , mom or a dramatic effect , as when the seemingly kind and charming hostess initiates a bitter quarrel with her husband as soon as the guests are gone in the context of art , it is surely a good thing that we expect unity of character and uniformity of behavior since much of art depends on either reaffirming or frustrating those expectations , and thus , on their very existence in real life , drawing false inferences with regard to a person s character may have serious practical consequences a mother who firmly believes that her daughter cannot be taking drugs because she is just not that kind of girl may end up losing her daughter to an overdose it may even lead to injustice a judge who fails to see that the convict is a reformed man may keep that convict in prison for no good reason what is the basis for our assumptions that people s characters are unified , and that their behavior in one context will resemble their behavior in other contexts \? drawing on social psychology , some philosophers , most notably gilbert harman and john doris , have proposed that the perception of unity is a result of biases and systematic errors , not of the actual qualities of the people observed i do not think the skeptical conclusion they draw is warranted , but the challenge is worth taking seriously there are , indeed , various features of our perception of other people s characters that make us prone to expect unity consider first what i would call the privileged perspective bias we tend to give priority to our own interactions with and feelings for the person we are called upon to judge , and since people are usually consistent in their behavior toward us , we form unfounded beliefs in the stability of their dispositions there is something puzzling about the fact that the girlfriend of the repeated criminal offender often manages to hold on to her belief in her lover s intrinsic goodness something puzzling , yes , but also something deeply familiar the criminal is good to his girlfriend , and that leads her to perceive him as good by nature she sees his tenderness toward her as essential to who he is , and his abuse of others as accidental , or somehow minor this is what we all do , to one degree or another , when assessing the characters of others in our lives think of a person who has always been kind to you , perhaps a colleague , a relative , or a neighbor imagine also that you are asked to describe that person you will probably say he is kind you won t say he is kind to you , you will say he is kind , period you may continue to think of him as kind even if you hear his employees , coworkers , or spouse call him difficult , obstinate or quarrelsome there are limits , of course if you learn that the kindtoyou colleague beats his daughter with a belt , for instance , you will most certainly reconsider the kindness attribution but the point remains revisions tend to lag behind the evidence because of the privileged perspective bias here , i wish merely to document this bias , not to denounce it it may well be that we see something about the kindtous person that others whose relationship with him is less amicable are missing , just as it may be that the criminal s girlfriend sees something about him that we are missing the point is simply that even when our own perspective on someone s character happens to be insightful , consistency in relation to us is not yet good enough evidence for stable character dispositions in others there is another , more general limitation on ordinary observation that inclines us to find unity where none is to be found everyday experience rarely affords us grounds to discover what people are capable of and how they would behave in novel contexts and the truth about what they are capable of may well contradict our beliefs about them for instance , we may think that most people are decent and that no decent person would cause pain to another for no good reason the results of stanley milgram s much discussed experiment on obedience and philip zimbardo s stanford prison experiment , however , suggest otherwise ordinary people can be led to administer painful electric shocks to one another for the sake of pleasing an experimenter or may cruelly humiliate their fellows if invited to play the role of prison guards these are striking results , and while there is considerable controversy over how they are to be interpreted , there is no doubt that in order to make a convincing case for the existence of character we have to accommodate those results in some way it is precisely such studies that have led philosophers like harman and doris to deny the existence of character as ordinarily conceived what are we to say in response \? the first thing to point out is that it cannot simply be that situations rather than character determine behavior , since some sort of human tendency will always be part of the explanation of action if humans had no tendency to obey , for example , the milgram experiment would not have delivered the results it delivered but to make this point is not yet to give an argument for the existence of character for we think of character traits as stable dispositions that tend to influence behavior regardless of external provocation not invariably , of course , but often enough thus , the composed person tends not to get angry even when provoked the decent person refuses to engage in acts of cruelty even under pressure to have tendencies that will manifest themselves only when provoked , or that fail to manifest when there is external pressure to behave otherwise , is not yet to have traits it could be , however , that the seemingly contradictory bits of evidence reveal not the lack of character but people s deeper tendencies this is a line suggested by the psychologist gordon allport in his response to early attacks on character mounted by stimulusresponse theorists allport tells a story of an ordinarily honest boy who spends the summer with older boys who don t give him the respect he d like the younger boy then steals candy from a store to get the others approval in allport s interpretation , the boy , while he may appear inconsistent with regard to the trait of honesty , is really consistent with himself , since his desire for peer approval has all along been the stronger motive some such explanation will often help consider again the case of tolstoy it may be that tolstoy , too , was consistent with himself perhaps , both tolstoy s compassion for his characters and his aloofness toward his illegitimate son are aspects of one master motive perfectionism suppose tolstoy was a perfectionist , as seems likely given the number of times he rewrote his novels perfectionism may have led him to develop compassion for his characters in the course of writing and rewriting his novels , while simultaneously rendering him unable to own up to the mistakes in his own life tolstoy , it seems , dealt with his illegitimate child as one might deal with a manuscript rough draft by discarding it and hiding his authorship of it from others but there is a problem with applying the master motive explanation to the milgram experiment the tendency to obey , while in one sense an aspect of character , is in another sense a sign of the lack of character for think about what we mean when we say that someone has no character we mean just that he can be led in any direction and pressured to do all sorts of things it would be a poor defense of the existence of his character if we said that really , his deeper tendency to obey united the seemingly incongruent bits of his behavior to lack character is to lack principles , to fail to be , as it were , internally motivated of course , tendencies ordinarily antithetical to what we mean by real character like the tendency to obey may , in some contexts , be a part of character a samurai who has made a commitment to do everything his master commands may very well be showing precisely character in fulfilling an order but more often than not , this will not be so still , the allport response to skepticism about character will help much of the time my second point in defense of character is this even if people are fragmented , as we all are to some extent , there must be a difference between ordinary and pathological fragmentation people who are fragmented in a way incompatible with unity of any sort are usually suffering from a dissociative identity disorder or have some other psychiatric condition the rest of us are what i would call ordinarily fragmented and ordinary fragmentation much like ordinary irrationality , which differs from madness because , in the words of one philosopher , it exists in the house of reason exists in the house of unity this type of unity is a far cry from the idea of unity inherent in our ordinary notions of character and many of us are inclined to stick to the ordinary notions this may help explain some people s resistance to absurdist theater and literature absurdist theater , unlike traditional narrative art , presents characters who are inconstant not upon occasion , but as a rule and the details of the lives of whom never add up to a coherent picture but the fault , no doubt , lies in part with those viewers , not with absurdist art if traditional art seems more realistic , that may just be because of the various biases of our perception but however fragmented we may in fact be , we can always strive for more unification this is my main point unity in character is an achievement and we have a better chance of attaining it if we take it to be a goal , rather than an existing state of affairs if we want pronouncements like up the republic ! and sweetheart ! to really mean something , we d better take these pronouncements as commitments to live up to , not as expressions of who we already are when i declare i will be faithful to you , there is , strictly speaking , something wishful about my declaration i do not know from where i shall get the strength to do as i promise it is certainly not the case that i possess a faithfulness property that can guarantee my success but this is not a pessimistic conclusion for there is nothing that guarantees failure either my past failures , in particular , do not and would you really prefer that my success be guaranteed \? i would conjecture that the answer is no the power of my declaration lies , for you , precisely in that i make a promise that i can keep only if i make an effort nothing about my character can ensure success there is inevitable precariousness in human interaction that stems from the very way in which we are built but perhaps this is just what , in our dealings with one another , gives both our success and our failure to live up to our commitments real meaning iskra fileva is a visiting assistant professor of philosophy and faculty fellow of the parr center for ethics at the university of north carolina , chapel hill she

los angeles the nation s busiest port complex remained largely shut down here on friday as a port workers' strike dragged into its fourth day , raising fears that the work stoppage could hurt the region s economy beginning tuesday , clerical workers from the international longshore and warehouse union walked off the job at the ports of los angeles and long beach seven of the eight container terminals at the port of los angeles remained closed friday , as did half of the six container terminals at long beach , and some ships had begun to divert to other ports about 40 percent of the nation s imports are handled at the ports of los angeles and long beach an estimated 1 billion in cargo moves through the ports each day , and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the region are connected to the ports clearly there is a nearterm economic impact that expands each day for longshoremen , truckers , railroad engineers and warehouse workers , said steve getzug , a spokesman for the , which represents the terminal operators anyone connected with the shipping chain is not drawing a paycheck today , because of the actions of some of the highestpaid clerical workers in america about 600 clerical workers are participating in the strike , after contract negotiations with the companies that operate the terminals stalled for more than two years but although the number of striking workers is small , they have exerted enormous influence , largely because the thousands of longshoremen who load and unload the containers from ships every day have refused to cross the picket lines as a result , business at the ports has ground to a halt union representatives say the companies have been outsourcing clerical jobs which can now be done largely remotely by computer to just about anywhere that labor is cheaper , be it taiwan , costa rica or texas the clerical workers struck last year but soon resumed work everyone can understand why big powerful corporations want to outsource as many jobs as they can , and pay workers as little as they can get away with , said craig merrilees , a spokesman for the international longshore and warehouse union workers have drawn a line in the sand to try to take on powerful employers that are sending good jobs overseas and hurting lots of communities in the process mr getzug , however , insisted that none of the companies have been outsourcing jobs because business has slowed since the economic downturn began , employees who retired have not been replaced , he said , calling the strike an effort to promote featherbedding , a practice intended to force companies to hire extra workers even when there is no work for them to do
that s amazing ! you re amazing ! that s astonishing ! you re astonishing ! for a day and a half , i had been rehearsing these phrases with the proper expression on my face a subdued , sort of quiet surprise no big emotion , just slightly widened eyes and a bland , pleasant smile my husband had suggested the phrases amazing and astonishing being words that can be construed to mean almost anything no matter what i felt when i saw my portrait , i just had to remember my lines , and i would be fine about a year earlier , i had bought a raffle ticket from someone whose choir was raising money none of the prizes listed appealed to me then i realized that since i never won anything anyway , i could designate anything at all as my preferred prize and , in effect , make a donation so i picked an oil portrait to be painted by an artist with a connection to the choir and i won i didn t know what to expect when i went for my sitting i took an industrial elevator to the fifth floor of an anonymous beige building between fifth and sixth avenues i knocked on a gray metal door , and the artist , a pretty , slender woman who looked to be in her mid30s , let me in she showed me some of the paintings and portraits in her nononsense studio , and i was all admiration they were excellent after she explained to me how it would work , she sat me down in a chair by a big window and snapped picture after picture of me while we talked at our next appointment , we looked at the photos together when the artist showed me the one she had chosen to work from , i was appalled the photo did not flatter me i sat there , unsmiling , looking straight at the camera with a small part of my face in shadow the black top i was wearing , the way i was sitting in the dark chair and the light from the window combined to create what i saw a tired , round face floating above a lumpy , undifferentiated mass she explained why , from an artistic point of view , this would make such an interesting composition i explained why , from a human point of view , i wouldn t like to live with this image of myself as i looked through the photos again , i pointed out others i thought would be better but , although she was pleasant , i wasn t sure i had convinced her several weeks passed why did it matter so much what likeness of me the artist had chosen to paint \? why did it make me so anxious \? i suppose it s because a portrait is an exterior view of yourself a photograph is , too , but a photo is the product , in part , of a mechanical object everyone knows that people are or are not photogenic even those of us who take good pictures know that sometimes the shutter closes in the middle of a blink there s also the mirror like most people , i have a relationship with the mirrors in my life , especially my bathroom mirror i compose my face in front of it , but i suppose i also compose my face before i confront it i m so used to the images that my mirrors and i have agreed upon that i m sometimes startled by a glimpse of myself in an unfamiliar mirror those images i usually ignore or forget a portrait is different because it reports how another person sees you if there is something unattractive about you in a portrait by a good artist , the odds are that , sometimes , from a certain angle , that s what you look like in real life and i had seen before , in her studio , that she was a good artist i thought i was on my way to discover what the world sees when it looks at me , and the prospect frightened me i was in the studio again before i knew it after the briefest of preliminaries , the artist pulled a canvas out of a rack and set it on an easel oh , i said spontaneously , it s beautiful i meant it the image before me was not the one i had disliked in fact , i didn t remember this image at all it was a good likeness of me in profile it didn t look like a young woman , but neither did it look like the very tired older woman the artist had wanted to paint before i objected it was the profile of a nicelooking woman the artist and i laughed together when i told her the phrases i d rehearsed and why you must think that s weird , i said not at all , she replied a portrait is a very personal thing as i think about it now , it occurs to me that if the artist had painted an image of me that i didn t like , i could have buried it in the back of a closet that s what we did some years ago with a portrait of my husband that just didn t look like him and that s what we could have said , that this portrait didn t look like me but the doubt would have lingered when robert burns wrote , oh , would some power the giftie give us to see ourselves as others see us , he was suggesting that it is rare to obtain such a perspective , and desirable i wonder now whether i should regret rejecting that first image whether the artist s first choice was , after all , that truer vision , the one that should have made me say that s amazing you re amazing ! that s astonishing you re astonishing ! townies welcomes submissions at  diana trevi o benet is a writer
fastidiousness is never a good sign in a general officer though strutting military peacocks go back to alexander s time , our first was macarthur , who seemed at times to care more about how much gold braid decorated the brim of his cap than he did about how many bodies he left on beachheads across the pacific next came westmoreland , with his starched fatigues in vietnam in our time , gen david h petraeus has set the bar high never has so much beribboned finery decorated a general s uniform since al haig passed through the sally ports of west point on his way to the white house what s wrong with a general looking good \? you may wonder i would propose that every moment a general spends on his uniform jacket is a moment he s not doing his job , which is supposed to be leading soldiers in combat and winning wars something we , and our generals , stopped doing about the time that macarthur goldbraided his way around the stalemated korean war and now comes dave petraeus , and the iraq and afghanistan conflicts no matter how good he looked in his biographermistress s book , it does n't make up for the fact that we failed to conquer the countries we invaded , and ended up occupying undefeated nations the genius of general petraeus was to recognize early on that the war he had been sent to fight in iraq was n't a real war at all this is what the public and the news media lamenting the fall of the brilliant hero undone by a tawdry affair have failed to see he was n't the military magician portrayed in the press he was a selfconstructed hologram , emitting an aura of preening heroism for the ever eager cameras i spent part of the fall of 2003 with general petraeus and the 101st airborne division in and around mosul , iraq one of the first questions i asked him was what his orders had been was he ordered to take mosul , i asked no answer how about find mosul and report back \? no answer finally i asked him if his orders were something along the lines of go to mosul ! he gave me an almost imperceptible nod it must have been the first time an american combat infantry division had been ordered into battle so casually general petraeus is very , very clever , which is quite different from stating that he is the brilliant tactician he has been described as he figured if he had n't actually been given the mission to win the war he found himself in , he could at least look good in the meantime and the truth is he did a lot of good things , like conceiving of the idea of basically buying the loyalties of various factions in iraq but they were n't the kinds of things that win wars in fact , they were the kinds of things that prolong wars , which for the general had the useful side effect of putting him on ever grander stages so he could be seen doing ever grander things , culminating in his appointment last year as the director of the cia the thing he learned to do better than anything else was present the image of the man you turn to when things get tough \( who can forget the newsweek cover , with a photo of general petraeus looking very princetoneducated in his westystarched fatigues \? \) he was so good at it that he conned the news media into thinking he was the most remarkable general officer in the last 40 years , and , by playing hard to get , he conned the political establishment into thinking that he could morph into ike part deux and might one day be persuaded to lead a moribund political party back to the white house the problem was that he had n't led his own army to win anything even approximating a victory in either iraq or afghanistan it s not just general petraeus the fact is that none of our generals have led us to a victory since men like patton and my grandfather , lucian king truscott jr , stormed the beaches of north africa and southern france with blood in their eyes and military murder on their minds those generals , in my humble opinion , were nearly psychotic in their drive to kill enemy soldiers and subjugate enemy nations thankfully , we will probably never have cause to go back to those bloodsoaked days but we still should n't allow our military establishment to give us one generation after another of imitation generals who pretend to greatness on talk shows and photo spreads , jetting around the world in militaryspec business jets the generals who won world war ii were the kind of men who , as it was said at the time , chewed nails for breakfast , spit tacks at lunch and picked their teeth with their pistol barrels general petraeus probably flosses he did n't chew nails and spit tacks , but rather challenged privates to pushup contests and went out on fivemile reveille runs with biographers his greatest accomplishment was merely personal he transformed himself from an intellectual nerd into a rock star military man the problem was that he got so lost among his hangerson and handlers and roadies and groupies that he finally had his head turned by a west point babe in a sleeveless top if only our political leadership , not to mention the iraqi and afghan insurgencies , had known how quickly and hard he would fall over such a petty , ignominious affair think of how many tens of thousands of lives could have been saved by ending those conflicts much earlier and sending dave and his merry band of doonesbury generals to the showers
in campaign stops across college campuses , and again in the debate on tuesday , has promoted his efforts to make college more affordable his record , more activist than any recent predecessor s , includes greatly expanding the federal government s role in granting college loans , increasing aid to , and even taking steps to try to stem soaring tuition though none of the questions in the were on college affordability , mr obama pivoted to that topic on his own in answering a question about gender equity , he said , we 've expanded pell grants for millions of people , including millions of young women but while many education experts laud his efforts , analysts of varying political stripes have also questioned how much impact some of the president s policies will have , noting that the prices charged by colleges , and student borrowing , continue to climb i think the president deserves a lot of credit for putting emphasis on things that were n't being talked about much raising educational attainment , expanding community college , cost containment , said derek bok , the former harvard president who has written extensively on the problems and future of higher education but i think the jury s out on whether it s effective some conservatives have pushed that critique further , saying that mr obama s policies are too costly , often assist the wrong people and could have the paradoxical effect of driving up college costs the dispute turns not just on different assessments of how policies play out , but on differing philosophical views about the role of government during his time in office , mr obama has sharply increased aid to low and middleincome students , notably through the pell grant program , which grew from 146 billion given to 6 million students in 2008 , to nearly 40 billion for almost 10 million students this year his administration also made it easier to request aid , shortening the complex federal application and allowing people to transfer their financial information electronically from the internal revenue service database on the area of assisting students to gain a college opportunity , president obama has exerted the most impressive leadership of any president in my memory , said molly corbett broad , president of the , an association of college and university presidents but conservative critics of the pell grant program contend that as government pours more money into higher education whether in grants or loans the law of supply and demand dictates that it contributes to price increases could the colleges charge what they 're charging now in the absence of federal aid \? asked neal mccluskey , an education analyst at the , a conservative policy research group the answer is no mitt romney has also called the aid expansion unsustainable , and his campaign s says he would refocus pell grant dollars on the students that need them most his stance was widely interpreted as meaning that he would cut the program , primarily by making fewer students eligible the same approach that his running mate , representative paul d ryan , took in his proposed budget yet in the presidential debates , mr romney seems to have shifted his position in the first debate on oct 3 , he said , i do n't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college he went further in the debate tuesday , promoting a state aid program he created as governor of massachusetts , saying , i want to make sure we keep our pell grant program growing college costs have risen dramatically in the last school year , tuition , fees , room and board averaged 38 , 589 at private colleges , up almost 15 , 000 from a decade earlier , according to the college board at public fouryear colleges , the total bill came to 17 , 131 , up more than 8 , 000 but behind the headlines about soaring costs , the reality is more complex and wildly uneven , because a growing number of students receive financial aid , and only relatively highincome families pay those fastrising sticker prices adjusted for inflation , the college board calculates , the average net price changed little over the last decade at private schools , and rose only modestly at public ones defending federal spending , arne duncan , the secretary of education , said that for more than 30 years , college prices had risen even when federal aid had not , leading him to believe there was zero correlation and he noted that the big increases under mr obama had come at a time of declining state support for public colleges conservatives have criticized mr obama s other college affordability programs mr obama removed banks as middlemen in making federal , saving billions of dollars a year in lender fees , some of which was used to pay for increased student aid mr romney has said he would replace that policy with a marketplace approach the president also strengthened programs that limit the size of student loan payments , based on a debtor s income , and forgive unpaid loans for some borrowers after 10 or 20 years so far , few borrowers have taken advantage of such options , and mr obama has directed the department of education to publicize them more aggressively scott fleming , an education policy adviser to mr romney , said those changes would cost the government billions of dollars by increasing unpaid loans shrinking monthly payments means extending the life of a loan , he noted , so some borrowers could end up paying much more the administration repeatedly makes the case that more people need to go to college or back to college and that much of that education should take place at community colleges mr obama has sought 10 billion in new aid for community colleges over several years , much of it to teach job skills so far , congress has approved 2 billion experts from across the political spectrum say expanding college enrollment is not enough , that both quality and price must be addressed mr obama has taken steps to curb rising prices and link federal assistance to performance we 're not just investing in the status quo we 're investing in reform , mr duncan said experts say those attempts are limited , and may not work , but they go well beyond what other presidents have done the idea that the government has put colleges on notice not to just expect a blank check is a huge change , said kevin carey , director of education policy at the  but mr mccluskey , the cato analyst , said mr obama misses the system s fundamental flaw that federal aid and loans are often awarded to mediocre students and schools , with poor odds of producing economically successful graduates the president wants to tie some aid to colleges' efforts to keep prices in check , and he has called for a contest among states to win 1 billion in grants for the best costcontrol ideas both proposals would require congressional approval this summer , his administration released a shopping sheet , a form allowing students to make applestoapples price comparisons among colleges about 400 schools have pledged to use it the administration also imposed what is known as the gainful employment rule , mandating that schools , mainly aimed at , meet benchmarks for graduation rates , student employment and debt , or risk losing access to federal loans and aid the rule was struck down in court this year , but the administration is planning a new version obama has done big things on higher education that just have n't gotten a lot of attention , mr carey said he s taken on issues that had been largely neglected
in march , one year after kemba walker led the connecticut men s basketball team to its third national championship , the huskies were ousted in their first game of the ncaa tournament , an early end to a disappointing season but connecticut will be unable to redeem itself next season because the ncaa on wednesday imposed a oneyear postseason ban as a result of the program s low academic progress rate scores connecticut is the first team from a bowl championship series conference to receive this punishment ten division i basketball teams and five teams from other sports were penalized for the coming academic year i believe very strongly that this is a gamechanger , said walter harrison , the president of the university of hartford and the chairman of the ncaa s committee on academic performance it sends a message to our teams and to our critics that we mean business he added , those teams not eligible for the postseason need to think hard about who they recruit and how they support their studentathletes the offending programs all had fouryear apr scores below the minimum of 900 from the 20078 academic year to 201011 the teams also face additional sanctions , including the loss of practice time in basketball , jacksonville state , towson , mississippi valley state , north carolinawilmington , texas amcorpus christi , toledo , arkansaspine bluff , californiariverside and california statebakersfield received oneyear postseason bans \( cal statebakersfield s case remains under review because it entered division i as a full member in 201011 \) but connecticut was the most prominent team to be disciplined it is kind of surprising we 've come this far with the apr and we still have a bigtime school that s fallen below that number , said jason lanter , an assistant professor of psychology at kutztown university and the president of the drake group , an ncaa watchdog what i 'd be interested to see is what s going to happen in the academic support unit at who s going to be held accountable for the uconn men s basketball team \? there is a chance the ncaa s committee on academic performance could review connecticut s case and include its 201112 apr scores in its portfolio , thus making the huskies eligible for the postseason but harrison said he did not expect any retroactive changes in march , the big east s university presidents voted that any team ineligible for ncaa postseason play would also be barred from the big east championships that would cast an even longer shadow on what is widely considered the nation s premier conference tournament west virginia is leaving for the big 12 this year , and syracuse and pittsburgh are scheduled to leave for the atlantic coast conference after this season any team that s ineligible would be a huge loss to the tournament , particularly a program like connecticut , said dan gavitt , a big east associate commissioner tim welsh , an analyst for sny , said he did not expect connecticut s ban to affect recruiting but he questioned the notion of punishing current players who were not responsible for the team s academic troubles these kids work hard and wo n't have that opportunity that every other team has had in the past , and none of it is their fault , he said connecticut s situation could serve as a cautionary tale for other programs , especially because the ncaa is raising the minimum apr to 930 , from 900 , over the next three years this change essentially corresponds to a 50 percent graduation rate i think the bigger story is that many basketball programs could be in jeopardy in the future , gavitt said i think the change is going to have a dramatic impact lanter applauded the ncaa for addressing the issue and continuing to raise postseason eligibility requirements , but he said there remained room for improvement i really do n't view the apr as a good standard , lanter said a 50 percent graduation rate , i do n't consider that successful we need to raise the standard to some level , but we also need to truly understand the education they 're receiving
washington forget hope and change after months of planning , president obama s media team has prepared an aggressive strategy to portray mitt romney as insensitive to the plight of working people and beholden to powerful interests they have researched possible lines of attack and drafted language that can be dropped into an advertisement at a moment s notice campaign advisers said they were willing to commit a considerable chunk of their advertising budget expected to be the largest any presidential campaign has ever seen to broadcasting these attacks the work of the obama message machine , a halfdozen outside advertising firms and inhouse campaign strategists , is already on vivid display in their ads , web videos and online features , the president wants to thwart the influence of big oil mr romney cashes their campaign checks the president saved hundreds of thousands of jobs by rescuing the auto industry mr romney shipped jobs overseas it s just what you expect from a guy who had a swiss bank account , one ad says at the center of this effort is jim margolis , and his job is to make you think of call centers in india every time you hear mr romney s name with a reporter in his studio on a recent afternoon , an unassuming mr margolis seemed harmless enough as he leaned back in a swivel chair and suggested a few revisions to a video he was editing with his staff their work that day would become part of the 25 million advertising blitz the obama campaign kicked off this week strip a few data points out of the script , he said too many numbers might confuse people swap out a clip of a smiling family and replace it with a father and son playing baseball it will look less staged but mr margolis did not become a top chef in what mr romney calls the president s hell s kitchen of negative ads based solely on his eye for a pretty picture and his flair for boiling down a good r \? m \? n 30 seconds his past work shows why he is such an indispensable part of mr obama s media team in the 2008 presidential campaign , mr margolis produced a commercial that repeated john mccain s illadvised assertion the fundamentals of our economy are strong over and over , helping to sear the phrase into voters' minds as the economy imploded that fall two years later , he helped senator barbara boxer of california win reelection against carly fiorina , the republican nominee and former chief executive of hewlettpackard , with ads that showed ms fiorina being ushered into a chauffeured car as an aide held the door one of them reminded voters , while californians lost their jobs , fiorina tripled her salary , bought a milliondollar yacht and five corporate jets mr margolis , 57 , maintains a low profile in a presidential inner circle filled with advisers who write books and appear regularly on meet the press the antithesis of a flamboyant adman his lack of visibility belies his influence in democratic circles , where he first surfaced as a 23yearold congressional chief of staff in the 1980s a contemplative man with silver hair , large blue eyes and a low , gravely voice , he has served as a close adviser to a host of top democrats , including senators harry reid , max baucus and mark warner as a debate coach , he once made mrs boxer so angry during a prep session \( he stood in very convincingly as ms fiorina \) that she had to take a walk outside to calm down he still travels to capitol hill almost every tuesday to offer strategic advice to mr reid , who says of him , he s very good at making you feel you 're better than you are if you live in a state where a presidential contest has been close at some point in the last 20 years , you have probably seen one of mr margolis s ads during the 2004 democratic primaries , mr margolis s commercials featuring senator john kerry s crewmates from vietnam recalling his heroism were credited with helping him win the nomination mr margolis and his firm , gmmb , first produced ads for mr obama in 2007 , and their work quickly stood out for its subtle edge using video from one of mr obama s speeches in iowa , he created a gauzy 60second commercial that made hillary rodham clinton sound irrelevant with a line that never even mentioned her the same old washington textbook campaigns just wo n't do it it was a beautiful spot , said mandy grunwald , who was a senior strategist for mrs clinton at the time everybody knew who he was talking about the ad s potency speaks to a fact about mr obama s 2008 campaign that often goes overlooked that year he ran more negative ads than any other candidate in history , according to the wisconsin advertising project , a nonpartisan political research group mr mccain was depicted in some commercials as out of touch and feeble one recalled him saying that he could not remember how many houses he owned well , it s seven , the announcer said dismissively the obama campaign acknowledges that fiercely attacking mr romney has risks tonally we have to be very careful about the fact that the president does have standards and does have a brand that he feels strongly about , said david axelrod , mr obama s senior strategist i think it s possible to be tough and also fair , tough and also factual and that s what we 're going to do but rest assured , we will be responding when we are being attacked putting the efforts to define mr romney aside , the obama campaign faces problems with its own message one big challenge that mr margolis acknowledged is conveying optimism about the country s progress without seeming tone deaf to the struggles that many americans still face if your house is under water or you ca n't make your car payment , i'm not going to convince you that everything is ok , mr margolis said but after he pointed out some of the president s signature accomplishments , like the auto industry bailout , he added , while none of us should diminish the hardships , we also should n't be shy about telling the story of what this president is accomplishing not that mr margolis has ever held back in the 2010 boxer race , he sent a film crew to california to interview workers who were laid off by ms fiorina fiorina never cared about our jobs not then not now , said one of the workers , his voice ringing with indignation mr margolis also created a series of commercials that year for mr reid using ordinary citizens to criticize sharron angle , his tea partybacked opponent , as reckless and erratic in one ad , a republican who is a member of the national rifle association said of ms angle s position on guns , it s crazy what was most damning went left unsaid the suggestion that he was speaking about ms angle herself mr margolis declined to discuss any ads in the works for the obama campaign but his advice to mrs boxer in 2010 may offer a hint of what is to come he would always say , 'barbara , this is a race between two choices , ' mrs boxer said in an interview 'and you need to remind people that you 're running against someone who shipped tens of thousands of jobs overseas and made her success by stepping over other people you can never forget that' photo jim margolis , who develops advertisements for president obama s reelection campaign , reviewing a commercial with colleagues \( photograph by jonathan ernst for the new york times \)
tim page , the biographer of the novelist dawn powell who had been trying to sell powell s diaries in an online auction , says that the sale has ended without his receiving any bids mr page , who is also a pulitzerwinning music critic , wrote in an email on monday that he had had four or five terrific conversations , but none with parties who were able or willing to meet his floor price 500 , 000 he said he had also spoken with someone unwilling to meet his stipulation that the diaries be made available to the public the auction site , dawnpowelldiariescom , is still up , but mr page , who said , i consider this a pretty complete failure , plans to take it down in a few days he added still think that the people who didn t buy this trove will feel a little bit like peter minuit if he hadn t shelled out those 24 for mannahatta but who knows \?
wimbledon , england imagine a pitcher in baseball retiring all 27 batters and then not learning he had thrown a perfect game until he had reached the clubhouse that is what happened saturday to yaroslava shvedova , who played a flawless set of tennis , the best by a woman in at least 44 years , and did not even realize it i was just playing every point and every game , shvedova said with a shrug she won every point , all 24 of them , and every game , all 6 of them , in that first set against sara errani the golden set , as it is called , is the sport s equivalent of an urban legend had anyone ever done it , or is it just a myth \? pete sampras , roger federer and bjorn borg never won a golden set neither had any woman since the dawn of the open era in 1968 let alone steffi graf , martina navratilova or until a 24yearold doubles specialist from kazakhstan blasted forehand tracers and backhand passing shots and volley winners on a windy saturday at wimbledon only one other professional is known to have won 24 straight points bill scanlon , in the first round of a 1983 tournament in delray beach , fla never lost a point \? said sam querrey , an american who accomplished something remarkable in his own right saturday , losing the secondlongest match in wimbledon history , a fivesetter in 5 hours 31 minutes to marin cilic the longest , played two years ago , involved john isner and nicolas mahut amazing , querrey added to me , that s almost as incredible as isnermahut consider all that can go wrong on a tennis court , especially on slick grass , especially with a blustery wind whipping around the ball can strike the racket frame it could sail just wide or long , missing the chalk by centimeters it could nick the net tape , then bounce on the same side of the court a shoelace could come untied for 15 42 on saturday \( according to an espn replay \) , none of that happened shvedova put the ball into play 44 times without making an error on the first point of the fourth game , shvedova clipped the top of the net with her backhand service return it stayed airborne , and shvedova ended the point with a thunderous backhand her biggest threat to perfection came three points later , when errani launched a defensive lob that seemed to be soaring over her head turning sideways , shvedova reached up and behind her , cracking a sky hook of an overhead that would have made jimmy connors proud it was incredible , said errani , who was dumbfounded when shvedova cracked a 108mileperhour serve up the t on a second serve on her way to winning , 60 , 64 i mean , you never do that , but you 're so confident that you try and everything s going in here might be a good place to stress that this was the third round at wimbledon , against a formidable opponent , and not some sunday breakfast league at the , errani , seeded 10th here , lost in the final to maria sharapova in her first two matches at wimbledon , she had lost a total of six games on saturday , when shvedova opened the second set by netting a forehand , the crowd at court 3 clapped and cheered i was like , what s going on \? ' shvedova said i even smiled i was like , ok , they want to see a good match' that is all she thought the fans wanted and then her coach , emiliano redondi , cornered shvedova as she was cooling down afterward i was like , really \? ' shvedova said like , not making unforced errors or not losing points \? not losing a point so it was incredible news of her feat gradually spread throughout the all england club querrey called the golden set a bigger stunner than lukas rosol s upset of rafael nadal i'm , like , speechless , querrey said serena williams , her next opponent , sounded impressed , though initially unclear i immediately thought , she won all four in a row and the olympics \? ' williams said , referring to the four grand slam tournaments i thought that was n't possible that s the only golden thing i know of then williams , who outlasted zheng jie of china , 67 \( 5 \) , 62 , 97 , added hopefully , i 'll be able to win a point in the set that will be my first goal , and then i 'll go from there like williams , brian baker has kept his expectations grounded a year ago , he was unranked in men s tennis he was preparing to drive nine hours to pittsburgh to play in his first pro event in four years he was an assistant at belmont university in nashville on saturday , he advanced to the fourth round of wimbledon he is one of 16 men remaining , a group that includes roger federer and novak djokovic and andy murray , who was apparently granted special dispensation in his match against marcos baghdatis , finishing it two minutes past the 11 pm local curfew for centre court to add another astonishing layer to his captivating comeback , baker surmounted tough conditions and the frenchman beno t paire , who lost nine straight games and his composure asked when he realized that he could play at the level required to reach the second week of a grand slam , baker smiled and said , right now in truth , it began far earlier , as he excelled as a top junior , as he recovered from five operations in six years , as he won that tournament in pittsburgh and another in georgia , and reached a final last month in nice , france on the clay there , he lost to nicol s almagro , but his confidence had soared he felt validated with his 64 , 46 , 61 , 63 victory , baker advances to face philipp kohlschreiber of germany , who defeated rosol in three sets baker s ranking , nonexistent last june and 456 in january , has climbed to around 78 for joining the top 100 , baker will gain entry into the  we 're all so obsessed in our little moments , and all of a sudden you think , gosh , where is that guy \?

at first blush bryan drury s appear to be conventionally oldfashioned portraits of the kind of men and women who have the resources to commission fauxrenaissance pictures of themselves and their family members but the closer you look , the weirder they seem , a recent graduate of the new york academy of art , produces an extraordinarily intense realism that registers pores , wrinkles and grainy skin textures as well as hair , jewelry , fabric and glassy eyes so exactingly that you might suspect a highresolution photographic under layer \( there is none \) his subjects have grim , haughty expressions vic , who resembles charlton heston , has a disproportionately small head on his bulky , businesssuited body , and he stares back at viewers with a suspicious , appraising gaze jann , whose shoulders are enveloped in an elegant taupe , furtrimmed coat , has shiny , taut skin over the protruding bones of her skull tammy wears a luxuriantly beaded halter over her leathery bare shoulders there is a reptilian feeling about these people it seems pretty clear that mr drury means to portray the souls of a certain species of coldhearted rich folks in that sense they have an amusing topicality but there is a strangeness about them that exceeds mere caricature they might be extraterrestrial beings who have donned human disguises in their mission to take over planet earth
seth jones probably should have wound up a basketball player he is tall , with a great vertical leap , and his father is popeye jones , who played 11 years in the nba and is now an assistant coach with the nets but instead , seth jones , 18 , is in the nhl draft and may be on his way to becoming hockey s first africanamerican star i 'd be shocked myself if i heard a story like that , jones said , when asked if people are surprised by the combination of a basketball father and a hockey son me and my two brothers all play hockey , so it was weird , i guess , that none of us played basketball jones , a 6foot4 defenseman with slick skating and puckpossession skills , seems to have a ca n'tmiss label sewn onto his hockey sweater he will help lead the united states team at the world junior championships in russia next week , even though he is the youngest player on the roster he was on the team for last year s tournament as a 17yearold , but an injury sidelined him just before it started now in his first year with the portland winter hawks of the western hockey league , jones has 28 points in 31 games , third among rookies , and a plus27 mark , fourth among all players on the ice he is a commanding presence , a hard hitter but more often he is the rare defenseman who can control a game s tempo with his stickhandling and passing a fullpackage defenseman , in the words of phil housley , the united states coach probably not what anyone expected from a son of popeye jones no one wants to live in their father s footsteps , seth jones said this week when the united states team held a threeday training camp at the rangers' practice rink in greenburgh , ny , before heading to europe i think the time will come when i stop getting those questions and everyone knows the story that s just my family and my background and part of my life jacob trouba , another defenseman on the national team , said he s always been popeye s son now he s turning into seth jones he s not popeye s kid anymore he s making his own name jones may not have followed in his father s footsteps , but played a large role in seth s hockey development popeye became a hockey fan while playing in dallas he arrived in 1993 , the year the stars moved to dallas from minnesota seth was born outside dallas the next year after popeye was traded to toronto in 1996 , the jones family was steeped in the game through constant exposure to don cherry and hockey night in canada when i was a guy growing up , the only sports offered to me in a small town in tennessee were basketball , football and baseball , popeye said seth s path to hockey started in denver when his father was playing for the nuggets in 19992000 , and his older brother , justin , wanted to play roller hockey with his school friends seth , who was about 5 , got a pair of inline skates , too when the weather turned cold , they received ice skates and hockey gear , but only played pickup games with other children then one day at the pepsi center in denver , popeye bumped into joe sakic , the colorado avalanche captain and future hall of famer i do n't think he knew who i was , but i knew who joe was , and i stopped him and introduced myself and said , my kids want to play hockey , and i really do n't know anything about it , ' said popeye , who is 68 he looked at how big i was and said make sure they know how to skate i'm sure they 'll be good athletes' seth took skating lessons with a figureskating instructor for a year , but what sealed hockey for him was sitting rinkside with justin and his younger brother , caleb , when the of the 2001 stanley cup finals seeing the cup in person was just unbelievable , seth said he went on to star on youth teams when the family returned to dallas and at the elite united states national team development program in ann arbor , mich , winning gold medals at the 2011 and 2012 world u18 championship \( caleb , 16 , has been invited to the program s 2013 tryouts \) the nhl , mired in a lockout and struggling to renew fan interest , would probably welcome the marketing potential of a young africanamerican star , especially if jones were to play , say , in brooklyn when the islanders move there in 2015 seth , whose mother , amy , is white , said he would prefer that race not be part of the conversation when it comes to his hockey career i do n't want to be looked at as an africanamerican , you know \? he said i want to be looked at as someone who has good character , and people know me for the person i am , not my color still , he said he understood why people asked about race anytime i or anyone can help to get kids into the sport of hockey or any sport , as a matter of fact it s huge , he said but he added that being that kind of role model can put a lot of weight on your shoulders in 1958 , willie o 'ree of the boston bruins became the first black player to skate in an nhl game , and only a few others all canadian appeared in the league over the next 20 years but as canadian demographics changed , more and more black players made nhl rosters , and by the mid1990s , it was no longer especially noteworthy to see black athletes in nhl uniforms grant fuhr won four stanley cups in five years as an edmonton oilers goaltender and was team canada s goalie in the 1980s donald brashear , born in indiana but raised in quebec , was one of the most feared fighters of the 1990s after 15 seasons and 516 goals with the calgary flames , jarome iginla is one of the most popular players in canada but fewer than a dozen africanamerican players have skated in the nhl in its 95 years of existence val james , and about half of the total are listed on current rosters only one of the players can be considered something of a star the winnipeg jets' dustin byfuglien , who as a chicago blackhawk in 2010 became the third black player , and the first from the united states , to have his name inscribed on the stanley cup \( fuhr , brashear , iginla and byfuglien are all biracial , like jones \) jones said he had never encountered a problem because of his race , on or off the ice racially charged incidents on north american rinks have become increasingly rare growing up in 1980s boston , mike grier , who retired last season after a 14season career with four nhl teams , recalled hearing occasional racial slurs from opponents and parents still , there is the occasional incident last year , philadelphia s wayne simmonds , a black canadian , was taunted by a fan who threw a banana on the ice at a preseason game in london , ontario the fan was turned in by other fans and prosecuted in the playoffs , washington s joel ward , also a black canadian , eliminated the defending champion bruins with a game 7 overtime goal , unleashing a torrent of racist comments on social media as simmonds observed after his incident , when you 're a black man playing in a predominantly white man s sport , you 've got to come to expect things like that still , jones said he had not experienced anything of that nature , and his basketball connections might prove to be the more unusual part of his background basketball and hockey do not often overlap alex ovechkin is one of the few nhl players with a basketball background his mother starred for the soviet national team los angeles lakers point guard steve nash played hockey while growing up in canada jones acknowledged that the two sports did not have much in common , but said he learned from watching basketball players the persons i watched closely were dirk nowitzki and jason kidd , he said , recalling when his father was an assistant with the dallas mavericks you 'd see dirk back there behind the scenes taking jump shots before and after games , before and after practices it just taught me to keep working hard when no ones s watching , and the person you are behind the scenes is your true self seth never played organized basketball , but some of popeye s basketball dna seems to have rubbed off we played basketball in ann arbor a lot the last couple years , and he s got a lot of talent , said brady skjei , a united states teammate who spent two years with jones at the national team development program great hands , a soft stroke , a terrific shot jones said i actually am pretty good at basketball , i have to admit i have a nice twoway game , i think popeye and seth disagreed over which of them would win a game of oneonone basketball but popeye , who was chosen in the second round of the , figured seth would top him in draft position he s passed his dad , and that s pretty cool , popeye said
newark in the end , as the minutes wound down in game 5 on saturday night , as they had in game 4 , the officials never had to think about pulling the stanley cup from its protective case the , who were poised to parade it around a rink in celebration , proved in two losses to the that they may still be the better team , but that they are not ready to hoist the prize they proved the theory that the final win is the hardest , and perhaps that the stanley cup will not be won cannot be won \? until you have done something truly  it s disappointing , but they do n't hand this thing out , kings defenseman matt greene said it s difficult to do it s a test you 're going to lose two games in a row you 're going to lose on the road the kings had been trying to skip all of that they cruised through the first three rounds , two game 4 losses hardly qualifying as trying circumstances before game 4 of this series , they were poised to match the matchless 1988 oilers for the best record ever in winning the cup they had not lost a single road game the kings \? a no 8 seed with a franchise r sum of exactly one cup finals appearance 19 years ago \? the hockey gods would have none of that what else can explain how the kings could outplay the devils so completely in the first period of game 5 and come up with nothing but the imprints of the rings they skated around the devils and the post justin williams dented with a shot that should have been goal no 1 \? they had done the same in a long stretch of game 4 , playing well enough to win and yet not winning in game 5 , for all that early dominance , the devils' zach parise collected one horrendous gaffe of a clearing attempt by kings goalie jonathan quick and stuffed it into the net for a major piece of comeuppance sure , you can look at that and go home and think , woe is me , if the puck would have bounced this way or that way , ' williams said hey , those are the breaks you make your own breaks you make your own luck now things get kind of hard , although going home for game 6 on monday still seems to be a fairly cushy punishment to their credit , the kings did not appear frustrated or putupon to a man , they talked about sticking to the approach that got them this far they pushed away the idea that the pressure was mounting in the devils , though , the kings have encountered the terrier that will not let go of their pant leg the devils are a smart team with a levelheaded coach , experienced enough to know after they fell behind , three games to none , that the deficit would not be made up in one game the devils' game plan became much simpler they just had to hang on , make the kings work for their success , make them earn the cup i thought we survived out there , devils goalie said i do n't think we played our greatest game , but we found a way to win these are important games to win , especially at home brodeur has become a living example of how to hang in there at 40 , he is , by most measures , the greatest goalie of all time he could have strolled into retirement years ago , with the devils mired in mediocrity , with enough accomplishments already to fill three careers but born out of equal parts childlike love of the game and sheer stubbornness , brodeur refused to fade away now everything he does seems heroic he has made some amazing , acrobatic saves , but even his routine ones seem to lift his teammates , as if every one reassures them marty s still there the best of brodeur s saves have come in staving off disaster these past two games , breakaways stuffed with deft poke checks or pucks kicked away by pads thrown high in the air in game 5 , these moments were greeted with thunderous approval from devils fans because brodeur seemed reason enough to believe that this team can think about doing the nearimpossible i wish i was that eloquent that i had more ways to phrase it for you , devils coach peter deboer said when asked about brodeur his performance speaks for itself it s the timing of it you know , i think the fact we 're 91 or 101 in games 4 through 7 in a series is a testament to how he enjoys that type of pressure for the record , the devils are 101 in games 47 against the panthers , flyers , rangers and kings when he was done with his interview session with reporters after game 5 , brodeur labored to push himself up from his chair he descended the few steps from the podium slowly and gingerly , age and fatigue finally hinting at their presence but he was still smiling he is still here we 're still alive , he said we have a chance it s not a difficult thing to get yourself ready for games like that now it s been two in a row it drains you a lot it takes a lot out of you but it s worth it for at least another game , stubbornness held off the parade
in a confederacy of bachelors , on the cover of last sunday s metropolitan section , hilary howard profiled four men , all approaching 40 , who have mostly lived together since college hundreds of readers commented on the story on nytimescom , expressing support , envy and disdain for the arrangement a selection of comments is belowi hope they can look back in many years and say it was worth it my wife of 23 years is my best friend , lover and confidant we have a happy and healthy relationship \( as well as normal issues \) my adult children give me great pleasure and joy all the trials and tribulations of raising a family were worth it for these guys , i only wish them the best , and hope that they live the life that they want , without regrets but family is something i would never trade a moment of my single friends' lives for ever alec , miami as far as we 've come as a society , it s clear we are still in the dark ages when it comes to things like marriage and family oh sure , society says it now accepts families of all types but yet we continue to see terms like settling down \( the implication being that if you are not settled down married or in a committed relationship you must be an unsettled person \) or we see terms like family man , conveniently oftused by politicians , lawyers , etc , as a way to show a man s trustworthiness or stability \( the implication being that those who are therefore not family men must therefore be less trustworthy , stable , etc \) i applaud these guys for doing their own thing society needs to stop pressuring people to conform \( ie , marriage and kids \) and let people do whatever feels right for them avina , nyc i want to hang out with these guys ! though i 've only got one roommate , i'm in my mid30s , and this is essentially my current lifestyle i do n't know if it s my forever lifestyle but the beauty is , it does n't have to be , and i do n't have to decide that now i know it must raise eyebrows to some , but you should understand when you keep your expenses low , you free yourself to make your choices based on desire instead of fear i do n't mean desire in a salacious way i mean that you can pursue something creative if that s what is calling to you at whatever scale you 're less bound to the needs of others that might sound like escaping adulthood , but it s not adulthood is knowing what responsibilities you are willing to undertake , and shouldering them sara tonin , astoria , ny i did this for 20 years in williamsburg until they changed the zoning , evicted us and turned my neighborhood into suburbia i remember palpably feeling the shame of approaching 40 and having conversations about being single and living with a grown man the social stigma is really quite amazing now that i'm over 40 , i simply care less about what other people think i do believe that men who are in the creative class , and are freelancers , do n't have the feeling of security required to start a family and this security may be a combination of cultural factors as well as very real economic realities perhaps something as simple as universal health care would see this trend disappear but i will say , for all the cohabitation scenarios i 've ever had , none have been more fun , satisfying and supportive than those years spent with my bros designthis , rosendale , ny why is this even considered strange \? they have a familylike group , with mutual support plus independence not only more economical than living alone , it is also a greener way to live bc , belmont , ma i agree with many of the comments here however , what i find a bit disturbing about this article is that it does seem to reinforce how there is a segment of the population that seems to be stuck in a state of arrested development at some point , i think responsibility should kick in and it s not entirely unreasonable that people should try to aspire to jobs that enable them to save for retirement and or cover health and other expenses the longer people defer or avoid doing this , the more likely it is that they will become dependent upon social programs \( eg , medicaid , unemployment benefits , etc \) to serve as their safety net , and who pays for all that \? the rest of us if the past few years have proven anything , it s that there are increasing demands and strains on all those social programs with diminishing funds to replenish them while these guys may be living a life that is suitable to them and fun to an extent , there is an element of irresponsibility , immaturity and lack of sustainability involved ekack86178 , new york , ny this is why nyc is such a vast wasteland for us singles single men here do n't want to grow up maryjane , ny , ny as their landlord , i can attest to what a great bunch of guys they truly are of course , this will not stop me from increasing their rent shortly heh , heh anastasios sarikas , new york city photo brotherhood from left , rick brown , shyaporn theerakulstit , luke crane and danaher dempsey , roommates for years \( photograph by brad vest the new york times \)
philadelphia just before the opening faceoff of the ' playoff game against the on sunday , claude giroux of philadelphia skated over to his bench he wanted to tell his teammate danny briere something briere leaned in close watch this shift , giroux said six seconds in , giroux flattened sidney crosby with a check twentysix seconds later , giroux scored i did n't even know what to say to him , briere said the fans at wells fargo center did a crowd that teemed with the sort of nervous energy produced by the penguins' stirring revival erupted , swallowing giroux and the flyers in cathartic joy behind another dominant game by giroux , who figured in their first three goals , the flyers ended pittsburgh s comeback bid with a in game 6 in becoming the first team to advance to the eastern conference semifinals , the fifthseeded flyers bounced a team widely viewed as the stanley cup favorite and its showcase players , crosby and evgeni malkin out of the playoffs there s a lot of regrets in this room , pittsburgh defenseman brooks orpik said starting , perhaps , with goaltender marcandre fleury , who allowed 26 goals in six games according to the elias sports bureau , fleury is the first goalie since andy moog in 1991 to give up as many as 26 goals in a playoff series of fewer than seven games on sunday , fleury gave up four goals on 22 shots he barely moved as erik gustafsson s 50foot wrist shot zipped by for a 30 philadelphia lead at 5 minutes 25 seconds of the second period i think it s real satisfying to be able to move on against that team , flyers coach peter laviolette said a lot of people picked them , so we were underdogs for six games , the flyers and the penguins engaged in a highscoring joy ride \( 56 goals \) that featured two thrilling philadelphia comeback victories a 10goal outburst by pittsburgh the flyers' staggering powerplay efficiency \( 12 for 23 \) and an ugly game 3 that stretched the boundaries of fair play there were also marvelous individual performances , like the flyers rookie sean couturier s outstanding twoway play and pittsburgh center jordan staal s hat trick to stave off elimination in game 4 but no one else dominated quite like giroux he finished the season as the nhl s thirdleading scorer but , if possible , elevated his play in the playoffs only one player in flyers history amassed more points in a playoff series \( tim kerr , 15 , in 1989 \) than giroux , who had 14 , including six in game 2 to set a franchise playoff record he was possessed , briere said giroux was angry immediately after pittsburgh won game 5 , splintering his stick against the goal early sunday , he told laviolette he wanted that first shift he took 27 more , logging 24 48 of ice time , the most among flyers forwards when the best player in the world comes up to you and tells you , laviolette said , adding , that says everything you need to know about claude giroux right there that s correct , laviolette called giroux the best player in the world , a phrase often applied to crosby or to malkin malkin scored the penguins' goal sunday , but he was prone to disappearing for long stretches like malkin , crosby finished with 8 points in the series , but he lapsed into periods of inconsistency on sunday , he was minus 3 i would have liked to get a little more going , crosby said the flyers would not let him they filled passing lanes they bottled the slot they forechecked and backchecked with intensity and as promised by scott hartnell , they blocked shots 40 of them , 12 more than their regularseason high where s that been \? flyers defenseman kimmo timonen said , laughing he added , if we want to help ilya bryzgalov out , that s the one way we can help block every shot the flyers did not block every shot , leaving bryzgalov , their mercurial goalie , to handle 31 he saved 30 none were particularly memorable , but for bryzgalov , steadiness trumps quality it was his best performance of the playoffs , though bryzgalov was not in the mood to rank it why you asking a question like that \? he said you are reading too much of the newspaper asked if he was tired , he agreed it was a 12o'clockinthemorning game , bryzgalov said , referring to the noon start i woke up too early by dispatching the penguins , bryzgalov and the flyers earned a few days to rest their next opponent is unknown , but whoever it is would be wise to watch sunday s game from the beginning , even before the first shift
have another victory , their first since todd benzinger caught carney lansford s foul pop to win the world series with s election to the hall of fame on monday , the became the last championship team from the prewildcard era to be represented in cooperstown by him going to the hall of fame , his teammate eric davis said by telephone on tuesday , it s like we made the hall of fame the first postseason with wild cards was 1995 few stars from the champions since then have appeared on the ballot of the 90 teams to win the title before 1995 , however , all now have at least one player or manager in the hall of fame from the boston red sox of cy young to the toronto blue jays of roberto alomar and paul molitor with larkin , the picture is complete wow , larkin said tuesday how about that \? larkin was at the waldorfastoria in midtown , slipping into a hall of fame jersey , meeting with reporters and posing for photographs as the newest member of baseball s most storied club he is 47 now , but he looks almost the way he did when he helped the reds to a championship few could have predicted in 1989 , larkin had injured his elbow in a relay competition before the allstar game in anaheim , calif the reds limped to a fifthplace finish and lost their manager , the cincinnati icon pete rose , who was barred from baseball for gambling it left us with an insecure feeling because we did n't know where we were headed , davis said for us , getting lou piniella was a breath of fresh air we had a fiery type of guy with baseball knowledge from one of the greatest organizations  but larkin said that piniella , a former yankee , made some people nervous because he had not talked with many players before spring training in plant city , fla in his first meeting with the team , piniella surveyed the clubhouse and said , in salty language , that he hated to lose and would not accept it then he left the room jackie moore says , ok , boys , let s go to work , ' larkin said , referring to a coach we went wire to wire that year after over pittsburgh in the national league championship series , the reds faced the heavily favored oakland athletics , who had swept the 1989 world series and the 1990 american league championship series they were loaded with star power i remember the buildup , larkin said i remember the feeling in the clubhouse , the talk about mcgwire , canseco , carney lansford , dave stewart , eckersley , steinbach , all these guys they had we opened up the cincinnati paper , and i remember one of our rally cries was they 're not even talking about us they 're talking about everyone on that team' eric davis was rallying us at that time they do not respect us' davis , now a special assistant to the reds' general manager , said he was actually bothered more by the lack of respect from the athletics players besides rickey henderson and willie mcgee , davis said , none of the a s even spoke to the reds during the workout before game 1 to davis , they seemed to be sneering , as if to intimidate the reds , who had almost no world series experience but the reds knew the oakland pitchers well several had recently pitched in the nl and davis had a plan against stewart in game 1 i had faced him in the allstar game , davis said he threw me a firstpitch fastball and i took it , and then he threw four splitters in the dirt and walked me so if he was going to start me off with a fastball , i was not going to take it and everything else is history davis s tworun , firstpitch blast in the first inning of game 1 sent riverfront stadium into delirium , sparking a 70 victory behind jose rijo the reds beat eckersley , a future hall of famer , in the 10th inning of game 2 , and then blew out the a s in game 3 cincinnati wrapped up the title behind rijo in game 4 , larkin starting the gamewinning rally with a single off stewart in the eighth inning larkin batted 353 in the world series , and never played in another one  the reds were in first place when the strike halted the 1994 season in august they lost the nlcs to atlanta the next year , and lost the wild card to the mets in a onegame playoff in 1999 larkin turned down a trade to the mets the next summer , signing a contract extension to finish his career in his hometown the 1990 triumph was his career highlight as a player , that was the reason why i competed , to try to win the world series , larkin said this trumps a little bit of everything right now , but as a player , that was the culmination , that is what we were there for norm charlton , rob dibble and randy myers the nasty boys set the standard for postseason bullpen dominance , and few hitters have ever had a better world series than billy hatcher and chris sabo , who combined to go 18 for 28 against the a s besides larkin , nobody s career approached cooperstown injuries halted davis s ascent and all but ruined rijo by age 30 paul o'neill became a fourtime champion with the yankees , but collected just 22 percent of the vote in his only appearance on the hall of fame ballot some of the team s best players rijo , myers and tom browning each received a single hall of fame vote larkin was only 26 in 1990 , with his best years ahead of him the world series served notice that the nl s next premier shortstop had arrived he was taking the step to unseat ozzie smith , davis said everybody saw the writing on the wall barry larkin is not coming anymore he s here
it was nov 25 , 1963 , three days after the kennedy assassination , and the powerful columnist was calling the neophyte president already , had penned a personal letter to lyndon johnson offering his support the phone call was an attempt to offer something more advice the advice itself , nearly five decades later , hardly matters what is striking is the tenor of the conversation although alsop doles out the requisite flattery you 've already made a marvelous start , he says he is insistent that johnson would be wise to follow his counsel when johnson objects , he respectfully pushes back he even cuts the president off wait a second , now , he says , in a faux british accent when i heard recently , i could n't help thinking boy , those must have been the days the person who sent me the link to that recording , which was declassified in the 1990s , is david auburn a pulitzer prizewinning playwright , auburn has written entitled the columnist it opens on broadway on wednesday and stars john lithgow what you get from listening to that phone call , auburn told me the other day , is that alsop does n't think johnson knows how things work , and he is going to explain it to him the assumption of authority is just incredible what is likely to amaze younger theatergoers living , as many do , in a world of bloggers and anonymous critics and a fractured , often ideologically driven journalism is that journalists ever had that kind of authority but the great columnists of the postwar generation did their columns were part of the weaponry of policymaking , and they themselves were powerbrokers none were more overt about this than alsop his power stemmed less from the fact that his column appeared in 300 newspapers than from the fact that he had the ear of every important person in washington during the eisenhower years , he had fought against joe mccarthy , a courageous stance , given that he was gay and homosexuality in that era was a potential career ender he was also the social dean of georgetown , whose dinner parties included cabinet members , senators and sometimes even the president the night his good friend jack kennedy was sworn in , after the inaugural balls were over , the secret service drove the new president to alsop s house , where the two men talked nearly till dawn robert w merry , the editor of , and the author of , also a prominent journalist , wrote that kennedy often divulged highly sensitive information to alsop , knowing that he would n't use it unless the president gave him the goahead kennedy and everybody else in official washington trusted him completely of course , alsop trusted them every bit as much the heart of auburn s play is the way alsop s faith in his official sources his friends , really led to his downfall a staunch supporter of the vietnam war , he refused to listen to anyone who dared to say it was going badly in the play , he calls , the times s washington bureau chief , hoping to convince him to fire david halberstam , the paper s reporter in vietnam by the time alsop retired in the mid1970s , he had become a laughingstock , an embittered man whose onceformidable authority lay in tatters here in 2012 , of course , there are still plenty of washington dinner parties attended by prominent columnists and government officials but it s not the same the national consensus that alsop once represented no longer exists politics is fragmented and angry and , certainly , no high government official is about to divulge a state secret to a columnist over drinks not if its supposed to stay secret somewhat to my surprise , both auburn , who is 42 , and merry , who is 66 , did not view this as an unmixed blessing a tremendous amount of information came out of those dinner parties that was then conveyed to the american public , merry told me they served a purpose auburn appreciated the fact that the phony controversies that crop up all the time now medicare death panels , for instance were much less frequent because the leading journalists of the day would n't give them voice but auburn , who is a voracious reader of blogs , also said that one of the things he really likes about the blogosphere is the incredible diversity of opinion many of the people i read are not journalists , he said but they sometimes have amazing knowledge and depth i have to agree it would be heady , certainly , if i could call the president and insist that he try my ideas and i imagine that my life would be quite pleasant if i could write from the mountaintop the way joe alsop did instead , i'm just one voice among many we 're all better off for that being the case
in the mansion of happiness a history of life and death \( knopf \) , jill lepore examines the ways in which we ve historically defined where life begins , where it ends and how it should be conducted while it lasts in a recent interview via email , ms lepore discussed why death is a less contentious subject than conception , why the word parenthood had to be invented and more below are excerpts from the conversation most of the chapters in this book started as essays in the new yorker , where you re a staff writer was this a case of seeing a theme emerging after you wrote the magazine pieces , or did you always plan to include them in a book \? one day , i was playing the game of life , the board game , with a mess of kids , and i wasn t quite sure how , but it seemed different than the game i remembered playing as a kid so i bought an old game , from 1960 , and it was different and i got to thinking , i bet you could write a whole history of life by studying games of life , because they go way back they re ancient , and they re like tiny time capsules i ended up writing an essay about milton bradley a year after that came an essay about stuart little , which i m sure i wrote because i had been reading a great deal about the history of the stages of life , including childhood not long after that , i happened to write an essay about the history of the breast pump you d think i might have figured out that these essays had something in common years passed , and i kept meaning to return to the library all the books i had checked out for the initial essay , but i kept needing them for one thing or another so i held on to them until one day , i opened up a letter from the billing department at harvard s widener library to discover that i had racked up 6 , 000 worth of fines for overdue books my first thought was , of course , oh hell but my second thought was , hey , maybe i ve been writing a book without knowing it daft of me , but there you have it you say the word parenthood dates to the middle of the 19th century why was it necessary to label that as a phase of life \? and why then \? adulthood used to cover it , because to be an adult was , almost always , to be a parent you grew up , you had kids your kids grew up and then you died demographers talk about the demographic transition that began in the second half of the 18th century the fertility rate began declining and life expectancy began rising more people began living longer , while having fewer children so the part of your life when you were an adult , but not a parent , got bigger also , and significantly , this happened first among wealthier families , for whom , by the middle of the 19th century , a whole new literature of parenting advice was being written by the beginning of the 20th century , that development intersected with the rise of the massmarket magazine i write in the book about the history of parents magazine , which started in the 1920s its premise was that if you grew up in a small family , where you didn t raise 10 brothers and sisters , and then you started having children late in life , and you had only a few , you probably didn t know what the hell you were doing one thing i felt keenly while reading was the ignorance of even great minds , based on when they lived in history aristotle knew about as much about how babies are made as a curious but confused schoolboy what lifeanddeath answer do you think we re most confident about now that might turn out not to be true \? most everything , probably no one stands outside time about a hundred years ago , lillian gilbreth promoted the notion of happiness minutes , the idea that , if you could live your life more efficiently , you d have more time for joy she said stuff like this if you make a lemon meringue pie in just any kitchen , you have to walk about 224 feet cupboard to counter , counter to icebox , icebox to stove and so on but if you used her design for a more efficient kitchen , you could make that pie in only 92 feet leaving all kinds of extra time and energy for happiness minutes picture a bain consultant telling you how to downsize your melancholy , and you might have some idea of what she was up to gilbreth s work now reads as so wacky that it s very fun to write about it the problem is that writing about what is so delightfully nutty about happiness minutes can make it seem as if we know better we don t we just know different , and maybe not as different as we think gilbrethian efficiency is all over the place today aristotle was wise gilbreth was smart my grandmother , who taught me how to cook , didn t know how to read kant , freud , darwin lost on her she kept her stove in her cellar because that s where she kept her tomatoes also , she liked walking up and down the stairs everything took forever but she knew a whole lot about death and sorrow and happiness , and it never escaped her that life s an awful mystery speaking of aristotle , he divided the ages of man into three youth , the prime of life and old age but as you write , we ve since invented adolescence , middle age and various other stages are there practical consequences for all of this microclassifying \? mainly , the more faddish and newer stages of life are really just marketing schemes tweenhood the young old the quarterlife crisis you can sell a lot of junk to a lot of people by inventing a stage of life and giving it a name i m surprised the case of karen quinlan , which you cover extensively , is not as common a part of the vernacular as roe v wade as we become more preoccupied with debates about endoflife care , is the question of when death arrives going to overtake the question of when life begins as a contentious subject \? has it already \? the karen ann quinlan case is where the right to life and the right to die got bound together , and i don t think they ve ever gotten untangled the end of life is sometimes deployed politically sarah palin invoking death panels , for instance but nowhere near on the scale of the beginning of life i wonder if it s because while not everyone has faced an excruciating decision about a pregnancy \( and some people would insist that there is no such thing as a decision about a pregnancy \) , very many people have faced a decision while watching someone die i had to spend a lot of time in icus over the last few years , and i just don t see people in those rooms looking smug and ready to tell other people how to act , or what s right and what s wrong , when it comes down to the next decision about the next test , the next drug , the next procedure you say , matters of life and death are not , inherently , partisan why not \? and if not , why did they get that way \? in modern american party politics \? in the late 1960s and early 1970s it s not that matters of life and death weren t the subject of fierce political debate before then , but in those years , the twoparty system realigned itself around these issues , which is horrible , because , while there are only two parties , matters of life and death don t generally have only two sides making these matters partisan makes them impossible to resolve , or even to talk about in any humane way over the last four or five decades , a great deal of political discourse has been reduced to a hamfisted rhetoric of freedom and murder it s as if there are only two possible issues and only two possible positions either abortion is freedom and guns are murder , or guns are freedom and abortion is murder none of these issues and positions existed , in exactly this form , before 1968 i find that strangely comforting because something that has a beginning has also got an end
kibbutz lohamei hagetaot , israel it is n't only the history of the holocaust that you see on display in israel s holocaust museums it s also the history of the history of the holocaust there is an archaeology of trauma to be found if you look closely , and in its layers and transmutations you see how a nation has wrestled with the burden of one of history s immense horrors through examining how israeli museums treat the holocaust including the here , in a in the far north of the country , whose founders included survivors of the warsaw ghetto uprising we can see how visions of that past are changing , sometimes in unsettling ways one museum on another , smaller kibbutz , for example , was described in the newspaper for its new emphasis on sound and lighting effects , including a simulation of a cattle car heading to a death camp the director of the museum at the ghetto fighters' house said that it would increasingly emphasize the broadest lessons of the holocaust an ethical imperative of tolerance that could influence israeli society and when creating the most powerful exposition of this history i have seen it too modified its approach , with a new focus on feelings and individual stories these changes have different meanings and effects , and some are familiar from museums devoted to the subject in other countries but in israel this is far from a mere museological matter the major holocaust institutions , for example , are on hilltops offering grand vistas at the ghetto fighters' house , which may have been the first holocaust museum in the world to open , in 1949 , you emerge from its tales of darkness onto a bright plaza , overlooking an aqueduct , an outdoor amphitheater and the plains stretching toward the sea a companion institution at the kibbutz , , may be the world s only children s museum devoted to the holocaust you , as if it were a tear in the texture of ordinary experience gradually the walls close in sound effects are meant to simulate a child s preverbal experience inscribed along the way are brief recollections , almost heartbreaking in their simplicity everyone will look at my yellow star and they 'll know she s 6 , and she is jewish and you emerge from that journey into illumination first through a gallery about children who survived , and ultimately into the galilean landscape and , of course , the sits on its own hill , the mount of remembrance in its latest incarnation , with a new exhibition design by dorit harel , and with , the history is recounted along a zigzagging path , leading upward through a cement gash in the mountain , emerging into daylight , overlooking the jerusalem hills even the poor relation of these at , a kibbutz in the south named after the leader of the warsaw ghetto uprising , creates a similar drama , calling its whole exhibition you literally walk downward into the historical narrative and gradually work through tales of resistance until you emerge again into the landscape , in which important battles were fought during israel s war of independence these museums deliberately treat the landscape as a part of the history indeed , as a resolution from the start , that was one meaning the holocaust took on the founding of the state of israel was seen as an answer to the holocaust and a deliverance from it that is one reason that the annual holocaust remembrance day here is observed by a moment of nationwide stillness a siren sounds , commerce halts , and  museums reinforce that connection between the holocaust and the state it has become so strong that it has even led to a distortion of the history by some who twist the connection into cause and effect , presuming that the state was created as a guilty compensation for the holocaust rather than as something that emerged as a result of nearly a century of development the association between the holocaust and the state initially had a very different significance , highlighted in the themes of the ghetto fighters' house and yad mordechai both were established during the early decades of a nation left with only intermittent episodes of peace at the time an element of shame was associated with the seeming passivity of jews who were murdered in europe so the emphasis of these institutions was at first placed not on survival , but rather on rebellion exhibitions at the ghetto fighters' house , for example , focus on jewish resistance , ranging from an escape by prisoners from a fortress prison in kovno \( now kaunas \) in lithuania to the secret recording of history in various ghettos a wall at yad mordechai is inscribed with the name of every camp and ghetto where rebellion occurred the museum s displays also make a connection between those battles and the resolute history of the kibbutz itself , which held off egyptian forces after war was declared on the fledgling state in 1948 just long enough to prevent their march toward tel aviv as recently as june , hit the kibbutz but because both of these kibbutz institutions also developed out of branches of leftwing zionism , which would have been wary of forms of nationalism associated with the israeli right , a mixture of sentiments has emerged there in recent decades these founding lessons can take on different emphases one recent tendency is to generalize what was once particular so in 1995 was established by the ghetto fighters' house , stressing what it calls the universal lessons of the holocaust rather than national ones , attacking indifference to the suffering of others when i recently spoke with , she mentioned plans for programs to encourage tolerance between jews and arabs none of this is evident in the exhibitions right now but a similar strategy is employed by that attempt to draw lessons of tolerance from the holocaust , most notably the museum of tolerance in los angeles \( which has been involved in a in jerusalem \) at yad mordechai , whose approach is more dated than the one at the ghetto fighters' house , attempts to create relevance have been more a matter of adding new display technology than any rethinking of the museum s mission but the museum s director at the time , vered bar samakh , told haaretz in 2011 that the institution should incorporate notions of peaceful coexistence and deal with racism and xenophobia you have to learn a lesson from everything , she said i do n't want to get into it , but the abuse at the checkpoints of the warsaw ghetto bridge is n't far from what s happening today at our checkpoints in judea and samaria this view , thankfully , is not explicit in the museum but it suggests that temptations are strong to replace historical analysis with sentiment that is more of a risk for yad mordechai than a disneyfied approach , which is not particularly effective and has already been toned down the museum now has a new director , anat pais , and plans for an exhibition about poland between the world wars but some pedagogical efforts in both museums emphasize less the need for resilience in confronting murderous ambitions than the need for tolerance , broadly applied this concept is familiar from american holocaust museums , which also search for broad relevance as the last generation of survivors dies but it leaves holocaust museums intellectually orphaned what lessons are we supposed to take away \? the impulse has been to generalize , to say that a holocaust museum ca n't be just about the murder of jews during  why \? is there a problem , say , with an american slavery museum being just about american slavery \? why should holocaust museums deal with notions of tolerance or racism in general , or even genocide in general \? why do we think that the proper lesson comes from generalizing rather than comprehending the particular \? the moment we generalize , we strip away details we lose information and create equivalences that may be fallacious in israel , as the earlier lessons of museums are being submerged , there has been an increased focus on simulating the , trying to spur empathy feelings are evoked because nothing else can be assumed this is to be expected at yad layeled , which is a children s museum , but elsewhere it has serious limitations this has even affected yad vashem , with its new attention to individual stories is this an example of that museum s response to contemporary nonchalance , an attempt to seduce us into shock \? no yad vashem is a stunning counterexample it may imply a traditional , national lesson in its presence and placement it was , after all , founded by a knesset law in 1953 but it scrupulously avoids moralizing or posturing the museum offers no lessons and promises no relevance the stories , facts and analyses accumulate until you begin to comprehend something beyond comprehension the museum s implied conclusion is sensed rather than taught after the harrowing history , you are brought back , finally , to the present , in somber gratitude
goliad , tex fourteen illegal immigrants were killed sunday outside this rural south texas town after the pickup truck they were riding in veered off a highway and struck two trees , the authorities said a total of 23 people , from guatemala , honduras and mexico and all in the country illegally , had been crammed into the cab and the bed of the pickup truck when the driver lost control around 6 30 pm sunday the truck , a white 2000 ford f250 superduty extended cab pickup , slammed into the trees on the side of the road off northbound us highway 59 , about 10 miles southwest of goliad , officials said eleven men , one woman and two young girls died nine others who were injured remain in local hospitals , state and federal authorities said it was unclear why the driver veered off the road , but a spokesman for the texas department of public safety , the state s top law enforcement agency , said a crash reconstruction team was investigating whether tire failure might have been a cause the crash was one of the deadliest singlevehicle accidents in south texas , where a series of crashes involving vehicles filled with illegal immigrants have claimed numerous lives in recent months and years in april , a minivan crashed and rolled over near mcallen , killing nine people inside the vehicle had been filled with 16 illegal immigrants , all of whom had been picked up from a socalled stash house and were being transported to their next destination when agents pulled it over the smugglers of illegal immigrants often use the highways and roads to travel from the border to houston , dallas and other cities north , or to head from the border to a south texas stash house an apartment or rental home where they wait for the next leg of their journey there have been a number of accidents , gregory palmore , a spokesman for s , which was assisting in the investigation , said of fatal crashes involving illegal immigrants even if there s one fatality , there s more than there should be state officials said none of the 14 victims in the goliad accident had been identified , and it was too early in the investigation to say where the truck was heading or where it had been coming from the driver was among those who died at the site of the crash , about 145 miles from the mexican border , there are two northbound lanes of the highway and one southbound lane investigators marked the truck s tire tracks with bright orange paint , highlighting its path as it veered from the northbound passing lane and down a ditch to the line of trees at the side of the road when state troopers and sheriff s deputies arrived at the scene sunday evening , only six people were found in the truck the rest had been ejected i 've been here stationed in victoria for 36 years , and this is one of the worst ones i 've seen , said trooper gerald bryant , who works in the nearby victoria office of the department of public safety by monday afternoon , the truck had been removed from the base of the two thick trees , which were scuffed but still standing the crash occurred on a straight stretch of highway in the daylight in dry weather though illegal at the united statesmexico border has declined in recent years , the south texas area has seen an increase in activity in the customs and border protection s rio grande valley sector , which includes the site of the goliad crash , more than 2 , 000 illegal immigrants were apprehended this fiscal year as of may in nearly 80 stash houses , up from 1 , 012 in 69 stash houses in all of the 2011 fiscal year
first things first cutting social security benefits is a cruel , stupid policy just not nearly as cruel and stupid as raising the medicare eligibility age but sometimes you have to accept bad things in pursuit of a larger goal health reform should have included a public option heck , it should have gone straight to singlepayer but a flawed route to universal coverage was better than none at all the question about this looming deal is whether the end justifies the means unfortunately , it s not nearly as clear a case as the health care deal , and i m agonizing , big time as of last night i was marginally positive , right now marginally negative let s talk about what s going on first of all , the comparison has to be with what we think obama can get if he goes over the cliff if that happens , all the bush tax cuts expire , and he can propose and probably get accepted a new round of middleclass cuts but nothing else no extension of unemployment benefits \( another cruel , stupid action \) , no infrastructure spending to boost the economy so how does the possible deal differ \? it doesn t raise rates on the secondhighest bracket , which means that the tax hike on earned income only falls on those making 400 , 000 or more as i understand it the reporting is weirdly silent on this , but it s what i got from my own conversation with an sao is that taxes on unearned income are going back to prebush levels capital gains at 20 instead of 15 percent , dividends taxed as ordinary income if i m wrong about that , this is easy no deal and there s extra revenue too , notably from changing the treatment of itemized deductions instead of being a deduction from taxable income , they offer a tax credit , not to exceed 28 percent which means a further substantial tax rise for people in the top bracket overall , there s more revenue in this deal than you get from letting the highend tax cuts expire after the cliff so the revenue side isn t that bad we do make some headway on unstarving the beast on the other hand , i really don t think of revenue as opposed to preserving the social safety net as being the most important thing also on the plus side , extended unemployment benefits and more infrastructure spending but no payroll tax cut extension , which means a fairly big dose of austerity despite the deal but then there s the social security cut switching from the regular cpi to the chained cpi doesn t affect benefits immediately after retirement , which are based on your past earningswhat it does mean is that after retirement your payments grow more slowly , about 03 percent each year so if you retire at 65 , your income at 75 would be 3 percent less under this proposal than under current law at 85 it would be 6 percent less there s supposedly a bumpup in benefits for people who make it that far this is not good there s no good policy reason to be doing this , because the savings won t have any significant impact on the underlying budget issues and for many older people it would hurt also , the symbolism of a democratic president cutting social security is pretty awful so is what obama gets out of this basically unemployment benefits and infrastructure worth it \? the hardship of the unemployed is important on the other hand , the numbers here are only about half a percent of gdp as i said , right now i m not feeling positive i understand that obama prefers not to go over the cliff and face the political and economic uncertainty that this opens up maybe my assumption that he can still get the middleclass tax cuts is wrong on the other hand , cutting social security , even modestly , is a very big concession , especially because , as i said , it s cruel and stupid viewed purely as policy one thing is for sure any further concession on obama s part would make this a total nonstarter and i m waiting for clarification on capital gains and dividends but even as it stands , it s not a deal to be happy about so am i dead set against \? no , i m still agonizing very uncomfortable times sao senior administration official
re \( march 11 \) your summary of readers' complaints about the times s coverage of the reasons to bomb iran seems fair enough , although one must also question the united states' right to bomb iran where is the right \? the united nations charter prohibits the threat and use of force by states in the conduct of their international relations yet , from vietnam to iraq , and now iran , the editorial page of the times has failed to apply this most fundamental rule of international law to the threats and use of force by the united states the news pages have done so only sparingly more than 40 years ago , publisher arthur ochs sulzberger and editor abe rosenthal bravely risked federal prosecution and prison time by publishing excerpts and analysis of the pentagon papers what does the times risk today by holding presidents and congresses accountable to laws with which they are formally obliged to comply \? is this mere legalism \? whom did the illegal wars in indochina and iraq benefit \? the warmakers and lawbreakers have had their day for too long let s not give them any more howard friel northampton , mass  i think your discussion of the iran issue is fairminded , but there is an important gap you suggest that there are two competing narratives the narrative of war and a counternarrative of uncertainty and caution but that s really only one narrative the narrative of war vs uncertainty about it thus even when you are questioning the war narrative , you are not really offering an alternative based on the times s coverage , how else are readers to think about iran s behavior other than they may be mad mullahs \? i suggest that the alternative narrative would be a cycle of mistrust this idea is based on the political science theory of the security dilemma a situation in which each side s efforts to increase its own security threaten its rival , leading to a spiral of escalation that may result in an arms race , crisis or war according to the mistrust narrative about iran , reasonable iranians notice that the iraqi and libyan regimes , which gave up their unconventional weapons programs , were destroyed by the west a few years later while north korea , which tested nuclear weapons , was left alone thus prudent iranians \( especially iranian officials \) want at least the capability to build nuclear weapons , even if they have moral or practical doubts so they resist international pressure to give up that option hardline americans' talk of regime change or of military attack would , in this view , be dangerous , increasing iranian determination to pursue this regimesaving deterrent capability this is a real , and plausible , alternative narrative stuart j kaufman newark , del  you do not need real iranians in order to get a more balanced iranian point of view regarding american israeli plans for a possible war to stop that country from becoming the 10th \( 10th ! \) nuclearweapons state many american professors of politics and history \( most notably juan cole of the university of michigan , an expert on shiite islam \) could disabuse your readers of their constant diet of misinformation relating to iran having hostile intentions \( it has not started an aggressive war in two centuries \) and threatening to wipe israel off the face of the map \( the original persian of that oftcited phrase related to time not place the zionist regime would pass and was expressed in the passive voice , implying no agency on the part of iran in bringing that about \) occasionally consulting a persianspeaking source like professor cole could help you a lot michael sullivan rydal , pa re \( march 25 \) i am a strong supporter of our democratic system and journalism s role in preserving and strengthening that system the on uniview technologies and mitt romney s connection to its use of video surveillance by the chinese government was simply poor journalism there was no news none and i say that as an obama supporter there is no hypocrisy in having a blind trust \( which , by law , romney ca n't direct or control \) invest a relatively minuscule amount of money in any company it may be an interesting aside to note the unusual connection , but frontpage placement \? this was less a story than a gift to all romney opponents jeff pozmantier houston  as a lawyer who has negotiated blind trust arrangements for executive branch appointees and trust agreements generally , i 'd like to add to your commentary first , the blind trust concept is used by the executive branch to separate decisionmaking from personal financial gain in fact , the beneficiary is not supposed to know how the trust is invested these arrangements are thoroughly negotiated that is clearly not the case in the romney situation since he knows enough to report his holdings on financial disclosure forms , etc he and others morph the concept into who has investment authority , which is not the same thing among other matters , both the trustee and the investment adviser are fiduciaries , and they are highly unlikely to retain or make an investment in a bain capital partnership without the consent of the beneficiaries second , at the time of the romney taxreturn disclosure , the trustee was called on to defend an investment in swiss francs a bet against the us dollar other articles have covered bain s aggressive transfers of jobs offshore , and here it is an investment in a surveillance company these would not be attractive positions in a presidential portfolio despite the blind trust argument and are worth prominent coverage adam sonnenschein cambridge , mass  at the risk of simplifying your column , i have to say so , what s new \? your analysis of the issue was elegant but has been known in newspapers since the american revolution my high school english teacher alerted me to how journalism and layout can affect a reader s perception the question i would have liked you to have addressed is why \? why does the times do this and , statistically , on what subjects or political leanings \? why is the times trying to entice the readership subconsciously with its placement of content , use of type size or frontpage prominence \? among other esteemed style guidelines , your own times guidelines do n't seem to address this either patrick d batchelder newark
it seems to make little business sense not when amazon s dominance continues to threaten brickandmortar storefronts and not when the economy has already claimed many small businesses none of that , however , has deterred aurora anayacerda from pursuing her dream it took six years , but her quest to open a bookstore , la casa azul , has finally come to fruition this has been an incredible journey , overwhelming at times , ms anayacerda said so many people have told me they share my dream to have this as a community space is something we 've all wanted for east harlem a mural on the outside of the store , which specializes in latino literature , in english and in spanish , depicts the faces of julia de burgos , pedro pietri and piri thomas literary icons whose works have helped promote puerto rican culture raising awareness for these figures is part of ms anayacerda s mission to help el barrio s latino community get in touch with its heritage and history this is going to be a mecca for writers from all over the country , said rich villar , a poet , who attended the store s opening on friday la casa azul lies at the nexus of a changing neighborhood at east 103rd street and lexington avenue plush condos and gritty bodegas stand side by side a large mexican restaurant is just steps away , reflecting the demographic shift of recent years ms anayacerda herself was born in mexico , before her family moved to california when she was 5 in 2005 , she was captivated by el barrio on her first trip to the east coast it felt like home , really comfortable i could see myself living here , she said two years later , i moved it was a oneway ticket no job , no friends i gave myself three months if i did n't have a job after that , i would go home she found a teaching post at an afterschool program , before also going to work at el museo del barrio coordinating educational initiatives throughout that whole time , while i was working these two jobs , i was also planning to open a store , ms anayacerda said her love for literature goes back to childhood , when she was surrounded by books at a very young age my mother says that i'm a reader from the womb , because she would read a lot even when she was pregnant , ms anayacerda said literature played an important part in my life , and the bookstore idea started from there , she added but financial problems got in the way last year a bank loan was denied at the 11th hour , as ms anayacerda was about to sign her lease she then raised 36 , 000 in online and private donations and received an interestfree matching loan from an investor , which enabled her to secure the space la casa azul \( the blue house \) is named after the painter frida kahlo s home in the outskirts of mexico city , and ms anayacerda hopes to create a similarly intimate atmosphere marlene pratt , who helped open the store , said of ms anayacerda she designed it with the concept of her grandmother s house you see all the mexican colors , nice and bright , but they complement each other it s a modern interpretation ms pratt is a founder of casa latina , a home and lifestyle brand serving latino communities she arranged a 5 , 000 furniture donation from ikea to la casa azul the store s basement reading lounge is filled with comfortable seating , and will serve as a gallery , while its backyard provides extra space for private or educational events artists will be coming every week , july through august , to teach different art projects , ms anayacerda said we will also have film screenings on the patio , author readings , and a 'meet the agent' workshop for writers if history is any predictor , ms anayacerda will have to be as creative as possible to keep her dream alive a few blocks away , another bookstore , cemi underground , closed in 2009 , just two years after opening we held events every thursday and friday comedy , poetry , open mic nights and the place would fill up , said luis cordero santoni , a graphic artist , who had started the store and who also works for the metropolitan transportation authority i think we produced 150 events in two years , he said but the problem was that during the week , there would be very few sales i was not making enough to sustain the bookstore ms anayacerda said she was fully aware of the economic perils she may face but she said her past experience working at six bookstores made her as prepared as i can be i'm taking on the challenge at full speed , because i think it s important for the community , she added sery colon also had unpleasant experiences trying to sell books the oldfashioned way not only did he work at cemi underground , mr colon was also the owner of agueybana , a latino bookstore on the lower east side that shuttered in 1998 when the rent increased fourfold one time , i remember somebody called to ask if i had a specific puerto rican book , and he dared to tell me it was 2 cheaper on amazon , he continued that s what killed me mr colon still occasionally dabbles in the trade at a market outside el museo del barrio recently , he made just one sale all day , yet he still believes an appetite for literature exists in east harlem you need to know where you are , what kind of people you 're serving , and what books interest them you cannot carry just what you want to carry these cautionary tales have not discouraged ms anayacerda , who was in high spirits as a long line of people formed outside la casa azul on its opening night it feels amazing and surreal , she said this place is just how i dreamed it this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo a display at the grand opening of la casa azul on friday in east harlem the independent bookstore , named after the home of the painter frida kahlo , faces an uphill battle for survival \( photograph by brad vest the new york times \)

san francisco almost all creatures , great and small , are welcome in the city of st francis , patron saint of animals , whose spirit imbues this place with a love and regard for our nonhuman friends take just one example gleaned from census and city data dogs outnumber children here , making already assertive dog owners an even more formidable political force but the emergence in recent years of coyotes in the city s parks , and sometimes in its expensive backyards and picturesque streets , has raised doubts about whether that founding legacy can survive will the two animal worlds the domesticated and the wild be able to coexist \? might they even , as many in this liberal city hope , ultimately complement each other \? taking no chances , city officials recently cordoned off trails and barricaded a restroom in an area of where reports of coyotes following dog owners and approaching unleashed dogs have been rising the coyotes are believed to be protecting their den and newborns during the puprearing season , which lasts from april through august coyote alert signboards and posters , as well as those warning dog owners to keep their pets on leash , have been put up in golden gate park and other pockets where coyotes have been sighted reports of coyotes killing dogs have come in , though none have been substantiated this season some of it , we do n't know how real it is and how much of it is people raising the hysteria level , said rebecca katz , director of the city s  the other day , ms katz said , someone called in a coyote attack on a pet pig we went out there there was no pig , no coyote so yeah the barricades had also upset some people so it becomes more and more escalated that way , she said last week , animal care and control sent out a stern warning that san franciscans do not seem to be getting the message about how to coexist peacefully with local wildlife because many dog owners were ignoring the law and letting their pets run loose animal care posted of an offleash rottweiler , filmed by his owner , harassing two coyotes apparently protecting a den some dog lovers were left unconvinced by the city s plea for coexistence i'm not fond of wildlife this is as wild as i want it to get , said david powers , who was walking honda , a mix between a rottweiler and german shepherd , near the barricaded restroom one recent afternoon this is a city they belong in the country i 've never seen any thank god , he said , about half an hour before a lone coyote appeared at that spot and lingered more than long enough to satisfy joggers who stopped to take pictures with their iphones in san francisco , a city of 805 , 000 , there are 108 , 000 children , according to the 2010 census and there are 180 , 000 dogs , and 10 coyotes , according to city estimates the coyote population has grown nationwide , with an increasing number making forays into suburban and urban areas coyotes arrived relatively late here , with the first sightings in 2004 around that time , a coyote was videotaped crossing the golden gate bridge into the city at night genetic tests later confirmed that the city s coyotes share ties to those found to the north , on the other side of the bridge in 2007 , the city had to call federal authorities to shoot two coyotes that had attacked a pair of dogs in golden gate park since then , the city has emphasized coexistence usually , the kneejerk response is , problem wildlife let s trap and kill , said camilla fox , executive director of project coyote , a private organization based in marin county that has worked with several cities , including san francisco , to educate people about coyotes san francisco has been very proactive though some dog owners accepted the coyotes' presence grudgingly , others embraced it in glen canyon park , matt orrick said he walked his mutt , lazlo , at least twice a day and regularly spotted coyotes at dusk he had never experienced an encounter , though he kept lazlo off leash they 're doing their own thing , he said it s pretty cool this is a big city , and there are wild animals
valencia , spain over the past two years , ana mar a molina cuevas , 36 , has worked five shifts a week in a ceramics factory on the outskirts of this city , handrolling paint onto tiles but at the end of the month , she often went unpaid still , she kept showing up , trying to keep her frustration under control if she quit , she reasoned , she might never get her money and besides , where was she going to find another job \? last month , she was down to about 130 in her bank account with a mortgage payment due on the days you get paid , she said at home with her disabled husband and young daughter , it is like the sun has risen three times it is a day of joy mrs molina , who is owed about 13 , 000 by the factory , is hardly alone being paid for the work you do is no longer something that can be counted on in spain , as this country struggles through its fourth year of an economic crisis with the regional and municipal governments deeply in debt , even workers like bus drivers and health care attendants , dependent on government financing for their salaries , are not always paid but few workers in this situation believe they have any choice but to stick it out , and none wanted to name their employers , to protect both the companies and their jobs they try to manage their lives with occasional checks and partial payments on random dates never sure whether they will get what they are owed in the end spain s unemployment rate is the highest in the euro zone at more than 25 percent , and despite the government s labor reforms , the rate has continued to rise month after month before the crisis , a worker might let one month go by , and then move on to another job , said jos francisco perez , a lawyer who represents unpaid workers in the valencia area now that just is n't an option people now have nowhere to go , and they are scared they are afraid even to complain no one is keeping track of workers like mrs molina but one indication of their number can be seen in the courts , which have become jammed with people trying to get back pay from a government insurance fund , aimed at giving workers something when a company does not pay them in valencia , spain s thirdlargest city , the unemployment rate is 281 percent and the courts are so overwhelmed that processing claims , which used to take three to six months , now takes three to four years since the start of the crisis in 2008 , the insurance fund has paid nearly a million workers nationally back pay or severance in 2007 , it paid 70 , 000 workers it is on track to pay more than 250 , 000 this year , and experts say the figures would be much higher if not for the logjam in the courts often the unpaid workers , like mrs molina , whose company is now in bankruptcy proceedings , hope their labor will keep a struggling operation afloat over the long run unemployment benefits last only two years , they point out , and they wonder what they would do after that but in the meantime , they cannot even claim unemployment benefits and no amount of budgeting can cover no payment at all beatriz morales garc a , 31 , said she could not remember the last time she went shopping for herself a few years ago , she and her husband , daniel chiva , 34 , thought that they had settled into a comfortable life , he as a bus driver and she as a therapist in a rehabilitation center for people with mental disabilities his job is financed by the city of valencia , and hers by the regional government of valencia they never expected any big money but it seemed reasonable to expect a reliable salary , to take on a mortgage and think about children in the past year , however , both of them have had trouble being paid she is owed 6 , 000 euros , nearly 8 , 000 they have cut back on everything they can think of they have given up their landline and their internet connection they no long park their car in a garage or pay for extra health insurance coverage mr chiva even forgoes the coffee he used to drink in a cafe before his night shifts still , the anxiety is constant there are nights when we cannot sleep , he said moments when you talk out loud to yourself in the street it has been terrible , terrible mrs morales said it was particularly hard to watch other mothers in the park with their children while she must leave her own toddler to go to work , unsure she will ever get paid we are working eight hours , and we 're suffering more than people who are not working , she said the couple s pay has been so irregular that they are having a hard time even keeping track of how much they are owed , because small payments show up sporadically in their account the regional government would not address the dimensions of the problem , when questions were submitted in writing instead , it offered a statement saying it was doing its best to pay its debts we are aware of the difficulties faced by many associations and suppliers caused by the delay in payments from the public administration , the statement said the region of valencia , it said , was working to overcome this crisis at the earliest opportunity , understanding that paying contributes towards activating the economy often enough the workers' patience has not paid off more than 300 , 000 companies have gone bankrupt in spain over the last few years on a recent morning , workers began lining up outside the valencia offices of the government insurance fund even before it opened the mood was grim most would get only a fraction of what they were owed recently , the government reduced the maximum reimbursement of 1 , 700 a month to four months , rather than five many in line were secondguessing their decision to keep working , feeling that their employers had taken advantage of them some could barely contain their fury several construction workers described how they had lived at a job site , working 12 to 16hour days because the construction company assured them that getting a job done early would guarantee payment it did not i know i will never get what i am owed , said tudo vrendicu , 38 , who moved to spain from romania nearly a decade ago and worked on the construction site free for months , occasionally getting 65 from his boss we came here for a better life , but this is a nightmare it is unclear how many workers are being taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers officials of the insurance fund , which seeks to retrieve the money it has paid out from companies that are behind in paying salaries , said they simply did not consider this question however , it is one that gnaws at many unpaid workers crist bal hern ndez , a chef at a 750room hotel in the resort town of benidorm south of valencia , said the hotel had been totally booked and still the workers were owed money it is the same , he said , for most of the other big hotels in town we keep trying to figure it out , he said where is the money going \? we think it may be going to hold up the owner s other businesses mr hern ndez said the hotel workers had recently threatened to go to the press , a threat that got them some of their back pay but , he said , none of the workers were eager to take that route , for fear it would kill the hotel s business and with it their jobs he asked that the hotel not be named for that reason this is our living , he said some employers say that they are doing their best , but that their customers frequently pay late , or not at all others say they have gone to great lengths to pay their employees one , who refused to be identified because he did not want to advertise his real estate company s financial problems , said his family had sold a beach house and a space in a parking garage to pay employees their commissions earlier this year we know that all our employees have their own obligations mortgages , families , he said paying wages on time is sacred it is an act of faith some worker advocates worry that the backup in the courts is giving abusive employers extra leverage workers hang on longer because they know that giving up and going to the courts will not get them any cash soon the companies understand all this , said mr perez , the lawyer , who said some workers were simply pressured into accepting less than they were owed it s shameful at home recently , mrs molina said she had sometimes used her credit card to pay her mortgage but she considered herself luckier than most at least her family has been able to lend her money when she needed it , at least for now still , she has to fight off anger as she puts in the hours and has nothing to show for it i try not to let it get to me and , over all , not to pass the bitterness on to my family , she said that s not going to feed us

the photosharing app instagram on thursday completed a full retreat from its proposed new terms of service that led to instant outcry from users , nicole perlroth and jenna wortham reported the question , however , was whether the move came too late from instagram , which was acquired this year by facebook and is under the same pressure as its parent company to generate advertising revenue the proposed changes included a clause that suggested instagram would share users data like their favorite places , bands , restaurants and hobbies with facebook and its advertisers to direct ads more precisely in the interim , other services , including flickr , which coincidentally has just introduced a new app , appeared to be gaining followers the boston globe on thursday appointed a new editor , brian mcgrory , a bostonarea native who began his connection to the newspaper as a paperboy , christine haughney reports he has been a columnist , white house correspondent and metro editor in his 23 years there , yet was something of an unexpected choice mr mcgrory succeeds martin baron , who was picked to be the next editor of the washington post after marty baron s extremely successful tenure here , we don t need any overhaul , said christopher m mayer , the publisher of the globe , which is owned by the new york times company gil friesen , who helped establish am records with the band leader herb alpert and music promoter jerry moss , in the 1960s , died in los angeles on dec 13 at age 75 , paul vitello writes he was one of the first employees at the record company , which took the a from alpert , and the m from moss mr friesen , mr alpert said , was the ampersand in the middle he encouraged the company to produce movies too , and later became a founding partner of the classic sports cable channel , which was sold to espn in 1997 for 175 million thus , mr vitello writes , he became known in hollywood as one of the few executives with entrepreneurial successes in music , film and tv on thursday night , the mtv series jersey shore signed off after a sixseason run that introduced characters like the situation and snooki the real jersey shore has been in people s thoughts because of the destruction there from hurricane sandy expect the show and its cast to quickly fade away , never to return , ken tucker writes for entertainment weekly at the top of the piece , he frames his question what is jersey shore s lasting significance , its enduring impact \? his answer absolutely none you would be forgiven for stopping right there , but he continues but by any measure , there is nothing about jersey shore that merits enshrining it in any category of tv history other than time killer as i can attest in preparing to write this piece , it doesn t hold up as entertaining in reruns it already plays like one of those ancient artifacts of papyrus a newspaper , i believe they were called that has been crumpled and tossed to the air i wrote that justinbieber has millions more followers than pontifex oss romano says pope has more retweets per follower than bieber !  rachel donadio nyt \( racheldonadio \) 21 dec 12
beirut , lebanon rebel commanders in the northern syrian city of aleppo vowed sunday to liberate it from government control as intense street battles there entered a third day while the fighting appeared to be spreading in aleppo , skirmishes in damascus petered out on sunday as large numbers of government troops were deployed to shut down the rebels in one neighborhood after another where they had gained footholds last week we have cleared qaboun of terrorists , and now we are going to finish them off in other sections of damascus and beyond , said one soldier wearing camouflage fatigues who was interviewed on syrian state television the television report and videos posted by activists from qaboun , a northeastern suburb of the capital , reflected a situation similar to that reported in several other damascus neighborhoods where fighting erupted last week state television showed deserted streets strewn with rubble and an occasional body rotting in the sun , and video from qaboun showed asphalt streets torn up by the tracks of armored vehicles opposition activists said the government used tanks , artillery and rockets fired from helicopters to subdue various areas fighting apparently still flared on sunday in parts of mezze , a western neighborhood , where videos on youtube showed columns of smoke rising but syrian government television sought to portray life in the capital as returning to normal , highlighting video from the midan area , a battleground last week , where cleanup crews were seen wielding brooms and happy citizens heard declaring that the bakery was selling bread again another report by syrian television featured interviews with people from a neighborhood where it said that citizens had asked the army to intervene they thanked god that they no longer had to live in fear , now that the terrorists the government s usual term for its opponents had been chased away and security restored the lengthy report said the syrian army was winning the battle on many fronts , including damascus , hama , homs and other cities , because of the army s long experience confronting terrorism and imperialism president appeared on state television on sunday for the second time since the assassination of four top security officials wednesday in a bombing in damascus this time he was shown though not heard meeting with his new army chief of staff an emergency meeting of arab league ministers in doha , qatar , ended with what the qatari prime minister , sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr althani , told reporters was agreement that mr assad should step down and that the rebel free syrian army should form a transitional government mr assad has resisted such calls from the united states and other powers in aleppo , the opposition fighters seemed to be using momentum gained in the last week to spread the fight into new districts of the city a report on state television purported to show traffic circulating normally , and claimed that foreign satellite channels were spreading false rumors about fierce clashes in the city but a video from opposition activists seemed to show a column of tanks moving into one aleppo neighborhood and spraying machinegun fire into alleyways and apartment houses as they passed neither version of events could be independently confirmed activists said that rebel fighters had the upper hand in three aleppo neighborhoods sakhour , salaheddin and meridian and opposition figures said they were pressing government forces on several fronts , including the area around police headquarters near the city center the clashes that started in earnest on friday were the first sustained fighting in aleppo , the largest city in and the country s main commercial center , which had been a bastion of support for mr assad since the uprising began in march 2011 we issued the orders for the march into aleppo with the goal of liberating it , and from there to liberate the rest of syria , said a man in a crisp uniform who appeared in an opposition video the video identified him as col abduljabber mohammed aqidi and said he commanded the unity brigade , a newly announced coalition of rebel fighters around aleppo he is heard encouraging government soldiers to defect to the opposition , and vowing that the rebels would protect members of president assad s minority sect , the alawites , who account for many military officers and government officials our war is not with you , but with the assad family , he says in the video in remarks addressed to alawites another youtube video purported , somewhat confusingly , to show the joint command of the unity brigade , with six men in camouflage fatigues or street clothes at a table , none of whom are colonel aqidi they , too , are heard asserting that a battle to liberate aleppo from the government had been joined we call on all supporters in aleppo to cooperate with the mujahedeen and to support them , one of the men says in the video , adding that any rebel fighter who tampered with public or private property would be punished the last rebel fighter to speak in that video offered an insulting allusion to the president s surname , which means lion in arabic the battle has started to liberate aleppo from the assad battalions , he said a dog remains a dog , even if you call him a lion
boston the role i played in the boston tea party was relatively small samuel adams , the hotheaded patriot , called on me in the meeting hall on many occasions during the years before our independence was declared 236 years ago , adams had , no doubt , run similarly fiery meetings , honing his rhetorical skills , learning just how to set mobs into action even when the moderates among boston s merchants had been satisfied by compromises with george iii and the british parliament , he fueled more radical ambitions for independence and he was doing it again james brewer ! he called out , looking directly at me from his speaker s perch i know you to be an eloquent man \( he was shrewd with his flattery \) i heard that your house needed new windows how did you manage to pay for them during the dark days of the townshend acts \? \( he was reminding me of british attempts to collect taxes , by fiat , on the most ordinary materials \) i glanced at the card i had been given on taking my seat , and like one of the other colonists who had just been called on , i tried , in reading it , to match adams s tone i did pay for them ! i cried i was forced to choose between new windows or putting food in my family s bellies ! and amid accumulating huzzahs and cries of shame ! , the roster of english perfidy finally drove the 30 or so of us who had , by chance , come together for the noon tour at the newly reopened , to leap to our feet and follow adams down the gangplank to a deck of the beaver it was one of the three ships that had been docked in boston harbor that night of dec 16 , 1773 , with their cargo of 342 chests of tea on which a heinous british tax was going to be applied the next day every american schoolchild knows what happened next disguised as american indians , several dozen bostonians boarded the ships and tossed the chests and all their contents overboard , a tea party that inspired similar demonstrations in new york philadelphia charleston , sc and other ports , and led to roiling confrontations with the redcoats that erupted into the revolutionary war in more recent times , of course , its name has been adopted by a political movement that deliberately echoes colonial accusations of unjust taxation true to script , once we were on the beaver , another costumed interpreter led us to chests of tea , which , he teased , could weigh hundreds of pounds each , and encouraged the many children in our touring midst to toss them overboard then , breaking with the illusion for a while , he hauled the light wooden boxes back onboard so other children could have a turn now i am not generally a fan of historical reenactments , participatory history and costumed recreations , even in so great a cause as life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness and in boston , where like the and the survive , is such a manufactured experience needed \? this museum , for all its evocation of the period and its location it is mounted like a pier in the water in fort point channel , just a few hundred yards from where the tea party took place is not even that interested in authenticity but there is still a valuable historical function this museum can fulfill , even if very little about it is profoundly historical and that is worth exploring the museum is owned by , whose other attractions range from the in key west , fla , to the museum s earlier incarnation was destroyed by a lightning fire in 2001 rebuilding and relocating , according to the museum s executive director , shawn p ford , was a 28 million project \( including public funds and an 18 million loan from the \) the ambition , mr ford explained in an interview , is to come within 100 , 000 of the halfmillion visitors a year that the museum had after it opened in 1973 , and the nation s bicentennial celebrations began and as the museum s hourlong tour ends , commercial transactions are encouraged in a tea shop costumed servers might banter about their lives or the making of tea \( 1495 prix fixe with pastries \) to customers before they enter the extensive gift shop the museum also wants to attract visitors by providing an entertaining and inspirational message , not by presenting original artifacts or by adding complicated perspectives authenticity is merely the intended impression the two ships used for tours are actually modifications of 20thcentury fishing vessels by the shipwright leon poindexter , using historical models \( the third ship , being built from scratch , will take another two years to complete \) we are never really immersed in the period , anyway , and not just because of the intercontinental hotel visible on one side of the museum s pier , and the boston children s museum on the other after leaving the ships , you enter the tea party museum , which begins with a staged dialogue between two colonial women , one a rebel , the other a tory they turn out to be holograms and are spirited off into the darkness an effect meant to amaze in a way the revolution may not and in the next gallery , portraits of george iii and samuel adams come to life in their frames , harry potterstyle , and engage in a debate of sorts about the colonies and their relationship to england , drawn from written statements the only arguably historical item here is the robinson half chest , which , we are told , is one of only two known tea chests still in existence from the original event , mounted in a protective cylinder within which it rotates the museum s overall inspirational message is highlighted in the final gallery s film showing what happened after the tea dumping , including the battles of lexington and concord the film ends with a fervent , symbolinvoking rendition of america \( my country , 'tis of thee \) historically , none of this sheds much additional light on the tea party or the revolution it reinforces what we already think we know but at the museum we do see john adams s reaction to the tea party in his there is a dignity , a majesty , a sublimity , in this last effort of the patriots that i greatly admire adams continued this destruction of the tea is so bold , so daring , so firm , intrepid , and inflexible , and it must have so important consequences , and so lasting , that i ca n't but consider it as an epocha in history but what was it about this event that stirred him and so many others \? in what way was this act different from what came before \? other protests , particularly boycotts , had considerable success britain ultimately repealed its stamp tax and even eliminated onerous duties imposed by the townshend acts except for the tax on tea the impact of that tax , though , could hardly compare to the effects of the others perhaps this protest seemed different because it focused on principle on the idea of political representation rather than on practical or economic issues it was so focused , in fact , that much energy was expended to ensure that no selfinterest was on display no protester was permitted to pocket any tea or even to scoop it out of the water the damage done was considerable well over the equivalent of 1 million in today s dollars but the signal sent was far more serious despite its destructiveness , the tea party was quite different from the horrifying examples of mob violence and crude plunder of earlier colonial protests it was presented as an act more controlled , and thus , perhaps , more threatening as it turned out to be the episode is on the surface this museum might have explored the event s complexities , but it has something else in mind in the telling of certain kinds of history , we deal with essences rather than nuances , with largescale effects rather than finegrain details with varied success , that is what is done here and though more would be needed for my full satisfaction , it would be just as wrong to overlook those immense themes and transformations , particularly when as on a day like the fourth they are so justly celebrated
if this was the weekend you chose to unplug from sports , to delebronify your life , to forget they 're still playing hockey in june , along with golf and tennis and a bunch of olympic sports you forgot existed , plugging back in today might crash your hard drive , both real and metaphorical the weekend became a holding pen for odd happenings and stuff you did n't see coming let s see , you had the thunder rolling back the spurs' dominance to tie their playoff series at two games each the kings went up , 20 , in the stanley cup finals by waiting until overtime again to unleash the one great shot that counted on martin brodeur you had tiger woods out of his past to win a tournament with none other than jack nicklaus looking on a great american gymnast , shawn johnson , at the ancient age of 20 the united states men s soccer team tried to help canada remember it has a soccer team , too , but even sort of failed at that in  weirder still , had you tuned back in a tad early , say , in overtime of the heatceltics game late sunday night , you might have thought you 'd have entered another dimension altogether yes , that was lebron james sitting on the bench as the celtics won because james had fouled out you read that right lebron james had fouled out for good measure , paul pierce had too had it gone two overtimes , rod serling would have been doing the playbyplay perhaps it was a fitting , if altogether bizarre , moment in the jamespierce rivalry , as , that they shared sideline seats during the final moments of this game , which brought boston all the way back for an improbable 22 tie in the eastern conference finals they shared the same view everyone saw of dwyane wade s gamedeciding 3pointer spinning off the rim and changing everything , as the celtics were going to live and die by the long ball in this game , , and it just so happened the last one bounced their way but for the moment , it seems the celtics have the upper hand , with james unable to make anything bend to his will , , and the celtics' big three playing with a greater sense of urgency , if anything , wade s miss opened the door for this to be a classic series , , even if the referees keep calling offensive fouls as if they are getting bonuses for them the stanley cup finals have a way to go before they can see classic through a telescope yes , the games have been close , but the cautious play did n't give way to anything dramatic until way past a lot of bedtimes in either of the first two overtime games now , the kings are back home , trying to share more than real estate with the lakers , as they are rekindling memories of the '93 finals team , writes , and trying to do it one better hockey had another oddity drop into its weekend with the news that boston goalie tim thomas has decided to take a year off , a decision in a facebook post the french open apparently decided on a whole theme of wacky on sunday , as , with the topseeded woman , victoria azarenka , dropping out in straight sets and novak djokovic and roger federer both needing to the only sanity seems to be happening in rafael nadal s world , as he tracks down bjorn borg in the record books ,  the happenings at golf s memorial tournament would not seem strange at all had the last two and a half years not happened in the career of tiger woods but they did , and his dramatic victory tied nicklaus s mark of pga tour victories there was plenty of the normal revelry , as , for any sign of renewed life from woods s career , but at least the tiger s back ! cries have been a bit more tempered than usual woods may be on his way back , , but he is not there yet , and would like everyone to stop trying to analyze every woods swing and just enjoy it when it goes right that , however , would require a good bit of sanity , which was not the trend of the weekend

detroit the last time phil hughes pitched against the tigers in detroit , he was coming off his worst outing of the season , a disastrous evening in his hometown , anaheim , calif , at the end of may , when he gave up seven runs in five and a third innings the flight to detroit was not a good one for hughes , but once he arrived in the midwest , he produced his best and perhaps most significant start of the season hughes was almost untouchable that afternoon against the tigers , throwing his only complete game of the season and just the second of his career after being roughed up by the los angeles angels , he made a conscious effort to be more aggressive with righthanded hitters , to pitch inside to them with more conviction with that plan of attack , he allowed only one run and four hits and struck out eight in a 51 win hughes went into that game with a 45 record and a 564 earned run average since then , he is 73 with a 277 era , so returning to detroit gives him a pleasing demarcation point for his season the important thing for me was that i was able to bounce right back , he said monday before the yankees opened a fourgame series with the tigers you don t want to follow up a bad one with another bad one and then it snowballs so it was good i was able to put that anaheim game behind me pretty quickly on tuesday , hughes is scheduled to face rick porcello , a righthanded pitcher for detroit , in his first game back at comerica park since that complete game june 3 he has won his past two starts after losing two of his previous three in his last outing , he held the baltimore orioles to one run and nine hits over six innings as his era dipped below 400 for the first time this season , to 396 entering monday , he was tied with c c sabathia for most wins on the yankees with 11 none of his outings have been masterpieces , but the game in detroit was one of a small number that made hughes feel particularly good being back in detroit helped remind him how he would like to make those outings more the norm last time i pitched here was one of those , he said i can dissect outings and feel i wasn t perfect with everything that s just how it goes when you throw a 100something pitches you re not going to be absolutely perfect but there have been a couple of times when i was really close , and i d just like to have an outing where i feel really , really good with everything i feel like i was close a couple of times , but i d like to have that consistently these last couple of months of course , at the time , the tigers were not playing nearly as well as they have been in recent weeks they were 2528 before that game , and went into monday s game with a 5850 record the area that hughes would most like to shore up is home runs he has given up 25 , which tied him for third most in the american league they always bother me because they are runs i d like to prevent , he said if they are solo home runs and they come in spots where i have a big lead , and i m being aggressive and i don t have second thoughts about the pitch selection , i can live with those ailing pitchers one day , the yankees may have an impressive young pitching staff anchored by michael pineda , manny banuelos and dellin betances but it definitely will not be this year pineda had seasonending shoulder surgery in the spring , and betances has a combined 567 earned run average after being demoted to class aa from class aaa , and now banuelos is out for the season , too the yankees have shut down the lefthanded banuelos because of a bone bruise in his left elbow banuelos has not pitched since may because of the injury yankees manager joe girardi said it was possible banuelos could pitch in the fall or winter and be ready for spring training banuelos made only six starts , and was 02 with a 450 era in 24 innings it hurts , girardi said i don t want to say it s a wasted year , but he obviously didn t pitch as much as we wanted him to can he make that up \? sure , i think he can make that up but who knows where he would have been if he had 150 innings right now in five minor league seasons banuelos is 1919 with a 312 era and is considered one of the yankees top prospects
detroit there were two outs and two on and the triple crown winner at the plate in the seventh inning sunday for the out in faraway center field , under the chevrolet fountain , coco crisp played deep he would not let a ball sail over his head , and he would race in for anything shallow miguel cabrera hits so many balls hard , but this was not one of them as it floated in the air , crisp made his charge someone asked later if the play had unfolded in slow motion , and crisp looked puzzled slow motion \? this play was all about speed churning legs , instant calculations crisp said he saw it all the way he knew he would have no time to camp under the ball , to raise his glove and use two hands if he tried , he would handcuff himself to crisp , there were only two options for making the catch and preserving the ' onerun lead he could slide or try a running basket catch , willie mays style one was no riskier than the other i do n't know if i 've ever dropped either one , to my recollection , crisp said it s just one of those inthemoment situations at the last moment , you 've got to make a decision , and that was the decision that i made the ball struck crisp s glove , near his waist , and he lunged for it again , getting more leather on it , but not enough he reached in vain with his bare hand as the ball fluttered to the ground , and two runs scored the a s went on to lose , 54 , on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth it just did n't go in the web , crisp said hit my palm , you know \? that s the way it goes so we have to bounce back and i 've got to forget about it , even though it s tough it s going to be tough to forget about it crisp had a long flight to oakland , and a day off , to forget before game 3 on tuesday the athletics , forever the plucky , underpaid underdogs , must win three in a row to extend their joy ride the tigers are one victory from returning to the american league championship series the a s have seen enough of detroit they struck out 23 times in the two games here , and they scored in only four innings every time they did , the tigers came right back with at least one run the a s have not completed an inning with a lead you play to get that momentum and keep it on your side , said reliever sean doolittle , who was on the mound for crisp s error it just seems the momentum keeps going back and forth that s a tribute to them we can have it , and they 're fighting and clawing to get it back otherwise , the a s were not interested in complimenting the tigers at least not the reliever who finished them off with two on in the top of the ninth al alburquerque fielded a comebacker from the dangerous yoenis cespedes , then held the ball high and kissed it before flipping to first cespedes laughed it off , saying he could still get a big hit off alburquerque , and when he did , he would kiss his bat josh reddick was less amused it got under my skin , reddick said it was very unprofessional i did n't appreciate that one bit to reddick , alburquerque was showing up the a s that s exactly what he s doing , reddick said i do n't think anybody , from one day of experience in the big leagues to 15 years in the big leagues , should do that everybody knows that this game is a professional game and you 've got to keep within yourself reddick , the boston castoff who erupted this season for 32 home runs , had fired his bat to the ground after striking out to end the third , stranding two runners by the time he came up in the eighth , he was 0 for 6 in the series , with six strikeouts but reddick worked a tough atbat against joaquin benoit , fouling off two pitches with two strikes to coax a gametying wild pitch then he lashed a home run over the wall in right i was just trying to put the ball in play , reddick said i was just trying to not walk back to the dugout , like i 've been doing all series his turn as the hero did not last long the tigers tied the score on ryan cook s twoout wild pitch in the eighth , another miscue by an oakland franchise whose fans must still wonder why jeremy giambi did n't slide since the mustache brigade of the 1970s , the a s just do n't do octobers very well of course , none of these players witnessed the five playoff losses since 2000 , or the earlier october takedowns by orel hershiser , jose rijo and roberto alomar the last time these a s played at home , they swept three games from texas to win a division title now they must sweep three games from detroit to win a division series it seems improbable , unless the a s start making more contact and minimizing mistakes they still must face justin verlander in a potential fifth game but at least they have a chance hey , who knows \? closer grant balfour said i 've seen some crazy things happen in the last week , and i still believe
kabul , afghanistan the past is a foreign country to abdul wasi hamdard , one where they did things differently and he was an artist full of promise on the face of it , that past was hardly to be envied he fled the modernarthating taliban in 1996 and joined a few million of his fellow afghans as a refugee in pakistan , separated from his family he lived alone in a small room scarcely bigger than his bed , with a window and an easel i painted from 9 pm until dawn every day , he says i was very happy then the result was a remarkable output 10 , 000 canvases over the ensuing years , mostly oils but also watercolors , establishing himself as one of afghanistan s most successful young artists when the taliban fell in late 2001 , mr hamdard , then in his late 30s , returned , and kabul s galleries snapped up his paintings by then , few afghans could afford them , but the capital was full of foreigners passing through for whom prices as low as 100 a canvas \( ranging into the low thousands for larger pieces \) were a steal for fine art you can find one or two of my paintings in every corner of the world , he says the norwegian and indian embassies were among those that held showings for a time , the american embassy even had a small gallery inside its compound , with hamdards as a staple offering there is a from the early part of the decade , vital and cheery in front of his work he was often invited to art events , nearly always at embassies his friend karim khosravi , a businessman and art lover , started the on and did well from his 30 percent commission on mr hamdard s paintings a swedish woman helped start a web site featuring his work the money poured in steadily not riches \( his most expensive painting to date , wedding , sold for 6 , 500 \) , but in the afghan economy , it was plenty , at least at first he moved into a large house with his seven brothers none of them artists or professionals , they were taxi drivers and restaurant workers , government workers , shop clerks people whose monthly salaries were often less than even an inexpensive hamdard he supported the entire family , and though he did not marry , his brothers did , until soon the house had 30 people including all the wives and children mr hamdard stopped painting at home it was just too crowded , he says yet he was honor and culturebound to remain with his brothers according to friends , two of his family members suffered from mental illness his mother had a stroke and was paralyzed their house collapsed one day , and he had to rebuild it , the expense devastating his savings he wo n't talk much about it , other than to say if i had a studio and peace , i could do happy paintings but i have a lot of problems more recent photographs would show a man who has aged suddenly , pale and tiredlooking , his dark hair receding rapidly he had long been a painter who worked in many genres , though chiefly expressionist oils with a strong sense of afghan place , often done with a palette knife instead of brush later , his output became more abstract expressionist , twisted and dark i first met hamdard in islamabad , said hedayat amin arsala , the senior minister in president hamid karzai s government and his former vice president i sensed some vulnerability in him , very tormented somehow mr arsala was a patron for several afghan artists , including mr hamdard , and has followed his career since he is one of the few afghans who own the artist s work he reminds me a lot of the painter in la boh me , ' mr arsala said like marcello , mr hamdard has never married , though he will not say why exactly for years , his brothers tried to arrange a match , but he spurned all offers i could never find a woman who understood me , he says many of what mr hamdard considers his best paintings currently reside in the closet of a guesthouse run by a friend they include brothers and the fundamentalist , and what mr hamdard says he calls his best work , a painting he originally called twenty years of war the war went on , the painting never sold , and he renamed it thirty years of war and as the war went on , things changed in kabul a number

on oct 12 , 2010 , jimmy mubenga was deported from the 46yearold angolan had come to the country as a refugee 16 years earlier but after his involvement in a pub brawl and a subsequent criminal conviction , the government ordered his deportation three private security guards escorted him through heathrow airport and onto british airways flight 77 to luanda , angola the exact details of what followed are still unclear and currently  several that mr mubenga repeatedly complained that he could not breathe and that he was being held down with his head between his knees by security guards as the airplane taxied to the runway in london , mr mubenga lost consciousness and later died control has traditionally been viewed as an inalienable sovereign function of the state but today migration management has increasingly been taken over by private contractors proponents of privatization have been keen to argue that the use of contractors does not mean that governments lose control yet , privatization introduces a corporate veil that blurs both public oversight and legal accountability despite efforts to introduce outside supervisors , performance reports and other monitoring mechanisms , the private nature of these companies breaks the ordinary administrative chain of command , placing both governments and the public at a disadvantage in terms of ensuring transparency private companies seldom have an interest in securing public oversight , as any criticism may entail negative economic consequences australasian correctional management , which ran detention centers in australia from 1998 to 2004 , was known to require medical staff members or teachers entering its facilities to sign confidentiality agreements preventing them from disclosing any information regarding detainees or the administration of the centers being foreigners , migrants and refugees have always had a hard time gaining access to outside complaint mechanisms and advocacy institutions as an employee in charge of reviewing disciplinary cases at a corrections corporation of america facility in houston once told a reporter from this paper , i'm the supreme court the corporate veil also distorts lines of legal responsibility human rights law is largely designed on the presumption that it is states and not private companies that exercise sovereign powers like detention or border control legally holding governments accountable for human rights violations by contractors requires an additional step showing that it is the state and not just the corporation or individual employee that is responsible for the misconduct mr mubenga s case is not unique numerous reports have been filed about misconduct , violence and abuse perpetrated by contractors carrying out migration functions the three security guards responsible for deporting mr mubenga worked for the anglodanish security company g4s before mr mubenga s death , g4s held the exclusive contract with the uk border agency to provide escorts for immigration detainees deported from the country the firm , but this did n't end its involvement in managing migration as the world s largest security company with more than 650 , 000 employees , g4s is involved in a plethora of migration functions all over the world , from operating immigration detention centers in britain to carrying out passenger screening at airports in europe , canada and the middle east in america , g4s operates a fleet of custombuilt fortified buses that serve as deportation transports for illegal migrants caught along the united statesmexico border just last month , the uk border agency signed a new contract with g4s worth up to 337 million to house asylum seekers g4s s success in this market shows that deportation , detention and border control have become big business boeing s current contract to set up and operate a hightech border surveillance system along the united statesmexico border is worth 13 billion and involves nearly 100 subcontractors the floridabased one of g4s s main competitors manages 7 , 000 detention beds in the united states and , until recently , at the guant namo bay detention center , where migrants intercepted in the caribbean are transferred ngos and international organizations profit , too in 2010 , the international organization for migration was paid 265 million to assist governments in returning migrants to their home countries , among other activities the migration control industry covers not only detention and deportations but also border control many airlines today employ former immigration officers or themselves contract security companies to perform the document , forgery and profiling checks required by destination states in israel , the west bank checkpoints are gradually being transferred to private security companies placing responsibility at lower levels may serve to insulate governments from lawsuits in the mubenga case , the three private security guards involved in the deportation were initially arrested following accusations from g4s employees that senior management had repeatedly ignored internal warnings about poor training and unsafe restraint techniques , charges against the company are now being considered yet none of these lawsuits are likely to address whether the uk border agency should face criminal liability for mr mubenga s death because of its decision to outsource deportations in the first place even if governments want to reestablish state control over migration , it is n't so easy political promises to renationalize immigration detention centers in britain have so far remained unfulfilled despite repeated reports of abuse and mistreatment and privatization , once pursued , is difficult to reverse the united states discovered this when , in the aftermath of 9 11 , it was faced with the challenge of hiring 45 , 000 employees for the newly established transportation security administration to recoup sovereign control over previously private and private contractors work to shape policy as well when arizona s notorious sb 1070 immigration bill was passed , 30 out of 36 cosponsors had received donations from private prison companies or their lobbyists today , government outsourcing has given rise to an industry that encompasses nearly every aspect of migration management in countries across the globe this shift comes at a price it eliminates government accountability and runs roughshod over the rights of those subjected to private corporations' control and unless governments reassert control over what used to be a core sovereign function of the state , many more jimmy mubengas are likely to die

washington the former chief security officer for the american embassy in on wednesday told a house committee investigating the fatal attack last month on a diplomatic compound in benghazi that his request to extend the deployment of an american military team was thwarted by the state department s  but a senior state department official said after the hearing by the that keeping the team would not have changed the bloody outcome in benghazi because it was not based there but in tripoli the clashing perspectives of witnesses was echoed in the partisan sparring of lawmakers , with republicans accusing the state department of shortchanging security at the compound and democrats countering that the vast majority of security requests from there had been met the hearing never established what it might have taken to repel on the compound in benghazi that killed ambassador and three other americans , or even if the american military team might have played a role in defending the compound if it had been in libya the former security officer who testified , eric a nordstrom , said he was told in a phone call in july that the deployment of the site security team , a 16member american military unit based in tripoli , could not be prolonged the military command that oversaw the unit , the africa command , was willing to extend it but the state department decided that it was not necessary it was abundantly clear we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident , mr nordstrom said and the question that we would ask is , again , how thin does the ice have to get before someone falls through \? the account of mr nordstorm , who served as the regional security officer for the embassy from september 2011 to july 2012 , was supported by lt col andrew wood of the utah national guard , the leader of the team , which wrapped up its deployment in august colonel wood said that the team s specialized military training and weapons made it far more effective than the libyan militiamen the united states was trying to use to protect its diplomatic compounds the security in benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there , colonel wood said diplomatic security remained weak the state department s position was presented by patrick kennedy , its under secretary for management , who suggested that none of the steps mr nordstrom or colonel wood had proposed would have altered the outcome the attack , he said , was an unprecedented assault by dozens of heavily armed men , a characterization that mr nordstrom acknowledged was accurate the cantankerous tone of the hearing was evident during the testimony of mr kennedy , who was frequently interrupted by representative darrell issa of california , the committee chairman , and other republicans after the hearing , mr kennedy called a news conference at the state department in an effort to rebut allegations that the department had neglected security at the benghazi compound he acknowledged that the state department did not give mr nordstrom exactly what he wanted , but said , nobody takes this more seriously than we do to find the right solution charlene lamb , a deputy assistant secretary in the bureau of diplomatic security , insisted that mr nordstrom s request to extend the military team was only a recommendation and that the state department had been right not to heed it the broader strategy was to phase out the american military team and rely more on the libyan militiamen who were protecting the compound along with a small number of american security officers at the time of the attack in benghazi , ms lamb said , the outer wall had been raised and external lighting had been installed , along with a network of camera and security grills on windows five american security agents were at the compound at the time of the assault , ms lamb said , though it was later noted that only three were based at the compound and that two had accompanied mr stevens from tripoli there were also three members of the libyan 17th february brigade , she said , referring to the militia that had been retained to help protect the compound in addition , a welltrained american quick reaction security team was stationed at a nearby annex for all that , it was clear that there was a large gap between what the security officers in the field believed was needed and what the state department officials in washington assessed was required under questioning , mr kennedy and ms lamb acknowledged that they had not visited libya mr nordstrom said he tried to improve security by asking for 12 agents , only to be told by a state department official that he was asking for the sun , moon and the stars mr nordstrom , who continues to work for the state department , said he had responded that the most frustrating part of his assignment was not the turmoil in libya it s not the hardships , mr nordstrom said he had replied it s not the gunfire it s not the threats it s dealing and fighting against the people , programs and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me and i added it by saying , for me , the taliban is on the inside of the building' after declining for weeks to provide details about the assault on sept 11 , the state department on tuesday night arranged with little notice a conference call in which a spokesman gave new details on what had happened the account provided by a state department official , whom the agency declined to identify , differed from the initial obama administration reports in some important respects susan e rice , the american ambassador to the united nations , had said that the attack on the compound began with an angry protest about an antiislamic film that was hijacked by extremists but the new account provided by the state department made no mention of a protest in this account , mr stevens met with a turkish diplomat during the day of the attack and escorted him to the main gate of the compound around 8 30 pm at that time , there were no demonstrations , and the situation appeared calm little more than an hour later , there was gunfire and explosions american agents , watching the compound through cameras , saw armed men moving into it the barracks for a militia that was protecting the compound was set on fire , and the attack unfolded
monday was an orderly day in the polls national polls showed a modestly favorable trend for president obama , allowing him to gain slightly in our forecast \( mr obama s chances of winning the electoral college are now 660 percent , according to the fivethirtyeight model , up from 634 percent on sunday \) but the movement toward him was not anything extraordinary , serving only to offset some of the decline he experienced in the polls late last week , and to bring the national polls more in line with statebystate surveys the state polls themselves were decent for mitt romney but there weren t all that many of them , and the trend that they showed a fourpoint gain for mr romney , on average , since the denver debate on oct 3 was in line with our previous understanding about the magnitude of his gains none of the polls published on monday really ought to fit the definition of an outlier some were slightly more favorable or slightly less so for the respective candidates , but in a way that is consistent with unavoidable statistical variation and the methodological differences between different polling firms let me first you show you the trend in national polls there were 10 of them published on monday mr obama made gains in 5 of the 10 polls as compared with the previous version of the survey , which in most cases postdated the denver debate mr romney gained in one poll , although by less than a full percentage point the others were exactly unchanged on average , mr obama gained slightly less than a percentage point , going from about half a point behind in the previous version of the polls to half a point ahead instead that is a modest difference , to be sure , but it is getting late enough in the campaign and the election is so close that these modest differences can potentially matter when averaged across a number of surveys a halfpoint advantage for mr obama in the national polls is also a little easier to reconcile with the state polls than a halfpoint deficit the estimate of the national popular vote from our nowcast , which uses both state polls and national polls , shows mr obama up by one percentage point mr obama s position in the nowcast is improved by 07 percentage points since friday that modest overall gain matches the small gain that he made in the national polls on monday , suggesting that the national polls may be coming into line with the state polls rather than the other way around unlike on other recent days , the state polls did not constitute a moving target as i mentioned , mr romney gained about four points on average from the predebate baselines in the same surveys that is very consistent with where the nowcast pegs mr romney s debate bounce note that all of the state polls were from swing states the argument that mr obama would somehow be immune from seeing his swingstate numbers decline was pretty well discredited by late last week , at least in my view on the other hand , there is equally little evidence that mr obama s decline has been especially large in the swing states \( one can make a straightfaced argument that mr obama s decline has been slightly larger than average in florida and slightly smaller than average in ohio , but even those differences could easily be caused by statistical noise \) in general , it shouldn t be surprising when you see new polls showing a decline for mr obama from his predebate averages for instance , the muhlenberg college poll in pennsylvania , which showed mr obama s lead declining to four points from seven before the debate , got quite a lot of attention on monday afternoon but that was pretty much exactly what you would expect based on the way everything else has trended at this point , the more useful question may be how mr obama and mr romney are polling relative to their post debate numbers is mr obama losing further ground still \? are there signs that mr romney s standing has peaked \? still , even a fairly calm day in the polling can give people opportunities to see what they want to see in the data the most egregious form of this is if you cherrypick the three or four polling results that you like best for your candidate every now and then , a candidate s polls are so abysmal that even this exercise will fail to yield satisfying results \( friday was such a day for mr obama , for example \) but the vast majority of the time , you can find a couple of results that you like if you looked at only the three best national polls for mr obama on monday , you would conclude that he was three points ahead in the national race if you looked at only mr romney s three best polls , you would say that he was ahead by two points instead most people avoid this sort of mistake , however it s just too flagrant a case of cherrypicking , when there are 20 polls published in a day and you re discussing only two or three of them there is a more subtle form of bias , however , that a lot more of us are prone to \( i m sure i d be prone to it myself , which is why i like having a computer program that looks at all the polls and has consistent rules by which it does so \) that bias is to look at all the data except for the two or three data points that you like least , which you dismiss as being outliers if you re a democrat , for example , and throw out mr romney s three most favorable polls from the 10 national surveys published on monday , you ll claim that mr obama is ahead in the race by 13 percentage points if you re a republican and do the same thing , dropping mr obama s three best polls , you ll have mr romney ahead by one point instead that is not quite as biased as cherrypicking the best results but it gets you halfway there , and it is a heck of a lot easier to rationalize there is something that can be critiqued about almost every poll the methodology , or the demographics , or the sample size , or the pollster s history , or something else often , these critiques have a grain of truth in them i m not a relativist who says that gravis marketing polls are as good as what gallup or the washington post puts out but what people often do is come up with reasons \( valid or otherwise \) to avoid looking at the polls they don t like while giving a pass to those they do i think claims about polls oversampling democrats or republicans are deeply misguided , for the most part but if you re going to do it , you ought to do so consistently if you re critiquing the partisan split in monday s washington post poll , for example , you probably ought to have done the same thing for last week s pew poll , which also had a partisan split that was different from the consensus if this sort of error can be hard to avoid , however , there is a different type that is much less forgivable that is in making too much of demographic or geographic subsamples within a poll for example , monday s washington post poll had mr obama performing better in what it termed swing states than in the country as a whole the gallup poll showed just the opposite this data is largely useless a typical national poll might interview 1 , 000 people , of which perhaps 250 or 300 will live in swing states , depending on exactly how it defines them the margin of error on a 250 or 300person subsample is enormous about plus or minus six percentage points \( the swing state sample from the gallup poll was somewhat larger , but still small as compared to the 3 , 000 or so voters that it interviews for each instance of its national tracking poll \) in contrast , in the state polls , there are often tens of thousands of people interviewed in polls of battleground states on a given day \( there were about 2 , 500 on monday , for example , despite its having a relatively low volume of state polling \) there is just no reason at all to care about what 250 or 300 people say when you can look at what 2 , 500 or 3 , 000 do instead if you re going to indulge this habit , then look at the rasmussen reports tracking poll of swing states , which at least has a decent sample size \( and which , not coincidentally , generally shows results similar to rasmussen s overall national figures \) even this can be problematic , however , because there is not a clear delineation between what is a swing state and what isn t if you include republicanleaning states like arizona and missouri on the list of swing states , while excluding democraticleaning states like minnesota or if you do just the opposite you would expect to see some persistent differences a related point is that some of the swing states are a lot more important than others ohio alone , for instance , is likely be the pivotal state in the election more than 40 percent of the time , according to our tippingpoint analysis about as much as the next four or five states combined nevada , despite having a much smaller population , actually ranks higher on our tippingpoint list than florida , and yet florida \( because of its larger population \) will have a much greater influence on a battleground state subsample the same problem occurs when people focus too much on demographic subsamples within the polls you ll often see whole news articles focused around themes like did you see how bad mr obama s numbers were among latinos in the pew poll \? how good they were among workingclass women in the quinnipiac survey of ohio \? it is bad enough to focus on one poll when 20 of them are published on a given day it is much worse to focus on one of the 20 demographic subsamples within one of the 20 polls , which gives you 400 options to pick from these stories are fake news that have no value to consumers but it is often the outliers that make for better arguments , and better headlines

mazarisharif , afghanistan the atrocities of the afghan civil war in the 1990s are still recounted in whispers here tales of horror born out of a scorchedearth ethnic and factional conflict in which civilians and captured combatants were frequently slaughtered en masse stark evidence of such killings are held in the mass graves that still litter the afghan countryside one such site is outside mazarisharif , in the north it lies only halfexcavated , with bones and the remains of clothing partially obscured by water and mud from recent flooding experts say at least 16 victims are here , and each skull that lies exposed is uniformly punctured by a single bulletentry hole at the back the powerful men accused of responsibility for these deaths and tens of thousands of others some said to be directly at their orders , others carried out by men in their chain of command are named in the pages of a monumental 800page report on human rights abuses in afghanistan from 1978 , before the soviet invasion of afghanistan , to the fall of the taliban in 2001 , according to researchers and officials who helped compile the study over the past six years the list of names is a sort of who s who of power players in afghanistan former and current warlords or officials , some now in very prominent positions in the national government , as well as in insurgent factions fighting it many of the named men were principals in the civil war era after the soviet union withdrew , and they are also frequently mentioned when talk here turns to fears of violence after the end of the nato combat mission in 2014 already , there is growing concern about a scramble for power and resources along ethnic and tribal lines but the report seeking to hold them accountable is unlikely to be released anytime soon , the researchers say , accusing senior afghan officials of effectively suppressing the work and those responsible for it for their part , human rights activists say the country is doomed to repeat its violent past if abuses are not brought to light and prosecuted at the same time , some officials here including some american diplomats express worry that releasing the report will actually trigger new civil strife titled simply , conflict mapping in afghanistan since 1978 , the study , prepared by the afghan independent human rights commission , details the locations and details of 180 mass graves of civilians or prisoners , many of the sites secret and none of them yet excavated properly it compiles testimony from survivors and witnesses to the mass interments , and details other war crimes as well the study was commissioned as part of a reconciliation and justice effort ordered by president in 2005 , and it was completed this past december some of the world s top experts in forensics and what is called transitional justice advised the commission on the report and provided training and advice for the 40 researchers who worked on it over a sixyear period three afghan and foreign human rights activists who worked as researchers and analysts on large sections of the report spoke about its contents on condition of anonymity , both out of fear of reprisal and because the commission had not authorized them to discuss it publicly according to afghan rights advocates and western officials , word that the report was near to being officially submitted to the president apparently prompted powerful former warlords , including the first vice president , marshal muhammad qasim fahim , to demand that mr karzai dismiss the commissioner responsible , ahmad nader nadery at a meeting on dec 21 , including mr karzai and other top officials , marshal fahim argued that dismissing mr nadery would actually be too mild a punishment we should just shoot 30 holes in his face , he said , according to one of those present he later apologized to other officials for the remark , saying it was not meant in earnest mr karzai did remove mr nadery but a spokesman for the president , aimal faizi , said it was irresponsible and untrue to say that the president fired mr nadery because of the mass graves report or was trying to block its release he also called the accounts of the dec 21 meeting with marshal fahim and other officials totally baseless mr nadery had finished two fiveyear terms as a commissioner and the president was legally entitled to replace him , mr faizi said this decision has nothing to do with any aihrc report on war atrocities , he said we believe that if there is any such report by the aihrc , sooner or later it will come up and will be published one day the figures accused in the report of playing some role in mass killings include some of the most powerful figures in afghanistan s government and ethnic factions , including the northern alliance that fought the taliban in 2001 among them are first vice president fahim , a tajik from the jamiat islami party , and second vice president karim khalili , a hazara leader from the wahdat party gen atta mohammed noor , a tajik from the jamiat islami party and now the governor of the important northern province of balkh , of which mazarisharif is capital and gen abdul rashid dostum , a former uzbek warlord from the jumbush party who holds the honorary title of chief of staff to the supreme commander of the afghan armed forces , among many others those men gave no response to verbal and written requests for comment about their naming in the report in all , the researchers said , more than 500 afghans are named in the report as responsible for mass killings , including the country s revered national martyr , ahmed shah massoud , one of the last militia leaders to hold out against the taliban sweep to power and who was assassinated by al qaeda just before the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks the report also investigates killings of civilians and prisoners said to be carried out by the taliban and other insurgents , including gulbuddin hekmatyar , the leader of the hezbiislami insurgents named specifically in the report as responsible for war crimes in massacres of prisoners in northern afghanistan are two taliban commanders now held at the guant namo bay prison camp mullah fazul akhund and mullah khairullah khirkawa and whose release is thought to be a condition of negotiations with the insurgent group as the report languishes , evidence in the graves is being destroyed , sometimes as a function of poor care of the sites and sometimes intentionally one mass grave containing more than 100 dead was discovered in the kefayet square area of mazarisharif , where general noor holds sway , during a roadbuilding project in march the halfdozen bodies that were turned up were simply relocated to a cemetery and the construction went on , bulldozing over most of the rest of the remains in 2007 , two mass graves in the khalid ibn alwalid township of mazar were simply covered over by construction of a new residential complex that researchers said was developed and owned by general noor a researcher for the afghan rights commission who investigated both of the graves in khalid ibn alwalid said the victims were killed by general noor s political party , which had what the researcher called a human slaughterhouse on the site in the 1990s , as well as by the taliban , who later took over the same facility for the same purpose in the case of the grave with exposed skulls , it was discovered in january by american and afghan workers during a united states army corps of engineers construction project in dehdadi district , six miles outside mazarisharif one of at least two graves found there so far human rights investigators said that grave dated from the period when general dostum and his hazara allies controlled the site the victims , their wrists still bound in many cases with stout twine , included women and children , judging from the clothing found with them during the civil war period , after the communists were defeated and before the taliban took power , warlords like general noor , general dostum , and the hazara leader hajji mohammad mohaqiq fought bitterly among themselves as well as against the taliban , who are mostly ethnic pashtuns the conflict among these leaders , who had all fought in the jihad against the soviet occupation of afghanistan , was on both political and ethnic grounds for many afghans , the warlords' atrocities are taken as a given old news better left unrevived it will take us centuries to forget this , said an afghan national army lieutenant colonel we do n't want to go back to those bad days again in all , 13 mass graves have been identified in the mazarisharif area , including one detailed by human rights workers in the dashteleili desert in the neighboring jawjzan province , believed to contain 2 , 000 taliban prisoners slaughtered by general dostum s forces that grave was there and then suddenly it was not there , said a second human rights worker who worked on the investigation in jawjzan they just got rid of all the evidence he said bulldozers were brought in during 2008 to remove the bodies , leaving huge pits behind the remains were reportedly incinerated at a secret location , he said mr nadery would not discuss the contents of the mapping report except in the most general way you open the map in the report , you see there are dots everywhere , he said everyone should know that what they suffered was not unique we should be able to tell our people this is our past , this is our history it s ugly , it s bad , but we should be able to face it' he said he still hoped that the commission would be able to submit the report , although he conceded that those prospects looked dim i do n't want the report to become an event , just a headline for one day , he said instead , he said , it needs to be presented officially so it can be acted on officially , whether by the afghan government or by the international community he said the report tallied more than a million people killed in the conflict and 13 million disabled , although not all of those are necessarily victims of war crimes other humanrights officials in afghanistan also expressed urgency about releasing the report there are lots of examples where a report like this was an important first step to bringing justice for the victims , said heather barr , head of the human rights watch office in afghanistan it does put pressure on people who are named it leads at least to marginalizing them the volatility of the accusations was on full display in april , when a wellestablished but small political bloc , the afghanistan solidarity party , held a demonstration against what it said were war criminals in government for us there is no difference between the taliban and these war criminals , said hafizullah rasikh , a party spokesman they are like twin brothers parliament responded with a declaration accusing the party of treason and demanding its disbandment a former mujahedeen commander , abdul hafiz mansoor , who is now an editor of a weekly publication called mujahed , did not deny that many atrocities took place , on all sides one cannot make war with rosewater , he said , referring to a popular ingredient in sweets and perfumes here if this war and all these killings were so bad , then why are n't we putting their international backers on trial \? if we talk about violation of human rights , we should accuse the un special representative for afghanistan , who supported the mujahedeen at the time and now calls them warlords or president ronald reagan , who provided these warlords and human rights violators with stinger missiles the american embassy here has been another source of objection to the massgraves report american officials say releasing the report would be a bad idea , at least until after afghanistan s 2014 presidential election which is also when the nato combat withdrawal should be complete i have to tell you frankly on the mapping thing , when i first learned about it , it scared me , said a senior american official , speaking on condition of anonymity as a matter of embassy policy there will be a time for it , but i'm not persuaded this is the time it s going to reopen all the old wounds , the official said , noting that several men who were bitter rivals during the civil war were at least nominally working together in the government now for its part , the united nations has supported release of the report the un position has always been that such reports should always be released publicly , said georgette gagnon , the top human rights officer for the united nations mission in afghanistan but it s up to the commission and we would support whatever they decide to do of the 180 graves documented in the report , only one has so far been exhumed forensically because the afghan authorities lack the facilities to carry out dna testing and the sort of scientific identification of remains that was done systematically in bosnia that one was a grave on the grounds of the interior ministry in kabul , according to m ashraf bakhteyari , head of the forensic science organization , a foreigntrained group that carried out the exhumation mr bakhteyari said he was ordered by the interior ministry not to divulge who the victims were it is classified information , he said he is frank , though , about the prospects for investigating the rest of afghanistan s mass graves it is impossible to prosecute those who are responsible for the mass graves , mr bakhteyari said neither the international community nor the afghan government have the will to do that
president ma yingjeou well , to answer that question , i 'll have to cite six examples 1 \) a robust economy , 2 \) a clean and capable government , 3 \) a just and equitable society , 4 \) a sustainable environment , 5 \) crossstrait peace , and 6 \) improved foreign relations these are in fact the six major accomplishments of my first term taking them one by one , last year , we created economic growth of 1072 percentthe fourthhighest in the world and secondhighest in asia more importantly , we held inflation to less than 15 percent and unemployment dropped to 43 percent we are one of the countries in east asia with the lowest misery index and wealth gap in the category of clean and capable government , taiwan is ranked sixth worldwide for national competiveness , and has been among the world s top 10 in terms of government efficiency for two consecutive years we were one of the five biggest movers in the corruption perceptions index when we jumped to 32 in 2011 as for fostering a more just and equitable society , this administration over the past four years has introduced more social welfare measures benefiting the greatest number of people , and a larger socialwelfare budget than any previous administration in the area of sustainable environment , we reversed the past practice of everincreasing carbondioxide emissions emissions in 2010 were lower than those in 2008 the air pollution situation is also at an historic best as for crossstrait peace , there are now regular direct crossstrait flights , and the two sides are enjoying the best relations in 60 years and in the realm of foreign relations , our ties with the united states , japan , and asiapacific and european countries are the strongest ever our diplomatic partnerships have remained unaffected and 124 nations and territories have granted our citizens visafree treatment sales of defensive arms to us by the united states have been the greatest in a decade i am delighted with all these accomplishments nevertheless , there s still room for improvement in each of these areas , and that will require a second term to complete president ma in fact , at present , we enjoy the greatest number of supporters among any of the three presidential tickets of course , the race is shaping up to be closely contested even though we have achieved many unprecedented accomplishments , the public hopes that we can do better this is understandable take the economy for example we hope to help more people , but the economic crisis of 2008 upset our original plans and has led to an unemployment rate today of 43 percent as opposed to our target rate of 3 percent the same is true of the gap between rich and poor so we need more time to realize our ideals people are more and more realizing that my staying in office will bring greater prosperity , as well as social fairness , and be better for the environment we have not publicized our achievements sufficiently there are many things we have accomplished that people are not aware of this is an area in which we will indeed improve president ma we 're pleased to see highranking us officials visit taiwan , as this indicates taiwan and the us have reestablished mutual trust at high levels of government over the last four years , we have worked closely with the us while developing our crossstrait policy , we have managed our relationship with the us in such a manner as to avoid surprises and remain lowkey this has helped increase mutual trust to a degree not attained by the previous administration or some others before it this is exemplified by remarks made by us secretary of state hillary clinton in hawaii that taiwan is a very solid strategic security and economic partner of the united states this is the sort of statement highlevel us officials would , in the past , have rarely made another example is when , at the world health assembly in may , us secretary of health and human services kathleen sebelius remarked that no un body had the right to unilaterally determine taiwan s status such remarks have no precedent this shows that the bilateral relationship is the best it has been in the last 30 years moreover , with crossstrait relations having improved , it has become easier for the united states to implement its own policies concerning taiwan and mainland china also , the impression of international media is that taiwan is no longer regarded as a troublemaker , but rather , as a force for peace president ma taiwanus bilateral relations , in the area of security cooperation , for example , are the best they have been for 30 years in three separate lots , the us has sold a total of us 183 billion worth of defensive armaments to the republic of china , the most in a decade aside from this , we are working hard to join the us visawaiver program we have nearly fulfilled all of the criteria for becoming a candidate country , a status we hope to achieve next year we are also negotiating an extradition accord with the us free trade agreement negotiations have moved forward , stepbystep , with further discussions held within the parameters of the trade and investment framework agreement \( tifa \) however , the two sides still have differences concerning us beef exports , which we are still discussing with the us while fostering communication with the public here at home we have been fully accommodative of us global policies , such as its antiterrorism policy we have had great success with our participation in the megaport initiative the us has also been active in fighting human trafficking , an area in which we have long been ranked at the forefront with one of the best records in addition , the republic of china has worked side by side with the us on many policies consonant with us interests this is a major reason behind the recovery of a high level of bilateral trust , which includes crossstrait policy president ma we have a long list of weapons we would like to purchase from the united states we are quite satisfied with the part that we 've acquired over the past three years , but we are still working on the purchase of f16 c d aircraft and diesel submarines upgrading the fighter jets is an important item currently , we have 145 f16 a b fighter planes , but these are reaching the end of their usable lifespan we are concerned about the availability of spare parts we have gained us approval to upgrade these fighter planes part of the upgrade will give our fighters capabilities that even the f16 c d does not have we are very grateful for this we will continue our efforts to acquire f16 c d aircraft , as our request has not been rejected by the us , which says it is still considering our requests , including that for diesel submarines we understand that the united states has its own difficulties , but in view of our national defense needs , we will continue to seek purchases from the united states the f16 a b upgrade just mentioned involves components whose performance exceeds that of current f16 c ds , including avionics and radars president ma before i took office , when we were drafting a crossstrait policy , we clearly understood that mainland china had already risen to become a major global economic entity , and that we must face the fact we realized that the mainland presented a risk , but also an opportunity over the past three years , we have striven to minimize the threat and maximize the opportunity for instance , since we have yet to identify a way to resolve the sovereignty issue between the two sides , we have set it aside by utilizing the 1992 consensus that there is only one china , but each side maintains its respective interpretation of what that china is this has allowed bilateral cooperation on more pressing issues to remain unobstructed by differences over sovereignty while implementing these tasks , we have been very careful to first establish a framework for instance , under the framework of the republic of china constitution , we have adopted the principle of no unification , no independence and no use of force no unification means we will not discuss unification during my term of office no independence means we will not pursue taiwan independence no use of force means not using force to resolve crossstrait issues the maintenance of the status quo under these principles has the support of 86 percent of taiwan s people and can thus be regarded as mainstream the consensus on one china , respective interpretations has also gained broad support these principles established under the framework of our constitution have allowed the two sides to shelve disputes while creating a winwin situation , and constitute the most important factor in the peaceful progress of crossstrait relations over the past three years thus , we will continue to promote crossstrait relations along these lines the two sides of the taiwan strait have many issues yet to discuss the process could be said to have only just begun take the crossstraits economic cooperation framework agreement for example we have only completed negotiations on about onefifth of its content many things remain that will require much more effort to accomplish president ma i believe that mainland china has not changed its objective regarding taiwan , which is to achieve one country , two systems and peaceful unification however , as a result of the improvement in crossstrait relations , mainland leaders talk less of these policies now than in the past because maintaining the current state of affairs is in the interest of both sides thus , the mainland so far has not made any changes to the actions taken under its original policies , including those relating to missile deployment this is of course not favorable to maintaining the status quo or the peaceful development of crossstrait relations we have brought this up many times before , and we inevitably take these factors into consideration when promoting crossstrait relations as i just mentioned , there are risks , so we must be very careful so when dealing with crossstrait matters , we always proceed carefully one step at a time , and follow the principle of addressing pressing matters before less pressing ones , easy issues before difficult ones , and economic issues before political ones judging from our endeavors over the past threeplus years , we are on the right track the more we create a peaceful crossstrait atmosphere , the less possibility there will be of confrontation , conflict or even war i believe this is the best strategy for taiwan president ma the opposition has been making empty accusations for over three years now every time i ask them to give an example of where i have conceded taiwan s sovereignty , they have nothing to say we have signed 16 agreements with mainland china every one of these has been openly signed and not one touches on political issues so , under such circumstances , when they claim that i have sacrificed taiwan s sovereignty , we respond , show me one example , and they cannot do so they only use this as a political tool and pretext it is utterly baseless as a matter of fact , i can cite an example of its speciousness taiwan has participated in the past three sessions of the world health assembly \( wha \) this was not previously possible under the dpp administration during that time , taiwan was only able to send lowerranking officials to technical meetings and could not be represented by ministerlevel officials however , we have done it we have been able to participate as an official observer under the name chinese taipei the dpp was unable to do that in other words , not only have we not sacrificed taiwan s sovereignty but , instead , we have significantly increased taiwan s visibility another example is our recent success in winning the right to host the 2017 world university games the dpp administration twice failed in its bid to hold the event , but we have succeeded we can clearly see that the benefits of improved crossstrait relations are not limited to the taiwan strait but have extended to the international community where taiwan s visibility has increased similarly , the republic of china lost six of its diplomatic allies during the dpp administration , but not a single country has severed official ties with us under my watch when we first came into office , taiwan was accorded visa waiver privileges by 54 countries and territories the number is now up to 124 this was something that the dpp could not achieve in other words , under this administration , our national sovereignty has not suffered instead , we have gained even greater respect from the global community these empty accusations by the dpp are not supported by any concrete fact there is no truth in them , just as there is none in their other criticisms of me i trust that our people will be able to judge for themselves let me offer yet another example during ms tsai ingwen s terms as vice premier of the executive yuan and minister of the mainland affairs council , taiwan s representative attended the wha under the name taiwan , china this was a name most strongly opposed by the dpp , yet the administration used it 18 times , including six times while ms tsai was vice premier we have participated in the wha three times , each time under the name chinese taipei while the people of taiwan are not happy with this name , it is one they can live with in addition to the wha , we have also acceded to the world trade organization s government procurement agreement furthermore , we have signed an investment protection arrangement with japan , which was the first time in 60 years at the same time , we are engaged in negotiations on signing an economic cooperation agreement with singapore we are also conducting feasibility studies on a similar pact with new zealand all this would have been totally impossible under the dpp administration clearly , through such agreements and participation in global activities , our sovereignty has been accorded much greater respect , which is most important for taiwan in contrast , the dpp s confrontational policy forced the world community to distance itself from taiwan we feel that our policy is beneficial to taiwan and is a direction that we should take in the future another important point is our relations with hong kong in the past , taiwan s representative office in hong kong did not have an official name it was known as chung hwa travel service this year , however , it was renamed taipei economic and cultural office in line with taiwan s other representative offices abroad this was the biggest change in taiwanhong kong relations in six decadesan obvious result of improved crossstrait relations this was something the dpp administration could not have achieved president ma of course we are a countryand an independent and sovereign nation we have diplomatic relations with 23 countries and substantive ties with more than 100 others around the world but their developing relations with us have been subject to many limitations as a result of the existence of mainland china nevertheless , this situation has changed with the improvement in crossstrait relations since we took office now , countries are willing to have better relationships with us because they think , if mainland china is willing to improve its ties with taiwan , why ca n't we \? of course , the mainland still engages in maneuvers that cause us problems , but certainly less so than before president ma i do n't think this is possible at present , because i am the president of the republic of china if i were to meet with the leader of mainland china , i would do so while maintaining my title of president and there is no way that this would be acceptable to them therefore , i will not be visiting mainland china , and i do n't believe mr hu jintao would visit taiwan at this juncture this is a completely hypothetical situation up to now , the two sides have not reached any consensus on the sovereignty issue , so it is totally hypothetical and could not happen right now at this stage in crossstrait relations , it is in the best interest of both sides to move forward one step at a time what matters most is that people can accept and are satisfied with this kind of progress a meeting between leaders of the two sides is not the top priority in crossstrait relations , so i will not visit the mainland over the next four years president ma mainland china has poured considerable resources into its military over the past 20 to 30 years as a result , its military power has grown dramatically in fact , the military imbalance between the two sides began in 2005 however , in terms of the big picture , taiwan cannot get into an arms race with mainland china hence , the defense strategy we have developed principally involves fostering the kind of situation in which mainland china would not think of resorting to military force to resolve crossstrait disputes thus , i have made crossstrait relations , and especially the institutionalization of crossstrait reconciliation , the first line of defense for taiwan s security judging from the current situation , the taiwan strait region is increasingly peaceful and prosperous i believe that no one would think of changing this situation , since the price would be too high for either side to pay this is the best defense for taiwan s security however , that does not mean that we do not need a national defense force , we must maintain a small but powerful national defense that can present a credible deterrence , so that taiwan s security is not threatened at critical times still , we must stress that relying solely on military force is insufficient crossstrait rapprochement , which deters mainland leaders from considering the use of military force to resolve their issues with taiwan , is in fact achievable president ma the considerable improvement in crossstrait relations that has indeed taken place since we took office is now taken for granted by the public , shifting the focus of attention to other issues in fact , more and more people recently have said they hope that there will be no major change in crossstrait relations the public will gradually come to realize that it is not just the sentiment of largescale business owners who have benefited , but also privatesector proprietors of restaurants , hotels and tour buses , since the opening up of crossstrait relations has brought a large number of tourists to taiwan , and not just tourists from mainland china , but also from other countries this has been very beneficial to small businesses , including pineapple pastry vendors , boosting their sales this demonstrates that this open policy is beneficial to the nation i believe that most would not be willing to return to the situation under dpp rule recently , more and more people have voiced the hope that our policy will continue , and i will continue to strive to explain this to the public the dpp has recently stated that it will not change the ecfa a trade pact with china this demonstrates that we were right all along and that their opposition to it at the outset , and even mobilizing several thousand people to march against it , was mistaken if they were to come back into power , would they try to turn back the clock \? this is a concern that many people have president ma democracy in taiwan has made clear progress over the past several decades three years ago when i was elected , then us president george w bush said in his congratulatory telegram that taiwan was a beacon of democracy for asia and the world this delighted us and made us reflect we are in fact a young democracy that still has many problems our elections are hotly contested , but there are still some violations of the law we count the vote very quickly , but there is plenty of negative campaigning that pollutes our society thus , while we have many areas in which we can improve , the overall direction is correct for example , the presidential debate held december 3 could be seen in mainland china this has never happened before even though it was not carried on television , it could be seen on the internet and this is no easy matter if the two sides of the taiwan strait can reach greater consensus on the issue of democracy , it will surely be a positive boost for bilateral exchanges president ma i have called on mainland china many times to refrain from any involvement in these presidential and legislative elections early on in several presidential elections held over the past decade or so , they took some actions that were not beneficial to the crossstrait relationship thus , i once more call upon beijing to stay out of our election president ma i studied and worked in the united states over a period of seven years and before that i visited america i feel that for us in taiwan , what we have gained from the us via a variety of channels and which has had the greatest influence , has been the american system of democracy and respect for human rights the us has had an enormous influence on the changes that have taken place in taiwan we have also learned a great deal from american technology and culture thus , relations between taiwan and the us , as far as taiwan is concerned , have been very positive several decades of friendly bilateral ties have made taiwan very happy to comply with any cooperative initiative required by the us thus , american scholars feel that taiwanus relations are the best in 30 years , and the triangular set of relations between taiwan , the us and mainland china are the finest in 60 years this greatly reflects mainstream opinion in the us we shall continue to strive for maintaining taiwanus ties at their best we also hope that the trilateral set of relations remain optimal while this is certainly no easy matter , given that we have accomplished it before , we aim to maintain it going forward over the next four years , while crossstrait relations and international ties are on a progressive track , we feel we can continue to improve them domestically , my most important policy is to narrow the gap between rich and poor , create more job opportunities , provide even more care for the disadvantaged , and reduce the mshaped economic polarization of society this is an enormous challenge , but we have accomplished a great deal in past years , perhaps the most in history nevertheless , it is still not enough the public is still not satisfied , so we must redouble our efforts we hope that in the future we will see a society that can

forty years ago sunday , on sept 2 , 1972 , in montreal , one of the most stunning upsets in the history of sports took place team canada an nhl allstar team led by phil esposito , brad park , yvan cournoyer , frank and peter mahovlich , bobby clarke , ken dryden and the rangers gag line of jean ratelle , rod gilbert and vic hadfield met the soviet national team , the world and olympic champion but a group that had never played a game against professional opponents it was supposed to be a cakewalk for the canadians , what many in north america believed would be the first of eight straight victories against the supposedly outclassed visitors from behind the iron curtain and indeed that s how it started , with quick goals from esposito and paul henderson the organist at the montreal forum played a funeral march esposito laughed and wondered on the bench whether they should take it easy so as not to embarrass the soviets but then yevgeny zimin scored , then vladimir petrov , then valeri kharlamov twice and boris mikhailov , zimin again and aleksander yakushev when it was all over , the soviets swirling , passing , creating beautiful play after beautiful play on clockwork rushes had shocked the canadians , 73 canada s image as an unassailable hockey superpower was shattered forever vladimir petrov centered the great soviet first line in the 1972 summit series , flanked by his wings , boris mikhailov and valery kharlamov he scored three goals and four assists in the series eight games last week , petrov answered our questions via email from russia on what it was like to play that first game in montreal , in what was then the terra incognita of headtohead hockey against the great canadian professionals \( translation by vsevolod kukushkin \) were you as astonished by your victory as everyone else in the hockey world \? naturally we were very surprised with the result of the first game none of us could even think about such an outcome before the game some officials from the sports committee told us , just don t lose by a big margin do you think you caught the canadians off guard \? it was easier for us to play against them than it was for the canadians to play against us we were quite experienced players we had behind us the olympics and world championship tournaments we tried to study them , but they did not bother to collect information about us so for them it was a surprise when they saw us continuing to play our game even after we went down , 02 , in the first seven minutes after the first victory our bosses who asked us to lose only by the minimum started to tell us that we now must win all the games and we have no right to lose what was it like to go to canada \? we were surprised with many things , starting with the royal treatment we received in hotels and so on after game 1 we were recognized at every canadian airport , and people were stepping aside to make corridors for us to walk down as we were going through them some fans gave us friendly slaps on our shoulders we even joked that kharlamov had more slaps from fans than body checks in that first game the canadians were already playing rough in game 1 of the series what was your reaction \? speaking frankly , we had no experience of playing in a game of such intensity we were not followers of the leo tolstoy philosophy if you get a slap on the cheek , give him one back we had some fights , but we were instructed from the very beginning that it is better to score more goals than to have some fights but naturally we paid back , and as you know some players still remember my friend boris mikhailov kicked gary bergman in the leg with his skate blade in game 7 , bloodying bergman s leg but that s history at that time nobody could foresee that we were forging the history of modern hockey
cairo an obscure militant group based in s north sinai region claimed responsibility over the weekend for a last week the claim called fresh attention to the uphill struggle the newly formed egyptian government is facing to control the restive sinai region the group , which calls itself supporters of the holy places , said in a statement posted on militant web sites that it mounted the attack in response to a crude americanmade video mocking the prophet muhammad , the same video cited in antiamerican protests around the muslim world the group repeated a false claim that a number of jews were involved in making the video , an apparent lie initially told by a coptic christian , an egyptian expatriate , who did play a role in the production the militant group also said it was responsible for a last year that killed 8 people and wounded more than 30 the israeli response to that attack inadvertently killed five egyptian soldiers , bringing the two nations to the brink of a crisis the militant group said that one of its leaders , ibrahim aweida , helped lead the eilat attack and that killed him last month in the sinai village of khreiza the attack on friday was partly to avenge his death , the group said all three of the attackers were killed by israeli security forces their bodies were returned to egypt over the weekend , state news media reported none of the militant group s statements could be confirmed the same group claimed responsibility for bombing a natural gas pipeline to israel this year the pipeline was bombed frequently over the last 18 months , until egypt stopped shipping gas to israel in a price dispute president mohamed morsi , a former leader of the muslim brotherhood , began a military campaign last month to clear sinai of what he has called militants and criminals , after killed 16 soldiers there are often reports of gun battles between egyptian soldiers and militants , and the army has announced the detention of dozens of suspects and the closing of at least 31 crossborder smuggling tunnels but the sinai region , dominated by bedouin clans who consider smuggling revenue a birthright , was relatively lawless even under former president hosni mubarak s police state residents often refer to cairo , even egypt , as a different country or colonial power after mr mubarak s government collapsed , the police scattered and lawlessness reached a new peak president morsi told a visiting business delegation that the reassertion of egyptian sovereignty in sinai was a top priority , participants said , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting but security on the egyptian side of the border remains a challenge last week , egyptian state news media reported that a government checkpoint on the road to the rafah border crossing had been attacked by unidentified gunmen for the 36th time since mr mubarak was ousted in february 2011
chestnut hill , mass before texas am shocked topranked alabama , before oregon , kansas state and moved front and center , aggies quarterback johnny manziel wrote on twitter , give to them nothing but take from them everything once no 15 texas am triumphed saturday when the sport seemed at its best , and everything seemed possible oregon presumably assumed its perch atop college football , with kansas state and notre dame remaining as the ducks' unbeaten rivals , left to jockey in the standings the southeastern conference , which has won six consecutive national championships , fumbled its best chance at a seventh manziel s rallying cry and brilliant play affirmed that no team is safe ask no 4 notre dame , which rolled past boston college , 216 , on saturday , one week removed from its near undoing the fighting irish would have lost if pittsburgh had made a 33yard field goal in the second overtime but the panthers missed , and notre dame continued on unbeaten and with new life ask everett golson , notre dame s sophomore quarterback he had been injured , benched , berated , but also praised for his play against pittsburgh , and all season , he often erased his own mistakes there were fewer mistakes against the eagles golson recorded his highest quarterback rating of the season \( 1642 \) and scored three touchdowns he appeared as if he belonged ask alabama coach nick saban , whose team had controlled its destiny until it faced manziel , the gutsy quarterback nicknamed johnny football he threw easily \( for 253 yards \) and ran effectively \( for 92 \) , stripping alabama of its confidence the aggies' defense chipped in , intercepting two passes and forcing a fumble although texas am has two losses , manziel could be considered a heisman trophy contender throwing for 2 , 780 yards , rushing for 1 , 014 yards and scoring 33 touchdowns this season across the field in tuscaloosa , saban , perturbed , ran his hands through his hair in the game s waning moments if two of the three remaining unbeaten teams lose a game , and alabama wins the rest of its games , the crimson tide could be the top oneloss team and positioned to sneak back into the national championship game two of the three national championship teams that i 've coached both lost a game , saban told reporters after the game this team still has an opportunity to win the west , go to the sec championship game and have a chance to win the championship game there is still a lot for this team to play for and a lot for them to set their mind to and recommit themselves to the possibility of alabama playing for a championship is not so farfetched the ducks finish their season against two currently ranked teams no 16 stanford this week , then no 13 and with a win over the cardinal , oregon would play no 21 southern california or no 17 ucla in the pacific12 championship game can the ducks keep their blistering pace \?

fiscal cliffs are nothing new in the classical record industry as became increasingly apparent when the classical music critics of the new york times set about the annual ritual of choosing records of the year , the larger economy could perhaps learn a thing or two from certain classical cliff dwellers who have managed to tailor supply to demand while maintaining a zest for innovation and continuing to lead and expand taste for more than a decade , the socalled major labels , such as they still exist , have been paying a heavy price for long years of excess and shortsighted management some have maintained a core quality , often surrounded by layers of crossover pandering and superstar indulgence but as our honor roll suggests , these days most of the action lies elsewhere with the latterday stalwart harmonia mundi and upstart labels like avie and cedille with big american orchestras recording for small international labels \( the new york philharmonic for dacapo , the minnesota orchestra for bis \) with performing institutions issuing their own recordings \( the berlin philharmonic the boston symphony , mariinsky and philharmonia baroque orchestras john eliot gardiner s monteverdi choir and english baroque soloists \) to add to the industry s uncertainties , we keep hearing that the cd is doomed , however much as the list clearly shows it continues to dominate our listening habits be all of that as it may , our critics had little difficulty compiling a small treasury of excellent recordings we allowed each critic to choose up to five cds , dvds or downloads and made a conscious attempt to spread the wealth , sorting out duplications \( i , for one , could happily have doubled up on two of the bach recordings listed , mr gardiner s motets and andras schiff s

london opened a criminal trial on monday against its former prime minister , geir h haarde , becoming the first country to prosecute one of its leaders over the financial crisis of 2008 mr haarde is charged , in effect , with doing too little to protect the country against the depredations of its bankers as they pursued wildly expansionary lending that resulted in he was indicted in 2010 by a sharply divided parliament , charged with violating the laws of ministerial responsibility public opinion in iceland about the case is split , according to hannes holmsteinn gissurarson , a professor at the university of iceland some people hope the case will help to shine more light on a traumatic episode , but many think that haarde is a sacrificial lamb , and that it is strange to drag him in front of court for something he failed to do , mr gissurarson said he may be a failed politician , but is he a criminal \? the trial opened a month after a prosecutor indicted the former heads of kaupthing , one of three failed icelandic banks , on charges of fraud and market manipulation hreidar mar sigurdsson , kaupthing s former chief executive , and sigurdur einarsson , the former chairman , have pleaded not guilty and are due in court later this year iceland was hit harder by the global financial crisis than many other countries because of its inflated banking system in a matter of weeks after the banks' collapse , the unemployment rate jumped to 10 percent , house prices fell , the currency plunged and inflation surged mr haarde , whose after the debacle , has rejected the charges laid against him , saying as he took the stand monday that there was no basis for them none of us realized at the time that there was something fishy within the banking system itself , as now appears to have been the case , mr haarde told the court on monday , reuters reported mr haarde , 60 , served as prime minister from june 2006 until february 2009 , when his centerright independence party was ousted in general elections by a coalition of the social democrats and the leftgreen movement  the trial raises renewed questions about what really lay at the heart of iceland s financial collapse while the public is still angry at the bankers , the government ministers are a different matter , and even some members of parliament who voted to indict mr haarde have started to express doubts about their decision perhaps the most prominent of those is ogmundur jonasson , the interior minister , who said he has changed his mind and no longer thinks that mr haarde should be singled out to stand trial
tbilisi , georgia driving from the black sea in the west to the rolling wine country in the east , one might be forgiven for thinking the entire nation of georgia is currently under construction new tunnels , railroads , highways , ports , parks and public spaces seem to emerge overnight , as do shiny new tourism outposts , like sighnaghi and mestia towns that just a few years ago resembled crumbling postwar italy today these places sport freshly cobblestoned streets , refurbished facades and slick multilingual visitors centers while this headlong development looks impressive at first blush , and is often touted by the government as evidence of georgia s rapid progress toward european statehood , all is not as it seems a recent report compiled by four nongovernmental organizations , including the international watchdog group transparency international , reveals that much of the development has been built on a foundation of trampled property rights in the past five years , landowners across the country mostly in places where the government has an interest in building something new have watched their property slip into state hands , often under nefarious circumstances none of these underhanded maneuvers were necessary georgia has good eminent domain laws and the government , rightly attuned to developing both infrastructure and a sustainable tourism industry , could have used them in its favor going that route would probably have meant slowing the breakneck speed of development in this breathless little country , but it would have also meant protecting those exact values democracy , capitalism , anticorruption on which georgia has staked its reputation the report chronicles the plight of hundreds of local landowners who have seen their property move into state hands these transactions have taken place in a variety of ways one common method involves the government sweeping into a region slated for development and electronically registering large swaths of land as government property that had been previously registered to individuals on paper only effectively grabbing private land in 2010 , the public registry began moving to a computerized system of property registration , which is incompatible with the older paper system when local owners , brandishing paper copies of their registrations , have on occasion sued the government , the courts have decided almost unanimously in favor of the state another common method is for landowners in a specific region or neighborhood slated for development to spontaneously , and often en masse , either gift their land to the state or formally abandon it , which makes it the property of the state in some cases , people have gifted the land where they live , farm or run a business in other cases , people have abandoned land that they went through the trouble and expense of registering only months before these socalled gifts , it turns out , are often the result of coercion and intimidation by government representatives public records show that giftings and abandonments have occurred all over georgia where tourism developments are being planned , including in the resort region of bakhmaro and the winecountry town of sighnaghi it s quite suspicious , no \? said gia gvilava , a senior lawyer at transparency international who has been investigating these issues for years he says most of these giftings and abandonments occur under a shadowy form of duress landowners , many of whom are farmers , are visited first by a tax auditor who examines the past sixyears of the owner s tax records and assembles a list of all unpaid taxes and fees when the landowner can t pay up , the property becomes a form of collateral the landowner is then visited by a government prosecutor who tells them all the terrible things that could happen to them if they don t give up their land , gvilava said they are too afraid to talk to journalists or make their cases public this is regrettable in georgia s rush to build roads , ports and tourist destinations , the government seems to have forgotten that the process is as important as the goal with construction sites springing up across the country these days , georgia will no doubt emerge in a few years as a freshly painted , newly paved nation but at what cost \?
opponents of the relocation of the barnes foundation and its worldrenowned art collection from a philadelphia suburb to a downtown museum quarter have asked a pennsylvania court to reopen the case allowing the relocation , citing a comment made by the foundation s former director , the philadelphia inquirer reported the 2004 ruling by stanley r ott of the montgomery county orphans' court permitted the foundation , which had struggled financially , to go against the wishes of albert c barnes , who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent , sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in merion , pa judge ott said at the time that he considered the move the only viable alternative to save the barnes from bankruptcy , but opponents argued that the foundation s troubles had been overstated in a new petition to the court on monday , the friends of the barnes , which opposes the move , said the case should be reopened because the court was given inaccurate information about the foundation s financial health when it made its decision the group cited a recent blog post by kimberly camp , the barnes s president and chief executive officer from 1998 to 2005 bankruptcy was not the reason we filed the petition to move the foundation to the city , ms camp wrote at the time the petition was filed , the barnes foundation had a cash surplus and we had no debt none but , saying so made the rescue so much more gallant ralph wellington , the foundation s lawyer , told the inquirer that everything ms camp and other barnes officials said in court at the time of the original decision was completely true and accurate the barnes had no debt only because of stopgap financing provided by several charitable foundations to keep it solvent , mr wellington said , and the cash surplus it had could not be used for operations all of the financials were completely public and in the record , he added the barnes opened to the public in its new home , designed by tod williams billie tsien architects , in may this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

jerusalem s leaders on tuesday strongly censured the european union s foreign policy chief , , for remarks made a day earlier in which she was perceived as having equated the killing of three children at a jewish school in france with the death of children during the fighting in  speaking at a conference on refugees in brussels on monday , hours after the attack in toulouse , france , ms ashton spoke of remembering young people who have been killed in all sorts of terrible circumstances in the transcript of her comments released by the european union , she continues the belgian children having lost their lives in a terrible tragedy , and when we think of what happened in toulouse today , when we remember what happened in norway a year ago , when we know what is happening in syria , when we see what is happening in gaza and in different parts of the world we remember young people and children who lose their lives of her comments and a transcript later released by ms ashton s office show slightly different wording and include a reference to children in sderot , israel , a target for rockets fired from gaza she finishes by saying , when we see what is happening in gaza and sderot , in different parts of the world we remember young people and children who lose their lives there was no immediate reaction from israel s leaders after the recording , on the european commission s web site , was reviewed tuesday evening an israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue said of the corrected version of ms ashton s speech that she had still made a potpourri of so many completely unrelated events it was not her finest hour prime minister benjamin netanyahu said earlier that he was infuriated by what he called the comparison between a deliberate massacre of children and the defensive , surgical actions of the israeli military that he said were intended to hit terrorists who use children as a human shield the interior minister , eli yishai , told israel radio that ms ashton should not stay in her post and that her comments hurt the european union s ability to act as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians israel s defense minister , ehud barak , said , the comparison made by ashton between what is happening in gaza to what happened in toulouse , and what is going on in syria every day , is outrageous and has absolutely no grounding in reality israel s foreign ministry said the bodies of the victims of the attack in france were being brought to israel for burial at the request of their families the three children killed held dual frenchisraeli nationality during a visit to chengdu , china , avigdor lieberman , israel s foreign minister , described ms ashton s remarks as unworthy he added that the children ms ashton should have been thinking about were the children of southern israel who live in constant fear of rocket attacks launched from gaza , according to the israeli foreign ministry after those criticisms , ms ashton s spokesman issued a statement saying that her words had been grossly distorted and that she had not intended to draw any parallel the statement said that ms ashton strongly condemns the killings at the ozar hatorah school in toulouse yesterday and extends her sympathies to the families and friends of the victims and to the people of france and the jewish community the statement said that her comments at the conference referred to tragedies taking the lives of children around the world and drew no parallel whatsoever between the circumstances of the toulouse attack and the situation in gaza in the latest crossborder violence between israel and militant groups in gaza , 26 palestinians were killed over four days , according to the israeli military most were militants , but four were civilians a 12yearold boy was among those killed in israeli airstrikes another boy , 14 , was killed by explosives in disputed circumstances in the same period , palestinian militants fired over 150 rockets into southern israel , none of which claimed a life
over his last season and change in minnesota , forward michael beasley has developed a deserved reputation as a somewhat counterproductive offensive player there is no disputing his ability to score in volume a no 2 overall pick by the heat in 2008 , beasley put up 214 points per 36 minutes last season as the timberwolves primary offensive option , placing him in the nba s top 15 perminute scorers but there s certainly something to be said about the way he creates his scoring opportunities according to synergy sports technology , 314 percent of the possessions that beasley used last season \( either by way of shot attempt , drawn foul , or turnover \) came in isolation a recipe for disaster given how involved he was in the team s possessionbypossession offense the wolves did not exactly have many superior offensive alternatives , but beasley s ballstopping may have been the final blow to an offensive system that was structurally unsound his reputation as a black hole \( the ball goes in to him , but never comes back out \) has persisted into this season , so much so that when beasley missed his first of 11 games because of a foot sprain , cracks with beasley as the punch line soon followed via jerry zgoda of the minneapolis star tribune in early january timberwolves coach rick adelman emerged after sunday s 9372 victory ended their twogame losing streak and remarked how the ball moved better offensively against the wizards that afternoon than it had before in this still young season so with the starting lineup modified to compensate for the absence of injured michael beasley , just why was that \? um , wolves forward kevin love said , mike being out \? he smiled as he said that and then added i m just kidding twice picking on love for his zinger in good humor would be foolish , but there was a modicum of truth or at the very least , perceived truth beneath his playful jab that said , it is important that perceptions of beasley s offensive detriment do not get too far out of hand the wolves are not , as has been suggested , better without beasley the wolves offense may be a bit more fluid when he sits , but the skill that produced beasley s volume scoring last season is still present and still valuable all available on off data from this season while admittedly noisy points to beasley as providing a net benefit to minnesota s offense and overall performance while he is on the court without doing any damage whatsoever to the team s assist numbers as an extension of that discussion , here s a look at how the wolves performed offensively with beasley in and out of the lineup the difference isn t at all profound , but if anything , one could point to the radical highs in minnesota s offensive efficiency that coincided with beasley s two best scoring games of the season a 19point performance against the san antonio spurs on jan 2 and , more recently , a 34point showing against the houston rockets on jan 30 beasley may struggle with consistent application of the wolves offensive principles , but he has shown signs both in those two games and throughout the season that he is capable of growth as a player and flexible enough to be used in a variety of roles earned repute is a hard thing to shed in the pro sporting sphere , and beasley has been made a victim of the preposterous he is who he is line of basketball analysis \( it can be better described as he is who he was \) beasley did indeed hunt shots last season , and he still isn t moving the ball as well as he should this year he is not at all a perfect player , and he is not without fault but none of that dooms him to a completely static nba life , nor does it prevent him from finding that tricky equilibrium of utility and restraint beasley is 23 years old his college career was dominant but incredibly brief , and devoid of proper development he has had just two seasons under a competent nba head coach \( erik spoelstra \) , but that coach hasn t yet shown an ability to cultivate young talent that makes this season the first real developmental opportunity of beasley s young career \( as well as his first season as a part of a functional offense \) , and though his production and efficiency have shrunk a bit this year , beasley isn t the possessionkilling monster he used to be here is a comparison using data from synergy sports technology of how beasley is using his possessions this season compared to last although beasley s efficiency is down on both of these play types , he actually ranks 27 in the league on postup plays \( from 20 last season \) and 59 on isolation plays \( from 74 last season \) in basketball , usage and efficiency have a negative relationship the more possessions a player uses , the less efficient he will generally be but beasley provides an example of how that truism can apply between play types as much as it applies between players consider beasley the postup threat , beasley the spotup shooter and beasley the isolation scorer as separate entities the more the wolves use any one of those dimensions of beasley s game , the more opponents will be able to predict and counter the corresponding action that s particularly damaging to isolation play a scoring avenue that is inefficient by nature but made even more so by having an entire team defense geared to stop a tunnelvisioned iso scorer thus , for a player as multitalented as beasley , the best practice is likely to be a healthy balance between scoring approaches , provided that his teammates can set him up with open jumpers \( they can \) and space the floor effectively for him to work in the post \( they can sometimes \) beasley appears to be moving closer toward that ideal as a natural byproduct of his evolving role in the wolves offense , even if he has not demonstrated any radical change on an individual level which brings up another important point beasley isn t the only one learning rick adelman is piecing together his rotation on the fly , and has done plenty of experimenting thanks to the wolves rash of injuries and persistent firstquarter struggles he is still not using beasley in optimal fashion , if only because no one knows exactly what that optimal fashion is at the moment all we do know is that beasley is a profoundly weird basketball player , and though it is difficult to pinpoint a perfect role for him with absolute certainty , his offensive potential is unmistakable beasley can do more , and will provided he isn t burdened with the label of being this or that by those that matter , and that he works with his coaching staff to find his own comfortable zone of nba effectiveness
cairo when a panel of judges closed the door on the candidacies of three leading presidential contenders this week , anger at the ruling burst into the open , with some candidates publicly accusing the panel of being manipulated by the country s military rulers the scaf wants to pull the strings from behind the scenes , said , a official who had been considered a frontrunner , referring to the supreme council of the armed forces another candidate , hazem salah abu ismail , who was disqualified because his mother held an american passport in violation of egyptian law , called the decision part of a conspiracy others , though , said that the simultaneous disqualification of , a former egyptian intelligence chief under president hosni mubarak , suggested that the panel , whose members included judges promoted to senior posts by the former government , had independently reached a decision that relied only on interpretations of the law , although narrow ones the disqualifications threw the presidential race into a new bout of turmoil and underscored a growing confusion surrounding the country s politics , which often seem to be captive to feuds or deals between powerful new actors that usually occur out of public view and they threw a spotlight on the influential fivemember election commission , which has been given broad powers to oversee every aspect of what is supposed to be the country s first fair presidential election , with virtually no oversight many criticisms have centered on the panel s president , farouk sultan , who is seen as particularly close to the former government analysts said that his rapid rise from a lower court judge to the head of the supreme constitutional court the country s highest fueled suspicions that he was handpicked by government officials to oversee the 2011 elections , which either mr mubarak or his son gamal had been expected to win s revolution that began in january 2011 interrupted those plans mr sultan could not be reached for comment immediately analysts said that by the time mr sultan was appointed as head of the constitutional court , mr mubarak had completed a decadelong drive to stamp out any independence on the part of the presiding judges that effort had started with government fears after a series of activist decisions , including one that placed elections under judicial supervision chief judges of the supreme constitutional court , once selected by colleagues from within the court s ranks according to seniority and experience , began to be appointed for political reasons , sometimes from lower courts mr sultan , who also sat on the military and state security courts , became chief justice of the high court in 2009 zakaria abdul aziz , a former president of the court of appeals who advocates for independence in the judiciary , called mr sultan a big part of the mubarak regime mona elghobashy , a professor of political science at barnard college who has studied egypt s judiciary for years , said the concerns about the commission did not end with mr sultan this year , another judge on the election panel , abdul moez ibrahim , was accused by a colleague of trying to influence a highprofile case involving foreign nongovernmental groups later , his fellow judges tried , unsuccessfully , to have him removed as president of the cairo court of appeals and the election commission s administrator , hatem bagato , has remained in his role , despite telling an egyptian newspaper that he was distantly related to another leading presidential candidate , amr moussa , a former egyptian foreign minister professor ghobashy said it was possible that the panel was acting independently after all , she said , even with strong limitations , occasionally fake institutions take on a life of their own but what was more likely , she said , was that egypt s military rulers were playing a role in the commission s decisionmaking it s obvious the presidential election exercise cannot be left to its own devices , she said it will bring someone the scaf does n't want to deal with how do they manage it to look like it s completely legitimate without using techniques like intervention , or rigging \? there s a back story it is hard to say which factions , if any , benefited from the disqualifications many people find it hard to believe that anyone can fully control egypt s volatile course none of the remaining frontrunners are seen as close to the ruling military council , though some experts said that a few candidates , including mr moussa , would be more palatable to the military than mr shater of the muslim brotherhood or mr abu ismail , a popular ultraconservative islamist the election panel provided reasons for the disqualifications , hewing to what observers said was the letter of the law , even if the reasons struck many people as unreasonable mr shater and another candidate , ayman nour , were disqualified because of convictions for political crimes that were widely seen as linked to their opposition to mr mubarak they do announce reasons , but ultimately , they 're not appealable , said nathan j brown , a political science professor at george washington university who has written extensively about the egyptian courts that makes some sense but it also essentially means that you 've got this body dominated by old regime holdovers whose decisions cannot be reviewed i think this is giving people problems
and foster friess , a wealthy donor to conservative causes , were walking out of an event together a few months ago when mr friess broke the news after backing mr romney for president four years ago , he was getting behind this time around he could n't quite figure out why rick was even bothering to go through the effort , mr friess recalled in an interview on wednesday i mean , i do n't mean to fault him for saying , why take rick seriously \? ' nobody took rick seriously many more republicans are taking mr santorum seriously now , thanks to his victories in minnesota , missouri and colorado on tuesday and perhaps none more than mr romney , for whom mr santorum s unexpected rise poses another threat from the right few people played a more pivotal role in tuesday s turn of events than mr friess an investor who made millions in and now lives in wyoming , he is the chief backer of a super pac that has helped keep mr santorum s candidacy alive by running television advertisements on his behalf his role as outside funder one that mr friess indicated he would continue to play in the contests ahead escalates the battle among a few dozen wealthy republicans to influence their party s choice of a presidential nominee they are exploiting changes to campaign laws and regulations that have allowed wealthy individuals and businesses to pool unlimited contributions into super pacs that in turn have inundated the airwaves with negative advertisements mr friess s chosen outlet , called the , provided critical support for mr santorum as he successfully sought to resuscitate his campaign with victories in tuesday s contests at a time when mr santorum could not afford to pay for a single commercial of his own , the red , white and blue fund focused in particular on minnesota , where the super pac supporting mr romney , , broadcast a lastminute blitz of advertising against him , according to an analysis from kantar media cmag but mr friess s help could prove even more vital in the weeks ahead , as mr santorum tries to capitalize on his upset victories on tuesday to mount a more assertive challenge to mr romney and to newt gingrich , who has an even more deeppocketed supporter in the billionaire casino executive , one of the richest men in country michael biundo , mr santorum s campaign manager , said the red , white and blue fund had been helpful not just with television commercials but also with a phone bank operation that helped drive santorumfriendly voters to the polls in denver while he said the campaign was receiving an influx of new donations after tuesday s victories , anytime anybody wants to help us , we 'll take it mr friess s personal calls him the man atop the horse his father was a horse and cattle trader he is relatively rare among the major backers of super pacs for his close association with the religious conservative movement his web site quotes scripture , and he often says that god is the chairman of my board he is also rare for his willingness to speak openly about his political giving , a break from mr adelson , who has not spoken publicly about his donations of 10 million , with his wife , to the super pac supporting mr gingrich there are not many donors who are really willing to be out there as such an advocate , said the founder of red , white and blue , nick ryan it takes a little bit of the cloak and dagger out of the whole thing that mr friess has given the red , white and blue fund more than 40 percent of its financing as of dec 31 , or 331 , 000 he said he had subsequently given more but he would not say how much , or how much more he may give in the future , joking , if my wife finds out how much i put into the campaign and santorum does n't win , you 're basically talking suicide and he played down the significance of his giving , crediting mr santorum with his own victories and noting that another donor whom he would not name had chipped in 1 million to the fund and was talking about giving more as of wednesday morning mr friess , 71 , said that he liked mr santorum for his faith , but that he also believed he was the best candidate to compete with president obama , whom he blamed for excessive government he said he came to know mr santorum several years ago and particularly approved of his opposition to abortion rights and his hawkish foreign policy stance i guess the point i want to make is i'm not supporting him for how i 've known him as a friend , said mr friess , who has joined mr santorum on the campaign trail i'm supporting him because he has the best chance to beat barack obama asked what compelled him to give so much , he said no 1 , i think of all the guys that strap a gun on their backs and head to afghanistan and iraq to keep us free and safe and maintain what america has stood for if i put up a million bucks or whatever , it does n't seem like much of a sacrifice like donors to rival super pacs , mr friess ranks among the country s leading patrons of republican and conservative causes he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the and candidates in recent years , including to mr santorum s two chief rivals for the presidential nomination , mr romney and mr gingrich , to whom mr friess donated last spring late last year , mr friess gave 100 , 000 to gov scott walker of wisconsin to help fend off a democraticled recall effort he said during the interview wednesday that he had spoken to mr adelson recently and he has also been an ally of the billionaire koch brothers , perhaps the leading financiers of conservative causes in the nation he has attended the kochs' semiannual retreats for major donors , including the most recent one , held late last month at a resort in california , and like them has donated to inspired candidates and groups , including the tea party express political action committee he is known to be particularly generous even by the standards of the more generous republican donors fred v malek , a prominent republican donor and fundraiser for the republican governors association , recalled mr friess s attendance at a 2009 meeting at which the group asked each of those present to make a fivefigure donation as it grappled with mr obama s victory and forthcoming races in new jersey and virginia foster got up and said , i'm up for four years , and i 'll pay in advance , ' mr malek said while reluctant to take too much credit for helping mr santorum , mr friess said he believed that the candidate s recent success may allow him to raise more money for his campaign and become less reliant on outside backers but asked if he would be prompted to donate more to the super pac if mr romney and the super pac supporting him stepped up attacks on mr santorum , mr friess seemed to relish the prospect well , i think that if he does that it is so exciting , he said , because it finally recognizes that rick santorum is a threat
sometimes , artists homes are turned into museums after they die perhaps fittingly in the case of mike kelley , the anarchic detroitborn artist who committed suicide in january , a museum of sorts dedicated to his memory will now be built as an almost precise replica of his childhood suburban ranch home down to the dimensions of the walls and the white siding the project , mobile homestead , had been in the planning stages for several years , and a small piece of the home , a trailerhousesize recreation of part of its facade , made a kind of ancestral journey on wheels , towed behind a truck in 2010 from downtown detroit back to the suburb of westland where the former kelley family home still stands \( three videos that mr kelley made documenting that journey and other parts of the project will be shown as part of the whitney biennial beginning may 16 \) after his death , the full project was put on hold and there were doubts that it would ever be realized but the museum of contemporary art detroit , along with the londonbased art philanthropy artangel and the luma foundation , a nonprofit based in switzerland , are set to announce on monday that construction on the fullsize home will begin in june on a vacant lot behind the museum , and the home is expected to open by early 2013 it will function nothing like a traditional museum or gallery and will show none of mr kelley s work , at his own insistence the mobilehome part will remain detachable and will sometimes take its leave of the rest and journey through detroit the home as a whole will operate as an unconventional community service office , providing things like haircuts , social services , meeting space and a place to hold barbecues and perhaps for the homeless to pick up mail we re thinking that our education staff will actually move out to the homestead and work from there , said marsha miro , the acting director of the contemporary art museum she added to have something like this in the city will be so important , not just for the city but for mike beneath the house will be two underground levels accessed by ladders that will not be open to the public mr kelley had envisioned those floors as a labyrinthine place where he would make art or music a subterranean studiolair as both fact and a metaphor for the kind of dark subconscious material he mined in his work the floors might now be temporarily given over to other artists or musicians , ms miro said mike had planned to do various activities down there that were secret we didn t know what they were going to be , she said we re not really sure what will happen on those floors , since he isn t around to use them james lingwood , a codirector of artangel who had worked with mr kelley for more than six years to plan the home , the organization s first public art project in the united states , said that mr kelley , a meticulous artist , had approved almost all aspects of the home and signed contracts for the construction before he died fortunately , enough was shared that none of us are feeling that we have to invent very much here , he said he declined to reveal the cost of the project but said that it was modest compared to many major publicart projects the group had commissioned in discussions after mr kelley s death with the trustees of his estate and with the museum , a strong feeling developed that it was the right thing to do to go ahead with this , mr lingwood added , as a kind of memorial , or actually more of a living legacy to him mike had an uneasy , conflicted relationship to lots of situations not least his native city of detroit , he said mobile homestead was conceived to embody this unease in a characteristically complex and robust way
the series is featuring occasional works of fiction this is one one afternoon , when i was 8 years old , i went into my parents bedroom and found a coin in the top drawer of their bureau it was very heavy and had ancient markings written in arabic or hebrew or chinese i thought it was beautiful and stole it and hid it in the steamer trunk in the back of my closet and that was the beginning whenever my parents were out , i d go into their bedroom and rummage through their drawers and closets i stole my mother s gold arrow pin , a glass statuette of a unicorn , a money clip with my father s initials on it , a very small pair of old rimless reading glasses and a ceramic thimble with a picture of a blue rabbit sometimes my mother would ask , did you see my beaded necklace \? or my father would say i can t seem to find my blue striped tie do you know where it is \? i felt they knew i was stealing from them but were reluctant to confront me then one day i found , in the bottom drawer of my father s desk , a red silk pouch with a gold braided drawstring inside were small blackandwhite photographs using the magnifying glass from my stamp collection , i studied these old pictures in which i appeared as a small child but did not recognize any of the people around me in one , wearing a sailor s suit , i was with a group of bearded men in dark coats , big hats and stern faces standing in a forest in another , three people were gathered together in the snow , one holding me in his arms and standing with his foot on a frozen dead cow , smiling at the camera in another , i was harnessed to a baby s highchair in the company of a group of people sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe they were sipping coffee and laughing and waving at the camera , while the cafe behind them was on fire the last photo was taken in a dimly lit nightclub a man , sitting at a white piano , wearing a bandanna , was accompanying a couple dancing the tango in a very sexually provocative way on the far wall , i observed a large mural of the baby jesus the face of the christ child bore an uncanny resemblance to the face of the child in the other photos , and i wondered why i d been chosen to represent christ in an argentine dance club but i couldn t ask my parents about the pictures , because it would have revealed that i d been stealing from them meanwhile , i began to notice that some of my own possessions were disappearing bit by bit a toy soldier , a harmonica , my favorite pair of beatup sneakers , a boxcar from my electric train and my autographed baseball cards of bo hoskins and victor kessel as more of my things disappeared , i became even more compulsive about stealing from my parents i stole pendants , lockets , coffee cups , two miniature landscape paintings , a few small cushions from the couch , four incandescent bulbs from the ceiling track lighting and little beads of glass , one by one , from the chandelier in the living room over the course of a few months , the walls in the apartment grew barer and the furniture seemed more exposed , and the house became darker it happened so gradually that my parents didn t seem to notice at the same time , more of my own things continued to disappear for everything i took away , something was taken from me , as though an undeclared war was in progress as we sat at the dinner table talking about the day s events , my father would stare at me with his brow furrowed , looking around the room to see if anything else was missing , while my mother twirled her hair and drummed her fingers on the table there seemed to be an unspoken sense of suspicion , fear , rage , betrayal , the feeling of an imminent explosion , as if we were teetering on the brink of violence , but none of us could confront the other and in this atmosphere , i still managed to slip the pewter saltshaker into my pocket then , when i returned to my room , i found that my bicycle was missing by this time , i had taken to wearing a fishing jacket with multiple pockets , in order to stash even more items , and by the end of the day i d have books , figurines , shoes , socks and gloves , and the steamer trunk in the back of my closet was so crammed with contraband that it seemed about to burst one evening , i noticed my parents had put up two surveillance cameras , one in the living room , the other in the kitchen , and posted a uniformed guard at their bedroom door that night , i put my chair and desk against my own bedroom door , boarded up the windows and placed a tripwire attached to a springloaded catapult that would hurl a firebomb at the slightest turn of my doorknob as i waited , i continued to obsess about the pictures of me as a child , taken with members of an unrecognizable family finally , i cracked i marched into the living room , where my mother was dusting a table and my father was sitting on the couch why did you leave those pictures of me as a child with people who are completely unfamiliar to me \? i said was it to suggest that i have no part in your lives \? or were you trying to drive me crazy \? and so , there we have it ! an admission ! my father shouted you were the one who started this but i m a child , i said you re adults you should have explained to me that stealing was wrong instead , you started stealing from me now i ll never be able to trust anyone i m only 8 years old , and my entire way of looking at the world has been corrupted why did you do this to me \? did you think it would make me stronger \? did you think if you exposed me to betrayal , that you were tempering me to be able to face the realities of life \? my father s face reddened , and my mother began to cry finally , i came around to the subject that had been haunting me and why am i the only recognizable person in the pictures you had hidden away \? who are those people \? are you really my parents , or was i adopted \? what are you talking about \? my father said what pictures \? i went to my room and returned with the red silk pouch using my flashlight and magnifying glass , my parents examined the photos yes , it is you , my father said but neither of my parents recognized the other people , either we all shared a sense of wonder and bewilderment and retired to the kitchen to get something to eat but the refrigerator was empty because i d stolen everything in it , and there was only one chair left in the dinette none of us had eaten for three days , so we decided to go to a restaurant around the corner we felt a sense of hope that together , as a loving family , we would solve the mystery joe frank has written , produced and performed more than 200 radio programs for kcrw in santa monica , calif , and national public radio he has received the george foster peabody award , a guggenheim fellowship and recently gave live performances in los angeles , chicago , san francisco and new york more of his work can be found at
kabul , afghanistan the war refugee sayid mohammad lost his last son on wednesday , 3monthold khan , who became the in camps here in the past month after we had dinner he was crying all night of the cold , mr mohammad said the family had no wood and was husbanding a small portion of paper and plastic that his daughter had scavenged that day he said the boy had seemed healthy and was breastfeeding normally , though the family s dinner consisted only of tea and bread but he kept crying finally we started a fire , but it was n't enough , mr mohammad said by 1 am the boy was stiff and lifeless , he said even by the standards of destitution in these camps , mr mohammad s story is a hardluck one khan was the eighth of his nine children to die back home in the gereshk district of helmand province , six died of disease , he said three years ago they fled the fighting in that area for the nasaji bagrami camp here , where a 3yearold son froze to death last winter , he said like most of kabul s 35 , 000 internal refugees , he fled the country s war zones only to find a life of squalor sometimes as deadly , even in the capital of a country that has received more than 60 billion in nonmilitary aid over 10 years later wednesday morning , mr mohammad s sole surviving child , his daughter , feroza , 10 , stared saucereyed at her brother s tiny body as it lay in the middle of the family s hybrid dwelling , part mud hut , part tent , with united nationsbranded canvas for a roof leaders of this camp say that 16 children aged 5 or younger have died here in the that set in about a month ago , keeping nighttime temperatures in the midteens eight other children have died similarly in another kabul camp , charahi qambar , according to camp representatives , religious leaders and families government officials have that the children could all have died of cold , saying the deaths were unregistered and not reviewed by medical personnel , while at the same time blaming the international aid providers for not sending more supplies private afghan companies and businessmen and some charitable groups have begun to distribute food , fuel , winter clothing , blankets , tents and cash support in the camps , but so far the effort has been sporadic and incomplete other relief groups and afghan government ministries are still in the process of surveying needs in the camp as one relief worker said , starting an aid program even in a month would be fast work , and by then winter will be mostly over the nasaji bagrami camp counts 315 families who fled from wartorn southern provinces like kandahar and helmand some of their rough shelters had wood to burn in stoves , while others , like mr mohammad s , had no substantial heat sources at all mohammad ibrahim , chosen by camp residents as their representative , held up his hand in a visual parable of the realities of inequitable resources see my fingers \? he said they are five , but none are equal the mohammad family had two large blankets to share , plus the baby boy s blanket , a velveteen comforter with designs of teddy bears and bunny rabbits on it we did n't even have enough wood to make breakfast today , mr mohammad said a neighbor gave a small packet of potato chips to feroza , whose name means turquoise , the gemstone in the bitter cold , relatives and friends gathered and meticulously followed the prescribed rituals for the dead hot water was brought in pitchers from neighbors' huts the boy s body was laid on a plank in the hut s mudwalled yard , and washed five times with the hot water and soap , a pink bar of safeguard a ditch was dug so that the wash water would drain away and no one would step in it accidentally , which they viewed as potential sacrilege khan was so small that the hand of the man who washed him covered half of his body his mother , lailuma , peeked from the door of the hut to watch , but otherwise the women stayed inside and apart but feroza , in a purple head scarf , slipped unnoticed past the men close to khan s washing place , pressed into a crevice in the wall and watched wordlessly a clean white cotton sheet served as his burial shroud the available scissors were too dull to cut it , so the men ripped it into pieces with their gloveless hands after tying the sheet around khan , they sprayed his shrouded form with perfume , and then they wrapped him again in his teddy and bunny blanket for prayers , performed on mats outside , the men removed their shoes many had no socks then they carried khan , bundled in one man s arms , in a silent procession to a graveyard the camp mullah , walid khan , pronounced the final prayers khan was laid in the grave with his face toward mecca , and each of the mourners dropped in three handfuls of the hard earth mr mohammad had not slept his eyes were bloodshot the septum of his nose had cracked from the cold , bleeding a little , and leaving a small red icicle feroza stood just to his side and behind him a little , clutching his coat she coughed deeply and her father started now she is sick , too , he said
minsk , belarus supporters of president won every seat in parliament in an election over the weekend that , as many in postsoviet authoritarian states , was widely seen as rigged , if perhaps a little less so than before the chairman of the central election commission said the turnout was 74 percent , despite calls for a boycott by two opposition parties other opposition figures were allowed to run in the election with fewer bureaucratic hindrances , which was viewed as an improvement over past parliamentary elections , but none of them won a seat this election was not competitive , said matteo mecacci , an italian lawmaker and the head of an international observer mission in belarus , in a statement released by the mission a free election depends on people being free to speak , organize and run for office , and we did n't see that the group s report noted the easing of rules for registering candidates , something belarussian officials are believed to have enacted last year in the hope that the european union would ease a visa ban on mr lukashenko and 100 or so other senior officials foreign ministers of the union s members will meet next month to weigh whether the changes merit a loosening of the visa ban and other sanctions belarus s political system closely resembles those in other former soviet states with authoritarian governments that stage rigged elections in february , for example , the president of turkmenistan with 97 percent support against seven candidates , all of them members of his own political party in belarus , the last three opposition figures lost their seats in parliament in 2004 alaksiej janukievic , chairman of the one of the two parties that boycotted the latest election , said that if mr lukashenko wanted to win an easing of the european sanctions , the logical path would be to allow one or two opposition figures into the 110seat parliament but letting even one critic in would challenge the whole ideological line of the government , mr janukievic said there is a president , and the people who support him , and there is a fifth column if even one opposition member entered parliament , it would show the opposition is not a public enemy , as the public supported at least one of them
francis warrington dawson , my greatgrandfather , was born in london in 1841 that wasn t his original name , however christened austin john reeks , he was born into an educated , uppermiddleclass catholic family after graduating from school , he took a european grand tour before university then his father declared bankruptcy an aunt , mrs dawson , offered to pay his university tuitions , but died shortly thereafter instead , austin took up writing as a career he also fell in love with the civil war at the time , many english saw the war between the states as a highly romantic struggle young austin saw a parallel between states rights and the english efforts to establish the magna carta he became increasingly engaged , and in the fall of 1861 , he announced his plan to join the confederate forces his father tried to stop him , declaring that austin would get himself hanged and disgrace the family name austin replied by changing his name , so the only name to be disgraced would be his own from then on he was known as francis warrington dawson he volunteered for the confederate navy and in early 1862 sailed from england on the nashville , under capt robert pegram shortly after his arrival in america , dawson left the navy to serve in the cavalry , under pegram s nephew , capt willie c pegram dawson acquitted himself well , fighting at the battle of mechanicsburg , the second battle of bull run and , in 1863 , at gettysburg he was wounded once and taken prisoner twice he was later assigned to gen james longstreet s staff , and in 1864 he was promoted to captain and yet at the end of the war , dawson was rich in distinction , but nothing else he wrote that he had a penknife and 5 to his name but he didn t consider returning to england he had fallen in love with the south instead , dawson became a journalist , moving in 1866 to charleston , sc he and a friend bought interests in two papers , which they merged in 1868 dawson became halfowner and sole editor in chief of the news and courier he also became an american citizen and began going by frank dawson so began his new life for the next two decades frank dawson s was a powerful voice in the new south his editorials urged industrialization \( bring cotton mills to cotton \) , scientific farming and racial tolerance he was liberal , articulate and impassioned his mission was to help the south embrace its future he consistently presented racially tolerant views to a community that had never before heard them from a white man in 1874 frank married my greatgrandmother , sarah fowler morgan , a judge s daughter from louisiana she was a beauty , with wide blue eyes and long blond hair she , too , was a romantic , an idealist , and a writer \( her civil war journal was later published as a confederate girl s diary \) for a while , dawson s views , though iconoclastic , were broadly tolerated but by 1876 charleston was experiencing a racial backlash , with increased restrictions on africanamericans and enmity for their white supporters dawson carried on with his mission , believing in the power of the press and his own rational goals he became a national political figure , and was a delegate to the national democratic convention in 1880 , 1884 and 1888 ben tillman , a budding politician and antireconstruction vigilante , vowed to bring dawson down a committed populist and racist , he accused dawson of elitism , mounting vehement attacks on him through a rival paper soon public opinion began to change , and dawson found himself fighting for his newspaper s survival , and losing the support of the white community during the 1888 election , in desperation , dawson sided with the conservative white elite , and so lost the support of the black community as well the newspaper was on the edge of bankruptcy , but dawson also had a domestic problem sarah had brought back an au pair from a european trip , a pretty frenchswiss woman named h l ne burdayron when a local doctor , thomas mcdow , called in to see a servant s sick child , he became infatuated with h l ne mcdow began to stalk her , lurking in the garden and following her on the street he asked h l ne to marry him , though he already had a wife , katie , and a mistress , julia smith the enigmatic h l ne did not accept his advances , but she did not repel them dawson learned about this from an anonymous letter incensed , he went to the police the police told him that mcdow was even worse than he imagined he was implicated in an insurance scandal , and was about to be charged with signing false death certificates in fact , mcdow s life was seething with lunatic criminality he had told his mistress , julia smith , that he planned to kill his wife , katie , in order to marry julia \( who was one of katie s closest friends \) he d bribed his brother , arthur mcdow , to murder his fatherinlaw , charles ahrens , so that katie would inherit his considerable wealth a plot the police had uncovered before it was carried out the police urged dawson not to take matters into his own hands , but dawson had always taken matters into his own hands on the afternoon of march 12 , 1889 , dawson appeared at mcdow s door mcdow was upstairs having an argument with katie he came down and let dawson in dawson introduced himself and then upbraided mcdow for his improper conduct h l ne burdayron was under dawson s protection , and mcdow was married but mcdow declared that burdayron was an adult , and this was none of dawson s business they argued , and then mcdow claimed that dawson struck him with his walking stick mcdow opened a drawer , produced a revolver , and fired a single shot at dawson the bullet pierced the vena cava , the great vein bringing blood to the heart you have killed me , dawson exclaimed he collapsed onto the floor the great vessel emptied the blood from his heart , and he died within minutes mcdow dragged the body to an earthenfloored closet under the stairs , where he tried to bury it several hours later he dug it up and turned himself in to the police at the trial , mcdow pleaded selfdefense , and displayed his bruise his lawyer suggested seductive entrapment by h l ne the jury was not informed of mcdow s murder plot against charles ahrens , nor of his affair with julia smith , nor of his promises to murder katie nor of a female patient s complaint against mcdow on the day of the murder , mcdow had paid a house call on a mrs fair , whom he had grossly insulted she pulled out her own gun to defend her honor and mcdow turned to run from the room , striking his head against the doorframe mrs fair was not asked to testify mcdow was , in fact , presented as a victim an outraged householder , a happily married man who d been seduced by a foreigner and then attacked in his own home he was acquitted according to family history , from then on my greatgrandmother wore black

paris in a windowless room on the 10th floor of a paris highrise , a cohort of blearyeyed government employees scans nearly every minute of nearly every show on nearly every major television network in they are counting , second by second , in the name of democracy they can tell you that fran ois hollande , the frontrunner in this year s presidential race , and his supporters spoke for 7 hours , 57 minutes and 50 seconds on the television channel between jan 1 and feb 24 or that fr d ric nihous and the backers of his nowabandoned candidacy with the party spoke for just 23 minutes and 55 seconds on the same channel the government agency that employs the counters , the , or csa , monitors television and the radio to ensure that all candidates , mainstream or marginal , receive their fair share of exposure in france s highly concentrated media galaxy , where 4 of 400 television channels command 60 percent of viewers it is all in keeping with a snarl of rules meant to protect the candidates' constitutional right to equitable participation in politics notably , broadcasters must accord each contender precisely equal speaking time and coverage in the final weeks of the campaign the agency has sought to tally every second of broadcast speech by every candidate in every french presidential campaign since 1988 this is all about democracy , said christine kelly , who leads the working group charged with the tally highminded as the agency s mission may be , it seems perhaps quaint , if not absurd , in an era of facebook , youtube and twitter none of which the agency monitors to say nothing of web news outlets or the printed press , where political coverage is essentially unregulated and often virulently partisan but the work speaks to the country s principled and rather egalitarian vision of the presidential campaign , in addition to its penchant for state intervention the rules draw groans and occasional outrage from media executives , whose stations must sometimes contort themselves to comply in a letter to government regulators last month , nine major television and radio networks requested changes , deeming the equal speech requirement problematic and counterproductive as well as virtually impossible to respect on a daily basis by the admission of its own administrators , the system is stunningly complex beginning in january of an election year , networks must dole out speech time and coverage in accordance with each candidate s political stature , as measured in part by preelection polls a host of polls show mr hollande , for example , around 30 percent , placing him in a secondround runoff against the incumbent , nicolas sarkozy as of feb 24 , mr hollande accounted for a low of only 13 percent of televised candidate speech on and a high of 29 percent on france , the public station representing france s farflung overseas territories as a result , tf1 will be obliged to raise mr hollande s share of candidate airtime , and france the opposite to further confuse matters , the speech time refers not only to mr hollande himself but also to any supporters from politicians and pop stars to farmers and retirees who back him on the air and while there are 10 widely recognized candidates , dozens of obscure characters are campaigning as well , including a stripper representing the pleasure party and a man who dresses as a bumblebee the agency tracks all of them after the designation of official candidates on march 20 they must receive endorsements from 500 local officials the agency requires that each receives equal speech time and in the final four weeks before the second round of the election , on may 6 , speech and coverage are to be equal for every aspirant fines are threatened for networks that fail to comply under french law , political advertisements are banned from television and the radio in the united states , federal law requires that broadcasters offer the possibility of equal advertising time to all candidates for a given political office but it establishes no firm obligation of equal exposure allowing campaigns amplified by super pacs to flood the airwaves and effectively places no limits on news coverage what limits there once were , under a 1949 rule known as the fairness doctrine , were dropped in 1987 the french agency s work is not limited to campaigns it tracks coverage yearround , stipulating nearly equal airtime for the president , members of the government and the parliamentary majority and opposition adding to the complexity , many politicians wear multiple hats beyond his presidential duties , mr sarkozy , for example , belongs to the governing majority and is a candidate because the csa s election rules apply in addition to its usual restrictions , the networks and the agency have had to parse his presidential speech , majoritymember speech and candidate speech mercifully , for the counters , there is no double counting when i arrived at the csa , i said to myself that i never could have imagined how complicated the regulations are , said ms kelly , who spent 18 years as a television and radio journalist that tangle of rules is critical , ms kelly argued , given the concentration of the french media sector and the political impact of news coverage in a nation without campaign advertising while proponents call the rules a democratic imperative , critics view them as a byproduct of runaway republican idealism , with sometimes unfortunate consequences in 2002 , for example , with 16 candidates to accommodate , tf1 offered each just two and a half minutes of airtime over the final 15 days of the campaign , for an average of seconds per newscast , according to christian delporte , a media historian during elections , stations often prefer to just not talk about politics anymore , mr delporte noted , with a laugh the democratic imperative' is working against democracy ! minor candidates have their own complaints in normal times , small parties must all but beg the networks for coverage , said pierre royan , a spokesman for nathalie arthaud , a candidate from the party come election season , however , the trend is reversed flooded with media requests , the party must turn down the same stations it usually chases after the regulations are better than nothing , mr royan allowed still , he said , what s in place right now is far from being real pluralism mr delporte agreed despite the profusion of minor candidates , he said , french presidents have always hailed from major parties we have this notion that a minor candidate , from a minor party , can become president of the republic , he said the whole system of equal speech is based on this illusion
roy bates , who commandeered a former british military outpost in the north sea nearly 50 years ago and , died on tuesday in essex , england he was 91 he had had alzheimer s disease for several years , his son michael said in announcing the death make that prince michael members of the bates family still claim dynastic dominion over what they call the principality of sealand , a rudimentary platform of concrete and steel rising out of the water seven miles southeast of the main british island and they are looking to expand the royal family even if you never get the chance to visit the trip requires a helicopter ride or a willingness to be hoisted by crane from a boat you , too , can join the royal court of one of the world s most enduring and entrepreneurial micronations the sells titles \( the count countess title pack about 320 \) , identity cards , stamps , wristbands and email addresses \( just under 10 for six months \) it helps pay for the whole sealand thing , michael bates said a country does need an economy , and the effort to sustain sealand with internet commerce is at least somewhat consistent with why roy bates arrived there in the first place in the 1960s , mr bates , a former major in the british army , was among a group of disc jockeys who tried to avoid england s restrictive broadcasting regulations by setting up pirate radio stations on some of the country s abandoned offshore outposts , which had been used to fire ground artillery at german aircraft during mr bates began broadcasting from one outpost within the threemile limit of england s territorial waters , and when he was driven from there in 1966 he planned to start a station at her majesty s fort roughs , which was in international waters instead , he founded sealand on sept 2 , 1967 , mr bates , himself its royal overseer and his wife , joan , its princess it was her birthday they had a huge love affair , michael bates said he really worshiped her mr bates was emboldened the next year when , after he faced weapons charges for firing warning shots at an approaching british vessel , a british court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case because the exchange had occurred in international waters a decade later , a greater drama ensued when a group of germans with plans to build a luxury casino on the platform tried to take control of sealand while mr bates and his wife were away they held michael bates hostage for several days before roy bates stormed sealand and retook it in a dramatic helicopter raid he imprisoned one of the men there when the german government sought britain s help in freeing him , britain declined to intervene , citing the 1968 ruling germany sent a diplomat , the man was eventually freed , and mr bates asserted that germany had effectively recognized sealand as a sovereign nation even after britain expanded its territorial waters to 12 miles from shore , it mostly left sealand and the bateses alone the family has explored various means of economic development , including housing an internet company that wanted to create a financial haven without government oversight it is still considering playing host to an online casino wikileaks is said  for now , most of sealand s trade is driven by roy bates s grandson james prince royal james who oversees the sealand web site the history of sealand is a story of a struggle for liberty , the web site says sealand was founded on the principle that any group of people dissatisfied with the oppressive laws and restrictions of existing nationstates may declare independence in any place not claimed to be under the jurisdiction of another sovereign entity paddy roy bates was born on aug 29 , 1921 , in london his father served in the royal artillery in world war i and suffered lung damage from being gassed the family moved to essex with the goal of improving his health according to an account on the sealand web site , roy bates was the only one of five siblings who survived childhood , and he barely survived his 20s , suffering several war wounds as a british soldier he once said that despite the paradox of him breaking away from the uk with sealand , he would do it all again if his mother country needed him , the account said besides his son , his wife and his grandson , mr bates s survivors include a daughter , penelope hawker , who has not been especially involved with sealand , and a granddaughter roy bates was not just a selfmade prince , he was a selfmade man after the war , he imported beef and ran butcher shops he built fishing boats in essex , and some family members still fish commercially for cockles , mussels , oysters and other seafood none of the bateses live on sealand , though they do visit and provide upkeep a caretaker usually occupies the place , which includes modest living quarters , a kitchen , a chapel and an exercise area sealand was abandoned briefly after a fire in 2006 but later repaired michael bates has said in recent years that the family would consider selling the place or , given the complications of selling a supposedly sovereign nation , leasing it but he said on thursday that no sale was planned he expects his descendants to preside over sealand for many generations to come the family , he said , plans to continue the legacy

rahm emanuel , the mayor of chicago , said on wednesday that he had stepped down from his honorary position as cochairman of president obama s reelection campaign to help raise money for priorities usa action , a super pac founded by two former obama aides the deployment of mr emanuel a former chief of staff to mr obama and an aggressive fundraiser with close ties to the obama and clinton donor networks gives democratic groups for the first time a dedicated rainmaker of a stature similar to karl rove , the strategist who advises a network of republican outside groups that are expected to spend as much as 500 million in this election cycle mr emanuel will also raise money for two super pacs supporting democrats in congress , beginning with a fundraiser in chicago on monday for house majority pac i just find all the specialinterest money lined up on the other side , tilting the scales in a way that i don t want to see so if i can help , i m going to help , mr emanuel said in an interview on wednesday his considerable campaign energies , mr emanuel said , would be best spent helping mr obama where he really needed help the president s got a great field operation , they ve got a great campaign , mr emanuel said but in the last 61 days , where can i be most helpful \? cochair of the campaign \? or priorities \? as the party s elite donors gathered this week in charlotte , nc , for the democratic convention , congressional leaders were fanning out to receptions and happy hours for the outside groups that the party once embraced only hesitantly , if at all on wednesday morning , as the washington post reported the news of his switch , mr emanuel joined the party s congressional leaders in charlotte at a briefing for donors and potential donors hosted by james simons , a hedge fund billionaire who is among a handful of democratic donors who have made a sevenfigure contribution to a super pac this year harry reid , the senate majority leader , nancy pelosi , the house minority leader , and senator charles e schumer of new york all appeared , according to people who attended , much as prominent republicans appeared at events in tampa , fla , for the rovefounded american crossroads and for restore our future , a super pac founded by former aides to mitt romney driving the burst of activity is deep concern among democrats at the vast fundraising gulf between democratic and republican outside groups and mr romney s apparent ease in matching mr obama s own campaign fundraising , leaving the democrats severely outgunned mr romney is expected to report raising 100 million in august , far more than mr obama and the democrats are likely to report as delegates eyed obama tshirts and thronged the bars and restaurants , strategists affiliated with the democratic groups worked the busy sidewalk between the charlotte convention center and the ritzcarlton hotel , one of three hotels hosting the obama campaign s top donors and bundlers , charged with raising money at the democratic convention , you can get a lot of work done just walking down the street , bill burton , an official with priorities usa , said on tuesday as he bounced between television appearances and private coffees with potential donors while some had opened their checkbooks in charlotte , mr burton said including one unnamed donor who committed 500 , 000 during a meeting the groups were more interested in harnessing the enthusiasm around the convention and exploiting the presence of so many elite givers in a few blocks radius the goal is to give people a clear sense of what our plans are for the fall and catch them up on what we ve done so far , mr burton said mr burton s group raised 10 million in august , by far its best month mr burton and others raising money for the group including the clinton veterans harold ickes and paul begala and a growing number of mr obama s top bundlers have tried to convince donors that they need not match groups like crossroads dollar for dollar to be effective unlike crossroads , whose advertising barrages helped republicans take control of the house in 2010 , and restore our future , which claims credit for helping mr romney win the republican nomination , the democratic groups have a less obvious record of success none of them existed until last year , in part because of the initial reluctance of mr obama , who has publicly criticized outside groups and the 2010 supreme court decision , citizens united , that helped pave the way for super pacs in briefings , democratic strategists working with the group have argued that priorities usa s relatively modest advertising buys had helped weaken mr romney and have put him on the defensive over his business record our mission for the first half of the race was to take romney s greatest strength , his business record , and make it his weakness , mr begala said on tuesday he can t talk about his business record anymore and he s just left with his charm mr begala had just headlined a cocktail hour at a charlotte restaurant , where a crowd of fashionably dressed potential super pac supporters enjoyed an open bar they were young younger than the millionaires and billionaires who have provided most of the money for republican groups some of them rising fundraisers for mr obama and some gatekeepers to major donors the gathering to some extent reflected the shape of democratic super pac fundraising so far a smattering of large contributions from wealthy donors , but far more checks in the fivefigure range more typical of traditional candidate money as soon as soros and lewis said no , we knew we weren t playing the republican super pac game , said one obama donor who attended , referring to george soros and peter lewis , the liberal philanthropists who gave millions to outside groups in 2004 but have been far less supportive this time around we re going to get there fifty , one hundred thousand dollars at a time , the donor said after standing on a table to address the audience , mr begala chatted with representative joseph crowley of new york , a senior democrat in congress outside the restaurant , mr begala dismissed talk of a cash gap , though he admitted that fundraising wasn t necessarily his specialty i ve never done this before , so i don t really know if democratic groups are raising enough , mr begala said i know strategy carl hulse contributed reporting
3 07 pm updated cleveland newt gingrich asserted on wednesday that an iranian nuclear attack on the united states was a real danger and that it could kill and wound hundreds of thousands of americans his comments were the latest in a string of hawkish and even apocalyptic statements that some republican presidential candidates , particularly mr gingrich , have been using to discuss iran but his remarks wednesday at an appearance here may have been intended to carve out new space on the issue against rick santorum , who now appears much more of a threat to mr gingrich after mr santorum s surprisingly wide victories in colorado , minnesota and missouri on tuesday night mr santorum has made warning about the threat of the iranian nuclear program a signature issue , and he is betting his campaign on a strong showing in many of the same super tuesday states , like ohio , that mr gingrich must perform well in to remain viable a report in november by united nations weapons inspectors said that credible evidence showed that iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear device but the report did not say that iran was trying to construct an actual nuclear bomb , and iran has denied that it wants to do so the report also described what appeared to be concentrated effort by tehran to explore how to make a nuclear weapon before 2003 , but suggested that the effort may have become less directed and more scattered in later years in the past , mr gingrich has said that if iran were to obtain nuclear weapons , then not only israel but also the united states would be at risk , and he has characterized iran as a country and a culture that fosters terrorism he has also talked about how much worse a nuclear attack on the united states would be than the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington he tied those warnings particularly close together in his appearance here you think about an iranian nuclear weapon you think about the dangers , to cleveland , or to columbus , or to cincinnati , or to new york , mr gingrich said remember what it felt like on 9 11 when 3 , 100 americans were killed now imagine an attack where you add two zeros and it s 300 , 000 dead maybe a halfmillion wounded this is a real danger this is not science fiction that s why i think it s very important that we have the strongest possible national security there is no evidence that iran has developed a warhead that could fit atop one of its missiles , and those missiles do not have the range to reach the united states \( much of europe is also out of range \) while there are other ways to deliver a nuclear weapon by ship container , or aboard an airplane for example none are easy , and mr gingrich did not explain how he thought iran might carry out such an attack david e sanger contributed reporting from washington this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo \( photograph by michael mcelroy for the new york times \)
dennis surratt crouches beneath center , a quarterback secondguessing a play sent in by his coach the score is 00 just before halftime in one of the rarest and longest high school football games ever played the weather is so bad that the radio announcer says , last time it rained like this , somebody built an ark the play , tackle trap left , requires nimble footwork and tricky ballhandling in the wingt offense surratt is worried that he may stumble in mud so thick that the announcers struggle to read the numbers on the players' jerseys but he does what his coach orders he spins 180 degrees , fakes to his fullback slogging right and hands the ball to a halfback running left surratt is not wearing a uniform he is not on a football field he is standing in the optical department of a walmart in opelousas , la he is an optometrist and he is wearing a white lab coat , his name stitched across the breast he is 57 , his hair thinner and his waist thicker than at 17 , but his memory is as lithe now as his feet were then he reenacts the play from 40 years earlier , hands off the imaginary ball and watches the invisible hole open his trepidation dissolves as it always does in the retelling later , he pushes up the sleeve of his lab coat he rubs his arm still get goose bumps , he says on dec 1 , 1972 , surratt and neville high school of monroe in northern louisiana played a state semifinal game against brother martin high school of the renowned new orleans catholic league these were the days before overtime was used the playoff game ended 00 the first tiebreaker , first downs , ended even at 99 the second tiebreaker , penetrations of the opponent s 20yard line , also finished level , at 11 beyond that , the louisiana high school athletic association had no official way to resolve a game so four days later , on dec 5 , the state semifinal was replayed in its entirety this time , the rain sheeted and mud spackled the players' numbers , and their uniforms glistened as if slathered in pudding neville won , 80 three days after that , it played its third game in eight days without surrendering a point , winning , 60 , over airline high of bossier city to take the class aaaa state title for louisiana s largest schools at the time recordkeeping in high school football is scattered and incomplete , so no one knows how many games have been replayed from beginning to end another playoff game in louisiana was apparently redone in 1955 but experts said the occurrence was extremely rare the national federation of state high school associations said it knew of no other starttofinish replays same with officials and veteran sportswriters from prep football hotbeds in texas , california , florida , pennsylvania and ohio on oct 29 , 2010 , in the piney woods of east texas , jacksonville high defeated nacogdoches high by 8481 in a game that extended through 12 overtime periods and lasted 5 hours 24 minutes but that game was decided by continuous play in one evening , not repeated and prolonged over five days as the louisiana playoff was in 1972 replaying a whole game would be a real rarity , especially a game of that significance , a state semifinal , said doug huff , a high school sports historian from wheeling , wva and you might play three basketball games in eight days , but football is a different deal neville high was a quaint yet turbulent place in 1972 the team s star safety became the valedictorian and married the homecoming queen but the football season played out during a tempestuous period after the desegregation of louisiana s public schools personal tragedy also encroached on the playoff against brother martin one of neville s key players rode for hours to the first semifinal game directly from his father s funeral neville was coached by an intense and complicated former marine named charlie brown , whose meticulous handwriting underscored his demand for perfection and who went to his grave last year with a secret about his identity one of neville s players , running back lawrence anderson , later set a record for kickoff return yardage while playing for the pittsburgh steelers during the 1979 nfl season another player , center bill johnson , is the defensive line coach for the new orleans saints neville was led by surratt , its 5foot10 , 170pound quarterback he possessed a broad athleticism that earned him a scholarship to play college baseball and an easy confidence that brought the nickname bell cow , because others eagerly followed his lead surratt s guidance and brown s motivational skills could make a puppy pull a freight train , defensive back lee scott herron said football had long been ascendant at neville high the tigers won state championships in 1955 , 1959 , 1961 and 1962 under coach bill ruple , who lived in an apartment in the stadium that now bears his name neville was also one of the few high schools to have a live bengal tiger for a mascot the tiger , shasta ii , weighing 450 pounds , was purchased by students in 1972 from a rare feline breeding center and housed at the zoo in monroe on game days , students retrieved the tiger , placed it in a cage and drove it to the stadium cheerleaders led cheers from the roof of the cage , and in less litigious times , few worried about the complications of mixing high school kids and a wild animal can you imagine the liability today \? said buff harvey , a member of the neville dance team in 1972 who later married one of the team s running backs crazy boys went to the zoo and hooked him up it was n't the president of the student body , just somebody with a bronco on fridays , shasta also made appearances onstage in a cage at pep rallies in the school auditorium the practice was discontinued , the story goes , after the tiger occasionally nicked a coach or cheerleader the spca was n't happy , said dana jefferson , class of 1966 , who is now the executive director of neville s alumni association shasta did reach out and touch a couple people he was sedated no one had to go to the hospital but it was kind of hairy though charlie brown , the neville coach , bore the same name as the popular peanuts character , he hardly possessed the personality of an endearing loser he was masterful at making a game plan among his players , he was respected but not universally liked to some , he became a surrogate father seven players from the 1972 team followed his career path and became teachers and coaches johnson , who won a super bowl as a saints assistant after the 2009 season and a collegiate championship as an assistant with miami in 1987 , cannot mention brown s name without melting into tears he made everybody believe they were winners , johnson said the super bowl is the ultimate , but playing at neville is the reason i went to the super bowl i fell in love with the game otherwise , i 'd have been down the street stealing or smoking like the rest of the guys in my neighborhood neville gave me something i loved , a passion i learned to like to win to his favorite players , brown could show formal affection in the 1971 state semifinals , neville lost by 76 to the same brother martin team when surratt was stopped inches from the goal line on a 2pointconversion attempt in the final minute he rolled on the ground and saw a brother martin cheerleader he knew by the way she jumped and held her pompoms , outstretched instead of by her side , that neville had lost surratt was devastated but brown later wrote a soothing letter to his quarterback , saying your contributions did not go unnoticed we are scratched but not broken brown could be funny , too he gave the nickname clyde to a player named melvyn mccoy because we ca n't have a big tackle named melvyn but brown could also be caustic and lacerating with his players he was known to bang the ear holes of their helmets with a metal clipboard some players said he struck them others said they were so intimidated that they feared speaking to him pat scallan , a twotime allstate linebacker and a selfdescribed rebel , said he once almost came to blows with his coach at practice , brown invariably wore a white tshirt and khakis the pinkie finger on his left hand was missing , lost in a farming accident but a legend persisted that he had wearied of the finger getting caught in his players' face masks as he admonished them and had told doctors , just cut it off bob brown , the second of charlie s three sons , played for his father and graduated from neville in the spring of 1972 in those days , he said of his father , he did n't have a friend , did not want a friend he was probably one of the meanest individuals anyone has ever seen , bob brown said he was consumed with winning after an early playoff exit in 1970 , charlie brown became convinced that long hair had left his players distracted so he made them shave their heads as summer practice began in 1971 , sending the players back to the barbershop until he could no longer pinch their hair between his thumb and index finger if brown could not outsmart all other coaches , he was determined to outwork them three or four nights a week , summers included , he watched game film in the kitchen after dinner he insisted that his son bob assist him they spent hours reviewing neville s performances and they scouted opponents , both those on the schedule and others that might await in the playoffs bob brown said that his father was reluctant to display any favoritism toward him even during these private film sessions instead he voiced his approval by saying , miss jones s boy did ok on that play when the youngest of the brown sons , bill , sustained what appeared to be a broken leg during a junior varsity game in the 1970s , bob said that his father dismissively responded , what do you want me to do about it \? and returned to treating a star varsity quarterback who was recuperating from a knee injury later , bob brown said , he began to understand his father s fierce , blundered drive he described an itinerant life , full of privation , that his father lived as a boy , saying he moved from town to town , essentially living on the street and subsisting in monroe mostly on ice cream from the pharmacy where he worked and on food given to him by a friend in high school at neville , charlie brown played quarterback he was known as the shadow because he was so skinny that he did not cast one but he persisted with a mantra that he later repeated to his players keep pushing never give up brown joined the marines , later earned a master s degree , returned to neville and won four state football championships as an assistant coach and four state titles as the head baseball coach by 1972 , he was in his 10th season as head football coach but the ultimate prize of a state championship had eluded him he never had anything his whole life , said bob brown , 58 , a financial adviser he was trying so hard to become something and prove himself louisiana s public schools began to fully integrate during the 196970 school year a month after neil armstrong walked on the moon but by 1972 , neville had only two black players on its roster at first , blacks were reluctant to play for a white coach , fearing they would not get a fair shake , bob brown said anderson , the running back and future super bowl star , offered a more nuanced explanation in middle school , anderson said , he and his sister had been among the first africanamerican children to integrate monroe s schools when full integration came , a number of black students still held allegiance to their former school , carroll high , anderson said it was just the times , anderson said from a loyalty perspective , black athletes were torn they had the same pride and tradition at carroll people were cautious about extending themselves when he joined the team at neville , anderson said , he was called an uncle tom of brown , the coach , he said i imagine there was a lot of pressure on him for playing me i imagine he had to endure ridicule but he gave me a chance that speaks to the man some white players also felt a sense of dislocation at the time integration brought white flight several players left neville to attend private school other whites were sent as ninth graders to carroll high , the former allblack school in monroe in this chaotic period , they felt whipsawed by history , worried that their academic and athletic futures were in jeopardy forty years later , it is one of the greatest things that happened to me , to see the way life was becoming , blacks and whites living together , johnson , the saints assistant , said but in 1972 , there was fear that the federal courts were trying to break us up that was part of this fight to win this game , johnson said we thought our dreams were about to be shattered on dec 1 , 1972 , neville supporters chartered 17 buses for the fourandahalfhour trip from monroe , a college town along interstate 20 , to new orleans what followed in the concrete horseshoe of tad gormley stadium was one of the sport s most unusual and protracted games neville and brother martin were the state s topranked teams neville was undefeated , and brother martin , the defending state champion , had lost once at least two dozen players on the rosters would play college football brother martin s advantage , apart from playing at home , appeared to be size fifteen of its players weighed more than 200 pounds sizable in those days while only three neville players carried as much weight brown called his players little oilrag knots he poormouthed to reporters that brother martin was bigger than louisiana state and tulane when paul mcelroy , a 140pound neville halfback , walked onto the field , he gauged the size of the opponents and said to himself , why did n't i join the band \? until minutes before kickoff , neville was missing one of its most vital players , james leblanc , the punter and a starting defensive back three days earlier , he had been at practice when his brotherinlaw arrived unexpectedly and pulled him off the field leblanc s father had died surratt can still remember leblanc dropping his head in shock when leblanc arrived home , the news became even more despairing his father had shot himself , he said , perhaps over workrelated stress , but for reasons that never became clear after practice that day , leblanc said , his coaches and a dozen or more teammates went by to console him his mother told him to do what he thought best about the playoff game he decided to play it was the love of those guys , said leblanc , 58 , a carpenter they were all there for me at my time of sorrow i just thought it was something i needed to do to be with them they were the closest family i had outside what i lost after attending his father s funeral that friday , leblanc rode with his brotherinlaw to new orleans , arriving just before kickoff he remembers his teammates and coaches hugging him and crying they handed him his uniform as he walked into the locker room it was the greatest feeling , he said my emotions were all built up , and then i just relaxed leblanc would become indispensable in a game of defensive obstinance the ball was punted 17 times neither neville s wingt nor brother martin s wishbone could manage a touchdown or a field goal each team crossed the other s 20yard line only once with 1 minute 7 seconds remaining , brother martin threw a rare pass that tied the first downs at nine apiece then , on the final play , another desperate pass was thrown a first down for brother martin would have secured the victory on a tiebreaker instead , leblanc jumped and intercepted the ball and then players began to look around the score was 00 the tiebreakers were even neither team had won or lost what happened now \? players lingered on the field as coaches for both teams headed to a pay phone beneath the stands to speak with the state athletic commissioner few fans seemed to leave an eerie quiet prevailed without the noise of the cheerleaders and the bands , said scooter parris , a wide receiver for brother martin the game had been so muscular and exhausting that some players were cramping and not certain they could play anymore that night it was everything a fistfight could be without throwing punches , said darryl brue , an allstate defensive tackle for brother martin ron brocato , a sportswriter and photographer for the nowdefunct new orleans statesitem , followed both coaches from the field his photo showed bob conlin , the brother martin coach , still carrying the ball , as if the coaches might settle the outcome among themselves they pulled the pay phone from a girl who was trying to get a ride home from her parents or her friends , brocato said frank spruiell , the louisiana high school athletic commissioner , was asleep and had to be awakened , according to some accounts he suggested a coin flip to decide the game both coaches declined both teams played their hearts out and are deserving to win or lose on more than a coin flip , brown told the monroe morning world spruiell then suggested a replay four days later at a neutral site both coaches wanted to wait a week for a rematch spruiell then offered a solution of sudden death , according to the statesitem one team would run four plays from the opponent s 10yard line a coin toss would decide which team got the ball if the team scored , it would be the victor if it could not score , the other team would win the coaches shook their heads and laughed , brocato wrote players remained on the field for what seemed like 45 minutes or an hour nothing was decided , so both teams headed home we did n't know how to act , said bruce hanks , a neville safety the mood on the bus was quiet and tense , players said neville had lost , 76 , to brother martin in the 1971 semifinals and had played to an indeterminate conclusion in 1972 were they in trouble with their coach \? would brown yell at them \? on the ride home , neville stopped in baton rouge for burgers at a drivein called hopper s ruple , the former coach and then the school s athletic director , put money in the jukebox , stood on a chair and did a little dance , players said i knew we were n't in trouble , said mcelroy , the halfback the next day , a saturday , it was decided that neville and brother martin would play their rematch on tuesday the game would be played on a neutral field in alexandria in central louisiana the winner would host the state championship game three days later airline high of bossier city had reached the final on the visitor s side of the bracket its coach offered to postpone the title game for a week if it could play host no , thanks , neville and brother martin said chubby marks , an assistant coach at brother martin , said coaches began phoning spas and health clubs in new orleans , seeking the use of whirlpools for their players brue , the allstate tackle , said three universities that were recruiting him offered their whirlpools and trainers to help restore his aching body he declined , he said , fearing the wrath of the ncaa for a recruiting violation and his mother s culinary scorn for missing sunday dinner it was a command performance , brue said you had to be there at the table that tuesday , dec 5 , 1972 , neville and brother martin traveled to alexandria for the rematch it might have been postponed if not for the pending championship game pounding rain left water standing between the hash marks even before kickoff , the game film shows players wiped mud from their faces , scoured it from their ears referees tried to keep the ball dry by covering it with a towel as players herded in the middle of the field , it turned to the rutted slop of a feedlot there was enough water to run a shallowrunning crank bait through it , herron , the neville defensive back , said , laughing leblanc rescued neville early by scooping up a bouncing snap on a punt then he intercepted a pass in the end zone neville finally got a decisive break by blocking a punt in the second quarter the drive nearly stalled , though , and the tigers faced fourthand3 at the brother martin 23yard line brown signaled for tackle trap left , and surratt worried that he might lose his footing in the muck but he spun and handed the ball to mcelroy , the halfback , who hydroplaned for 11 yards and a first down it parted like the red sea , surratt said four plays later , fullback jerry tucker mushed into the end zone on the next snap , surratt completed his only pass of the night for an 80 lead after six quarters , someone had finally scored in this semifinal the rain was unyielding in the second half , the stadium lights cast a white sheen on the field , as if it were covered in ice the score held neville had reached the state final they were so much bigger and better than us , said don bartlett , a neville defensive back we should n't have been on the field with them the next morning , neville used electric fans in its equipment room to dry its waterlogged equipment there were only two days to prepare for the state championship some players went to class for half a day that week some missed school entirely i had bruises on top of bruises , said scallan , the allstate linebacker seemed like every player they had was 40 pounds heavier i was totally exhausted i only got out of bed to brush my teeth and go to practice i do n't think i 've felt that tired since it had been 10 years since neville won a title the school s tradition demanded victory , scallan said the pressure seemed as persistent as the rain that continued to fall in northern louisiana the world would explode if we lost , scallan , 57 , said our life would come to an end you start going to games in the sixth , seventh , eighth grade you walk the halls with the seniors you look at guys wearing their letterman jackets you 're like , these are winners' the junior high coach sits you down and tells you you boys are athletes people look up to you you need to set the correct example' they instilled winning there is no place here for a good loser my mother wore a tiger dress and a tiger hat to games she had a cowbell i 'd hear that cowbell i knew she was watching , and i 'd better kick someone s butt rain left neville s field sodden by the start of the title game would we want it any other way \? brown asked his players photographs showed him pacing the sideline in hip waders rumors have persisted for four decades that brown augmented the rain by watering neville s field to limit airline high s passing attack neville players say they would not be surprised it was for humanitarian reasons , herron said he did n't want anyone turning their ankles on a dry field at halftime , the score remained 00 anderson , the running back , had broken and dislocated his left index finger in the semifinals he played sparingly in the final , and brown later apologized perhaps considering the racial sensitivities of the time , he told anderson , i knew if i gave you the ball and you fumbled , you 'd beat yourself up as the neville players changed into dry uniforms at the half , brown had one more motivational card to play mike harvey , a running back , said that the championship and runnerup trophies appeared in the locker room brown picked up the secondplace trophy , harvey said , told his players , this is not the one we want ! and threw it to the ground as it turns out , the runnerup trophy might have been a fake , a stunt double , said bob brown , charlie s son he was a master at those kinds of things brown s players did not disappoint him early in the fourth quarter , scallan intercepted a pass on the next play , surratt called a quick snap , caught airline unaware and ran 27 yards to the end zone on a quarterback sneak , seeming to move sideways and forward at the same time the game ended at 60 , neville won its title with a 1301 record , and brown waded into a thicket of celebrating arms these young men will always be remembered as champions , brown told the monroe morning world , not only because they emerged as undefeated champions but because they did so under the most difficult obstacles that any team i know of ever incurred surratt came through when it mattered most , as he always did , brown told the newspaper surratt s mother took his mouthpiece and chin strap and thumbtacked it to the wall of her trophy room it remained for more than three decades at the team s 30year reunion , in 2002 , surratt moved tables aside at a restaurant and lined his teammates in formation , the old quarterback still running plays late into the night you forget your kids' birthdays , but you never forget three games in eight days , herron said louisiana adopted overtime in 1976 before brown retired in 1992 after 30 seasons as head coach and a record of 262665 , he won two more state titles and finished second three times but surratt remained perhaps his favorite player in his living room , brown kept a picture of his eldest son , tom , who pitched in the major leagues , and one of surratt when bob brown s wife asked why there was no photograph of her husband , charlie brown replied , bob never won a state championship for me a gradual softening occurred in his father after that 1972 title , bob brown said a burden seemed to be lifted if the phone rang , he answered it if the doorbell rang , he opened the front door he brought fish to his friends , and ice cream he quit smoking he became more human , bob brown said people were trying to get to know him , and he was finally starting to let people in , to be a regular person when charlie brown was inducted into the louisiana high school sports hall of fame , anderson made a point of attending when anderson graduated from neville in 1974 , he said , brown came to his mother s house with a recruiter and helped secure a tryout at louisiana tech at a time when few black players found opportunities at southern universities later , brown kept in touch by phone he was interested in me more than just as a football player , said anderson , 56 , a supervisor of child welfare for the caddo parish school district in shreveport , la he was interested in me as a person he wanted to make sure i got my schooling that meant a lot leblanc , the former punter and defensive back , did carpentry work for brown through the years they would sit and talk , drink the occasional beer i do n't think i spoke 10 words to him when i played , leblanc said later , he treated me like a son he was a super guy i did n't realize it in high school in 1992 , brown coached his final game , another appearance in the state championship neville lost , 2827 , when its kicker missed an extra point in overtime brown approached the kicker and embraced him in retirement , he seemed to be at neville every day , attending practices and games , giving out hugs when children of neville graduates were born , he handed out tshirts to the newborns that said , i'm a little tiger from neville got to recruit from the womb , he would say on april 11 , 2011 , brown visited neville to check on the building of a field house that would be named in his honor later that day , he had a heart attack and died in his garden his age was given variously as 82 and 83 a sunset memorial service at the football stadium drew more than 100 of brown s former players probably none knew that their coach had kept a final secret as bob brown went through his father s belongings , he discovered that his real name was not charlie brown but claude charles roberts apparently the coach did not know this either , until he retired and needed his birth certificate to begin collecting veterans' benefits , bob brown said no one knows how his father came to be called charlie brown , he said , but it seems to help sustain his father s mystique it shows everything he had to overcome as a little kid with nothing , not even a name , bob brown said i think it s one of the reasons he s so well known if he 'd have been called claude roberts , no one would remember who he was

when a great invention comes along , it often becomes part of our lives so fast that we barely even notice it we take it for granted who remembers life before television , the internet or gps \? but what if there was a great invention that barely got picked up , even after a decade \? can you imagine if the iphone had been invented in 1997 , and we were only just getting to use it now \? that s the story with sprinkles , an innovative treatment for one of the most pervasive problems affecting the world s children , and one that goes largely unaddressed about 300 million children nearly half of the world s children under the age of 5 have anemia parents usually do not know what is wrong their kids are often listless , and prone to illness by school age the immediate effects tend to fade , but longterm , early childhood anemia impairs physical and cognitive development , can lead to a weakened immune system and is sometimes fatal the damage done in the first thousand days of life to a badly malnourished child is irreversible sprinkles were invented in the late 1990s by dr stanley zlotkin , a professor of pediatrics , nutritional sciences and public health at the university of toronto , in response to a request by unicef , the united nations children s fund , to come up with an effective way to treat childhood anemia in poor countries until then , the normal treatment was iron supplements delivered via a pill or syrup , which could have an unpleasant taste and uncomfortable tummy impacts on tiny bodies sprinkles , a specially coated , powdered form of the supplement , is simply added to the child s normal food usually a rice or corn porridge of some type and has none of the side effects or bad taste but micronutrient powders \( sprinkles is the name of the original , most common formulation \) are being distributed at a national level in just a smattering of countries mongolia , kyrgyzstan , bolivia and the dominican republic bangladesh , with a population of 161 million , is using them in about half the country in the last four years , about 50 countries have begun pilot programs to distribute sprinkleslike micronutrient powders but most are only just getting off the ground only about 136 million of the world s 300 million irondeficient children have received sprinkles \( or a differently named equivalent , in some cultures \) , according to zlotkin we have only scratched the surface , he said there is a long way to go the presence of anemia usually signifies a host of other micronutrient deficiencies that are more difficult to test for thus , micronutrient powders like sprinkles contain not just iron , but 15 essential vitamins and minerals , including iodine , zinc and vitamin a children who do not receive these micronutrients in their first thousand days of life can suffer irreversible physical and cognitive development damage the copenhagen consensus , a group of expert economists convened in 2008 to determine the world s most effective aid interventions , put micronutrient supplements at the top of the list according to their estimate , the cost of providing vitamin a and zinc to 80 percent of the world s 140 million children who are lacking them would cost 60 million per year the benefits of this treatment would be worth more than 1 billion a recent study by british and pakistani researchers in the british medical journal of 200 , 000 children found that vitamin a supplements could reduce the risk of death by 24 percent kiddie vitamins , like flintstones , aren t an option these are small children , from 6 to 24 months , so pills are unwieldy and the levels of vitamin fortification in processed foods like flour are far too low for small children but getting people to give the micronutrient powders to their kids regularly is also a challenge compliance is a huge issue it will take time to change people s behavior , said dr kaosar afsana , the director of the health program for brac , the mammoth bangladeshbased ngo more than 70 percent of children under 5 in bangladesh are anemic the organization started distributing the micronutrient powder only in 2010 but it is already reaching half the country , distributing a million sachets a month they would like to be distributing 10 times that amount the powder comes in a small sachet the size of a sugar packet they cost only a few cents each some organizations give them away free , but some of the biggest success has come from selling them , demonstrating that even very poor people are willing to spend money for their children s health if given the opportunity , which is a key to making the micronutrient powders a lasting solution unicef and the centers for disease control and prevention have run pilot projects to show national governments that sprinkles can be effective and that there is a demand for the supplement the latter is important because a key to keeping the costs under control is having local or at least regional producers , if possible no company would step in unless they knew there was a market for it , said arnold timmer , a senior adviser in unicef s nutrition section persuading governments to take up the project presents an array of challenges in the case of kyrgyzstan , for instance , government officials were concerned that the micronutrient powders might be some kind of ploy , that they were being experimented on the cdc helped coordinate a local trial project , and there was an enthusiastic response from the mothers who saw that their children became active , got sick less , and generally acted like naughty , healthy children , said timmer despite having by far the world s highest concentration of anemia , with two out of three children under 5 affected , african countries have been slow to take up the use of sprinkles and other iron supplements most international attention goes to children who are at risk of death from starvation , while the far larger numbers who suffer from chronic problems like anemia are a lower priority a study in kenya illustrates how difficult getting people to use a seemingly basic intervention like sprinkles can be the study , which was run by the cdc , looked at 60 villages , with a total population of 80 , 000 , from 2007 to 2010 while the results of the study were strong anemia rates dropped 27 percent and vitamin a deficiency dropped by 17 percent getting there took a lot of work sprinkles were distributed by a local organization in the nyando district of southwestern kenya the safe water and aids project \( swap \) in which local women sell subsidized health products ranging from malaria nets to sanitary napkins in their communities the cdc added sprinkles to the mix but making it work was challenging some people tried to use them as soap others were put off by the packet s red color , which they associated with disease one vendor , nancy auma omolo , from the village of kacholo , said that people in her community were nervous that the vitamins were poison they questioned why , if it was good for their children , the adults shouldn t take it , too do you want to get rid of our children \? they asked her but once people started seeing how it worked , and the new energy that their children suddenly had , the packets became a popular seller paying attention to community sensibilities is a key to getting sprinkles right in one rushed distribution in a refugee camp for somalis , many recipients refused the micronutrients both because the shiny packets resembled condoms , and the drawing of what was supposed to be a happy child on the packet looked to many like a ghost it is one thing to invent a great new tool , it is quite another to get people to use it yet in the world of public health , distribution is usually an afterthought much of the focus is on breakthrough drugs , silver bullet vaccines and sprawling , megabudget projects like the 66 billion dollar american antiaids program pepfar , which accounted for 75 percent of the obama administration s global health budget in fiscal year 2012 all of these approaches are focused on what public health scholars call the medicalization of a disease either finding new cures or giving out drugs that is how many americans think of public health we need a wonder drug to solve the world s problems but it is misleading that s especially true since most diseases are chronic , localized and affect poor people in fact , for many diseases , like anemia , the dynamics of treatment are known and the cures already exist most of the diseases that kill the world s children are not a result of a mysterious virus or an unknown parasite , but of poverty no sanitation , dirty drinking water , poor transportation and a monotonous diet devoid of nutrients with poverty comes inefficient government and a lack of basic infrastructure , which gets to the real problem of most global health interventions how to get assistance to people in a sustainable , efficient way , and make sure it is used correctly this medicalization of malnutrition is part of the reason for the slow adoption of micronutrient powders , said dominic schofield , a director of the micronutrient program at gain \( the global alliance for improved nutrition , a genevabased organization \) , which is a major supporter of micronutrient powders around the world and of the cdckenya study as well while an emergency feeding supplement like plumpy nut has received a lot of attention from international donors because it immediately saves lives , micronutrients are less sexy , said schofield prevention is not as exciting to doctors , it s not something that a lot of them understand in the end , the real work has to be done with parents getting parents to give their children the micronutrients every day can be difficult , said afsana , the brac director , but the success of micronutrient powders in bangladesh has largely been because of the advocacy efforts of the mothers themselves we should not get frustrated or disappointed , she said hope is there sam loewenberg is a journalist who covers the intersection of global health , business , government and politics his work has appeared in the new york times , the economist and the lancet he is the 20112012 nieman foundation global health reporting fellow at harvard university the

a humbling loss , for one oh , and a 385 , 000 paycheck this was the definition of a paycheck game next up for oklahoma state is arizona , on the road up next for savannah state \? a road game against florida state it won t get any easier tom spousta from halftime good news , michigan got on the board , thanks to 71yard bomb from robinson to jeremy gallon , setting up robinson s 6yard run bad news , that play accounted for most of michigan s 119 total yards in first half bama had 280 mccarron was an efficient 8 of 15 for 140 yards it s 317 at half , and alabama could easily hit 50 wonder if saban will call off the tide by then a few clemson skill players are stepping up in sammy watkins absence one is andre ellington , an overlooked asset during last season s offensive breakthrough , has 161 yards on 21 carries twice , ellington has prolonged runs by sticking his left hand he always has the ball cradled in his right elbow on the turf and tajh boyd has done some work on the ground , especially on this current drive after allowing auburn to move ahead by 1916 , clemson is driving deep within auburn s territory early in this drive , boyd gained 20 yards off the left side on a zoneread play a play where boyd reads the defensive end , either handing off to ellington if the end maintains containment or keeping it himself if the end breaks down on the running back later in this drive , boyd converted on a long second down play to keep clemson driving forward how has boyd looked through the air \? average , by his recent standard he s hit on 21 of 32 attempts for 201 yards and an interception for auburn , it s clear that the offense stands behind this defense both are breaking in new coordinators , as noted earlier in the day , and brian vangorder has this defense playing well scot loeffler s offense has been fine , but a portion of auburn s 350 yards of total offense came on one play a 53yard touchdown pass from kiehl frazier to emory blake this always happens i was writing about vangorder s defense just as auburn allows a touchdown boyd found nuke hopkins from four yards out to give clemson a 2319 lead hopkins numbers look good 10 receptions for 87 yards and a touchdown but he s had far too many drops hopkins is one of the nation s best second bananas , but he s not going to fill watkins shoes well , michigan scored a touchdown nick saban was not happy about that heading into halftime the touchdown is only the fourth alabama has allowed in its last 509 minutes against fbs competition that s a long , long time eight games and a half put another way alabama has now allowed four touchdowns since one minute into the game against florida last oct 1 that s a span that includes 59 minutes against florida and all of games against vanderbilt , mississippi , tennessee , lsu \( twice \) , mississippi state and auburn , and the first half against michigan last year s defense was one of the best in college football history this year s \? all systems are go again , tom spousta robinson just threw it to linebacker cj mosely , who jogged into the end zone from 16 yards out like he was finishing a practice drill thing is , alabama isn t playing any exotic defenses michigan simply has no answer offensively with 4 minutes left before half , michigan has yet to cross the 50yard line a few things for michigan to consider as this lead balloons to 210 \( and perhaps 280 within minutes \) alabama has allowed a touchdown or less in the first half in 16 of its last 17 games the lone team to score more than a touchdown was florida which scored 10 points the tide have given up more than 21 points only six times since the start of the 2008 season georgia \( 30 points \) , florida \( 31 \) and utah \( 31 \) in 2008 , and south carolina \( 35 \) , lsu \( 24 \) and auburn \( 28 \) in 2010 the only team to score more 14 points against alabama last fall \? georgia southern , believe it or not tom spousta in texas aj mccarron already has michigan measured doubt if he s going to make the kind of mistake that helps the wolverines back in the game tide defenders aren t worried about denard robinson s arm bama looks set up daring him to pass and robinson hasn t been able to make them pay with his running yet just as i say that , cornerback dee milliner picks off robinson on what was an overthow or busted route bama about to punch it in again , eddie lacy 9yard run bama 210 , 1 24 left in first quarter you can feel the air hissing out of cowboys stadium for michigan fans alabama has had two offensive series thus far that should be taped , copied onto discs and mailed to every high school in america the first , a 9play , 81yard drive that ended in a touchdown , featured a perfect blend of alabama s powerful running game and opportunistic passing attack after pounding away at michigan s front seven for five or six plays , the crimson tide capped the drive with a playaction pass near the goal line the wolverines linebackers bit , leaving the tight end michael williams wide open near the front left pylon the second spanned only three plays incomplete a 16yard gain for jalston fowler after fowler churned out that big run , alabama dialed up aj mccarron off of playaction deandrew white s double move left him 15 yards behind the nearest michigan defender he waltzed into the end zone run , run , run playaction that s your prostyle offense , as run by alabama it s just perfect what else is perfect \? alabama s backfield i realize that the tide no longer have trent richardson , a heisman finalist last fall , but the staff has carved out concrete roles for the top three runners eddie lacy is the lead back tj yeldon is the changeofpace back fowler s the big back and then there s dee hart , a redshirt freshman with wheels who originally committed to michigan before opting for tuscaloosa let s not underestimate a proud program positively brimming with confidence i m speaking of michigan , not alabama how successful was brady hoke s first season \? eleven wins a win over ohio state a bcs bowl berth a win over virginia tech in the sugar bowl it was a magical season and let s not overlook the idea that michigan can t be happy about being viewed almost universally as the underdog against big , bad alabama you saw the energy that stems from this usagainsttheworld mentality on alabama s first series , when michigan forced a threeandout now , the wolverines will be without fitzgerald toussaint , the allconference running back who will miss this game due to you guessed it a violation of team rules in this case , toussaint is suspended for his offseason arrest on dui charges in july \( earlier this week , toussaint pled guilty to a lesser charge \) this places even greater pressure on denard robinson while michigan will lean on thomas rawls , vincent smith , justice hayes and the fullback stephen hopkins , robinson will need to carry an even larger load in the running game the game will be decided by robinson s ability to deliver on third down , however nick saban and kirby smart will scheme to limit robinson s gamechanging ability as a runner instead , the senior must be consistent as a thrower again , tom spousta from michiganalabama ozzy osbourne s crazy train blasting through the speakers and crowd pretty much in a frenzy neither team has taken the field fans probably thought kickoff was at 7 pm and didn t factor in the abc pregame just adding to an electric atmosphere and you should see the wild looks on people s faces when they realize they are on the gigantic video board ! the wolverines come through the tunnel first defending national champs ready to run out nice to have an opener with national implications michigan wins the toss and defers to the second half , so we ll see what quarterback aj mccarron and bama s offense has first more from tom spousta in arlington , tex got plenty of roll tide from the parking lot to the press box it s such a part of the bama vernacular that it literally rolls off the tongue like i ll have the fried eggs , sausage and grits with coffee and orange juice , roll tide so i asked a group of six bama fans who had secured a prime spot on the north end zone party deck to name a few of their favorites when my wife says whisper something sexy in my ear , i say roll tide , one said added another i say it at the end of the blessing at supper thank you lord for this food roll tide all agreed the tone and southern accent can really ratchet up depending on the amount of adult beverages like for the auburn game , one said as the others agreed shouts of go blue ! held their own as the stadium filled up , but it just didn t sound the same or as one elderly bama fan told me , i can tell you what i think of that , roll tide prior to this afternoon , you could say one thing about colorado s jon embree at least he owns colorado state no longer the rams , led by the former alabama offensive coordinator , jim mcelwain , knocked off the buffaloes , 2217 in doing so , mcelwain became the first firstyear head coach in colorado state s history to beat colorado nice debut , huh \? mcelwain , who did obnoxiously underrated work with the crimson tide , weathered a tough offseason to notch a seasondefining win colorado is a garbage fire , however and it s been a good day for members of the nick saban coaching tree last night , derek dooley \( tennessee \) and mark dantonio \( michigan state \) won their openers today , mcelwain and will muschamp \( florida \) have already won jimbo fisher \( florida state \) will follow will saban round out the perfect day \? i m betting he will my prediction for tonight alabama 30 , michigan 14 tom spousta is in arlington , tex , for michigan and alabama here s his first update it s a rare sight , michigan s maize and blue clashed against alabama s crimson the school s have met only three times in their storied history , all in bowl games and for two teams that have never met in the regular season , animosity seems to already be running high michigan fans booed when tide players hit the field for warmups , and vice versa the volume seriously higher than the obligatory boos you hear pregame at most places the standing room only party decks are rocking and a lot of fans are standing at their seats \( probably hoping to get picked up by cameras for the gigantic video board \) college football pageantry really does fit cowboys stadium like a stetson you can feel the energy building just like at campus stadiums the michigan band just cranked up hail good to have football back ! auburn beat clemson in 2010 , thanks in large part to clemson s massive mistakes on special teams clemson return the favor last year , snapping the nation s longest winning streak the two meet in the rubber match of their threeyear duel tonight in atlanta , in the second part of the secacc kickoff classic the sec struck first last night , tennessee , behind some electric play from junior college transfer cordarrelle patterson , beat nc state , 3521 for the volunteers and the derek dooley , a win might give this team some muchneeded confidence heading into a date with florida on sept 15 \( next saturday , tennessee plays georgia state \) a win tonight and a win for alabama over michigan would cement home the idea that the sec is the finest conference in the country , if that wasn t already obvious the sec has won the last six national championships , after all what should you look for with clemson and auburn \? missing pieces for one , new pieces for the other clemson will go without the allamerican wide receiver sammy watkins , who will sit out this game due to an offseason violation of team rules i d rank watkins freshman season as one of the finest in ncaa history , in the same class with herschel walker s at georgia and marshall faulk s at san diego state fine , not quite as good as walker s auburn has a new offensive coordinator and a new defensive coordinator on offense , auburn has replaced gus malzahn , now at arkansas state , with former michigan , florida and temple assistant scot loeffler on defense , auburn exchanged ted roof for brian vangorder an upgrade it s going to be interesting to see just how different auburn s offense will be under loeffler , whose prostyle background does not quite match malzahn s spread background florida will survive , barring some sort of offensive explosion from bowling green , which doesn t seem likely what can florida take from this win \? absolutely nothing well , perhaps something based on what i saw , it seems like driskel outplayed brissett and the number back that up after getting most of the snaps over the second half , driskel is 9 of 14 for 107 yards and touchdown brissett is 3 of 5 for 31 yards has florida found a quarterback \? if so , this win while ugly will end up being very meaningful for the gators the defense only had one sour drive by and large , the gators controlled the line of scrimmage against a mac offense this should be expected , of course heading into the year , i thought that florida has one of the nation s top 10 defenses did the gators play like a top10 defense \? sort of , but there s clearly room for improvement and the offense the gators can only improve the key from here will be relying even more heavily upon a running game that had some moments today , especially with mike gillislee in the backfield gillislee , the heir apparent to jeff demps and chris rainey , has 141 yards on 19 carries but the offensive line still had its hands full with a very unimpressive front seven the receiver corps did nothing quarterback play remains a huge question mark what can florida do \? hand the reins to driskel and roll with one quarterback , not two three teams remain very much on upset alert california and nevada are tied , 2424 , with about a minute left nevada has the football , meaning that the game could be over by the time i finish writing this sentence iowa trails northern illinois , 1712 , midway through the fourth the huskies are interesting they lost a ton of talent off of last year s team , especially on offense , but are still chewing off long gains in the running game florida leads bowling green , 1714 , thanks to in large part to two missed field goals by the falcons a threepoint win , in this case , will feel very much like a loss this is a bit of a bounceback game for bowling green s dave clawson , who served a oneyear stint as tennessee s offensive coordinator in 2008 he was not a big hit with the ut fan base , to put it mildly a win this afternoon would feel great let s just say you entered the peace corps in 1995 \( does the peace corps still exist \? did it in 1995 \? \) over the last 17 years , your contact with college football has been limited , to put it lightly you ve returned to the states in time to watch today s college football action welcome back , friend someone turns to you let s just say it s me and says , florida s two quarterbacks have onefifth the passing yards of nebraska s starter does your head explode \? well , it is surprising driskel and brissett have thrown for a combined 76 yards martinez has 322 yards it s almost hard to believe this is magic down by 3130 with 23 seconds left , texassan antonio hits a 51yard field goal to beat south alabama , 3331 utsa led by 207 , 2014 , 2017 , 2724 and 3024 before the jaguars cj bennett found jereme jones for 34yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter the stars of the game for utsa \? one is sean ianno , who made the late field goal a second is quarterback eric soza , who completed 18 of 30 attempts for 215 yards and 3 touchdowns good sign for the roadrunners of the last 10 teams to win the national championship , seven won their first game of college football utsa won its firstever game , last september against northeastern state coker this is maybe the most awesome game i ve ever been around he won the 2001 national championship game and won its first game as part of the fbs that s a good sign texassan antonio 2041 national champs  projected ohio is just one nonbcs conference team to watch \( and as an aside , the bcs and nonbcs labels are not long for this world , as you might have heard \) another is nevada , which won 13 games in 2010 before taking a slight step back a season ago , finishing 85 the wolf pack nevada s the wolf pack , nc state the wolfpack were the first team to run the pistol offense , which makes sense the offense was dreamed up by chris ault , the longtime nevada head coach and two years after colin kaepernick broke countless school records , the wolf pack have another sublime quarterback in the sophomore cody fajardo , who started just more than half of nevada s games a season ago fajardo needs to avoid injury , but he s as gifted a young quarterback as you ll find in the country could nevada join ohio and make a run to doubledigit wins \? i have no doubt and nevada could achieve even more if it can get past california with less than four minutes left , the wolf pack hold a 2114 lead fajardo s doing work 17 of 21 for 136 yards through the air , 16 carries for 90 yards and a score on the ground those are your typical pistol numbers , should you have the right quarterback and fajardo s the right quarterback an injury story coming out of lincoln rex burkhead , the aforementioned star , will miss the rest of the game against southern mississippi with a sprained mcl , according to espn it s hard to pinpoint the recovery time for such an injury two weeks \? the rest of this game \? four weeks , six weeks \? burkhead is still on the sidelines , not back in the training room , so that might be a positive sign for nebraska but nebraska needs burkhead next week , when it travels to the rose bowl to take on ucla and nebraska certainly needs burkhead during big ten play if the program hopes to make a run to the conference championship game without burkhead , nebraska is a very average team with him , this team could be a surprise of course , nebraska isn t going anywhere if its defense doesn t step forward remember when the cornhuskers had the best defense in college football \? the defense has gone downhill since ndamukong suh left after the 2009 season how to describe taylor martinez s throwing mechanics over his freshman and sophomore seasons \? start with his feet as he raised his first arm , his back foot , his right foot , would take a wobbly step away from the line of scrimmage he would then transfer his weight entirely on his back foot as his arm moved towards the line of scrimmage , all of martinez s weight would remain on his back foot , leading to a looping , lobbed , rainbow of a toss his lead foot would splay out away from his body , not in a straight line , resulting in even further inaccuracy no starting quarterback in college football had worse mechanics how did martinez spend his summer vacation \? he remained in california , near his hometown , and worked with noted quarterback guru steve calhoun on retooling his failed delivery all i heard throughout the summer and during fall camp was how much better martinez was as a passer he was transitioning his weight as he threw , taking weight off of his back foot he was a different player , in short just through a quarter and change against southern mississippi , it s clear that i m looking at a different quarterback the number tell one story martinez is 12 of 14 for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns his mechanics tell another martinez is stepping into his throws , hitting his receivers with accuracy and with far more zip than in the past it s been striking can he keep it up \? let s wait until martinez delivers with heat coming up the middle southern mississippi isn t getting much pressure but it s a great start for the junior florida has two quarterbacks both are quarterbacks both can play quarterback florida has no idea who it wants to be its starter , however so how have will muschamp and the firstyear offensive coordinator brent pease attacked this dilemma \? let s see here s how it ll play out jeff driskel will play the entirety of the first quarter jacoby brissett will play the entire second quarter florida will reevaluate at halftime yes , it s as dumb as it sounds muschamp is many things , especially as a defensive coordinator , but his lack of experience as a head coach is crippling florida s potential on offense as its offense goes , so goes florida after one quarter we ll call it the driskel quarter florida trails bowling green , 70 should we talk a little heisman while waiting for the 3 30 games to heat up \? \( and speaking of heating up , northwestern stopped syracuse s torrid run with a nineyard touchdown pass with 44 seconds left , taking a 4241 lead wildcats will hold on , barring the unforeseeable \) my top 10 heading into the opening week matt barkley , usc the leader heading into the first hole montee ball , wisconsin the most prolific back in football de anthony thomas , oregon don t blink , or you ll miss him ej manuel , florida state voters love the quarterback on the nation s best team aaron murray , georgia very overlooked nationally marcus lattimore , south carolina already off to a good start denard robinson , michigan we ll see him tonight collin klein , kansas state has the best nickname in the country optimus klein rex burkhead , nebraska already has a 57yard touchdown run let s hear yours , if you would what i ll be following among the 3 30 starts southern mississippi at nebraska the last time the golden eagles went to lincoln , they escaped with a 2117 win on fourth down inside the southern mississippi red zone , thennebraska quarterback joe dailey ran out of bounds rather than try a shot at the end zone it was confusing nevada at california already underway , to be honest california will not start zach maynard at quarterback after the senior missed a tutoring session earlier this week iowa and northern illinois \( in chicago \) last year , niu could have given the hawkeyes a game this year \? the huskies have a lot of weapons to replace on offense tulsa at iowa state no one gives paul rhoads and the cyclones any respect except for president obama , who began a speech in ames , ia , earlier this week by saying , i may not be able to give a speech like paul rhoads , but i ll try i will not be following boston college at miami \( fla \) , because doug flutie isn t walking through that door nor is matt ryan , or anything resembling the sort of talent typically seen at miami both programs are in a very bad place the remainder of ohio s regular season schedule sept 8 new mexico state sept 15 at marshall sept 22 norfolk state sept 29 at massachusetts oct 6 buffalo oct 13 akron oct 27 at miami of ohio nov 1 eastern michgian nov 7 bowling green nov 14 at ball state nov 23 at kent state keep an eye on the bobcats , folks lost in the shuffle among bill o brien s debut , names on the jerseys , jay and sue paterno in the stands , what have you of all the storylines surrounding this game , none have touched on one fact ohio is one of the best nonbcs conferences teams in the country twentyone unanswered points have given the bobcats a 2414 lead over penn state with less than three minutes left the latest drive was a thing of beauty , traveling 94 yards on 14 plays , taking nearly seven minutes off of the clock and ending in six just beautiful most will say that penn state is letting ohio storm ahead for the win nope ohio doesn t need the help the bobcats are a superb football team what s the ceiling \? a perfect regular season if that comes to pass , ohio will earn an atlarge bcs bid this team is good enough and has the coaching to get there just a wonderful football team and while penn state is clearly down , this will be one of the marquee victories in school history a key figure in the ongoing corruption scandal at the los angeles county assessor s office said he gave cash and perks to two southern california studentathletes while both were attending the university , reports the los angeles times one of the two is joe mcknight , a former usc running back currently playing for the new york jets as the los angeles times writes , such an action would be a clear violation of ncaa rules after the times asked about the alleged payments , officials at usc said they immediately informed the ncaa about the claims we are dedicated to playing and competing the right way , usc athletic director pat haden wrote in an email to the newspaper there have been a few rule modifications heading into this season very briefly , they are as follows kickoffs are now from the 35yard line , up from the 30yard line touchbacks are now moved out to the 25 , not the 20 the goal is to limit collisions , thereby cutting down on concussions if a player loses his helmet during the course of a play , he must immediately stop participating in said play in addition , he must sit out the following play , as during an injury no more shield blocking on punt plays what s that \? it s when a team puts three or four blockers in front of its punter the end result , from time to time , is a player tumbling headoverheels after trying to leap over the defenders again , a safety issue a larger halo surrounding a kick or punt returner again , meant to increase player safety finally , a change to the rules previously governing blocking below the waist now , a blocker can block a defender below the waist within the tackle box if he is not in motion prior to the snap in addition , a blocker can engage a defender below the waist at any place on the field if he is moving directly at the defender i just saw the new blocking rule pop up for the first time initially , the officials threw a flag for an illegal block by an ohio player against penn state under the new rule , however , the block was perfectly legal the officials picked up the flag , and a handful of plays later , ohio scored a touchdown to take a 1714 lead compared to texassan antonio , south alabama is , well , plainold alabama the jaguars that s south alabama christened a football program in 2009 against a sevengame slate of service academies hagrave and fork union , not army and navy the roadrunners that s texassan antonio didn t field a team until last year that didn t stop the western athletic conference from giving utsa a call up into the big leagues , though it ll be a shortlived stay the wac will disappear after this season , with the roadrunners moving into conference usa what happens when the youngest in the fbs meets the secondyoungest \? greatness , perhaps or the worst level of football you ll see all season that s more likely so it s a game worth watching , in my mind after one drive , the jaguars hold a 70 lead up next the roadrunners utsa s head coach is the former miami \( fla \) coach larry coker , by the way there s so much to love about this game earlier , i mentioned that georgia will play at least the first game of this season and likely at least the first two games without several key figures on defense one is the free safety bacarri rambo , an allamerican last fall another is the cornerback sanders commings a third is alec ogletree , a starting inside linebacker in georgia s 34 defensive system the bulldogs are also without the sophomore cornerback malcolm mitchell , a burgeoning star at receiver who was moved over to defense to help offset the bulldogs personnel issues you re seeing the missing pieces over the first half against buffalo through 30 minutes , the bulls have gained 147 yards on the ground that s more than georgia allowed to all but four teams a year ago south carolina \( 253 yards \) , vanderbilt \( 199 \) , georgia tech \( 243 \) and lsu \( 207 \) to end last season , the bulldogs held michigan state s power running game to 73 yards on 29 carries in the outback bowl now , the losses haven t impacted georgia s defensive line , which should be outstanding but the trickledown effect has been seen throughout this entire defense the linebackers are overcompensating to help the retooled secondary defend the pass , leaving open lanes along the front seven georgia won t lose this game for one , todd grantham , the defensive coordinator , is going to give a halftime speech for adult ears only that ll get this defense primed for a stronger showing in the second half but the bulldogs need to get back on track before next saturday , when they travel to missouri in the tigers sec debut tim rohan is at beaver stadium for penn state and ohio his first update this penn state season will be played for more than pride , of course , but among the reasons is convincing its current players to stick around the ncaa has given them permission to freely transfer after this season too , leaving open the possibility that a player will test bill o brien s first year as coach then decide to leave one could say , then the more players that leave , the harder it may be to keep the ones who stayed the running back silas redd and wide receiver justin brown have already left for southern california and oklahoma , for offenses with heisman trophycaliber quarterbacks it took one half saturday , the first of the o brien era , to feel their absence bill belton , the sophomore back who was used primarily in a wildcat package last season , fumbled when the offense was within field goal range on the opening drive and gerald hodges , the senior linebacker , perhaps the best penn state player not to transfer , returned punts brown was the punt returner last season it was a rare sight , the 6foot2 , 237pound hodges calling for a fair catch in the second quarter on his third punt return of the game but the ball evaded hodges , and ohio recovered his fumble that led to an ohio field goal five new head coaches took the field at noon alabamabirmingham s garrick mcgee , illinois tim beckman , ohio state s urban meyer , penn state s bill o brien and north carolina s larry fedora in all , 20 new head coaches will debut today , with the aforementioned quintet joined by southern mississippi s ellis johnson , colorado state s jim mcelwain , new mexico s bob davie , pittsburgh s paul chryst , memphis justin fuente , kansas charlie weis , arkansas john l smith , mississippi s hugh freeze , hawaii s norm chow , rutgers kyle flood , houston s tony levine , fresno state s tim derutyer , toledo s matt campbell , arizona s rich rodriguez and arkansas state s gus malzahn campbell and rodriguez face off in tucson later tonight while arizona will win the battle , toledo will win the war the rockets will battle for the top spot in the mac west under campbell , the team s former offensive coordinator of those games currently underway , uab trails troy , 170 ohio state has taken a 143 lead on miami of ohio the woody hayes bowl , we can call it penn state still leads ohio by 73 illinois has a 170 lead on western michigan and the tar heels are rolling past elon beckman was the head coach at toledo before being hired by the illini last fall , his team barely beat western michigan , 6663 this year \? having big tenlevel talent helps the two new head coaches most under the spotlight are charlie weis and john l smith weis for the way his tenure at notre dame sputtered under substantial expectations , and smith for the team he inherits from bobby petrino , who was fired in april prior to petrino s dismissal , i thought arkansas could make a run at alabama and louisiana state in the sec west division now , it s hard to see how the razorbacks can challenge the tigers and the crimson tide without the coach most responsible for the program s recent resurgence this has been a long time coming northwestern just scored on a punt return for the first since sept 10 , 2005 , when marquice cole did the honors against northern illinois thanks to venric mark s 82yard return , the wildcats hold a 76 lead over syracuse let s move down to georgia earlier this summer , the bulldogs lost the wouldbe sophomore running back isaiah crowell , a former fivestar recruit who was dismissed from the program for a violation of team rules in addition , mark richt suspended several key defensive players including one allamerican , bacarri rambo for at least the first game of the regular season as for crowell georgia now needs help from its two true freshmen running backs , todd gurley and keith marshall how has gurley fared thus far against buffalo \? three touches , two touchdowns one came on the ground , a 10yard jaunt off the left side to give georgia a 70 lead after buffalo pulled within 76 , gurley returned a kickoff 100 yards for his second score 146 , georgia not a bad start penn state s offensive breakdown through two series 11 pass attempts , 4 running plays that s fairly new what else is new \? on each of his team s close conversions on third down , bill o brien has dialed up the pass on this latest drive , o brien dropped matt mcgloin to pass on 3rd1 that it was incomplete is one thing it s more symbolic than anything , seeing that for decades , you could have pegged the nittany lions to run between the guards in a shortyardage situation likely with a fullback leading the way through the hole and what of ohio s offense \? the turning point for this program came in the 2010 new orleans bowl , when solich and his staff watched troy rip their defense to shreds running an uptempo , nohuddle , passfirst spread system after the game , solich ordered a directive implement this offense the bobcats hit the ground running to open last season and never stopped , eventually setting a slew of school records , most in the passing game tettleton was overshadowed in the mac by northern illinois chandler harnish , but he enters his junior season as one of the league s top two quarterbacks , joining western michigan s alex carder to see these two teams play last fall would have been a clash of offensive styles , to a degree penn state was still runheavy , but its offense had long since embraced a more wideopen passing system now \? based on the first few drives , penn state will throw the ball more than ever before but can the nittany lions convert with the running game on third down \? we haven t seen it yet , but we will ohio and penn state will receive the heavy focus among the noon starts you know all about the nittany lions what about ohio \? the bobcats are very , very good team ohio s the best team in the mac , in my mind , and very much a threat to notch doubledigit wins for the second consecutive season ohio could be even better than that if it can win today , ohio could very well run through the rest of the regular season undefeated in large part thanks to one of the easiest schedules in the country it may very be the easiest , in fact starting next week , the bobcats should play no more than three bowl teams so we need to at least consider the idea that ohio , like ball state during brady hoke s final season , will run the table during the regular season and become a threat for an atlarge bcs bid all the pieces are in place , from a seasoned coached staff , led by frank solich , to an allconference quarterback like tyler tettleton the finest passer in school history those unfamiliar with ohio will simply pencil penn state in for a win despite the nittany lions rough offseason , but that s simply not the case it s a macthemed day for the big ten illinois which is led by the former toledo head coach tim beckman hosts western michigan ohio state just kicked off against miami of ohio later this afternoon , iowa meets northern illinois in chicago s soldier field navy has just as many pass attempts as notre dame and more passing yards , which goes a long way towards explaining why the midshipmen are losing , 3310 , midway through the third quarter navy has attempted 16 passes since 2008 , the midshipmen are 16 when throwing the ball 16 or more times this is your appetizer for today s feast navy and notre dame , in dublin , no less top o the morning to you outside of the fact that most of the stadium seems unfamiliar with the rules of american football and the gentleman that stormed onto the field and did a jig in notre dame s end zone , the whole event has gone off without a hitch well , it s not going great for navy but it s going very well for the irish , who entered this morning with a new starting quarterback , everett golson last year s starter , tommy rees , was suspended for this trip to ireland after encountering some offfield difficulties during the offseason all rees suspension did was cement the idea that someone other than the senior would be taking snaps under center for this offense in 2012 , which in turn delighted notre dame s fan base prior to this recent drive , which has nd again inside navy s red zone , golson had completed 11 of 16 attempts for 130 yards with one touchdown and one interception yes , that interception did come in the red zone which conjured up memories of notre dame s offensive failures a year ago but golson has , as expected , given this offense some nimble feet in the pocket and the ability to do different things in the running game for example , and unlike rees , golson allows the irish to run the option it s a nice start for notre dame it wasn t so long ago that this program struggled with navy , losing three of four from 200710 today s victory , should notre dame hold on , will be its second straight in the series

aurora , colo the text message , sent to another graduate student in early july , was cryptic and worrisome had she heard of dysphoric mania , wanted to know \? the psychiatric condition , a form of bipolar disorder , combines the frenetic energy of mania with the agitation , dark thoughts and in some cases paranoid delusions of major depression she messaged back , asking him if dysphoric mania could be managed with treatment mr holmes replied it was , but added that she should stay away from him because i am bad news it was the last she heard from him about two weeks later , minutes into a special midnight screening of the dark knight rises on july 20 , mr holmes , encased in armor , his hair tinted orange , a gas mask obscuring his face , stepped through the emergency exit of a soldout movie theater here and opened fire by the time it was over , there were 12 dead and 58 wounded the ferocity of the attack , its setting , its sheer magnitude more people were killed and injured in the shooting than in any in the country s history shocked even a nation largely inured to random outbursts of violence but mr holmes , 24 , who was arrested outside the theater and has been charged in the shootings , has remained an enigma , his life and his motives cloaked by two court orders that have imposed a virtual blackout on information in the case and by the silence of the university of colorado , denver , where mr holmes was until june a graduate student in neuroscience unlike wade m page , who soon after the theater shooting opened fire at a sikh temple in wisconsin , killing six people , mr holmes left no trail of hate and destruction behind him , no telling imprints in the electronic world , not even a facebook page yet as time has passed , a clearer picture has begun to surface interviews with more than a dozen people who knew or had contact with mr holmes in the months before the attack paint a disturbing portrait of a young man struggling with a severe mental illness who more than once hinted to others that he was losing his footing those who worked side by side with him saw an amiable if intensely shy student with a quick smile and a laconic air , whose quirky sense of humor surfaced in goofy jokes take that to the bank , he said while giving a presentation about an enzyme known as atm and wry oneliners there was no question that he was intelligent james is really smart , one graduate student whispered to another after a firstsemester class yet he floated apart , locked inside a private world they could neither share nor penetrate he confided little about his outside life to classmates , but told a stranger at a nightclub in los angeles last year that he enjoyed taking lsd and other hallucinogenic drugs he had trouble making eye contact , but could make surprising forays into extroversion , mugging for the camera in a high school video a former classmate , sumit shah , remembers an instance when mr holmes performed irish folk tunes on the piano until others took notice of his playing , when he stopped so uncommunicative that at times he seemed almost mute , he piped up enthusiastically in a hospital cafeteria line when a nearby conversation turned to professional football like many of his generation , he was a devotee of roleplaying video games like diablo iii and world of warcraft in 2009 , he bought neverwinter nights ii , a game like dungeons dragons , on ebay , using the handle sherlockbond \( shipped with alacrity , great seller , he wrote in his feedback on the sale \) rumored to have had a girlfriend , at least for a time , he appeared lonely enough in the weeks before the shooting to post a personal advertisement seeking companionship on an adult web site sometime in the spring , he stopped smiling and no longer made jokes during class presentations , his behavior shifting , though the meaning of the changes remained unclear packages began arriving at his apartment and at the school , containing thousands of rounds of ammunition bought online , the police say prosecutors said in court filings released last week that mr holmes told a fellow student in march that he wanted to kill people when his life was over in may , he showed another student a glock semiautomatic pistol , saying he had bought it for protection at one point , his psychiatrist , dr lynne fenton , grew concerned enough that she alerted at least one member of the university s threat assessment team that he might be dangerous , an official with knowledge of the investigation said , and asked the campus police to find out if he had a criminal record he did not but the official said that nothing mr holmes disclosed to dr fenton rose to the threshold set by colorado law to hospitalize someone involuntarily yet mr holmes was descending into a realm of darkness in early june , he did poorly on his oral exams professors told him that he should find another career , prosecutors said at a hearing last week soon after , he left campus that mr holmes , who is being held in the arapahoe county jail awaiting arraignment on 142 criminal counts , deteriorated to the point of deadly violence cannot help but raise questions about the adequacy of the treatment he received and about the steps the university took or failed to take in dealing with a deeply troubled student in court hearings and documents , mr holmes s lawyers have confirmed that he has a mental disorder and that he was in treatment with dr fenton they will undoubtedly use any evidence that he was mentally ill in mounting a defense colorado is one of only a few states where , in an insanity defense , the burden of proof lies on the prosecution j reid meloy , a forensic psychologist and expert on mass killers , has noted that almost without exception , their crimes represent the endpoint of a long and troubled highway that in hindsight was dotted with signs missed or misinterpreted these individuals do not snap , he said , whatever that means but who could divine the capacity to shoot dozens of people in cold blood \? or the diabolical imagination necessary to devise the booby traps the police said mr holmes carefully set out in his apartment the night of the rampage , devices that could have killed more \? a potential for violence was the last thing that came to mind when a graduate student at the university met mr holmes at a recruitment weekend for the neuroscience program in february last year what struck me was that he was kind of nonchalant , the woman recalled he just seemed too cool to be there he kicked back in his chair and seemed very relaxed in a very stressful situation but his reticence was also apparent , she said i noticed that he was not engaged with people around him we went around the table to introduce ourselves , and he made a weird , awkward joke , said the student who , like many of those interviewed , spoke on the condition of anonymity , citing reasons that included not wanting their privacy invaded by other news organizations and hearing from law enforcement or university officials that talking publicly could compromise the investigation the university , invoking the investigation and the court orders , has refused to release even mundane details about mr holmes , like which professors he worked with as the fall term began last year and students plunged into their required coursework , that pairing of laconic ease with an almost crippling social discomfort would become a theme that many students later remembered the neuroscience program , which admits six or seven students each year out of 60 or more applicants , sits under the umbrella of the center for neuroscience , an interdisciplinary and multicampus enterprise started a little over year ago to bring together basic science and clinical research more than 150 scientists are affiliated with the center , 60 of them formally involved with the graduate program the mix of laboratory scientists and clinicians is absolutely fundamental to the center s goals , said diego restrepo , its director dr restrepo and two other administrators met with the new york times under the ground rule that no specific questions about mr holmes or the case be asked the research interests of the neuroscience faculty are wideranging and include the effects of aging on the sense of smell , the repair of spinal cord injuries , promising drugs for down syndrome , treatments for stroke , and studies of diseases and disorders like alzheimer s , schizophrenia and autism the center is particularly known for its research on the neurobiology of sensory perception in the first year of the program , each neuroscience graduate student takes required courses and completes three 12week laboratory rotations , said angie ribera , the program s director students might come in with a strong interest in one area , but we feel strongly that they should get broad training , she said it s an incredibly supportive group of students there is a bonding there other students said mr holmes did his rotations in the laboratories of achim klug , who studies the auditory system mark dell'acqua , who does basic research on synaptic signaling and dr curt freed , whose work focuses on messenger chemicals in the brain and transplants in patients with parkinson s disease but even in a world where students can spend hours in solitary research , mr holmes seemed especially alone he volunteered little information about himself , his interests or what he dreamed of doing with his degree , said one graduate student who , touched by mr holmes s shyness , tried repeatedly to draw him out attempts to engage him in small talk were met with an easy smile and a polite reply if only a softspoken yo but little more he would basically communicate with me in oneword sentences , one member of the neuroscience program said he always seemed to be off in his own world , which did not involve other people , as far as i could tell in classes , mr holmes arrived early to grab a good seat , his lanky 5foot11 frame in jeans and sometimes a star wars tshirt he hardly ever took notes , often staring into the distance as if daydreaming uncomfortable when called on by professors , he almost always began his responses with a wearysounding uhhhhhhh but there was little doubt about his intellect in a grantwriting class , where students were required to grade each other s proposals , mr holmes wrote thoughtful and detailed comments , one student recalled , giving each paper he was assigned to review a generous grade this was the only time i saw an assignment of james s , the student said frankly , i was very impressed i thought his comments were much better than anyone else s in the spring , just months before the shooting , mr holmes turned in a midterm essay that a professor said was spectacular , written almost at the level of a professional in the field the essay was beautifully written , the professor said , and more than i would have expected from a firstyear student in the talks mr holmes gave after his first laboratory rotations , he often resorted to jokes , perhaps in an effort to cover his unease during one presentation , he stood with one hand in his pocket , a laser pointer in his other hand with a slight smile , he aimed the pointer at a slide and crowed oooooooh ! oh my god , james is so awkward , a student recalled a classmate whispering yet in a video of scenes from hemingway s a farewell to arms , made when he was a student at westview high school in san diego , where he was on the crosscountry team and was a standout soccer defender , mr holmes proved a deft comedian with a talent for improvisation , his former classmate jared bird remembered he kept making funny faces at the camera and making unexpected comments , mr bird said he was being a goofy bartender we expected him to play it straight , but he made it more interesting , much more comical he adlibbed everything by the end of high school , mr holmes was already pursuing his interest in science , attending a summer internship in 2006 at the salk institute for biological studies in san diego , before going to college at the university of california , riverside but if he was beginning the process of finding a career , he was also forging a reputation for extreme shyness i frequently had to ask yesorno questions to get responses from him , said john jacobson , his adviser that summer , adding that he completed virtually none of the work he was assigned , which involved putting visual illusions developed in the laboratory on the internet communicating with james was difficult mr holmes was more voluble in emails when he discovered that mr jacobson spoke mandarin , he began one email to him with a greeting in that language ni hao john but he stayed apart from the other interns , often eating alone at his desk and not showing up for the regular afternoon teas he was the only intern not to keep in touch with the coordinator when the program ended at the end of the day , he would slink upstairs and leave , mr jacobson said a smile and the air of one who walked a solitary path they were enough to attract the attention of shopkeepers in the gritty neighborhood just west of the anschutz medical campus in aurora , where students could find cheap , if amenityfree , housing on many days , mr holmes could be seen cruising home slowly down 17th avenue on his bmx bicycle toward the redbrick apartment building where he lived on the third floor , his body arched casually , his gangling frame almost too big for the small bike , a subway sandwich bag dangling from the handlebars waiters and sales clerks recognized him he washed his clothes at a nearby laundry , took his car for servicing at the grease monkey , bought sunglasses at the mex mall and stopped in at a pawnshop on east colfax avenue , perusing the electronics and other goods for sale he favored a mexican food truck in the mornings , buying three chicken and beef tacos but refusing sauce , and at night he sometimes dropped by shepes s rincon , a latin club near his apartment , where he sat at the bar and drank three or four beers , a security guard there said but he spoke no spanish , and other than placing his order talked to no one on several occasions , he was spotted in the company of two other students , one male , one female did he date \? no one seemed sure mostly , he was alone you kind of got that feeling that he was a loner , said vivian andreu , who works at a local liquor store sometimes , she said , i would get a smile out of him he had apparently planned the attack for months , stockpiling 6 , 000 rounds of ammunition he purchased online , buying firearms a shotgun and a semiautomatic rifle in addition to two glock handguns and body armor , and lacing his apartment with deadly booby traps , the authorities have said but mr holmes s neighbors did not seem to notice narender dudee , who lived in an apartment next to his , did not even hear the loud techno music that blared from his rooms on the night of the shooting i must have been in a deep sleep , mr dudee said studies suggest that a majority of mass killers are in the grip of some type of psychosis at the time of their crimes , said dr meloy , the forensic psychologist , and they often harbor delusions that they are fighting off an enemy who is out to get them yet despite their severe illness , they are frequently capable of elaborate and meticulous planning , he said as the graduate students reached the end of their second semester , wrapping up coursework , finishing lab rotations and looking toward the oral exam that would cap their first year , some noticed a change in mr holmes if possible , he seemed more isolated , more alone his smile and silly jokes were gone the companions he had sometimes been seen with earlier in the year had disappeared on may 17 , he gave his final laboratory presentation on dopamine precursors the talks typically ran 15 minutes or so , but this time , mr holmes spoke for only half that time and while in earlier presentations he had made an attempt to entertain , this time he spoke flatly , as if he wanted only to be done with it a student with whom mr holmes had flirted clumsily he once sent her a text message after a class asking why are you distracting me with those shorts \? said that two messages she received from him , one in june and the other in july , were particularly puzzling their electronic exchanges had begun abruptly in february or march , when she was out with stomach flu you still sick , girl \? she remembers mr holmes asking who is this \? she shot back jimmy james from neuroscience , he replied after that , she said , he sent her messages sporadically once he asked her if she would like to go hiking though he would sometimes walk right past her in the hallway , making no eye contact as the oral exams approached , she recalled , mr holmes seemed relaxed about the prospect , telling her , i will study everything or maybe i will study nothing at all the goal of the onehour exam , said dr ribera , the neuroscience program director , is to evaluate how students integrate information from their coursework and lab rotations and to see how they communicate on their feet it is not , she said , to weed out or weed in as is customary in many doctoral programs , three faculty members ask the questions during the exam if a student does poorly , the orals can be repeated mr holmes took his oral exam on june 7 the graduate student sent him a message the next day , asking how it had gone not well , he replied , and i am going to quit are you kidding me \? she asked no , i am just being james , he said a few weeks later , another student recalled , cammie kennedy , the neuroscience program administrator , accompanied the students to cedar creek pub on campus to celebrate the completion of the first year all the students except mr holmes attended as the group drank beers and waxed nostalgic , ms kennedy suddenly grew serious i want to let you guys know that james has quit the program , a student remembered her saying he wrote us an email he did n't say why that s all i can really say mr holmes informed the school that he was dropping out at the same time that members of the threat assessment team were discussing dr fenton s concerns , the official familiar with the investigation said prosecutors in the case have said in court documents that mr holmes was barred from the campus after making unspecified threats to a professor but university administrators have insisted that he was not barred from campus and said his key card was deactivated on june 10 as part of the standard procedure for withdrawing in early july , the woman who conducted the text exchange with mr holmes sent him a message to ask if he had left town yet no , he wrote back , he still had two months remaining on his lease soon he asked her about dysphoric mania whether the diagnosis was his own or had been made by a mental health professional is unclear through a lawyer , mr holmes s parents declined several requests to talk about their son s life before the shooting or the nature of any illness of his dr victor reus , a professor of psychiatry at the university of california , san francisco , said is not uncommon in patients with bipolar disorder , a vast majority of whom never turn to violence but in severe cases , he said , patients can become highly agitated and caught up in paranoid delusions , reading meaning into trivial things , something said on tv , something a passerby might say , a bird flying by dr reus declined to speculate about mr holmes , whom he has never met , and he emphasized that he knew nothing about the psychiatric treatment mr holmes might have received but he said that in some cases psychiatrists , unaware of the risks , prescribe antidepressants for patients with dysphoric mania drugs that can make the condition worse dave aragon , the director of the lowbudget movie suffocator of sins , a batmanstyle story of vigilante justice and dark redemption , remembers receiving two phone calls in late may or early june from a man identifying himself as james holmes from denver the caller had become enraptured with the fourminute online trailer for the movie , mr aragon said he told me he 'd watched it 100 times and had pressed him for more details about the film he came off as articulate , nervous , on the meek side , he said he was obviously interested in the body count in the days after the shooting , faculty members and graduate students , in shock , compared notes on what they knew about mr holmes , what they might have missed , what they could have done some said they wished they had tried harder to break through his loneliness , a student recalled others wondered if living somewhere besides the dingy apartment on paris street might have mitigated his isolation at a meeting held at dr ribera s house , a student said , barry shur , the dean of the graduate school , said mr holmes had been seeing a psychiatrist when the authorities told him the identity of the shooting suspect , dr shur said , his reaction was i 've heard his name before but all that came later no one saw mr holmes much after he left school in june a classmate spotted him once walking past the subway on campus , his backpack in tow mr dudee , his neighbor , saw him in midjuly , his hair still its normal brown perhaps in a sign of ambivalence , he never took the forms he had filled out to the graduate dean s office , the final step in withdrawing from the university he never replied to the fellow student s last text message , asking if he wanted to talk about dysphoric mania at some point on thursday , july 19 , according to the police , he gathered up the bullets and shotgun shells , the gas mask , an urban assault vest , a ballistic helmet and a groin protector and moved into action at the century 16 theater he mailed a notebook to dr fenton that the university said arrived on july 23 , its contents still under seal by the court and he bought a ticket for the midnight premiere of the dark knight rises , as if he were just another moviegoer , looking forward to the biggest hit of the summer
so , let me clarify what i believe is really going on in the choice of paul ryan as vp nominee it is not about satisfying the conservative base , which was motivated anyway by obamahatred it is not about refocusing on the issues , because rr are both determined to avoid providing any of the crucial specifics about their plans it is as jonathan chait also seems to understand about exploiting the gullibility and vanity of the news media , in much the same way that george w bush did in 2000 like bush in 2000 , ryan has a completely undeserved reputation in the media as a bluff , honest guy , in ryan s case supplemented by a reputation as a serious policy wonk none of this has any basis in reality ryan s muchtouted plan , far from being a real solution , relies crucially on stuff that is just pulled out of thin air huge revenue increases from closing unspecified loopholes , huge spending cuts achieved in ways not mentioned see matt miller for more so whence comes the ryan reputation \? as i said in my last post , it s because many commentators want to tell a story about us politics that makes them feel and look good a story in which both parties are equally at fault in our national stalemate , and in which said commentators stand above the fray this story requires that there be good , honest , technically savvy conservative politicians , so that you can point to these politicians and say how much you admire them , even if you disagree with some of their ideas after all , unless you lavish praise on some conservatives , you don t come across as nobly evenhanded the trouble , of course , is that it s really really hard to find any actual conservative politicians who deserve that praise ryan , with his flaky numbers \( and actually very hardline stance on social issues \) , certainly doesn t but a large part of the commentariat decided early on that they were going to cast ryan in the role of serious honest conservative , and have been very unwilling to reconsider that casting call in the light of evidence so that s the constituency romney is targeting not a large segment of the electorate , but a few hundred at most editors , reporters , programmers , and pundits his hope is that ryan s unjustified reputation for honest wonkery will transfer to the ticket as a whole so , a memo to the news media you have now become players in this campaign , not just reporters mitt romney isn t seeking a debate on the issues on the contrary , he s betting that your gullibility and vanity will let him avoid a debate on the issues , including the issue of his own fitness for the presidency i guess we ll see if it works
miami mera rubell was taking time out from greeting the hundreds of visitors at her family s sprawling contemporary art center here to vent it s the height of arrogance to dismiss , she began jason , her son , interrupted it s arrogance it s a completely uninteresting story for the moment her husband , don , had given up on trying to get a word in the rubells , deans of miami s bustling art scene , were pushing back against a chorus of complaints that has been growing louder in the weeks leading up to , the annual art pilgrimage that began wednesday and ends sunday prominent art writers and critics , including , , and , have been attacking the art world , arguing that the staggering sums of money being spent on works are distorting judgments about art and undermining its longterm cultural significance money talks loudly and easily drowns out other meanings , ms thornton wrote in tar magazine in a recent article , top 10 reasons not to write about the art market in its special edition for the opening day of the fair , the art newspaper asked whether the art world is facing a crisis of values because of the pernicious influence of the market on art and in the eyes of many critics , art basel miami beach or what simon doonan , , labeled a promoparty cheesefest has become a symbol of everything that s wrong with the art market the fair s extraordinary success in just over a decade , and its celebration of wretched excess , have triggered a backlash but the rubells , along with a growing number of other prominent collectors , art dealers and curators , are having none of it the backlash against the backlash has begun the market supports artists , jason rubell said given the limited amount of government support for the arts , he added , it s an industry that without commerce does n't exist what do people want to go back to the recession \? ms rubell was annoyed that critics seemed to ignore the social , economic and cultural transformation of miami that the fair and collectors like her have helped bring about she noted that the rubells' 45 , 000squarefoot art center where one huge gallery is now filled with works by oscar murillo , a 26yearold colombian immigrant who lived with and was supported by the rubells while he created dozens of muralsized canvases used to be a drug enforcement administration storage center outside , in the center s courtyard , visitors like martha stewart admired the french artist bernar venet s collaboration with bugatti , the superluxury sports car brand , on a oneofakind veyron grand sport venet car \( a price has n't been set , a bugatti spokeswoman said , but will undoubtedly be in the higher end of the millions \) i'm grateful to bugatti , perrier , bank of america and other companies , ms rubell declared their support helps facilitate quality programs and opens exhibits like this the murillo show to the public in miami beach , at the main fair , the consumeroriented glitter abounds this week coffee carts with 20aglass ruinart champagne davidoff cigar rollers bmw s artistdesigned cars and takashi murakami s 70 , 000andup commissioned portraits one could almost imagine that the barbara kruger work on display at lm gallery a supersized sign reading greedy on one line and an unprintable expletive on the next had an invisible subtitle telling the wealthy vip s who had come to shop , i'm talking to you yeah , you ! of course , rich patrons have always supported artists , don rubell pointed out , from the pharaohs to the medicis today , multimilliondollar sales represent only a silkthin layer of a deeply varied and thriving art market the art world , mr rubell asserted , is actually becoming more democratic there s 20 ancillary fairs in addition to the highend main event of , he said whatever amount of money you have in your pocket , you can enter this magical world of art the notion that the art market contains multitudes is one with which marc glimcher , part of the family dynasty that runs the pace gallery , said he agreed sure , he said , there are examples of galleries turning into distribution networks for rich collectors who want what their friends or rivals have it used to be that an artist or gallery would immediately do the opposite of what people were clamoring for , but now , he said , every foyer in new york city needs the same painting but mr glimcher maintained that there were essentially as many markets as there were individual works of art and that more people than ever before had developed an appreciation for art the art market is n't like a child we 're all bringing up , he said , summarizing some of the points he made in a public talk at the fair on thursday rather , he compared it to the african savanna , where lions eat antelopes and every beast is looking for a niche of its own in which to survive in another aisle on the fair floor , the new york dealer fergus mccaffrey said he thought that concerns about the future of art were overwrought miami is a blingbling kind of place , and there s a lot of money , he said , but real art is happening still , many in the art world worry that even if superpowered collectors play a useful role in the market , they also exert a disproportionate influence on it their particular tastes , however idiosyncratic , can cause a middling artist to be elevated and a great one to be neglected , that argument goes everything is consumption , and the galleries are very hungry for money , said magda baltoyanni , a dealer from greece , while resting for a moment in the collectors lounge galleries run the game now , not the museums but powerful collectors , from eli broad to rosa de la cruz , resisted this notion i do n't consider myself a tastemaker , said mr broad , who founded a new museum at michigan state university and is opening another in downtown los angeles in 2014 , and whose foundation regularly donates and lends some of its 1 , 800work collection to hundreds of museums mr broad was at no 10 this year in art auction magazine s list of the art world s most powerful people , which was released on the fair s opening day enno scholma , chairman of the museum ludwig in cologne , said he rooted for ambitious collectors like mr broad here , there is an incredibly choosy public that is committed to buying at the top we need them for the art market to work , he said he added that he loved the bravado of the collectors who come to miami beach they 're not sissies , he said , and that is essential
washington with the debate over the federal deficit roiling last year , david smick , a financial market consultant , held a dinner for a bipartisan group of connected budget thinkers at his expansive home here at the table were members of the city s conservative policy elite , including , the former chairman of the federal reserve , and , the editor of the weekly standard but that evening , none drew more attention than a relatively new member of that bestof class representative , republican of wisconsin and now mitt romney s running mate , who spoke passionately about the threat posed by the and the radical actions needed to rein it in i thought , this is the one guy in washington paying attention , ' said niall ferguson , the harvard economic historian and commentator , who spent some of the rest of that evening , along with mr kristol , trying to persuade mr ryan to run for president much has been written about mr ryan s intellectual influences canonical conservative thinkers like friedrich von hayek , the austrian economist , and , the novelist and philosopher mr ryan s enthusiasm for them his days as a precocious undergraduate at miami university in ohio but since first coming to washington in the early 1990s , mr ryan has been closely tied to an intellectual world more concerned with the political agenda of low taxes , light regulations and small government than philosophical ruminations on work and freedom and since his emergence as the key congressional republican on the budget issue , mr ryan has become a particular favorite of and powerful influence on the intellectuals , economists , writers and policy makers who are at the heart of washington s conservative establishment mr ryan is the good thinktankeraspolitician , said stuart butler , the director of the center for policy innovation at the heritage foundation , a rightofcenter research institution when i'm having a discussion with ryan , i'm talking to someone who knows the material as well as , if not better than , i do mr kristol , who has been one of mr ryan s loudest boosters in washington , said , he s a guy who , unlike 98 percent of members of congress , can sit in a conference room or around the dinner table with 6 or 10 people from think tanks and magazines and more than hold his own in a discussion aides and confidants of mr ryan describe him as an earnestly interested , tactically minded policy thinker , with a deep knowledge of budget numbers and close ties with the right s influential policy heavies in his 20 years in washington , mr ryan has pursued ties with two groups of thinkers in particular policy scholars at research groups like the american enterprise institute and commentators like mr kristol and george f will of the washington post the reputation for wonkiness is merited , people close to mr ryan said he goes home with a stack of white papers he calls economists when he has questions about their budget projections or ideas he also athletically argues for his policy ideas among the city s policy elite in the whitetablecloth lunches , capitol hill meetings , private dinners and retreats where consensus gets formed he s unusual , mr kristol said the only member of congress i can remember like that is pat moynihan , he said , referring to senator , a new york democrat who was known for his reaching intellect early in his career , mr ryan worked at a nonprofit advocacy group , empower america , now part of freedomworks , after college and a brief stint on the hill two of its founders , william j bennett , the former education secretary and current talk radio host , and jack kemp , the former housing secretary and 1996 republican vicepresidential candidate , became important mentors to mr ryan mr kemp died in 2009 mr kemp taught me that big ideas are the best politics , mr ryan they will always be challenged , and they will sometimes be controversial , but you have to do what you think is right , what you 're passionate about , and be a strong advocate for it if you do that , you can shift the debate in a major way while mr ryan is sometimes compared to mr kemp because of their similar energetic and affable styles , mr ryan s bedrock belief in smaller government has sometimes placed him to the right of his mentors mr kemp was n't hostile to budget cuts , but he certainly was n't enthusiastic about them , said bruce bartlett , a budget expert who worked on mr kemp s staff and has known mr ryan for two decades jack just never thought that was important he thought growth was important he never proposed spending cuts to pay for tax cuts or anything like that the embrace by conservative policy elites began after mr ryan became a prominent voice pushing for of the system during the george w bush administration despite his lack of seniority and in no small part because of his already firm reputation as an economic policy thinker mr ryan became the top republican on the budget committee in 2007 and then its chairman when republicans retook the house in 2010 in 2008 , he released the first iteration of his budget , the roadmap for america s future it won plaudits in a rightofcenter policy world that had gotten used to politicians watering down its ideas and acquiescing to a bloated through the bush years probably more than any other member of congress , he says , what if we really try to apply conservative principles , limitedgovernment principles , to legislation \? let s see how far we can get , given the political realities , ' said michael f cannon , a health policy expert at the cato institute , who described mr ryan as a contrast to other republicans who are quick to abandon smallgovernment proposals under pressure from industries or interest groups he s worried about much more than the budget arithmetic , about the kind of government that we are going to have in america , said yuval levin of the ethics and public policy center here and a favored policy thinker of mr ryan he s a politician , not an omb economist , mr levin said , referring to the office of management and budget at the white house
just when your mailbox is clear of attacks and your television is free of fuzzy and unflattering blackandwhite images of career politicians , the political pros have already started manufacturing grist for the elections two years from now comptroller susan combs , who would love to be the state s next lieutenant governor , just moved a top aide , david white , from her state office to her campaign land commissioner jerry patterson just hired chris elam , a political operative , away from the of texas to run his campaign an announcement made under the letterhead patterson for lieutenant governor across austin , especially in the blocks closest to the state capitol , it s not hard to find bumper stickers promoting todd staples , the state s agriculture commissioner , for lieutenant governor and here comes george p bush , the newest bearer of the family franchise , who has made the necessary filings for a campaign associates say he will consider running for one of those emptying statewide offices but all that is really known is that he filed the paperwork to run for something could be anything from governor to a spot on a backwater appellate court do n't forget the current occupant of that corner office on the second floor of the capitol s east wing lt gov david dewhurst is not acting like a retiree he lost an expensive united states senate race in july , but he has jumped back into his work , naming senate committee heads early and announcing his support for legislation , including a bill that would require welfare applicants to take drug tests and he looks like a guy who wants to keep his job it s 2012 to most of us , but it s 2014 to them the speculation game is nothing new and is based partly on the state s recent history of electing republicans in statewide elections , and partly on the fact that the hierarchy in statewide offices has been relatively static voters may not be ready to talk about it , but the state s aspiring political talents are eager to move up , more so than usual because they have not had open seats to grab now , maybe maybe they will the game of musical chairs is already under way republicans started talking among themselves about presidential nominations before had conceded but in texas , the music is still playing someone in that pack of wannabes could back away from the lieutenant governor s seat and set his or her sights on something else maybe even reelection or retirement and the lines are forming for the contestants' current seats , which could force them to make decisions before they might normally do so mr patterson s run sets up a run by mr bush \( his father , former gov jeb bush of florida , told potential supporters in a fundraising letter that his son had his eye on the land office \) at least three texans have expressed interest in the comptroller job , should ms combs move on they have n't hired yet heck , gov rick perry , whose job will be on the ballot in 2014 , has n't filled out the political staff he disbanded after his presidential run mr dewhurst s plans are n't clear neither are those of attorney general greg abbott , who has quietly expressed interest in running for governor to this point , he and mr perry have been close allies their lists of big donors are close to identical no signs of a breakup there , but ambition can be a catalyst again , no motion there the 2013 legislative session could clarify some of this , both in terms of the issues that rise and fall , and because mr perry and mr abbott and after them , the others have said they will make their plans public in june , when the session is over statewide officials ca n't raise money during a legislative session , or for the month that precedes one june will come without any new sign of financial strength , because none of them will have done anything \( the restriction does n't apply to nonofficeholders like mr bush \) the early moves to staff campaigns could help them raise money during the remaining weeks before the blackout , however their efforts on the campaign finance front will be reported to regulators in january , just as the session gets under way texans will get a good peek at some 2014 prospects in june , when mr perry and mr abbott and the others announce their intentions but those are just announcements the campaigns are already working
philadelphia the s move from suburban philadelphia to the center of the city caused art lovers lots of worry devotees of this great polyglot collection , heavy with renoir , c zanne and matisse , which the omnivore art shopper albert c barnes amassed between 1912 and his death in 1951 , were appalled by the idea barnes spent years cheekbyjowl in the mansion in lower merion , pa , that he built for the purpose and opened in 1925 , and he stipulated that , after he died , it should remain exactly as it was in 2002 the foundation s board constrained by limits on attendance and public hours imposed by zoning restrictions announced plans to relocate many people , including a group that sued to stop the move , were sure that it could only desecrate this singular institution others , myself included , did not object to the move per se , but felt that faithfully reproducing the old barnes in the new space , as promised by the trustees , was a terrible idea to us it seemed time to at least loosen up barnes s straitjacketed displays , wonderful as they often were and why go to the trouble of moving the collection to a more accessible location when the galleries were not going to be any bigger \? and yet the new barnes proves all of us wrong against all odds , the museum that opens to the public on saturday is still very much the old barnes , only better it is easier to get to , more comfortable and userfriendly , and , above all , blessed with stateoftheart lighting that makes the collection much , much easier to see and barnes s exuberant vision of art as a relatively egalitarian aggregate of the fine , the decorative and the functional comes across more clearly , justifying its perpetuation with a new force as a result , his quirky institution is suddenly on the verge of becoming the prominent and influential national treasure that it has long deserved to be it is also positioned to make an important contribution to the way we look at and think about art , who pulled off this feat and somehow managed to avoid the feeling of plastic fakeness that barnes purists and barnes skeptics alike were anticipating deserves our gratitude the merion building and its 24 galleries , and barnes s arrangements within them , have been recreated with amazing fidelity in terms of proportions , window placement and finishings , albeit in a slightly more modern style the structure is oriented to the south , exactly as in merion the same mustardcolored burlap covers the walls the same plain wood molding outlines doors and baseboards as for barnes s arrangements , almost nothing is out of place not one of the hundreds of great french paintings , none of the pieces of americana , nor any of the greek or african sculptures , the small new mexican woodpanel santos or the scores of wroughtiron hinges , locks , door handles and whatnot that dot the interstices like unusually tangible bits of wallpaper pattern , often subtly reiterating the compositions of the paintings the only change to the installation a big improvement is the removal of the colorful fantasy of nudes in a landscape that is matisse s great fauve masterpiece , le bonheur de vivre , from its humiliating position on the stairway landing to a large alcove on the balcony overlooking the main gallery at the same time , some major systemic improvements make everything breathe in a new way especially important is the lighting system , designed by the fisher marantz stone firm , which seamlessly mixes natural and artificial illumination into a diffuse , even light , and had early visitors asking if some of the paintings had been cleaned \( they had n't \) there is also the spatial largess the recreated building is set within a larger structure that includes a raft of amenities , among them a cafe , an auditorium and a gracious garden court with lots of padded benches , as well as a 5 , 000squarefoot temporary exhibition gallery that pulses with curatorial possibility barnes s arrangements are as eyeopening , intoxicating and , at times , maddening as ever , maybe more so they mix major and minor in relentlessly symmetrical patchworks that argue at once for the idea of artistic genius and the pervasiveness of talent nearly every room is an exhibition unto itself a kind of art wunderkammer , or cabinet of curiosities where you can spend hours parsing the echoes and divergences among the works in terms of color , composition , theme , surface and light in room 4 , two chardins flank a \( school of \) el greco beneath 16thcentury carvedwood reliefs from france almost all depict women engaged in various tasks in room 14 , painted chinese fans hover beside matisse s magnificent 1907 portrait of his wife in a red madras headdress , with a folkish surrealist painting by jean hugo , greatgrandson of victor , positioned above several american modernists make recurring appearances , including charles demuth , maurice prendergast and william glackens , a former high school classmate of barnes s who turned him on to modern art so , to lesser extent , do artists who taught at the barnes in front of several renoirs are wonderful pots by that painter s son , the future filmmaker jean the twin poles of barnes s world are renoir , represented by 181 works \( the largest concentration in the world \) , and c zanne , represented by 69 barnes never seemed to tire of playing these two giants off each other , alternating the fuzzy , sybaritic pinks of renoir s forms whether female or floral with c zanne s anxious , angular blues , greens and rusts , played out in landscapes , still lifes and numerous paintings of bathers , early and late , small and large their backandforth dominates several galleries , and the renoirs are so ubiquitous that at times they seem to become a kind of background noise that is , until you come up against a great one , like leaving the conservatory , an imposing fulllength grouping of several parisians dressed in shades of gray that hangs above a predominantly grayblue pennsylvania dutch blanket chest these wonderful chests , of which there are several outstanding examples , as well as the numerous ceramics , affirm barnes s appreciation of painting as a freerange language expressed in various materials , not only oil on canvas there are also seemingly endless surprises , like the lone work by the postwar italian artist afro in room 10 , which also contains a veritable matisse retrospective , including a small , early still life that you could swear is a manet , and numerous works by picasso and modigliani and there are oddities everywhere that might not pass muster in a more conventional museum , like a european , possibly 15thcentury , panel in room 23 , depicting a flight into egypt the colors are rich , the figures big and wonderfully drawn , but the real life of the picture emanates from the greenery , applied in loose splotches that bring to mind the brushy , spongedon glazes of american redware ceramics looking at the slightly bizarre bits of green , you have no idea if they were part of the original picture or added later , but you do n't care , and perhaps barnes did not , either it made a point about continuities of human touch and technique , and he went for it in many ways the rebirth of the barnes could not be better timed it occurs at a point of intense public interest in art witness the fact that since the project s groundbreaking in november 2009 , membership has jumped from 400 to nearly 20 , 000 and it approaches art with an unfettered directness that is becoming rare among major american museums , of which the barnes is now one at a moment when so many museums seem bent on turning themselves into entertainment and social centers , or frequently mount dry , overly academic exhibitions , the barnes irrefutably foregrounds art and nonverbal visual experience the galleries are devoid of text panels and even wall labels most works have the artist s last name or some other cultural identification nailed to their frames , and there are printed guides stored in benches in each gallery that identify the works on view audio guides will be available , but really , there is nothing to do here but look at art and think for yourself the dense clusters and juxtapositions provide more than enough to work with a visual deluge of forms in different mediums and materials , from widely spread times and places that make looking and thinking reflexive , rapturous and liberating at the same time , the relocation of the barnes , with all its mixings and juxtapositions , comes at a time when curators of all kinds from museum professionals to artists organizing gallery group shows are increasingly interested in crosscultural , crossmedium presentations of artworks in this regard the barnes looks utterly prescient and let s not overlook the implications of that temporary gallery , which is opening with an exhibition about barnes s life and the history of the foundation this space creates the possibility of a new flexibility with regard to the meticulous recreation of the merion galleries they suggest that the barnes may be able to have its cake and eat it too , hold on to its past and also forge a new future barnes purists may consider this heresy , but barnes s installation should sometimes change and move a little there are moments , especially in the upstairs galleries among the plethora of drawings and greek and african objects , where the presentation palls and oppresses a bit , even now the symmetrical patchwork does n't always come across as meticulously assembled it can seem arbitrary and maniacally crowded more generally , there is simply too much there for everything to remain in perpetual lockdown the barnes curators need to come up with creative ways say for two or three months , every other year to extract certain works from the gallery collection , walk them across the garden court and put them on view in the temporaryexhibition galleries for less encumbered viewing set out all the african works , for example give us a c zanne or a matisse retrospective or a survey of the pennsylvania dutch blanket chests and related americana whose hues and surfaces barnes was so alive to barnes did so much , more than he was capable of knowing we can know how much only if his orchestrations are taken apart and rearranged ever so slightly and briefly , once in a while it is great that tod williams and billie tsien , the architects , adhered to his vision so sensitively , providing a kind of unwaveringly accurate baseline but every so often the pieces of even his most revelatory ensembles should be freed from his matrix , just as his amazing achievement has been liberated from merion
falcons \( 122 \) at lions \( 410 \) saturday , 8 30 pm eastern line falcons by 4 the nice thing about being the lions is that no matter how bad a season gets , they are not in danger of being the worst team in franchise history if you go 016 once , every other season seems like a success in some regard but as detroit is on the verge of an eighth consecutive loss , it is worth remembering that this team had far higher expectations than that winless 2008 squad the falcons , meanwhile , have a playoff spot secured and can clinch homefield advantage with one more win or losses by the packers and the 49ers , but will not be able to celebrate until they replicate some of that success in the postseason the last two seasons have seen atlanta charge into the playoffs on a high only to lose in the first round their motivations may be different , but at least both teams have something on the line pick falcons bengals \( 86 \) at steelers \( 77 \) sunday , 1 pm line steelers by 4 for the bengals , things are fairly simple win and they are in the playoffs then a win against the ravens next week , combined with a baltimore loss to the giants this week , and cincinnati improbably wins the afc north however , things never seem to stay simple when it comes to the bengals and their division rivals cincinnati has lost five consecutive games against the steelers and four against the ravens bengals quarterback andy dalton is 06 against the two teams things could be different this week , with the bengals looking more like a classic steelers team than the bungles of old having relied on dalton earlier this season , their recent hot streak has been led by their defense , which has been holding opponents to an nfllow 125 points a game over their last six contests and benjarvus greenellis , who has rushed for 593 yards and 3 touchdowns on 49 yards a carry over that span the steelers are likely surprised they are still in contention having struggled because of injuries to ben roethlisberger , rashard mendenhall , troy polamalu and james harrison \( among others \) , a loss to the cowboys last week nearly finished them off , and one more loss would eliminate them entirely if cincinnati can grind things out with greenellis and have their defense continue to impress , dalton may get that first win against pittsburgh pick bengals giants \( 86 \) at ravens \( 95 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line giants by 1 the problem with the strategy of not worrying about the regular season and saving yourself for the playoffs is that it does not work should you fall behind enough that you find yourselves watching the playoffs from a couch at home the giants , winners of two super bowls in the last five seasons , have the talent to win it all again , but almost certainly need to win both of their remaining games to sneak into the playoffs as last season s 97 team showed , regularseason success is not a good indication of whether or not the giants are real contenders pick giants 49ers \( 1031 \) at seahawks \( 95 \) sunday , 8 20 pm line 49ers by 1 over their last two games the seahawks have scored 108 points while allowing just 17 we re definitely clicking well , russell wilson , the team s rookie quarterback , told reporters this week i ve been on a couple of teams that have scored that many in college but to do it in the national football league , i mean that s really tough to do he was understating things the 108 points in a twogame stretch is tied for the third most ever , but seattle is unlikely in the words of barry switzer to hang half a hundred for a third consecutive game the seahawks now face a 49ers defense that is the best in the nfl at limiting points , with an average of 156 a game the 49ers can clinch the nfc west with a win , and are riding high after beating new england , but if the allpro defensive lineman justin smith is out or limited after injuring his arm in last week s win , seattle could stay alive in the division race for another week pick 49ers saints \( 68 \) at cowboys \( 86 \) sunday , 1 pm line cowboys by 1 after beating the steelers last week to move into a tie for the nfc east division lead , the cowboys are closing the season with quite a bit of momentum as everything has come together , jerry jones , the team s outspoken owner , has seen parallels with last year s giants team that went on to win the super bowl you can legitimately look at how the giants played last year , what they did at the end of the year and how they took it all the way , jones told reporters this week and that s not unrealistic to think that that can happen to you momentum has swung the other way for new orleans at one point it looked like the saints awful start would not stop them from marching to the playoffs , as they put together a stretch of strong midseason games but their chances are now slim they need to win both remaining games , along with receiving an enormous amount of help from other teams pick cowboys vikings \( 86 \) at texans \( 122 \) sunday , 1 pm line texans by 9 the texans have already clinched their division title , and can secure homefield advantage in the playoffs with one more win or losses by denver and new england the vikings , while currently clinging to the final wildcard spot in the nfc , appear unlikely to hold on , since they would almost certainly need wins against houston and green bay in consecutive weeks so with relatively little drama in terms of playoff possibilities , this becomes the adrian peterson show he needs 294 rushing yards to break eric dickerson s record of 2 , 105 for the season in the midst of a phenomenal streak in which he has rushed for more than 100 yards in eight consecutive games , with an average of 1641 yards a game , peterson has his last big test against a texans defense that is ranked fifth in the nfl against the run with an average of 932 yards allowed a game the texans appeared somewhat vulnerable last week , giving up 105 yards to vick ballard , a colts rookie if peterson , a native texan , could match that total , he would need less than 200 yards to break the record in a home game against a soft packers defense , which would help cushion the blow for a team that failed to live up to their early hype pick texans titans \( 59 \) at packers \( 104 \) sunday , 1 pm line packers by 13 the titans have not lost to the packers since 1998 their defense has looked capable for five consecutive weeks , chris johnson managed a 94yard run on primetime television monday and the team has nothing to lose , having already been eliminated from playoff contention none of that is likely to matter the packers are playing with a great deal of motivation they are trying to secure a firstround bye in the playoffs and want this season to be different than last , when they went on cruise control for the final two games of the regular season and ended up being bounced early from the playoffs even if the game is as boring as oddsmakers believe it to be , with the packers favored by 13 , some nfl history could be set as packers wide receiver randall cobb needs just 108 receiving yards and 36 kick return yards to be the first player ever to have 1 , 000 of each he may want to get those return yards early , as it is unlikely that the titans will be kicking more than a few times pick packers colts \( 95 \) at chiefs \( 212 \) sunday , 1 pm line colts by 7 winning seems to cure all problems , so colts fans will not focus on andrew luck s terrible completion percentage , his soso touchdowntointerception ratio or his tendency to make a lot of mistakes early in games with luck , the statistics matter far less than the colts being in the playoffs for the 10th time in 11 seasons and rightly so one more win will accomplish that goal statistics also do not matter much for kansas city , a team in a race with the jaguars for the worst record in the nfl even if kansas city ends up with more wins , the jaguars could argue that they have never looked as bad as the chiefs did last week when they managed just 119 yards and 7 first downs against a suspect oakland defense even jamaal charles , the team s lone bright spot , managed just 10 yards on the ground pick colts patriots \( 104 \) at jaguars \( 212 \) sunday , 1 pm line patriots by 15 the patriots will be in the playoffs no matter what whether they are the first , second or third seed in the afc depends not only on their performance over the final two weeks but also on how houston and denver play i m not smart enough to understand the 80 different things that can happen , patriots coach bill belichick told reporters i don t really care there s nothing we can do about any of them that is not entirely true the patriots can help their cause by beating jacksonville though it s possible the famously grumpy coach considers that a given pick patriots browns \( 59 \) at broncos \( 113 \) sunday , 4 05 pm line broncos by 14 as the browns have struggled through a difficult season , with a brief respite coming in the form of a threegame winning streak prior to last week s loss , the team has stuck with the rookie quarterback brandon weeden despite being ranked 26th in the nfl in total offense , and weeden having more interceptions than touchdowns along with a rating of 724 that is the fourth worst among qualified starters , the browns are committed to sticking with their quarterback of the future , even if , at 29 , he is not all that young the broncos , with nine consecutive wins , look like a super bowl contender with knowshon moreno having stepped in nicely at running back , peyton manning a top most valuable player candidate and the defense striking fear into the hearts of opponents , their current goal of securing a firstround bye should get one step closer this week pick broncos redskins \( 86 \) at eagles \( 410 \) sunday , 1 pm line redskins by 6 nick foles against kirk cousins does not have the same ring to it as michael vick against robert griffin iii yet that matchup might happen , even if vick and griffin are both suited up and ready to go in the eagles case , vick is expected to be healthy but will be philadelphia s no 3 quarterback behind foles and trent edwards for the redskins it will come down to how griffin s injured knee responds to a week of practice he currently appears ready to play , but if there are any setbacks , cousins is more than capable of beating philadelphia the owners of tiebreakers against both dallas and the giants , the redskins can win the nfc east outright if they win their two remaining games pick redskins bears \( 86 \) at cardinals \( 59 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line bears by 6 the bears earlyseason strategy of letting the defense score enough touchdowns to win games was not sustainable , but chicago probably thought the offense would be able to take up some of the slack as the season went on that has not happened , with the bears averaging 142 points a game over their last six games , and brandon marshall , the team s outspoken wide receiver , declaring that should the offense cost the team a trip to the playoffs , it should cost some players their jobs when you make a comment like that , it s almost guaranteed that you re going to rub some people the wrong way , and then there s some people that might respond to it in a positive way , marshall told reporters it s a little bit of both either way , marshall has done his part in his first year with the team , he needs just three yards to break marcus robinson s singleseason record of 1 , 400 receiving yards , set in 1999 pick bears bills \( 59 \) at dolphins \( 68 \) sunday , 1 pm line dolphins by 5 the dolphins have not yet been eliminated from the playoffs , but needing wins against buffalo and new england , as well as a great deal of luck in terms of other results , they are not likely to play beyond next week the bills know all about not making the playoffs , having failed to qualify since 1999 pick dolphins rams \( 671 \) at buccaneers \( 68 \) sunday , 1 pm line buccaneers by 3 a week ago , the rams looked like a good bet to make the playoffs , having won three consecutive games a loss to minnesota all but ended that dream the team has plenty to build on , having flashed occasional talent and a tough attitude this season , and still has a chance of finishing with a winning record for the first time since 2003 pick rams raiders \( 410 \) at panthers \( 59 \) sunday , 1 pm line panthers by 10 both teams have been eliminated from contention , taking any meaningful drama out of the contest but with a win , cam newton can match his total from last season , something that seemed unlikely when carolina was 39 pick panthers chargers \( 59 \) at jets \( 68 \) sunday , 1 pm line jets by 1 even oddsmakers could not get excited about this matchup of teams already eliminated from the playoffs with the home team favored by a point , las vegas essentially threw its hands up and declared that the game did not matter little money may be riding on it , but with greg mcelroy scheduled to start for the jets , the game could cost the team mark sanchez and tim tebow , who could both be traded a loss could cost rex ryan his job pick chargers picks do not reflect the spread all times are eastern
san francisco in a case that has pitted lawenforcement officials against advocates of victims' rights , prosecutors in sacramento county , calif , have detained a 17yearold girl for twice failing to appear in court to testify against the man accused of raping her the prosecutors say that testimony from the teenager , who twice ran away from a foster home before scheduled court appearances , is critical in the upcoming trial against a man who has a long criminal record and is also suspected of raping at least one other woman but the teenager s lawyer and victims' advocates say that the detention would discourage others , especially those who have been sexually assaulted , from coming forward they described the move as a setback in a state with some of the country s strongest laws protecting victims both sides agree that the detention of a material witness , particularly a juvenile , is extremely rare the girl , who has been held in a juvenile detention center since march 23 , is scheduled to appear on monday at a hearing concerning her detention at sacramento superior court the girl was 16 and staying at a foster home when she was attacked in july , the authorities say she had gone out with friends one evening in sacramento , officials said , when the suspect , frank william rackley , 37 , is said to have abducted her from a light rail station and raped her prosecutors have been forced to postpone the trial against mr rackley because of the teenager s missed court appearances officials in the sacramento district attorney s office have said that they were reluctant to detain the teenager but that it was necessary for the public good lisa m franco , the teenager s lawyer , said the detention violated , a 2008 amendment to the state s constitution that guarantees victims be free of intimidation during the criminal justice process that provision should supersede the authorities' power to detain a material witness , ms franco said she s afraid of confronting her rapist , and she does n't want to testify , ms franco said by imprisoning her it s just punitive , punishing her for not wanting to testify , which is contrary to what marsy s law stands for she s being bullied because she does n't want to do what the da wants her to do she s having a horrible time in there she s in a place where they put criminals ms franco has proposed releasing her to a foster home with a gps tracking device around her ankle experts said that prosecutors were generally extremely hesitant to exercise their power to detain material witnesses because they rely on their cooperation this is something that has existed for a long time and exists almost everywhere , but almost nobody uses it very much , said floyd f feeney , a criminal law expert at the university of california , davis but if you had a juvenile who s flitting back and forth and got lots of problems and is the key witness in a case against a really bad actor , i would n't think it would be that unusual for the da s office to consider holding her as a material witness marsy s law is based on a ballot measure that california voters approved in 2008 though supporters said it strengthened victims' rights , critics said it would violate prisoners' rights and merely serve to swell the state s prison population while 32 other states have passed similar constitutional amendments , none guarantee victims' rights as explicitly as marsy s law does , said meg garvin , a professor at lewis and clark law school in portland , ore , and the executive director of the national crime victim law institute there marsy s law is the newest , most comprehensive constitutional amendment in the country , ms garvin said it really is cutting edge that s why some other states are looking at it as a model , including illinois she added this constitutional amendment was supposed to protect victims but the fact that a rape victim is being held in detention is not only unusual , it is outrageous advocates for rape victims said that the case could make it even more difficult to persuade victims to report sexual assaults they may become reluctant to seek assistance if they feel this will trigger the criminal justice system and lead to them being forced to testify , said sandra henriquez , executive director of the california coalition against sexual assault in sacramento the trial against mr rackley is now scheduled to start on april 23 the suspect , a convicted felon with a criminal history two decades old , was identified by the teenager because of a large swastika tattooed on his chest , ms franco said according to prosecutors , from the suspect was also found on the teenager lawyers from the public defender s office representing mr rackley could not be reached for comment
washington over the last decade , the united states has built a sophisticated security system to protect the nation s seaports against terrorists and criminals but our nation s critical infrastructure is not similarly secured from cyberattack although we have made progress in recent years , congressional action is needed to ensure that our laws keep pace with the electronically connected world we live in the bipartisan cybersecurity act of 2012 , currently before the senate , offers a way forward a disruption of our electric grid or other critical infrastructure could temporarily cripple the american economy what s less well known is that such an attack could threaten the nation s defense as well ninetynine percent of the electricity the military uses comes from civilian sources ninety percent of military voice and internet communications travel over commercial networks much of the country s military logistics are handled by commercial shippers who rely , in turn , on privately managed networks as we protect our ports and coastlines , so must we marshal resources and techniques to mount an adequate defense of our networks our port security is ensured by a combination of the coast guard , customs and border protection , state and local governments , and private shipping companies and port operators , with the support of the navy and the intelligence agencies together , they patrol american waters , scan cargo , analyze and share information about threats to our coastlines , and report suspicious behavior to the proper authorities if any of these layers were to be removed , our defenses would be weakened effective cybersecurity requires a similar multilevel approach we have a final line of cyberdefense in the defense department s cyber command , which defends the nation against advanced cyberattacks , and we have a strong cyberintelligence system in the national security agency , which detects cyberthreats from overseas but we need additional levels of defense to protect the nation s critical infrastructure collective problems require collaborative solutions the government and private sector must work together to prevent cyberdisruption , cyberdestruction and theft of intellectual property this requires robust sharing of information between the government and private sector , aggressive prosecution of cybercriminals , and cooperation among federal agencies simply put , the cybersecurity act would help by enabling the government to share information about cyberthreats with industry the legislation would also permit the private sector to report cyberintrusions to the government or private companies that ability would increase awareness of cyberthreats , while leaving the private sector in control of which information is shared it would do all of this while protecting privacy and civil liberties , through robust oversight and accountability measures none of us want to see heavy government regulation , especially of the internet , the fount of so much innovation and economic productivity the legislation would provide meaningful baseline cybersecurity standards for industry , developed and adopted through a joint industrygovernment process although the american economy needs effective cybersecurity measures to function and prosper , many providers of critical infrastructure have not invested in basic strategies to defend themselves against cyberthreats meaningful standards will help drive companies to invest and help fill the gaps in our nation s cyberdefenses finally , the cybersecurity act would ensure that the department of homeland security has the ability to protect federal networks and assist the private sector effectively and efficiently , by strengthening the department s legal authority the department of defense stands ready to support the department of homeland security and any other agency in protecting the nation s critical infrastructure together , our two departments can bring our technical ability to bear and improve the nation s stock of cybersecurity tools and technology this legislation is a critical step for defending america s infrastructure against the clear and present cyberthreats we face we 're not going to solve this problem overnight it will involve a learning experience for both the private sector and the government , but we must learn fast , and develop solutions as quickly as possible the legislation will help pave the way to american security and prosperity in the information age it deserves the full support of congress and the american people
each nfl playoff game brings about its own sense of history , and the coming slate for this weekend is no different let s take a look at some of the unique features of the four games of the wildcard playoffs detroitnew orleans detroit may have one of the best passing games in the nfl , but winning a shootout in new orleans is a dicey proposition the lions are 105point underdogs against the saints , making them the biggest underdog of the weekend since 1990 , teams that are a touchdownorgreater underdogs are 314 in this round the 1998 cardinals shocked the cowboys in dallas , 207 , two years after the 96 jaguars won at buffalo despite being 85point underdogs but the biggest upset during wildcard weekend \? that happened with the saints just last season new orleans lost as a 10point road favorite against seattle there is some evidence that homefield advantage is minimized when the road team is familiar with the home team s stadium as you may recall , the lions have already played in new orleans this season although detroit did not fare well against the saints in that game , it may have gained some experience just from being there or maybe not since 1990 , there have been 56 times when a team has played a team from another division in the regular season and then played that team again in the same location in the playoffs the road teams were just 2531 against the spread in those situations making matters worse for detroit of those 56 road teams , 15 of them lost by at least two touchdowns the first time around only three won the rematch the 2005 steelers against the colts , the 2004 patriots against the steelers and the 93 chiefs against the oilers that s not a particularly large sample , and detroit is more used to playing in a dome than most saints opponents one thing that is certain when drew brees and matthew stafford start , the game will feature the most combined passing yardage in postseason history from 1970 to 2010 , 27 playoff games featured two quarterbacks who threw for a combined 8 , 000 yards but stafford \( 5 , 038 \) and brees \( 5 , 476 \) have combined for a mindboggling 10 , 514 yards no other postseason duel has ever come close to featuring such firepower pittsburghdenver the broncos have rushed for 2 , 632 yards this season in a year where the average team gained only 1 , 874 yards on the ground but not only did denver outrush the average team by over 750 yards , but the broncos also passed for 1 , 241 fewer yards than the average team in recent history , only one team has passed for so few yards relative to league average as this year s broncos the 2005 chicago bears since 1978 , 12 teams have made the playoffs while rushing for more than 500 yards than average but also failing to come within 500 passing yards of league average in fact , last year s afc west champion was just one such team the table above shows the number of playoff wins and losses for each team as you can see , none of them won the super bowl can denver buck that trend \? it s hard to think of a worse matchup for denver than pittsburgh the steelers lead the league in the three most important defensive statistics points allowed , yards allowed and net yards per pass allowed pittsburgh is now just the ninth team since the aflnfl merger to lead the league in all three categories in recent years , such production has been a strong indicator of playoff success three of the teams the 08 steelers , 02 buccaneers and 96 packers went on to win the super bowl the 2009 jets made it to the afc championship game before falling to the colts the first four teams to accomplish this defensive triple crown were less successful the 86 bears , 81 eagles and 70 vikings all lost their first playoff game , while the 79 bucs lost in the nfc championship game houstoncincinnati when andy dalton and tj yates take center stage , they will be as inexperienced a set of quarterbacks as the league has ever seen they will become the first pair of rookie quarterbacks since at least 1950 to start against each other in the playoffs but believe it or not , the game won t feature the least experienced set of quarterbacks to oppose each other in a playoff game , as long as you measure experience by games started dalton started every game this season while yates started the final five games of the season for houston since 1950 , four other playoff games featured quarterbacks with 21 or fewer career starts before that game an additional seven playoff games had quarterbacks with fewer than 30 combined career starts facing off houston has lost its last three games of the season , as have the denver broncos they become just the 9th and 10th teams to make the playoffs despite losing their final three games most recently , the 2009 saints started 130 , finished 133 , and won the super bowl the 01 raiders , 00 vikings , 99 lions , 91 raiders , 86 jets , 69 rams and 43 redskins round out the group , with the lions \( 4 \) and jets \( 5 \) actually losing more than just their last three in the wildcard round of the playoffs , those teams the 01 raiders , 99 lions , 91 raiders and 86 jets went 22 so the losing streak does not necessarily spell doom for houston or denver atlantanew york last season , the falcons had the best record in the nfc but were oneanddone in the playoffs how do those teams tend to perform the next year \? in 1990 , the nfl instituted the current playoff format , which gives two teams in each conference a bye twentythree times those teams have lost in their first playoff game , including atlanta and new england last season only 9 of those 23 teams made the playoffs the following season , but two of them converted a wildcard berth into a super bowl championship in 1996 , the denver broncos went 133 but lost to jacksonville in the first round denver won the super bowl in 1997 as a 124 wild card and then again as the no 1 seed in 1998 the 2005 colts chased an undefeated season to 130 unfortunately for peyton manning , the colts were ousted in their first playoff game by the steelers but the following season , the colts won the super bowl despite not earning a bye five of those nine teams , like the falcons , ended up earning a playoff berth as a wild card three of them the 2008 colts , 2000 colts and 1993 steelers lost their first playoff game , all in overtime in addition to the 96 broncos , the 03 rams also won their first playoff game , before losing in double overtime to the panthers the giants are anything but a balanced offense in fact , they rank last in the league in both rushing yards and rushing yards per carry since the merger , only two teams have ever made the playoffs despite ranking last in both categories the 1978 vikings and the 1986 patriots the 1981 49ers are the only team to win the super bowl despite ranking last in yards per carry no team has ever won the super bowl when ranking last in rushing yards the 1970 baltimore colts are the only team to win it all while ranking in the bottom five in both categories chase stuart is a contributor to , and
london a day after spending several hours in the biting cold atop a royal barge on the thames , , the 90yearold husband of queen elizabeth ii , was taken to a hospital on monday suffering from what a buckingham palace spokesman described as a bladder infection a palace statement said the prince , also known as the duke of edinburgh , had been taken to the king edward vii hospital in london after lunch on monday in what it described as a precautionary measure it said the prince s condition was being assessed and treated , and he would remain in the hospital for observation for a few days the announcement came midway through the fourday national holiday in in celebration of the queen s diamond jubilee , marking her 60 years on the throne the central event of the jubilee , on sunday , was a royal pageant on the thames , featuring a flotilla of 1 , 000 boats that processed down the river on a sevenmile course through the heart of london the police said the event drew more than a million spectators , making it the greatest public spectacle of the 86yearold monarch s reign but elizabeth and philip both remained coatless throughout the pageant , in temperatures that sank into the mid40s , with stiff winds and rain as long as they were visible on the barge s upper deck , neither the queen nor the prince sat during the journey , waving back at the throngs of cheering spectators during the live broadcast of the pageant , commentators questioned the wisdom of exposing the royal couple to the weather conditions prince philip , a former naval officer who has kept slim and generally fit as he has aged , and still active in his favored sport of carriage driving , has had several bouts of illness in recent years , though none that has been described as lifethreatening he was admitted to one of britain s leading heart hospital two days before christmas last year for a minor heart condition , and spent christmas day in the hospital recovering from what was described at the time as an invasive procedure to relieve a blocked coronary artery the procedure , known as coronary stenting , involved pushing a small balloon into the artery and inflating it to remove the blockage , then insert a metal sleeve the stent to keep the artery clear in 2002 , he suffered a previous bladder infection , and in 2008 he was admitted to the king edward hospital for a chronic chest infection on that occasion , he walked into hospital and walked out three days later , with the doctors saying he had made a full recovery on monday , an ambulance was summoned to windsor castle , the queen s residence just west of london near heathrow airport , after palace officials reported that he was feeling unwell the ambulance crew used a chair to help the prince into the ambulance and drove him the 15 miles to the hospital the development meant that prince philip would miss the rest of the jubilee celebrations , but palace officials said the queen would attend the events without him on monday night , a concert was staged outside the front gates of buckingham palace , with 10 , 000 invited guests and tens of thousands of others gathered to watch on big screens erected in several of london s public parks the concert featured some major names in pop , rock and rap music , including elton john , paul mccartney , kylie minogue and jessie j afterward , the queen lighted the last of more than 4 , 000 beacons on hilltops and major landmarks around the country , a way of marking great royal occasions that has been followed in britain since medieval times on tuesday , the queen is to attend a thanksgiving service observing the jubilee at st paul s cathedral in london , an event that will bring the celebrations to their formal close
los angeles the southwest border of beverly hills runs along whitworth drive in some ways , it is impossible to distinguish where that city ends and this sprawling one begins the houses are not drastically different and the lawns are manicured on both sides of the road oh , but that road drive west on whitworth and the car rides like a luxury sedan drive east and it is more like a covered wagon bouncing across a pockmarked prairie there are no snowstorms here the swings in the weather might make those from heartier parts of the country scoff but there are potholes aplenty indeed , on some major streets , every downpour seems to bring another jarring rut in a city where driving takes up an enormous amount of physical and mental energy , it is hardly surprising that the holes in the roads provoke deep irritation , the sort of thing that residents pester the mayor about when they spot him out and about this is a city built with an addiction to the single passenger automobile and people are on every road every day , so we have a daunting task , said mayor , who campaigned on a promise to fix the city s streets with crime down to some of the lowest levels in recent memory , he said , people have to find something to complain about and these days , potholes it is i hear it all the time , he said , and i tell people i got the message we 're fixing the streets for decades , more streets fell into disrepair than were fixed but now , the mayor said with no small amount of pride , the city s streets are not getting worse that has n't happened since , he said of course the standard should be fixing more streets , not just stopping them from falling apart late last year , the mayor floated a plan to spend 750 million over the next several years to fix roughly 1 , 500 miles of streets , far more than the city has been able to do in the past several decades but members of the city council have voiced skepticism over the plan , which they said would cost too much money in 2008 , voters in the county approved a halfcent sales tax to raise 36 billion over three decades to pay for transportation programs the mayor s plan would involve borrowing more money to rapidly improve the streets and repaying it using the city s revenues from the halfcent tax according to a by the , the los angeles metropolitan area had the poorest road quality of any metro area in the country , based on data and reports from local drivers although san diego and san francisco were not far behind the study found that 64 percent of all roads in the los angeles area were poor , and an additional 28 percent were mediocre and residents here pay more annually to repair their vehicles because of the rough roads than any other area in the country it is mystifying , but it s got to be just the constant wear and tear from constant traffic , said john horsley , the executive director of the group everybody is pounding the heck out of the road every day , and that takes a lot out of your streets the study included many roadways that are not within the city s jurisdiction , and officials here say that comparing los angeles with other cities is unfair , since it is so much bigger even keeping up with where potholes do exist is an enormous task , considering the amount of surface the city is responsible for about 6 , 500 miles add up all the lanes , city officials say , and that number balloons to 28 , 000 miles city officials say that despite budget cuts they have done more to improve the streets than any other administration last year , the city filled more than 300 , 000 potholes and spent nearly 100 million on street maintenance , nearly double what the city was spending a decade ago by comparison , the famously affluent city of beverly hills has spent as much as 5 million a year to keep its 110 miles of streets almost perfectly smooth and in what has become something of a winter ritual here , the city has sponsored an annual operation pothole weekend each year , bringing out extra street repair crews as they fill tens of thousands of potholes and pose for the news media cameras but none of this smoothes the clanking , bumpy roads , where a hole is liable to knock over coffee cups on good days and pop tires on bad ones pothole stories are common cocktail party chatter here , with drivers trying to outdo one another with stories about weaving around divots or driving into sudden fractures but jeff millman , a political consultant who lives in mar vista , has yet to find anyone who can match the fiasco he had last spring as he drove east on olympic boulevard , a busy street that cuts through much of the city , he hit a pothole that just obliterated his tire he pulled over and replaced the shredded rubber with his backup from the trunk a few blocks later , he felt an eerily familiar thumppop another tire had been destroyed by another pothole i 've never felt a need to have such a public meltdown , he said , recalling the outrage he unleashed on facebook , where he received plenty of sympathetic replies driving here now is like an offroad experience there are so many bad streets , you just sort of accept the pothole as a status quo during her time on the city council , wendy greuel , the city comptroller who is now running for mayor to succeed mr villaraigosa , was dubbed the pothole queen for doggedly promising to fill every pothole within 48 hours of its being identified by her aide s count , she helped fill more than 164 , 340 potholes these days , she routinely hears voters say that they will vote for anyone who promises to fix wilshire boulevard , one of the city s main thoroughfares that is pockmarked with deep holes it is emblematic of the kind of city we have and we want to have , ms greuel said it sends a message that we care about the big things and the little things and making sure the city is one we can be proud of nazario sauceda , the interim director of street services , said that the city had little choice but to take care of some of the less expensive problems first , so the streets that have the most need for repairs are often at the bottom of the list if i gave you 20 to eat for the next 20 days , would you go to black angus for one night or would you buy 99cent tacos \? he asked we have to do what we need to survive if i only focused on one road , we would only be able to fix 70 miles here , that s like doing nothing
a federal discrimination lawsuit filed on monday against the walt disney company by the american civil liberties union contends that a muslim woman was harassed and unfairly removed from her job after a dispute over her head scarf in response , a disney spokeswoman said its theme parks have a long history of accommodating a variety of religious requests from cast members of all faiths , but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit the suit , filed in united states district court in los angeles , says that imane boudlal , 28 , was called names like terrorist and camel on a weekly if not daily basis during her two years working at the storytellers cafe at the disneyland resort in anaheim , calif ms boudlal reported the harassment in writing to four different managers and none took action , according to the complaint the center of the suit , however , involves ms boudlal s decision to wear a head scarf , or hijab , and the resulting employment options disney gave her the company , citing wardrobe policies intended to suit a theme , offered ms boudlal various hats in keeping with the restaurant s early 1900s theme to wear over the hijab disney , which employs 80 , 000 people at its theme parks in north america , works out solutions to religionrelated attire with some frequency in this manner alternately , ms boudlal was told that she could work backstage out of public view while wearing the head scarf as she pleased ms boudlal , according to the suit , refused , explaining that she found these options humiliating and an infringement of her religious beliefs subsequently , disney removed her from the cafe s schedule , according to the suit in 2010 , after ms boudlal took her complaints to the news media , a disney spokeswoman , suzi brown , linked the accusations of discrimination to a dispute between disney and a hotel worker union over a new contract an email statement from ms brown at the time also offers another view of disney s version we met with ms boudlal on saturday and presented her with several options she asked that the costume be altered those alterations were made and a modified costume was presented to her that meets our costuming guidelines and which we believe provides an accommodation of her religious beliefs we also provided four different roles that she could transition to that would allow her to wear her own hijab she has twice chosen to reject all of the options that we ve presented
beginning tuesday , teams and fans will converge on madison square garden for the 32nd big east conference men s basketball tournament since the conference began using the garden for its annual carnival in 1983 , the tournament has become a popular launching pad for march madness last year , a record 11 men s teams were invited from the big east to the ncaa tournament , and connecticut went on to win the national title but this year s tournament takes place amid volatile conference shifts that make a mockery of geography and threaten the conference s integrity and possibly its very survival the big east was formed as a basketballonly conference in 1979 , and it had a great plan a plan a was dave gavitt s dream of creating a superconference on the east coast philadelphia , new york , boston and washington that would dominate college basketball gavitt s dream became the big east and the big east tournament , which continues to sell out the garden 29 years later there was no plan b rather , no plan f , for football now the conference is paying the price for ignoring the implications of not having bigtime football in its portfolio the conference has become a badluck ship , losing crew members and passengers left and right miami left , boston college left west virginia is leaving , pittsburgh is leaving the most crushing blow of all is that syracuse is leaving west virginia will play in the big 12 , pitt and syracuse in the atlantic coast conference no conference has played better basketball than the big east other conferences have played college basketball longer , but none better in 1985 , the big east had three teams reach the final four , and two played for the national championship , with villanova winning the title success invariably breeds overconfidence this may be why the big east founders were so opposed to having plan b who needed plan b when plan a was working so fabulously \? they did not contemplate a situation in which the big east would be scrambling , in which basketball would n't be enough to sustain the conference i think that people for the most part did n't understand how big and important football was , the former big east commissioner mike tranghese said in a recent interview it really drove the cart if the architects of the conference had known then what they know now , what would they have done differently \? tranghese said in hindsight , you say the league had 20something pretty good years when you look at it , but now with what s going on you look at it in hindsight , i think the question is pretty interesting i do n't know how to answer it for all of the league s success , it now realizes , perhaps too late , that football is king no matter how many cheering fans , no matter how many teams are invited to the ncaa tournament , without a hefty television contract for football , the big east will fall from the ranks of the 1 percent of the college sports elite tranghese tried to tell the big east s university presidents and athletic directors as much as early as 1989 when he was gavitt s assistant gavitt thought the conference needed to bring penn state into the fold penn state was an independent at the time , looking for the security of a conference the membership voted no , with st john s , villanova and georgetown leading the resistance at the end of the meeting , gavitt asked tranghese what he thought about the decision i said , we will all rue the day about this decision , ' tranghese said i understood how big football was i did n't understand how big it was going to become at that point , the big east had so much success in the '80s , everybody sort of forgot about it but i felt looking back on the history of the big east , that was probably the biggest mistake we made penn state joined the big ten in 1989 , and the move immediately set off a tidal wave that in many ways continues today the southeastern conference began talking expansion , the acc began talking expansion and for the first time , syracuse and bc began talking about leaving the big east to find a home in a strong football conference \( they were independents in the sport \) tranghese was hired to follow gavitt in 1990 in 1991 , the big east began playing football the league had no choice it had to look at football or break up the conference presidents commissioned a study to determine whether the big east should stay intact or disband the turmoil in the college football establishment was cresting you were in or you were out the big east had taken in miami to get the bigname football program it desperately needed now there was pressure to take on more footballplaying universities rutgers , west virginia , virginia tech the study recommend that the big east stay together tranghese had misgivings even then i do n't think they envisioned any idea of all this jumping around taking place , he said i thought at that point , our league should have given very serious consideration to separating , tranghese said from where i was sitting , the difficulty of keeping everything together some people playing football , some people not playing football was a challenge the big east added rutgers and west virginia in 1995 , virginia tech in 2000 big east basketball remained solid , but football was mostly a quagmire of mediocrity as it is today when the conference began to negotiate a new television contract , miami was on probation , so we got hammered , tranghese said miami and boston college decided to leave in 2003 their departures , and eventually that of virginia tech , were devastating for me , it s the worst thing i 've ever been through , tranghese said it was n't fun i saw a lot of people who were hurt by it people s existence in athletics was being threatened , and i just was n't willing to go through that again tranghese retired in 2009 he knew there would be more expansion and did n't want to go through it i knew it was coming the handwriting was on the wall , he said i did n't know if it was going to be a day , a week or a month , but i knew it was coming and i just refused to sit there and go through it again the big east will negotiate a new television contract next year even before pittsburgh and syracuse announced that they would be leaving for the acc , the big east s tv contract lagged behind the acc , pacific12 , big ten , big 12 and sec packages the losses of syracuse and pitt were more devastating than the boston college and miami departures that was a tremendous blow , tranghese said syracuse has been at the heart of big east basketball i have watched jim boeheim coach , and i ca n't even comprehend jim coaching in the acc it s like a foreign thought to be honest with you , my fondest hope is i 'd love to see syracuse win the national championship and jim get the heck out because i hope he never coaches a game in that league not only that , boeheim may be on the bench in madison square garden as an acc coach there was talk among acc officials about holding a future tournament at the garden who knows how much of that is trashtalking dancing on the big east shield and how much is legitimate market share now that boston college , syracuse and pittsburgh are in the acc fold what a nasty business while the adults who oversee this multibilliondollar enterprise preach sportsmanship to young athletes , the backroom business is more predatory than ever maybe eventually , there will be a backward revolution where people wind up being with people where there is some geographic sense to it all , tranghese said it just seems that there s this arms race to get bigger and more powerful sports mirrors real life
four years before he died , the austrian novelist and playwright thomas bernhard wrote one of his funniest works , a bitter comic tale of a musicologist named reger who has spent every other day for 30 years visiting the same room at the kunsthistorisches museum in vienna , planting himself on the same settee and looking at the same portrait , by tintoretto such is reger s devotion to his ritual that he meets the woman who will become his wife while contemplating the painting , and he maintains an almost familial relationship with an old guard , who brings him the occasional glass of water and prevents other museumgoers from entering the room when he wants to be alone i am not really crazy , reger insists to a friend i am just a person of extraordinary habits , a person with one extraordinary habit , to wit the extraordinary habit of going to the kunsthistorisches museum every other day for the past 30 years and of sitting on the bordone room settee i have n't gone quite so far around the bend yet , but for about a decade now i 've kept up a more or less regular appointment of my own with a single painting an intensely dark , brooding scene at the depicting st peter s denial of christ the met bought the in 1997 , and one of the things that drew me to the work was that it did n't immediately announce what it was a , only the second to enter the museum s permanent collection and one of fewer than a dozen on public view in the united states the denial of st peter has little of caravaggio s lyrical naturalism and none of the louche , sloeeyed characters who people his early paintings like its lively baroque gallery roommate , painted 15 years earlier , in 1595 in the bestknown works darkness and light wage a battle cinematic enough to warm the heart of cecil b demille in st peter , completed in the torturous last months of caravaggio s violent life , darkness almost carries the day , rendered in fast and sketchy strokes a terminally raw and ragged thing , as andrew grahamdixon describes the painting , with maybe only a little hyperbole , in his 2010 biography , caravaggio a life sacred and profane curators have long lamented how little time museum patrons spend in front of works a 2001 study by the met found the median viewing time to be only 17 seconds and so i would love to say that i formed a conviction to make the caravaggio my pilgrimage site in order to nobly embody the preinternet virtues of long looking , of allowing meaning to accrue over time the truth is that my job as an art reporter takes me to the met with great \( and pleasing \) regularity , and every time i make my way through the european galleries , i seem to end up passing the painting and stopping short in front of its pile of shadows eventually i came to remember exactly where the painting was , and after an interview , before heading to the subway , i got into the habit of making a beeline for it , almost sheepishly , like somebody at a party snubbing all the guests except the one he really wants to talk to i 'd shoot painfully past , one of my favorites , past and past bruegel s , eternally eating their lunchtime porridge i 'd hang a left at van dyck s , ignore rubens altogether , and by the time i got to and his gloriously torqued back , i 'd know i was almost there the next gallery , filled mostly with caravaggio and his followers , is never crowded , even with my failure to enlist a guard to keep people out st peter often hangs in a corner , unfolding its story in uncomfortable closeup , like a passion play presented in a broom closet to the right , peter , haggard , balding , his eyes rimmed with tears to the far left a guard of the high priest caiaphas , barely visible in the gloom of a nighttime courtyard in the middle peter s accuser , one of the high priest s maids , who , according to the , identifies him to the guard as a follower of jesus on the wall , the painting is even muddier than in reproductions most of the light comes weakly over the guard s right shoulder , falling on peter , who makes a universal gesture of blamelessness , turning both hands toward his chest , as if protesting at that moment me \? i'm telling you , you 've got the wrong fisherman for years when i visited the painting i looked mostly at peter , at his expression of simultaneous deception and defeat but the longer i looked , the more it seemed to me that the saint as the symbolic embodiment of the human frailty and faith that underpin roman catholic doctrine was not the lead actor in the drama it was the maid , whose eyes , catching the light with pinpoint reflections , somehow become the painting s center her eyes seem to have come unfocused , and she s not looking at the guard she is facing but looking momentarily inward whatever precise counterreformation doctrine the painting was once trying to expound , it is the maid s hesitation and humanity in the moment of accusation that , to me , now remain as the painting s subject and its power whether this has any historical justification , or whether it is what a brokendown caravaggio , near the end of his tooshort life , intended , no longer makes much difference to me one result of looking at a painting so long that you can see it in your mind s eye is that it does , in a very real sense , become your own , not quite the same painting that anyone else will see another result is that you feel bereft , in a very real sense , if it s not there the painting is now on loan until next spring when i rushed into the gallery the other day and found it missing , it was as if a close friend had disappeared into the witness protection program in bernhard s old masters , reger stares at his tintoretto year after year partly trying to tear it down , to cheer himself with the thought that there is no perfection in the world , even in a masterpiece he also fears being right beware of penetrating into a work of art , he said , you will ruin each and every one for yourself , even those you love most maybe , but it s a risk i 'd advise anyone to take at a decade and counting with caravaggio , i have n't managed to make as much as a dent
we have spent our careers as filmmakers making the case that the news media in the united states often fail to inform americans about the uglier actions of our own government we therefore have been deeply grateful for the accomplishments of wikileaks , and applaud ecuador s decision to grant diplomatic asylum to its founder , julian assange , who is now living in the ecuadorean embassy in london ecuador has acted in accordance with important principles of international human rights indeed , nothing could demonstrate the appropriateness of ecuador s action more than the british government s threat to violate a sacrosanct principle of diplomatic relations and invade the embassy to arrest mr assange since wikileaks' founding , it has revealed the collateral murder footage that shows the seemingly indiscriminate killing of baghdad civilians by a united states apache attack helicopter further finegrained detail about the true face of the iraq and afghanistan wars united states collusion with yemen s dictatorship to conceal our responsibility for bombing strikes there the obama administration s pressure on other nations not to prosecute bushera officials for torture and much more predictably , the response from those who would prefer that americans remain in the dark has been ferocious top elected leaders from both parties have called mr assange a hightech terrorist and senator dianne feinstein , the california democrat who leads the senate select committee on intelligence , has demanded that he be prosecuted under the espionage act most americans , britons and swedes are unaware that sweden has not formally charged mr assange with any crime rather , it has issued a warrant for his arrest to question him about allegations of sexual assault in 2010 all such allegations must be thoroughly investigated before mr assange moves to a country that might put him beyond the reach of the swedish justice system but it is the british and swedish governments that stand in the way of an investigation , not mr assange swedish authorities have traveled to other countries to conduct interrogations when needed , and the wikileaks founder has made clear his willingness to be questioned in london moreover , the ecuadorean government made a direct offer to sweden to allow mr assange to be interviewed within ecuador s embassy in both instances , sweden refused mr assange has also committed to traveling to sweden immediately if the swedish government pledges that it will not extradite him to the united states swedish officials have shown no interest in exploring this proposal , and foreign minister carl bildt recently told a legal adviser to mr assange and wikileaks unequivocally that sweden would not make such a pledge the british government would also have the right under the relevant treaty to prevent mr assange s extradition to the united states from sweden , and has also refused to pledge that it would use this power ecuador s attempts to facilitate that arrangement with both governments were rejected taken together , the british and swedish governments' actions suggest to us that their real agenda is to get mr assange to sweden because of treaty and other considerations , he probably could be more easily extradited from there to the united states to face charges mr assange has every reason to fear such an outcomethe justice department recently confirmed that it was continuing to investigate wikileaks , and justdisclosed australian government documents from this past february state that the us investigation into possible criminal conduct by mr assange has been ongoing for more than a year wikileaks itself has published emails from stratfor , a private intelligence corporation , which state that a grand jury has already returned a and history indicates sweden would buckle to any pressure from the united states to hand over mr assange in 2001 the swedish government delivered two egyptians seeking asylum to the cia , which rendered them to the mubarak regime , which tortured them if mr assange is extradited to the united states , the consequences will reverberate for years around the world mr assange is not an american citizen , and none of his actions have taken place on american soil if the united states can prosecute a journalist in these circumstances , the governments of russia or china could , by the same logic , demand that foreign reporters anywhere on earth be extradited for violating their laws the setting of such a precedent should deeply concern everyone , admirers of wikileaks or not we urge the people of britain and sweden to demand that their governments answer some basic questions why do the swedish authorities refuse to question mr assange in london \? and why can neither government promise that mr assange will not be extradited to the united states \? the citizens of britain and sweden have a rare opportunity to make a stand for free speech on behalf of the entire globe
this week millions of chreasters americans who attend church only on christmas and easter will crowd into pews to sing carols and renew their vague relationship with the christian god this year , there may be fewer chreasters than ever a growing number of nones live in our midst those who say they have no religious affiliation at all an october pew research center poll revealed that they now account for 20 percent of the population , up from 16 percent in 2008 avoiding church does not excuse americans from marking the birth of jesus , however most of us have no choice but to stay home from work or school and if you complain about this glaring exception to the separation between church and state , you must be a scrooge with no heart for tradition christmas has been a federal holiday for  yet christianity s preferential place in our culture and civil law came under fire this year , and not simply because more americans reject institutional religion the obama administration subtly worked to expand the scope of protected civil rights to include access to legal marriage and birth control catholic bishops and evangelical activists declared that washington was running roughshod over religious liberty and abandoning the country s founding values , while their opponents accused them of imposing one set of religious prejudices on an increasingly pluralistic population the christian consensus that long governed our public square is disintegrating american secularism is at a crossroads the narrative on the right is this once upon a time , americans honored the lord , and he commissioned their nation to welcome all faiths while commanding them to uphold christian values but in recent decades , the supreme court ruled against prayer in public schools , and legalized abortion , while politicians declared war on christmas and kowtowed to the homosexual lobby conservative activists insist that they protest these developments not to defend special privileges for christianity , but to respect the founders' desire for universal religious liberty rooted , they say , in the christian tradition the controversial activist david barton has devoted his career to popularizing this forgotten history through lectures , books and homeschool curriculums mr barton that biblical christianity in america produced many of the cherished traditions still enjoyed today , including protection for religious toleration and the rights of conscience bryan fischer , spokesman for the american family association , told me that he saw the nones as proof that the foundations of our culture are crumbling the pew poll , he said , is one of the signs a couple of weeks after we spoke , he a radio audience that god did not protect the children killed in the newtown , conn , massacre because of the supreme court decisions banning prayer and bible reading in public schools god is not going to go where he is not wanted , mr fischer said how accurate is this story of decline into godlessness \? is america , supposedly god s last bastion in the western world , rejecting faith and endangering religious liberty \? the truth is that nones are nothing new religion has been a feature of human society since times , but so has religious indifference our illusions of the past as a golden age of faith tend to cloud our assessment of today s religious landscape we think of atheism and religious apathy as uniquely modern spiritual options , ideas that voltaire and hume devised in a coffee house one rainy afternoon sometime in the 18th century before the enlightenment , legend has it , peasants hurried to church every week and princes bowed and scraped before priests historians have yet to unearth pew studies from the 13th century , but it is safe to say that we frequently overestimate medieval piety ordinary people often skipped church and had a feeble grasp of basic christian dogma many priests barely understood the latin they chanted and many parishes lacked any priest at all bishops complained about towns that used their cathedrals mainly as indoor markets or granaries lest protestants blame this irreverence on catholic corruption , the evidence suggests that it continued after martin luther nailed his theses to the wittenberg church door in 1584 , census takers in antwerp discovered that the city had of nones than 21stcentury america a full third of residents claimed no religious affiliation when conservative activists claim that america stands apart from godless europe , they are not entirely wrong the colonies were relatively unchurched , but european visitors to the early republic marveled at americans' fervent piety alexis de tocqueville in 1840 that the absence of an established state church nurtured a society in which christian sects are infinitely diversified and perpetually modified but christianity itself is a fact so irresistibly established that no one undertakes either to attack or to defend it de tocqueville visited during a wave of religious revival , but he underestimated the degree to which some americans held christianity at arm s length the abraham lincoln declined to join a church , and his wife spiritualists to hold s ances in the white house nevertheless , america s rates of church affiliation have long been higher than those of europe perhaps because of the first amendment , which permitted a religious free market that encouraged innovation and competition between spiritual entrepreneurs yet membership , as every exasperated parson knows , is not the same as showing up on sunday morning rates of church attendance have never been as sterling as the christian right s fable of national decline suggests before the civil war , regular attendance probably never exceeded 30 percent , rising to a high of 40 percent around 1965 and declining to under 30 percent in recent years even as 77 percent still identify as christians and 69 percent say they are very or moderately religious , according to a 2012 survey we know , then , that the good old days were not so good after all , even in god s new israel today s spiritual independents are not unprecedented what is new is their increasing visibility i like the fact that we 're getting more nones' because it helps christians realize that they 're different , stanley hauerwas , a protestant theologian at duke divinity school , said when i asked for his thoughts on the pew poll that s a crucial development america produces people that say , i believe jesus is lord , but that s just my personal opinion' the temple of my personal opinion may be the real established church in modern america three decades ago , one none named sheila larson told the sociologist robert bellah and his collaborators that she called her faith sheilaism just my own little voice americans are drifting out of the grip of institutionalized religion , just as they are drifting from institutional authority in general this trend , made famous by books like robert putnam s , has encouraged both the theological mushiness of those who say they are spiritual , not religious as well as the unfiltered fury that has come to characterize both ends of the political spectrum it seems like we live in a manichaean universe , with vitriolic extremes , said kathryn lofton , associate professor of american studies and religious studies at yale that s not unrelated to the lack of tempering authority religious authority' is no longer clergy in the pulpit saying vote for eisenhower , ' but forwarded url links or gossip exchanges in chat rooms there is no referee for a very long time , protestant leaders were those referees if individual impiety flourished in centuries past , churches still wielded significant control over civic culture the symbols , standards and sexual mores that most of the populace respected in public , if not always in private today , more and more americans openly accept extramarital sex , homosexuality and other outrages to traditional christian morality they question the protestant civil religion that has undergirded our common life for so long the idea of protestant civil religion sounds strange in a country that prides itself on secularism and religious tolerance however , america s religious free market has never been entirely free the founding fathers prized freedom of conscience , but they did not intend to purge society of protestant influence \( they had deep suspicions of catholicism \) most believed that churches helped to restrain the excesses of mob democracy since then , theology has shaped american laws regarding marriage , public oaths and the bounds of free speech for most of our history , the loudest defenders of the separation of church and state were not rogue atheists , but protestants worried about catholics seeking financing for parochial schools or scheming their way into public office to take orders only from mitered masters in rome activists on both the left and the right tend to forget this irony of the first amendment it has been as much a weapon of religious oppression as a safeguard for liberty in the 19th and early 20th century , when public school teachers read from a protestant translation of the bible in class , many americans saw benign reinforcement of american values if catholic parents complained , officials told them that their roman dogma was their own private concern the underlying logic here was not religious neutrality the protestant bias of the american public sphere has mellowed over time , but it still depends on christian secularism , said elizabeth shakman hurd , a political scientist at northwestern university this is a political stance premised on a chiefly protestant notion of religion understood as private assent to a set of propositional beliefs , she told me other traditions , such as judaism and islam and to some degree catholicism , do not frame faith in such rationalist terms , or accept the same distinction between internal conviction and public argument the very idea that it is possible to cordon off personal religious beliefs from a secular town square depends on protestant assumptions about what counts as religion , even if we now mask these sectarian foundations with labels like judeochristian conservative christian activists hold those sectarian foundations more dearly than they admit , and they are challenging the obama administration s efforts to frame access to contraception and samesex marriage as civil rights immune to the veto of private conscience alan sears , president of the legal advocacy organization alliance defending freedom , sees an unprecedented threat to religious liberty in the harsh fines facing employers who refuse to cover contraception in their insurance programs it is a death penalty it is a radical change , he told me it s one thing when you 're debating about public space , but it s another when you say , if you do n't surrender your conscience , you 're out of business barry lynn , the director of americans united for separation of church and state \( an organization that until 1972 was named , tellingly , protestants and other americans united for separation of church and state \) , sees things differently he worries about what might happen if an unpredictable supreme court agrees to hear conservative christians' challenges to the contraception mandate , or their pleas for for charities that accept federal grants but discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring the court could create something vastly more dangerous than corporate free speech a corporate conscience' claim , mr lynn , a lawyer and an ordained minister , told me these cases could become as significant for the redefinition of religious liberty as roe v wade was a rearticulation of the right to privacy these legal efforts are less an attempt to redefine religious liberty than a campaign to preserve christians' historic right to police the boundary between secular principles and religious beliefs only now that conservative christians have less control over organs of public power , they cannot rely on the political process now that the nones are declaring themselves , and more americans including many christians see birth control as a medical necessity rather than a sin , mr sears sees a stark course of action for the catholic and evangelical business owners he represents litigation is all that our clients have their problem , however , is more fundamental than legal precedent their problem is that america s christian consensus is fragmenting we are left groping for something far messier an evolving , thisworldly , compromise
so , looking at the most emailed list , i think we can safely conclude that times readers are suffering from postelection burnout all they seem to want to read about is food which is fine ! but i wanted to share some thoughts provoked by ross douthat s column today , which makes a very good point namely , that the winning obama coalition did not for the most part consist of forwardlooking , nprlistening , culturally adventurous liberals instead , the big numbers came from groups unified by economic fear indeed single women , hispanics , and , as always , africanamericans are for a stronger welfare state because people like them need the security such a welfare state can provide where i would part ways with ross is in his suggestions that \( a \) rising insecurity reflects social disintegration and that \( b \) turning to the welfare state is a dead end the truth is that while single women and members of minority groups are more insecure at any given point of time than married whites , insecurity is on the rise for everyone , driven by changes in the economy our industrial structure is probably less stable than it was you can t count on today s big corporations to survive , let alone retain their dominance , over the course of a working lifetime and the traditional accoutrements of a good job a definedbenefit pension plan , a good healthcare plan have been going away across the board every time you read someone extolling the dynamism of the modern economy , the virtues of risktaking , declaring that everyone has to expect to have multiple jobs in his or her life and that you can never stop learning , etc , , etc , bear in mind that this is a portrait of an economy with no stability , no guarantees that hard work will provide a consistent living , and a constant possibility of being thrown aside simply because you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and nothing people can do in their personal lives or behavior can change this your church and your traditional marriage won t guarantee the value of your 401 \( k \) , or make insurance affordable on the individual market so here s the question isn t this exactly the kind of economy that should have a strong welfare state \? isn t it much better to have guaranteed health care and a basic pension from social security rather than simply hanker for the corporate safety net that no longer exists \? might one not even argue that a bit of basic economic security would make our dynamic economy work better , by reducing the fear factor \? now , none of this will bring back traditional mores but that s really a different issue in sweden , more than half of children are born out of wedlock but they don t seem to suffer much as a result , perhaps because the welfare state is so strong maybe we ll go that way too so \? anyway , ross is quite right to point out that the obama coalition is in large part a response to fear instead of , or as well as , hope but that s ok
throughout this year , as fighting intensified in syria and antigovernment fighters grew in numbers and in strength , it had seemed inevitable that they would acquire heatseeking shoulderfired missiles and turn them against the syrian military aircraft this blog had documented the partbypart appearance in rebel hands of one old heatseeking system , known as the sa7 since midsummer there have been occasional sightings of full systems but none , as far as we know , showing the system in actual use two videos recently posted on youtube suggest that what had been expected is now occurring the first video , embedded below and posted today , shows what would appear to be a twoman hunterkiller team with an sa7 , waiting for an aircraft from hiding behind a building matthew schroeder , an analyst who covers missile proliferation and the arms trade at the federation of american scientists in washington , noted the glint of the missile s seeker head , so the missile is in the tube this , along with the visible battery and grip stock , indicates that the system is completethe man with the sa7 does not loiter he is soon picked up by another man on a light motorcycle the second video shows what appears to be a weapon of the same class being fired at a passing fixedwing jet the video is not perfect and it is not possible in the jerky and grainy video to determine which type of missile is in use , but at about 2 02 its audio seems to capture the sound of a missile s launching and then shows the telltale corkscrew signature of the weapon through the air the missile appears to miss and from here things become less clear it is possible that the video shows lingering flares from the area where the missile traveled in flight this might be the signature of a countermeasure system in the targeted aircraft , which dumped the flares to confuse and thwart the missile s seeker head these videos were shared this morning with the new york times by damien spleeters \( damspleet \) , a belgian arms researcher and an occasional contributor to at war  mr spleeters has set up and maintains a map of sightings of manportable airdefense systems , or manpads \( to use the security world s clunky acronym \) in syria this has become something of an internet trap line for missile sightings , and a reader that mr spleeters does not know , mads dahl \( massdall \) , alerted him to these new videos the videos have not been verified their contents cannot be readily confirmed but they do appear authentic and to show what analysts have expected to see for some time evidence of manpads in use by syria s rebels a few points of context can help decipher what the sightings might mean first , the sa7 is an old system many commentators tend to say that because it is old , its battery might lack adequate charge to activate the system , acquire a target and initiate the launching in other words , old sa7s might not fire that may be so , but there is ample evidence that many old sa7s do in fact fire , as was seen last year in libya , where sa7s from the 1980s were captured by fighters opposed to col muammar elqaddafi and fired several times while battery life is an issue worth considering , a more relevant issue for the conflict might be the capabilities of the weapon the sa7 is an early soviet entrant into the manpads field it is a dated system , it can be employed from a narrower engagement window than a more uptodate system , and it is vulnerable to countermeasures these systems are generally regarded as being less effective against modern military jets than they are against helicopters , or , for that matter , civilian aircraft the above reasons are among many reasons why aviation security circles worry intensely over the potential spread of sa7s from any nation that holds them , and why many western countries have encouraged militaries to consider destroying the old stock after all , what value to a modern state is a weapon that has limited utility in war , but could be a terrible weapon for a terrorist or inexperienced guerrilla who turns an sa7 toward a lumbering passenger jet \? second , manpads are not the only means of bringing down aircraft many heavy machine guns were designed for this purpose , and can work well against lowerelevation targets , as has been seen at the abu ad duhur air base and in this video , which shows , at 0 22 , a helicopter assuming the glide path of a pallet of cement blocks after apparently being struck on a rotor by a machinegun round
this is the second in a  and he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark on their right hand , or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell , save that he had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name revelation , xiii 16 , 17 have you ever seen herman melville s passport \? this was a question from judy rascoe , a screenwriter and a wellread friend i had to admit that i had not i had not even thought about the question of whether melville needed a passport it had just never entered my head several emails later judy directed me to a web site that provides 19thcentury passports and passport applications included is a facsimile of herman melville s passport application , dated oct 1 , 1849 there is no photograph accompanying the application \( even though daguerreotypes and tintypes had been around for nearly a decade \) i was puzzled how can a customs official or a border control agent know that the person standing before him is really herman melville and not someone else \? or am i missing the point \? perhaps the passport isn t used for identification perhaps it is only a formality more like a letter of introduction but if proof of identity is of no importance , then why include personal details at all \? melville writes in his application , included are the items of personal description which i trust will prove sufficient height 5 ft 10 1 8 1 eyes blue hair dark brown mouth medium nose medium prominent complexion fair age 30 years forehead medium chin ordinary face oval were these selfreported measurements deemed sufficient \? today , they would be rejected out of hand 2 face oval \? chin ordinary \? what does that tell us \? how were people able to prove their identity to others before the advent of photography and fingerprinting \? melville s passport raises all kinds of questions did people accept his identity on trust \? were customs officials simply making do with written descriptions because nothing better was available \? there are problems with selfreporting are we the best judges of our own physical characteristics \? if someone wanted to dissemble or hide from others his true identity , couldn t he provide selfserving and misleading information \? how do we make the measure of man more objective \? how can it be standardized \? and how can we be assured that we are providing a unique identification \? after all , even if melville had recorded his height correctly , he was not the only man with an ordinary chin , ovalshaped face and blue eyes he is the only man who wrote benito cereno but it s not clear how that detail would serve at a border crossing alphonse bertillon , who worked as a records clerk in a parisian police department , had these issues in mind when he started assembling physical data about criminals the bertillon system , or bertillonage , as it became known \( or anthropometry , or signaletics \) , consisted of a series of measurements that would uniquely identify an individual unlike melville s passport application , selfreporting was eliminated instead , a series of elaborate measurements were taken with specialized equipment used under standardized conditions 3 initially , it was believed that these measurements alone would be sufficient , but photographs were later added a frontal portrait and profile surely , in conjunction with a photograph these measurements would be even more reliable the bertillon system was introduced in 1882 fingerprinting had been around in one form or another before , but by world war i , they were competing systems part of the difficulty of deciding on the efficacy of one over the other hinged on the retrieval of information how do you classify fingerprints so that an unknown fingerprint can be efficiently matched with a card in a file \? 4 the cataloging of fingerprints at first glance seems to be subjective exactly what counts as a match between two prints \? the bertillon system , in comparison , is straightforward you have numerical data on a card , and you are able to catalog the data in a simple and straightforward manner and when photography became part of the bertillon system , the card presented photographs alongside the precise bertillon measurement of height , etc francis galton , the father of eugenics and eventually a champion of fingerprinting , allowed himself to be memorialized on a bertillon card with both a frontal photographic portrait and a profile but the bertillon measurements were never filled in photographs were used by the police as early as the 1840s 5 6 by midcentury , collections of photographs were assembled by various police departments in what became known as rogues galleries 7 professional criminals of america , written by thomas byrnes , inspector of police and chief of detectives in new york city , and published in 1886 , is a perfect example of such a rogues gallery it explains why photography is an indispensable aid in the unique identification of criminals 8 to the trained observer , the photograph provides essential details a criminal can try to disguise his appearance before the camera , but the photograph sees through all of that to telling physical details and facial quirks that cannot be fully concealed byrnes compares these features to the mark of cain 9 the very cleverest hands at preparing a false physiognomy for the camera have made their grimaces in vain the sun has been too quick for them , and has imprisoned the lines of the profile and the features and caught the expression before it could be disguised there is not a portrait here but has some marked characteristic by which you can identify the man who sat for it that is what has to be studied in the rogues gallery detail they have made their grimaces in vain a photograph captures something unique about a person try as hard as they might , criminals cannot hide or disguise their identity and if photographs alone provide unique identification , what about photography and bertillonage \? surely , that would be even better and then as the legend goes , on may 1 , 1903 , a young man named will west was admitted to fort leavenworth prison on manslaughter charges 10 a few days later he was brought into the office of the record clerk to be measured and photographed the clerk thought that he recognized west , though west protested in the bestknown account of this story , published in 1918 by the forensics pioneers harris hawthorne wilder and bert wentworth , the following exchange is reported you have been here before \? no , sir , answered west but as the clerk was positive , he ran his measuring instruments over him , and from the bertillon measurements thus obtained , went to the file , and returned with the card the measurements called for , properly filled out and bearing the name , william west this card was shown to the prisoner , who grinned in amazement , and said , that s my picture , but i don t know where you got it , for i know i have never been here before the record clerk turned the card over , and read the particulars there given , including the statements that this man was already a prisoner at the same institution , having been committed to a life sentence on september 9 , 1901 , for the crime of murder that is , the card found was that of a different man , still within the walls of that very prison , yet of the same name , the same facial expression , and practically the same bertillon measurements as the newcomer ! it then dawned on all present that there were two will wests , and that here was a case of the most remarkable resemblance of two unrelated persons on record since neither the photographs or the bertillon measurements were of any avail in establishing the identity of these two men the clerk writes that , with their hats on , it is almost impossible to tell these two men apart 11 bertillonage and photography had failed to adequately discriminate between the two wests their names were similar well , more than similar isn t will an abbreviation of william \? their photographs and bertillon measurements were identical \( almost \) and they looked like the same person , or at worst , like identical twins it became the stuff of legend everything about these two men matched , except , as the story goes , for the ink patterns left on paper when they were fingerprinted sure enough , despite the similarity of appearance , of names , and of their bertillon measurements , the fingerprints of will west and william west were completely different an inside whorl of 11 ridges \( will \) vs an invaded loop with 18 ridges \( william \) many subsequent accounts attribute the rise of fingerprinting and the fall of bertillon measurements to this confusion between one west and the other but others suggest that the story is fable , not fact 12 i discussed the story of the wests with simon cole , an associate professor of criminology at the university of california , irvine cole is also the author of suspect identities a history of fingerprinting and criminal identification \( harvard university press , 2002 \) , the definitive work on the triumph of fingerprinting \( or dactyloscopy \) over bertillonage cole s dissent from the etiological myth of the two will wests debunking bertillonage stems from his observation that the men were in fact distinguishable under the bertillon system the 7cm difference in foot length is outside bertillon s maximum tolerable deviation for saying two sets of measurements derived from the same body simon cole the story of the two wests is in all the accounts of the development of fingerprinting , including the fbi tour and the fbi s little pamphlets on the history of identification it is one of these myths that appear everywhere , every encyclopedia article , every standard history and they all tell this same story that i trace back to wilder and wentworth errol morris yes but then i read that the two wests william and will were not influential in making the change from bertillonage to fingerprinting in fact you make the point simon cole right it took another 20 years , but it has become part of the founding myth of fingerprinting for a reason here you have this case study in which these guys looked the same , their bertillon measurements were the same , and fingerprints distinguished them errol morris yes it was a sales tool for the promotion of fingerprinting simon cole yes and then , the fact that they turned out to be africanamericans seems not entirely accidental wilder himself had perpetuated the idea in his own writings about who should be fingerprinted it s all negroes and chinese essentially , immigrants and people who aren t subject to anthropometry so it is both a founding myth for fingerprinting and its implications for race , and that it somehow debunked bertillonage  13 errol morris so , wait a second it is an origin myth for fingerprinting how fingerprinting won out over anthropometry , but it was created 20 years after the fact \? simon cole i don t have the smoking gun as to why it was created but look at wilder s own history with this wilder starts out very skeptical of fingerprinting and claiming that anthropometry is the real scientific system fingerprinting is an expedient if you re doing something considered to be lowlevel , like identifying chinese immigrants but if you re identifying white criminals in new york , you need the better system , which is anthropometry and over the course of 20 years , he reverses himself on that position he becomes converted to fingerprinting errol morris why \? simon cole probably cost reasons fingerprinting puts the cost on the back end it s cheap to take fingerprints , and a little bit more expensive to classify them , whereas bertillonage is just the opposite it s expensive to take the measurements , because you have to train people and keep them disciplined and consistent , and working efficiently to take the measurements and then , once you ve got them , the costs go down also , familiarity police agencies became more familiar with it and , as police agencies started using it , it seemed to function ok the sense of it as less efficient and promising than bertillonage wore off errol morris but was photography ever considered \? or is this just something that had a kind of brief vogue , mid19th century \? simon cole yeah around 190002 , when people like wilder are saying use anthropometry , and fingerprinting is just coming over from europe and the police chief of san francisco , fh depue , says , no , no , use photographs there were systems floating around , where you would impose a grid over the face , and you would somehow quantify the information in the photograph the reason not to use photographs was ok , there s lots of information there but how do i classify it \? how do i put it in order \? bertillon talks about ok , you have a pile of photographs that s nice now what do you do with them \? what order do you put them in , so you know how to retrieve the correct photograph when you re trying to match it to a face \? errol morris right simon cole and , although i don t have much sense as to how these things were supposed to work , it s clear that people were thinking about a system of grids over the face you would come up with some kind of indexing an indexing system is probably the best thing to call it , rather than a classification system what you want is some way of finding a photograph of a face , if that face should appear again there s a moment when they re proposing fingerprinting chinese immigrants in the 1880s and they write to the immigration bureau in washington , dc , and they say photography is fine so there is this moment where photography is seen as a truer and more useful record than a fingerprint and even as late as 1902 , you have depue saying that as well but the real problem was the indexing system , and it is still the problem with facial recognition systems as an identification tool there are a lot of advantages to facial recognition because you can do it surreptitiously , and people don t have to cooperate but the face becomes a difficult thing to classify and convert into quantitative information you end up just measuring the distances between features , and it s just not the most discriminating kind of measurement , compared with irises or fingerprints or dna the fbi history of identification \( as quoted by simon cole \) concludes it would be hard to conceive a more nearly perfect case for refuting the claims of rival systems of identification although the two wests denied being related , there was a facial resemblance like that of twin brothers the formulas derived from their bertillon measurements were nearly identical and , finally , there was the crowning coincidence of the similarity of names the fallibility of three systems of personal identification names , photographs and bertillon measurements were demonstrated by this one case on the other hand , the value of fingerprints as a positive means of identifying people was dramatically shown 14 the story of the two wests may not have been the deciding factor in the ascendancy of fingerprints , but it showed how fingerprinting could provide a more effective solution to the problem of unique identification 15 names , photographs and bertillon measurements bertillon measurements are a series of descriptions \( or properties \) , much like the descriptions that accompany melville s passport application in 1849 admittedly , they are not selfreported , but they seem contingent , variable isn t there such a thing as a swollen foot , or a goiter , or some other physical malady that changes the circumference of a neck or an instep \? and what assurance do we have that we ve identified only one , unique individual the will william west problem \? what are we grabbing ahold of with these descriptions \? photographs seem to have similar problems a photograph may not resemble a person immediately after it s taken , let alone years after the fact , even though it is still a photograph of that person wilder and wentworth supply just such an example the photograph on the left was taken of frank murray in toronto in november 1908 the photograph on the right was taken of frank murray in old town , me , in december 1909 roughly a year apart the prints of the left middle finger were taken at the same times as the photographs it is still frank murray \( the same man \) over a year later , although his appearance is conspicuously different 16 again , we are left with several questions 17 1 if we are in possession of a photograph of a man , how do we know that a man appearing before us in the flesh is the man in that photograph \? \( how do we attach a photograph to the person who has been photographed \? \) 18 2 how do we know the man in the photograph is frank murray \? \( how do we attach a name to a person in a photograph \? \) 3 does a photograph uniquely identify an individual , eg , frank murray \? and if a photograph doesn t uniquely identify an individual , then what does \? fingerprints \? wilder and wentworth conclude with a series of arguments against sight recognition the extraordinary resemblance between two individuals second , the great amount of change in appearance of which a single individual is capable third , the known unreliability of eyes , memory , and judgment under the influence of excitement , fear , or other mental emotion the outcome of the inquiry is plainly and irrefutably this sight recognition is not identification  their conclusion only fingerprinting is reliable wilder and wentworth s book ends with a quote from bertillon , to fix the human personality , to give to each human being a definite individuality , durable , unchangeable , always recognizable and easily demonstrable such seems the most comprehensible object of the new method 19 sir francis galton s classic work on fingerprinting , finger prints , first appeared in 1892 let no one despise the ridges on account of their smallness , for they are in some respects the most important of all anthropological data we shall see that they form patterns , considerable in size and of a curious variety of shape , whose boundaries can be firmly outlined , and which are little worlds in themselves galton showed that these little worlds retain their character through a person s life and he clearly shows how even a child s fingerprints retain their peculiarities from two years to 15 years old as galton writes , fingerprints have the unique merit of retaining all their peculiarities unchanged throughout life , and afford in consequence an incomparably surer criterion of identity than any other bodily feature galton was so enamored of ridges and unique identification that he felt it necessary to offer an emendation to the biblical story of jezebel , wife of ahab , who turns him against the hebrew god , yahweh , and toward the worship of the false phoenician god , baal we read of the dead body of jezebel being devoured by the dogs in jezreel , so that no man might say , this is jezebel , and that the dogs left only her skull , the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet but the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet are the very remains by which a corpse might be surely identified , if impressions of them , made during life , were available francis galton , finger prints , 113 in the biblical account , god wants to insure that no man can identify jezebel , although he may be possibly misinformed about the utility of palm prints and sole impressions in postmortem identifications gustave dor illustrated the scene mark twain was clearly aware of galton s landmark work , and in pudd nhead wilson which appeared just a couple of years later , in 1894 he used these little worlds in themselves to create a story about race , appearance and identity with issues of nature and nurture liberally thrown in 20 twain s story starts with two babies who look more or less alike , although they are unrelated however , tom \( thomas beckett driscoll \) is the son of a wealthy white businessman chambers \( valet de chambre \) , the son of a slave , although he is only onethirtysecond black to all intents and purposes roxy was as white as anybody , but the onesixteenth of her that was black outvoted the other 15 parts and made her a negro she was a slave , and salable as such her child was 31 parts white , and he , too , was a slave , and by a fiction of law and custom a negro he had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade , and even the father of the white child was unable to tell the children apart 21 roxy worries that her son will be sold down the river a fate worse than death and so she seizes on a plan to switch the two babies chambers will become tom , and tom will become chambers or at least their names , if not their identities , will be switched the lawyer and the village eccentric pudd nhead wilson himself has the habit of collecting fingerprints and has taken the fingerprints of chambers and tom before and after the switch still , everyone remains blissfully ignorant of roxy s plan until the murder of tom s uncle here is pudd nhead s presentation , one of the great fictional perorations to a jury 22 every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave certain physical marks which do not change their character , and by which he can always be identified and that without shade of doubt or question these marks are his signature , his physiological autograph , so to speak , and this autograph cannot be counterfeited , nor can he disguise it or hide it away , nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of time this signature is not his face age can change that beyond recognition it is not his hair , for that can fall out it is not his height , for duplicates of that exist it is not his form , for duplicates of that exist also , whereas this signature is each man s very own there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe ! this autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet if you will look at the balls of your fingers that have very sharp eyesight you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close together , like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps , and that they form various clearly defined patterns , such as arches , circles , long curves , whorls , etc , and that these patterns differ on the different fingers between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were changed in the cradle a was put into b s cradle in the nursery b was transferred to the kitchen and became a negro and a slave sensation confusion of angry ejaculations but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you white and free ! burst of applause , checked by the officers from seven months onward until now , a has still been a usurper , and in my finger record he bears b s name here is his pantograph at the age of twelve compare it with the assassin s signature upon the knife handle do they tally \? the foreman answered to the minutest detail ! wilson said , solemnly the murderer of your friend and mine york driscoll of the generous hand and the kindly spirit sits in among you valet de chambre , negro and slave falsely called thomas becket driscoll make upon the window the fingerprints that will hang you ! ah , but twain has more in store for the reader chambers is sentenced to life in prison but this ending is clearly not despairing enough for twain something even more terrible , even more horrible , even more ironic is required and so , despite the endless twists and turns of the story , roxy s greatest fear comes true tom s estate is insolvent the creditors are anxious and angry if chambers goes to prison for life , they get nothing however , if he is sold as chattel down the river , the estate can recover some money the last lines of pudd nhead wilson must have given twain enormous pleasure everybody granted that if tom chambers were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish him it would be no loss to anybody but to shut up a valuable slave for life that was quite another matter as soon as the governor understood the case , he pardoned tom at once , and the creditors sold him down the river finis nature and nurture seem complicit and neither seem to matter much chambers is a bad guy , and his bad genes \( based on race or otherwise \) will out tom , deprived of the education which was presumably his due , is left in a most embarrassing situation no reading , no writing , no manners nothing good can come of any of it but , as they say in the latenight infomercials , that s not all a truly miserable end is guaranteed fate intervenes to insure the worst of outcomes why imprison chambers \? the problem of what to do with him is nothing more than the problem of what to do with erroneous inventory he is nothing more than chattel and hence , should be sold down the river his identity is revealed to us the readers of twain s novel through his fingerprints but there are deep rumblings of unseen machinery that dictate the outcome indeed , no amount of dissembling can hide his identity from the end he s destined to meet it is the appointment in samarra the predestined end but there is a better literary reference than john o hara it is james m cain , the author of a story about a man guilty of murder who is executed for a crime he didn t commit fate hooks onto us and drags us unceremoniously to some predetermined end cain and twain it s the belief that the postman always rings twice 23 it may all go back to this question of what makes us unique \? what uniquely identifies us \? what tells us that chambers is chambers , and tom is tom we assume that we are unique i am myself and no one else but can i prove it \? to myself or anyone else \? what if fingerprinting fails to provide unique identification \? tom has been disambiguated from chambers in twain s novel , but recent evidence suggests that fingerprints may not be unique even though identical twins have different fingerprints , given a sample of 100 , 000 or 1 , 000 , 000 or 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , are there no two people with the same prints \? recent studies suggest that fingerprinting may be less unique than we might think we might think of fate as proof that god had uniquely identified us for his own mischievous purposes even if we cannot identify jezebel , god must know who she is isn t he omniscient \? doesn t he know when the sparrow falls \? doesn t he know tom is tom , chambers is chambers , and that roxy has committed a sin for which she , too , must be punished does god \( or fate \) see beyond our physical characteristics to something deeper to something beyond a fingerprint \? to our essence \? to what makes us unique \? not just who we are , but how we have become who we are \? and what we will become \? leibniz tried to deal with this very question with his idea that the world is a skein of interlocking , interdependent pieces everything determined in advance leibniz s god knows everything in advance and has made a decision about what we will experience , what will happen to us , what we deserve we evade nothing it is guaranteed that we will get our just deserts 1 there is an account of melville s height in the recent and massive biography by hershel parker , melville , vol i 18191851 , johns hopkins , 2005 as we have seen , melville s 1849 passport application listed his height as 5 10 1 8 in 1856 , in preparation for another voyage , he applied for a new passport and sent in a new set of measurements in the intervening seven years , he had apparently shrunk parker tells the story doing as he was told , melville filled in the printed form and returned it for the state department files he had written carefully , in his best hand , but when he finished he folded it over before all the ink had dried , thereby creating a small smudge he was 37 years old he had listed his height as five feet eight and some fraction of an inch , but the smudge obliterated whatever fraction he had put down in the actual passport melville put his height at 5 8 3 4 , presumably what he wrote on the state department copy where the fraction was smudged pp 292293 curiously , the differing heights melville listed the 1849 and 1856 applications both diverged from an earlier record of melville s stature again , parker the earliest record of his mature height , at almost twenty , is in the crew list of the st lawrence , which he signed on june 3 , 1839 there he gave his height as 5 8 1 2 the height melville listed on his passport in 1849 \( 5 10 1 8 \) is curious on two grounds first , the difference between 8 1 2 and 10 1 8 is unusual , since it is somewhat infrequent for a man to grow 1 5 8 inches after the age of twenty second , while a man will say he is 5 10 1 2 , or even 5 10 1 4 , a man will not ordinarily give his height in eighths of an inch as evident from the personal descriptions in the crew list of the acushnet , for instance , it was common to measure by the quarter inch , but not a smaller unit melville s hyperprecision in this matter is poignant in retrospect because it magnifies the discrepancy between how tall he said he was in 1849 and how short he said he was in 1856 if it is unusual for a man to grow 1 5 8 inches between the ages of twenty and thirty , it is still more unusual for a man to shrink 1 3 8 inches between the ages of thirty and thirtyseven the height melville gave in 1856 may be his honest acknowledgment that sciatica and other physical ailments of the past several years had literally reduced his stature an example of the same honesty that had earlier led him to acknowledge procrastination to be a sad failing p 293 i have a slight problem with parker s account it suggests that these different recorded heights are accurate and that melville might have actually grown and then shrunk some 1 1 2 nowhere does parker suggest that melville may have reported his height incorrectly or perhaps was embarrassed by his actual height and sought to exaggerate it or minimize it \( could the 1 8 detail which as parker admits is unusual be motivated by melville s awareness that he was exaggerating his height , and therefore , thought to bolster the credibility of his claim by giving some absurdly precise measurement \? \) it is possible that his first successful efforts at writing literally increased melville s physical stature , and then the effort of writing mobydick , bartleby and benito cereno three of the greatest works in american literature caused him to fold in on himself by nearly an inch and a half a more plausible explanation , however , is that the selfreporting of personal details is not entirely reliable 2 melville

york city police department , ca 19089 4 bertillon did not believe in the possibility of the practical use of finger prints , because of the great difficulty of finding a means of classifying a large collection of them he says expressly unfortunately , it is quite undeniable , notwithstanding the indefatigable researches of mr francis galton in england , that these designs do not present in themselves elements of variability sufficiently striking to serve as a basis in a collection of many hundreds of thousands of cases harris hawthorne wilder and bert wentworth , personal identification

the following story we still remember the newspaper reports on the many thefts in churches and private residences that occurred in the last year because of the curious circumstances surrounding these thefts , one was led to believe that a clever and important gang was involved the startling thing was that no traces were ever found after any of the crimes had been committed the thieves disappeared into thin air , none of the stolen objects turned up , and no strangers were noticed it became obvious that many accomplices had to be involved , that fast means of transportation were available and that the goods were disposed of at faraway places several men were finally picked up and brought before the justice of the peace in lausanne among the suspects , there was a mysterious person whose name and antecedents were unknown and against whom it was very difficult to find anything but vague suspicions , because he had succeeded in keeping out of the spotlight the justice had a portrait taken of the prisoner , who was suspected to be dangerous this was done by the daguerreotype process he sent copies of it to the police of all the swiss cantons and to law enforcement agencies in the neighboring countries not much success was expected from this novel attempt , but finally news came in from the grand duchy of baden that the suspect had been recognized in the village where he had lived the villagers furnished the suspect s name and details on his tumultuous youth the investigation was continued , and wardens of the many prisons where the suspect should have been detained were interviewed he was recognized everywhere , and all called him very sly confronted with the depositions and the evidence , the suspect did not resist long and made important confessions 7 from 1862 ,

the obituaries for james q wilson , the eminent social scientist , generally emphasized his broken windows theory on how to reduce crime that s natural this strategy , which contributed to the recent reduction in crime rates , was his most tangible legacy but broken windows was only a small piece of what wilson contributed , and he did not consider it the center of his work the best way to understand the core wilson is by borrowing the title of one of his essays  when wilson began looking at social policy , at the university of redlands , the university of chicago and harvard , most people did not pay much attention to character the marxists looked at material forces darwinians at the time treated people as isolated products of competition policy makers of right and left thought about how to rearrange economic incentives it is as if it were a mark of sophistication for us to shun the language of morality in discussing the problems of mankind , he once recalled wilson worked within this tradition but during the 1960s and '70s , he noticed that the nation s problems could not be understood by looking at incentives schools were expanding , but james coleman found that the key to education success was the relationships at home and in the neighborhood income transfers to the poor increased , but poor neighborhoods did not improve instead families disintegrated the economy boomed and factory jobs opened up , but crime rates skyrocketed every generation has an incentive to spend on itself , but none ran up huge deficits until the current one some sort of moral norms prevented them at root , wilson wrote in 1985 in the public interest , in almost every area of important concern , we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously , whether as schoolchildren , applicants for public assistance , wouldbe lawbreakers or voters and public officials when wilson wrote about character and virtue , he did n't mean anything high flown or theocratic it was just the basics , befitting a man who grew up in the middleclass suburbs of los angeles in the 1940s behave in a balanced way think about the longterm consequences of your actions cooperate be decent he did not believe that virtue was inculcated by prayer in schools it was habituated by practicing good manners , by being dependable , punctual and responsible day by day wilson lived in an individualistic age , but he emphasized that character was formed in groups as he wrote in the moral sense , his 1993 masterpiece , order exists because a system of beliefs and sentiments held by members of a society sets limits to what those members can do wilson set out to learn how groups created a good order , why that order sometimes frayed he worked patiently and meticulously the phrase we do n't know rings throughout his writing he was quick to admit ignorance in the face of knotty social problems when wilson started talking about character , he was surprised that many in the academy regarded him as an archconservative why should character talk be conservative \? but he accepted the label and responded gracefully some conservatives in the academy respond to their isolation by becoming combative and extreme wilson s rule was that conservatives should respond by being twice as productive and four times as nice in the moral sense , he brilliantly investigated the virtuous sentiments we are born with and how they are cultivated by habit wilson s broken windows theory was promoted in an essay with george kelling called character and community wilson and kelling did n't think of crime primarily as an individual choice they saw it as something that emerged from the social psychology of a community when neighborhoods feel disorganized and scary , crime increases over the years , wilson argued that american communities responded to the stresses of industrialization by fortifying selfcontrol thanks to the temperance movement , for example , adult percapita alcohol consumption fell from 71 gallons a year to 18 gallons a year between 1830 and 1850 but america responded to the stresses of the information economy by reducing the communal buttresses to selfcontrol , with unfortunate results occasionally , when there was sufficient evidence , wilson recommended policies that might reverse this slide in one 1998 , he promoted ideas to strengthen the family create publicly supported , privately operated group homes for teenage mothers increase adoption investigate ways to increase preschool programs create a gi bill for young mothers if you take care of your kid now , the government will pay for training later create a religious united way fund to increase the role of religion in american society wilson was not a philosopher he was a social scientist he just understood that people are moral judgers and moral actors , and he reintegrated the vocabulary of character into discussions of everyday life
milwaukee the star point guard deron williams sat on the bench , dressed in a gray suit , unable to help his teammates williams missed the game against the on wednesday night after aggravating a right wrist injury that has hampered him all season mired in a slump with williams playing , the nets fared no better with williams on the bench , falling , 10893 it was the 10th loss in 13 games for the nets \( 1414 \) , sending them back to 500 after an 114 start it was also the nets' 13th consecutive loss to the bucks dating to march 3 , 2009 it s tough because of where we came from , joe johnson said of the slump we 've just got to all stay together , keep grinding , and we 'll get out of this sooner than later one day after a dispiriting 9376 loss to the boston celtics , the nets continued to struggle offensively coach avery johnson said before the game that the team needed to do a better job on offense after the game , he repeated the message at some point the guys are going to get sick and tired of me giving them the same speech after games , with the same results , johnson said if we take care of the basketball , we 've shown we can be a pretty good offensive team while the nets looked sharper than a day earlier against the celtics , the offensive output with williams missing was not enough to keep up with the bucks williams clapped whenever his teammates made nice plays , offered slight smiles at times and watched intently none of that helped a team that is seemingly in a free fall after a strong start williams s replacement , c j watson , made 2 of 12 shots from the floor and finished with 8 points and 2 assists in 31 minutes joe johnson continued to struggle to find rhythm , shooting 5 for 15 from the floor gerald wallace , starting for the third consecutive game , had 12 rebounds but made only 2 of 8 fieldgoal attempts for milwaukee , guards brandon jennings and monta ellis were too much for the nets jennings had 25 points and 6 assists , and ellis added 20 points , 6 rebounds and 7 assists the bright spot for the nets was brook lopez , who came out early for extra shooting before the game lopez scored 21 points on 9of18 shooting and had 10 rebounds with 3 blocked shots lopez said he did not believe that the nets were simply a 500 team absolutely no , he said i think the sky s the limit with us we 're working through a rough patch right now , but we have to stick together and keep working the second quarter was the nets' undoing , as it had been in the celtics game they mishandled the ball , allowed easy baskets down low and let mike dunleavy shoot unfettered jumpers dunleavy scored 10 in the quarter , and a 2point lead for the nets at the end of the first quarter had turned into a 5542 deficit by halftime in the second quarter , if we had taken care of the ball we would have scored more points and had more momentum in the first half , avery johnson said johnson said he was pleased with the team s play in the second half it s got to be throughout the whole game , he said we 've got to have our guys put together good games back to back we ca n't have guys playing one out of every five games we 've got to be dominant throughout the whole game , he continued we ca n't sputter and play in bits and pieces we have to have more consistency , and that s what i'm pushing for the nets made a run near the end of the third quarter , but ersan ilyasova scored 5 consecutive points to push the lead back to double digits in the final quarter , lopez scored on a layup to cut milwaukee s lead to 8782 with 6 minutes 39 seconds left ellis then hit a 3pointer for milwaukee , and joe johnson shot an air ball from the baseline dunleavy then made a 3pointer to extend the bucks' lead to 9382 with 5 43 to go , and the nets never seriously threatened again the nets now hope that williams can return for friday s game against charlotte it s been flaring up all throughout the season , avery johnson said before the game it seems like every time he falls , he falls directly on it johnson said he was called by the nets' chief executive , brett yormark , who wrote on twitter 20 minutes after the loss to boston nets fans deserved better today the entire organization needs to work harder to find the solution we will get there johnson said it was too early to draw conclusions about the team now is not the time to really analyze what s happened for us this year because we have n't even gotten to the halfway point and we have n't even played a full season with this roster , he said i agree , we all have to get better

jon huntsman had a more impressive resume , a better policy shop , better odds in november and stronger conservative bona fides than many of the candidates vying for the republican nomination but several of them are still running while he s dropped out , and that almost all of them enjoyed temporary surges in the polls while he always languished at the bottom of the pack for this , there s plenty of blame to go around huntsman can blame the mainstream media , for constantly depicting him as the sane republican tragically doomed to irrelevance by the folly of his party s base he can blame his own advisers , for embracing that selfdefeating image and trying to rerun john mccain s 2000 campaign in a very different climate he can blame republican voters for dismissing him because of symbolism and identity politics rather than judging him on his record he can blame conservative machers and opinionmakers for doing the same \( he can even blame his father , who declined or wasn t asked , or both to play sheldon adelson to his son s cashpoor campaign \) but he also has to blame his own skills as a candidate huntsman made a lackluster first impression , but he had plenty of chances to change that he was in most of the umpteen debates that newt gingrich used to reboot his candidacy after a shaky start , he put in the kind of man hours on the ground in new hampshire that paid dividends for rick santorum in iowa , and he received a level of media attention that was disproportionate to his poll numbers and in the end , he couldn t make the sale his epitaph , in this respect , was written a week ago by the new republic s alec macgillis  while huntsman s moderate deviations \( on civil unions , global warming and afghanistan , among other issues \) have undoubtedly played a major role in his failure to launch nationally , i decided tonight that his troubles in new hampshire come down to a simpler explanation for a guy who once played in a rock band called wizard and who rides a harley , jon huntsman is one heck of an undynamic dude on the stump worse , he has become that sort of underdog candidate who tries desperately to make a virtue of his humble standing , who chalks his failure up to his courage to utter truths that are , in many cases , far less bold than he makes them out to be making the humblelittleme tone of lines like these all the more noticeable is the delivery and body language that accompanies them an awshucks monotone the head tucked forward , turtlelike , to suggest modesty the mouth turned down at the edges and the eyes opened wide and cast low all of it adding up to a lugubrious expression at dissonance with the pert metrosexual look of the speaker s slim jeans and matching black and silver belt , black and silver watch and black and silver hair combed sharply back equally dissonant is the lengthy pitch made by his glamorous wife mary kaye , who describes in perplexed tones the time she read in the economist on an airplane how americans were looking for an unusual set of attributes in their president , attributes that it occurred to her as she was reading were all possessed by her husband , if only the american people would realize it he s extraordinary , he s honorable , he s commonsense , he s reasonable , he s sane , she said these are the things that i hear across the country , everywhere we go we get stopped , especially at the airports this is just america we go through an airport and almost always , always we get stopped you re the sane guy ! you re the honest guy ! you re the common sense guy ! ' wow , too bad that people in airports don t vote in the republican primaries ! this is harsh , but as someone who watched every one of huntsman s debate performances , it rings alltootrue to me and it makes his decision to swiftly endorse mitt romney seem like eminent good sense his odds of a post in a romney administration are slimtonone , but after this campaign , they re a long sight better than his chances of winning the republican nomination in 2016
new rochelle , ny each of mike glover s 12 tattoos carries personal significance , but none is more emblematic than the eight italicized words inked on his lean left calf if you do n't know me do n't judge me the message is a defiant reference to the labels he felt he acquired because his senioryear transcript from american christian academy in aston , pa , was voided because he had a son at a young age because he came from housing projects in the bronx because he attended junior college the tattoo recently turned three years old its birthday was celebrated not with petulance , but with a dunk glover , a firstteam all selection for the second consecutive year , is the hyperactive centerpiece for topseeded iona \( 246 , 153 maac \) as it enters the conference tournament this week glover s journey spans three high schools and four colleges in five states , with a courtroom detour in between once a top prospect for seton hall , in 2008 glover , a 6foot7 , 215pound forward , sued the ncaa after he was declared academically ineligible out of high school a rare move that cost him two years of playing he bounced to two junior colleges in brooklyn and utah never vacillating from his desire to play division i iona finally gave him a home , and there he has managed to revive a career and a reputation i think everything happens for a reason , glover said back then it just was n't my time to excel , i guess raised in the soundview section of the bronx , glover was the cornerstone of bobby gonzalez s first recruiting class at seton hall but in the fall of 2007 , just as glover s classes began , the ncaa , after investigating his grades at american christian , deemed him ineligible \( the academy ultimately closed as a high school in june 2008 \) he filed multiple appeals and , with no scholarship , eventually took out a loan to pay tuition for the spring semester , hoping the ncaa would change its decision according to glover , coaches continued to assure him that the decision would soon be reversed i'm just waiting , waiting , waiting , glover said in august 2008 , glover , with the lawyers walter r stone and jeffrey m crudup , filed suit in rhode island against the ncaa and the big east conference united states district judge ernest torres dismissed the lawsuit on procedural grounds in a telephone interview , crudup said the basis of their argument was that the ncaa never explained why glover s eligibility was revoked the ncaa just did n't seem to account for a kid doing better , crudup said mike was left wondering , did n't i do what i was supposed to do \? ' the lawyers were prepared to appeal , but glover decided to move on he and his girlfriend , alyssa carter , had just had a baby boy , and he did not want to swing from courtroom to courtroom glover enrolled at asa college in brooklyn he was in uniform in late january , having just stepped off the team bus to play his first collegiate game , when a coach told him that his eligibility paperwork still had not been accepted he burst into tears and hailed a cab home over the next five months , glover lived in his family s apartment in the on east 174th street , sharing a cramped bedroom with his son s crib , figuring out what to do next he said he grew depressed everything just built up , glover said i did n't know if it was signs or what was going on it was scaring me , actually i just thought i needed to get into a school if i could get in a school , i could take it from there that july , glover attended jerry mullen s junior college top 100 camp , an invitationonly annual showcase in tulsa , okla a 27yearold coach , chris craig , from the , knew nothing of glover s background , but he liked his effort and intensity , and offered him a spot ceu could not be further from the big east the college is in price , a tiny , mostly mormon mining community in the high desert plains just north of the san rafael swell glover lived in a dorm , frequented the town s lone chain restaurant , called wingers , and took overnight rides in a 1982 mci bus to play programs like northern idaho college this is what needed to be done , glover said my ultimate goal was to come back to division i basketball that was my dream while in utah , glover signed a letter of intent to play for coach brian nash at st francis college in brooklyn that was the plan until he got a text message informing him that nash had resigned scrambling , glover took a cue from a former coach about iona , a college he scoffed at when it recruited him in high school coach tim cluess was skeptical about glover s r sum until an assistant , jared grasso , brought glover on campus for a visit in early july 2010 once i talked to him and laid everything out on the line about how we do things , and accountability and what we expected of him , it was really an easy conversation , cluess said i genuinely felt he was a kid that got a little bit used by the system and was just looking for an opportunity again cluess thought he had unearthed something special a castoff who had acquired an unfair label that did not reflect his personality or motivation sometimes in our profession , when you go from one school to another school , i think the immediate reaction is he s got baggage , something is not right , marist coach chuck martin said in a telephone interview but i 'll tell you , mike is a great kid he s one of my favorite guys as a result , iona has won 49 games in two seasons with glover , who averaged 181 points and 91 rebounds per game this season for the highestscoring team \( 834 points a game \) in the country he is still with alyssa \( they have been together about seven years \) , and mike jr is a regular presence at home games he is set to graduate with a degree in criminal justice , and is thoughtful and reflective in describing his experience as something of a cautionary tale he never did get a full explanation for the ineligibility that once upended his life but the ink stain from that episode has finally worn off i do n't want anything now , glover said i'm happy
