the developments yesterday in the paula corbin jones suit against president clinton drew extensive , daylong coverage on television s allnews cable channels , but did not stir the allencompassing media frenzy that accompanied some of the earlier developments in the twomonthlong investigation into accusations of misconduct by the president though the day s news contained information that was later labeled explosive on one network and , if true , potentially a high crime that could lead to impeachment on another network , none of the three broadcast news divisions chose to interrupt their program schedules to cover any of the developments live one reason the central figure of the day s story was named paula jones , not monica lewinsky a lot of the information in the paula jones case is ending up in the other situation , said robert murphy , the senior vice president of hard news for abc but all those special live reports we did in january and february had a lot to do with criminal charges against the president , and that s a pretty serious matter that we take very seriously yesterday s news centered on the filing of more than 700 pages of documents by lawyers for ms jones in an effort to prevent the judge in the case from declaring a summary judgment in the president s favor it was considered serious enough to lead the evening newscasts on both abc and nbc but cbs topped its news with details from its exclusive interview with a central figure in both cases against president clinton , kathleen willey previewing the interview , which will be on the cbs news program 60 minutes on sunday night , ed bradley , the cbs correspondent , laid out ms willey s accusations \( most of which were also in her deposition in the jones case released yesterday \) that the president had sexually accosted her he also told the anchor , bob schieffer , that she tells her story in a very straightforward way and said , she comes across as a very credible person don hewitt , executive producer of 60 minutes , told reuters that ms willey in the interview told a very believable and very persuasive story of the meeting in the oval office it s her story and it s incredible and it s very believable and very persuasive , and leaves little doubt about what happened , he said asked if the interview with ms willey would damage mr clinton , who is fighting to keep the sex scandal from engulfing him politically , mr hewitt replied with a reference to mr clinton s lawyer well , bob bennett says she s a baldfaced liar and '60 minutes' is being used , but i do n't believe that for a moment it was on cbs s evening news report that its white house correspondent , scott pelley , said ms willey s testimony , if true , would mean the president had committed perjury in denying he had sexually accosted her , the kind of charge that could bring on impeachment another reason all three networks steered clear of live coverage of the release of the jones documents , executives from each network said , was because they needed time to digest the information before putting anything on the air our information was that it was n't bulletin material , said marcy mcginnis , the vice president of news coverage for cbs mr murphy said that abc s specialevents unit was prepared to go on the air live if the events yesterday warranted it , but that we were being very cautious because of the difficulty of dissecting all those pages of legal documents in a short period of time bill wheatley , vice president of nbc news , said the news was more appropriate for nbc s cable news channel msnbc it was the type of rolling coverage , with 700 pages of legal papers to examine and edit , that lends itself better to msnbc both that channel and cnn devoted large parts of the day first to the anticipation of the release of papers and what would be in them , and then to the dueling press conferences about what each side had to say about them after their release photo lawyers for paula corbin jones made public more than 600 pages of documents in her suit against president clinton yesterday amanda shipley delivered documents to federal district court in little rock , ark \( associated press \)

federal securities regulators accused w r grace company and six of its former executives of fraud yesterday , saying that the company had deceived shareholders over five years by falsely reporting earnings the move was part of a larger plan by the securities and exchange commission to crack down on the growing number of companies , including some of the nation s largest , that break accounting rules so they can manipulate earnings and meet wall street s expectations i hear from companies that say , 'everybody is doing it , so why ca n't we , ' said richard h walker , the sec s director of enforcement this is an area of great concern according to a civil complaint filed in united states district court in miami , grace , the large chemical company based in boca raton , fla , was blessed with unexpected revenue in the early 1990 s but instead of reporting all that revenue , the complaint said , executives moved 10 million to 20 million to later years when business was not as good regulators said that by using the false accounting , the company was able to report that revenue was on the rise for its health care group from 1991 to 1993 , even though actual revenue was declining regardless of the amount of revenue involved , the sec said in the complaint , grace management had misled investors just by not disclosing that it was engaged in an ongoing scheme to fraudulently manipulate its reported earnings in a written statement , grace said yesterday that it would vigorously contest the accusations the statement said the company believed its accounting in past years was proper and that the litigation should not have a significant impact on current earnings the company said none of the executives involved in the questioned accounting still worked for the company and , it said that its outside auditing firm , pricewaterhousecoopers , was aware of the accounting and had not raised any objections david nestor , a spokesman for pricewaterhousecoopers , said that the accounting firm did not comment on client matters but we stand behind our work , he said the company s share price fell 15625 , or 965 percent , to 14625 , after the sec s announcement yesterday regulators said grace executives had declined to report 10 million to 20 million in revenue that the company had received in the early 1990 s from a change in the medicare reimbursement rules because the executives believed it would not help the company s stock price at the time , the company was already reporting revenue at a rate that wall street was expecting so instead , according to the complaint , the executives set aside the unexpected medicare revenue in another account and then gradually used it to increase revenue from 1993 to 1995 when you manipulate earnings to show what you want to show and to not show the actual results , mr walker said , shareholders are deceived regulators are continuing their investigation into grace s accounting , he said , and plan to file similar complaints against other companies the complaint filed yesterday in miami seeks civil penalties and asks for an injunction restraining the company and its executives from further violations of federal securities laws the revenue that the sec is questioning was earned by a grace subsidiary , national medical care inc of waltham , mass the company sold national medical care , which operates kidney dialysis clinics , to fresenius ag of germany in 1996 regulators said grace executives used the unexpected revenue received by national medical care for profit planning purposes the amounts , which were improperly deferred in the accounting books by setting up reserve accounts , were used later to increase revenue of the health care group to meet wall street s expectations and to raise the company s earnings reported in its consolidated financial statements for example , for the fourth quarter of 1994 , grace senior managers asked executives at national medical care to report an additional 15 million in income , the regulators said , because grace needed that amount to increase its consolidated earnings regulators also filed an administrative complaint against the former grace executives , including j p bolduc , who had been chief executive , contending that they helped issue the financial reports that the regulators say are false gerald walpin , a lawyer for mr bolduc , said that his client would contest the accusations and expects to be vindicated he said the government s suit was an attempt to punish a chief executive for performing his responsibilities exactly as a responsible ceo should
cavalese , italy , feb 3 a lowflying united states military jet on a training flight over the craggy dolomite mountains here cut the cable of a ski lift today , sending a cable car plunging 260 feet into a snowy meadow and killing everyone aboard the authorities said 20 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage on a slope just south of this alpine hamlet the marine corps plane made an emergency landing safely , and none of the four crew members were injured , a marine spokesman said local officials said they had complained repeatedly of lowflying military aircraft stuntflying , some called it near these mountain cable systems , including instances when pilots flew below the cable lines on their way back to a nato air base at aviano , in northern italy in nearby trento , the president of the regional government , carlo andreotti , was quoted by the italian news agency ansa as saying , the military aircraft must stop playing war games , putting people s safety in grave danger many people say the military planes even play games by actually passing under the cables of the ski lifts , said mr andreotti , who was among officials who arrived here this afternoon the pentagon s spokesman , kenneth h bacon , said , there will have to be a full investigation he added that it was premature to discuss the cause of the accident or any complaints about previous flights a marine corps spokesman in washington , maj david lapan , said tonight that reports of civilian complaints would be considered by an accident investigation team that was to leave the marine corps air station at cherry point , nc , this evening the accident was the third involving cable cars here in little more than 20 years the last incident , in 1987 , involved a lowflying civilian plane that also sliced a cable and left 24 passengers hanging in a stranded car that time , no one was killed the aircraft involved in today s accident , a sophisticated electronic surveillance jet known as an ea6b prowler , ordinarily used to patrol the skies over bosnia to the east , returned to the aviano base the plane was only slightly damaged , the authorities said italian television reported that 14 of the 20 dead had been identified they included italian , german , belgian and polish vacationers soldiers of the italian army who carried the first bodies from the site of the crash described a scene of horror inside the crushed and overturned cable car bodies were twisted , they said , and the faces of the dead were described as contorted in terror several rescuers , who worked with the help of a hydraulic crane , broke down during the work a local catholic priest blessed the bodies as they were taken away the crash occurred at about 3 30 pm local time , when residents of cavalese said they heard a enormous boom at about the time the plane was thought to have hit the cable some people said the force of the boom was strong enough to shake light vehicles , much like a sonic boom with cranes and helicopters , rescue teams worked to remove bodies from the wreckage of the cable car by late this evening , scraps of yellow steel lay scattered over a snowy meadow amidst fir and larch trees pools of blood could be seen in the light of floodlights that illuminated the site a pile of twisted and broken skis , ski poles , boots goggles and gloves , some smeared with blood , had been collected by rescuers at the time of the accident , a second cable car was brought to a halt by an emergency braking system , and its sole passenger , an operator , was removed by helicopter he was taken to a local hospital and treated for shock the site of the accident is wedged into a corner of northern italy between the austrian and swiss borders the cable car , which carried skiers regularly in winter from the tiny town of cavalese to the slopes of mount cermis , to the south , was the scene of a major accident in 1976 , when a cable car crashed to the ground because of a mechanical fault , killing 42 people in addition to the marine investigation , italian judicial officials said they were opening a separate inquiry into the cause of the accident in rome , parliamentary deputies of the party of the democratic left , the former communists , called for an emergency session of parliament s defense committee for wednesday the parliamentary whip of the democratic left , fabio mussi , said he had requested the urgent meeting , noting that in months past various deputies had drawn attention to the dangers posed by the military flights mr mussi s group was acting at least in part to blunt an offensive by the more radical communist refounding party , which took the incident as an occasion to denounce the north atlantic treaty organization s presence in italy marco rizzo , a parliamentary deputy of communist refounding and a supporter of the centerleft government of prime minister romano prodi , said , the presence of united states bases in italy makes no sense and is only interference referring to tensions between the united states and iraq , mr mussi said , we would not want other italians to pay the price of preparations for an attack on saddam hussein prime minister prodi , who returned today from a visit to estonia , spoke by phone with president clinton , who expressed his condolences and assured him that italian authorities would be fully involved in an investigation into the tragedy by tonight , cavalese was quiet the bodies recovered from the wreckage had been brought to a local hospital the snowcovered slopes where the cable plunged to earth

the other side of silence men s lives and gay identities a twentiethcentury history by john loughery illustrated 507 pp new york a john macrae book henry holt company 35 for many otherwise wellmeaning americans , homosexuality and its attendant controversies gay marriage , military service , aids policy , sex education curriculums make us think or talk about things we would rather treat with benign neglect even though most straight americans oppose overt discrimination against homosexuals , 7 in 10 think sex between members of the same sex is wrong a majority viscerally opposes teaching tolerance for a homosexual life style and seems happiest with a do n't ask , do n't tell approach to the entire subject the other side of silence , john loughery s provocative history of gay male life in the united states from 1919 to the early 1990 s , will have none of it his title \( from the name of a shortlived gay theater workshop in the 1970 s \) refers both to the millions of gay lives that have been lived according to a kind of omerta , as well as to those who refused to follow the code and thereby risked their livelihoods and , as in the case of supervisor harvey milk of san francisco , their lives but the other side of silence \( or discretion \) is also speech by using blunt , nonacademic anglosaxonisms , loughery , the art critic of the hudson review , insures that readers cannot pretend not to know exactly which sexual acts were being practiced , forbidden or celebrated the broad outlines of loughery s story are becoming familiar to historians , if not to the general public but loughery goes farther in the other side of silence he combines original archival research , mastery of the secondary historical literature , more than 300 of his own interviews and a broad and deep knowledge of 20thcentury american letters , theater and film into a narrative that is completely accessible to nonspecialists despite our tendency to think of victorian sexuality as repressed , dominated by the rigidly separated spheres apportioned to men and women , that very segregation encouraged a good bit of samesex physical intimacy how much of this activity was what our cruder age regards as the real thing genital stimulation remains less clear , though with so much smoke in the sources , the odds favor the existence of a substantial amount of fire neither the terms nor the concepts homosexual and heterosexual even existed until the late 19th century , when a newly powerful medical profession began defining homoerotic behavior as perversion or mental illness still , the conceptual distinction between homosexual and heterosexual had considerably more force in the minds of clinicians than in the sexual practices of men , even the men who worked for vice squads in his opening chapter , for instance , loughery recounts the juicy story of the 1919 sex scandal at the naval training station at newport , ri , in which the navy ran a sting operation to entrap sailors and their civilian friends \( known among themselves as the ladies of newport \) in homosexual conduct the most striking part of the investigation , to modern eyes and eventually to an embarrassed department of the navy was the enthusiasm with which the presumably normal young detectives threw themselves into their work , enjoying \( under often explicit orders \) a fairly staggering amount of oral sex , loughery writes , and admitting , in at least two cases , to having had anal sex to orgasm but as long as they were on the receiving end of oral attentions , and on the giving end of anal intercourse , no one considered them fairies what was common knowledge within gay communities that otherwise heterosexual men , known as trade , could and did enjoy sex with other men has been more or less suppressed in straight life the 1920 s saw more cultural interest in sexuality , and if that decade s classic pantheon of writers \( hemingway , faulkner , fitzgerald , dos passos , dorothy parker \) seemed to have all but ignored homosexuality , late20 s and early30 s vaudeville , theater and even movies experienced what loughery calls a pansy craze , an implicit means of acknowledging , exploring and yet containing the specter of homosexuality by the late 30 s , however , in the grip of a national sex crimes panic , otherwise respectable newspapers ran lurid tales of murder , abduction and molestation on their front pages , frequently implying that sexual degeneracy code for homosexuality was fueling this apparent rampage the pansy had become a public menace world war ii had an immense if contradictory impact on gay life on the one hand , an estimated 9 , 000 servicemen and women were discharged on the basis of their sexual orientation , many of them entrapped and humiliated by periodic witch hunts at the same time , thousands of gay men and lesbians discovered one another and the fact that they were not alone in the military they also learned that whatever society s prejudices about queers and fairies , their capacity to survive and function and , for some , to excel was in no way impaired by their sexual life these lessons of gay men s wartime experience resembled those of black americans , who also felt , following the war , that the genie was not going to be forced back into the bottle

crack and marijuana and carried guns , shanika said she cut school to hang out with him , and by early summer , her aunt and grandmother decided they could no longer control her this time , children s

the staff evaluates their problems and determines where they should go next most graduate to a residential treatment center , where there is less supervision after that , they move on to group homes and then back to a foster family until they are 18 at first , shanika chafed under the strict rules of geller house during her first month there she left without permission , which is strictly against the rules , and got drunk slowly , though , a transformation took place shanika is now one of geller house s model residents she credits the discipline , the respect each child is given and learning

her spare time she s one the smartest kids we 've had around here she s just got to keep on the right path , he said shanika said she knows that path is not an easy one to follow she points to her mother as an example of how hard it is to stay on the straight and narrow in 1997 , her mother stopped using drugs and shanika returned home but her mother fell back into her old habits and shanika had to go back to her grandmother shanika said she hopes the changes she has made will last there are a lot of times i want to be back hanging out with my friends and drinking , she said right now i'm

thompsonville , mich i finally understood why adam was so enticed by eden s apples when we walked for the first time through our orchard near the northern coast of lake michigan more than 100 apple trees some gnarled and thick at the trunk like an old ash , others mere saplings stood scattered on a sandy ridge between the maple forest and a duncolored meadow it was september 1991 , weeks before the fruit fully matured still , the orchard s scent was sweet and inviting a dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color big , red round apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree , and they had a light , candy taste there were large green apples , a kind that had probably been stored during the winter in strawlined pits to be eaten in spring and there were smaller green apples with brown patches that might have originated from the old roxbury russet varieties popular in northwestern michigan around the turn of the century as a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern agriculture s shrinking genetic resources , i was struck by the number of varieties , none of which could be found at the markets in the towns of benzonia or frankfort nearby since the early 70 s , plant breeders have worried that the abundance of the world s food supply is balanced on a narrowing supply of wild and domestic plant genes for instance , a handful of varieties bred for peak production make up the bulk of the world s rice harvest meanwhile , irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to grow in harsh conditions have disappeared the same scenario is playing out for wheat , corn , barley , tomatoes and most other major food plants homogenization in the market is one result hunger can be another the irish potato famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops containing no genetic resistance as the new owners of 89 acres of forest , meadow and orchards in manistee county , mich , my wife and i wanted to know more about the place we had just bought and who had preceded us although historical records are incomplete , sometime during the 1880 s , hiram hier moved to the township and built a plain twostory home for his wife and two children on a rise above nurnberger road like other homesteaders , he planted different varieties of apple trees in his case , three neat rows down the southfacing slope of the widest ridge on his land during the late 19th century , american farmers were encouraged to spread seeds and see what came up hier almost surely followed the protocol , as did his neighbors long growing seasons moderated by lake michigan , welldrained soils and high ridges , which kept untimely frosts at bay , had already distinguished michigan s west side as one of the nation s prime fruitgrowing areas by the early 20th century , the fruit belt of northwest and western michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of apples , authorities say among the old favorites , some of them recognizable in my orchard , are snow apples , which are pure white to the bite the wolf river , a big , round baking apple maiden s blush , an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching darkpink patch on the side that receives the most sunlight , and golden russet , with skin the color of brown sugar at that time , apple varieties were so diverse , it was just like human beings , said john kilcherman , a farmer in northport , mich , who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving mailorder business there were as many apples as there were tastes two years ago , i walked our land and tried to count the number of varieties , concluding there were at least 14 it was not a simple task the old trees that hier had planted were mostly dead , and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around them hier s son , lee , was the last to farm the place , and when he died in the 1960 s , deer began spreading the seeds young fruitbearing trees are now growing throughout the property whatever the number , i was certain there were more varieties available than in almost any commercial supermarket even along the lake michigan coast , the center of a 100 million applegrowing industry , the nation s fourth largest , the markets offer paltry pickings red delicious , jonathan and mcintosh are michigan s big three northern spy , an old variety , is still grown widely for use in pies and to make cider shelf life , texture , uniform ripening and disease resistance are the most soughtafter traits distinctive taste is barely in the first tier of breeding goals growers , moreover , are reluctant to experiment by introducing unfamiliar varieties production costs are too high and profit margins too slim , and tearing out a productive orchard to test an unknown is too big a leap for most growers fortunately , apples have not descended to the level of the modern tomato cornell university keeps a wellstocked germplasm repository in geneva , ny , which is collecting wild seeds from the caspian sea region and from kazakhstan wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this socalled center of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest , said james luby , an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture at the university of minnesota moreover , there are 6 , 000 known commercial apple varieties in the world , a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next century at this point , i'm more interested in apples developed in the last century in midmay , the blossoms open and our trees look as if they are covered in snow in october , friends come to pick apples and haul them to swanson s mill three miles away to be pressed into the most delicious tart cider we have baked our apples into crisps and pies , eaten them straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones into the winter preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global solution but for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that are all the more precious because we ca n't find them anywhere else photo dan and sonya sturges harvesting heirloom apples from the old hier

washington , sept 9 from the moment geraldine a ferraro entered the new york race for senate , her opponents have questioned her skills and experience , suggesting that she was little more than a fading celebrity in search of an office at almost every turn , ms ferraro has responded by pointing to her sixyear tenure in the house of representatives , saying it offers a resume of accomplishments that her rivals should envy and a blueprint to understanding her rise from political neophyte to the first woman to be a major party candidate for vice president inside of two years , i was elected to house leadership , and within five years , to the national platform committee , she said in a recent interview , echoing a line from television commercials she began running two weeks ago that is the experience that will allow me to produce when i'm in the senate former colleagues and house officials generally agreed that ms ferraro was often an effective congresswoman but many said she was not necessarily an exceptional one , and a look at her time in the house , from 1979 through 1984 , shows that her political climb was not quite the simple , triumphant tale her campaign would suggest ms ferraro , former colleagues said , could be outspoken on issues dear to her , like supporting abortion rights , but did not brim with policy ideas , was not a frequent debater and was not known for having a detailed grasp of complex bills she scored some important legislative victories , they said , but the list was not long and while her ascension within the house democrats' maledominated leadership was unquestionably swift and clearly abetted by her energy and ambition , she also benefited heavily from her party s political needs of the moment for in the early 1980 s , democrats were searching for female leaders to help broaden the gender gap separating the parties as well as for centrist politicians who could appeal to the white , ethnic voters who were abandoning their party in droves for ronald reagan ms ferraro fit both bills placing her in leadership sent a signal to reagan democrats that here was a democrat in good standing from a district carried by reagan who was standing alongside the democratic leadership , said ross k baker , a professor of political science at rutgers university who was a consultant to the house democratic caucus in the early 1980 s her supporters say ms ferraro rose in leadership not just because of her sex but because she was willing to fight doggedly on issues that were important to many women and families , like protecting abortion rights , reducing poverty and improving the workplace for women she was aggressive , said patricia schroeder , a former democratic congresswoman who served with ms ferraro she worked on flex time , job sharing , all of those things that really were n't in the vocabulary then it is impossible to know what would have happened to ms ferraro if she had not run for vice president in 1984 and had stayed in congress , gaining experience and seniority some political analysts say she showed promise and could have risen into the upper echelons of either house had she not left she had an instinctive feel for the legislative process , said norman ornstein , a fellow at the american enterprise institute who has known ms ferraro since 1978 since leaving the house and running for vice president in 1984 , ms ferraro has been a television commentator , a lawyer in private practice , a candidate for senate in 1992 and the clinton administration s representative to the united nations human rights commission while she cites her united nations experience as equipping her to deal with foreign affairs , ms ferraro and others point to her house years as providing the clearest evidence of her ability to be a senator many politicians say ms ferraro s real legacy was not legislation but politics she was a skillful infighter , a pragmatist who could win friends among liberal house leaders while not alienating her conservative queens constituents , a feisty partisan in attacking republicans to her critics , her triumph was one of style and politics over substance and policy ms ferraro bristles at such characterizations she acknowledged focusing much time on political work for the house leadership and the democratic party but said that should not make her less qualified as a legislator than her major democratic opponents , mark green and representative charles e schumer , who are known for having voracious appetites for policy arcana how do you separate policy and politics \? she asked in the interview you do n't if you want to get legislation passed i'm the only one who will be able to do that i 've proven that in the house she also said that mr green , new york city s public advocate , has no right to attack her legislative record when he has none of his own and that mr schumer has taken credit for bills other people wrote a review of ms ferraro s six years in congress shows that she was not the most active of bill writers herself she was chief sponsor of just 6 bills in her first term , and about 40 over three terms fewer than many members of congress introduce in a single term in his first six years , mr schumer , who entered congress in 1980 , sponsored about 80 bills
trenton ever since a judge told the new jersey supreme court that urban schools need an additional 312 million , there has been a lot of bluster around here the court has yet to decide whether it will order the state to produce the money , which would allow more preschool and kindergarten classes , summer programs , teachers and social workers but with governor whitman s annual budget address just a week away , legislators are threatening to limit the court s power to force spending by rewriting the state constitution more specifically , they are proposing to change what is by now the most famous and infamous clause in the constitution the one that guarantees a thorough and efficient system of free public schools the court has referred to that clause in all its rulings on school financing , saying the state has failed to provide such a system in urban areas a growing number of legislators say that without that pesky clause , lawyers for poor schoolchildren would be hard pressed to prove that new jersey was not meeting its educational responsibilities and if those lawyers could not ask the court to define a thorough and efficient education , the court might not keep ordering millions of extra dollars for 28 urban districts which now receive more than half the 475 billion education budget there were rumblings about changing the constitution in the spring , when the court ordered the state to send an additional 248 million to the urban districts in the fall but it was an election year , and the governor and legislature probably did not want to seem too rebellious now that everyone has a few years' worth of job security and the possibility of another enormously expensive court order is looming the rumblings are back this time , they are louder the court has overstepped its bounds in a way that could lead to the bankruptcy of the state , said assembly speaker jack collins , who said the assembly would consider a constitutional amendment if the court orders an added 312 million for the urban schools changing the constitution is pretty big but it is at least remotely on my mind at least three legislators have proposed limiting the court s power over school financing , although it remains to be seen how much attention their proposals will get in the new legislative session one , from senator louis bassano , would establish laws to give the legislature the right to finance public schools in the manner that it determines to be appropriate another , from senator jack sinagra , would create a constitutional convention that would consider proposals to change the thorough and efficient clause in new jersey , any changes to the constitution are subject to approval by voters in a statewide referendum and while voters often support such amendments , it would take a lot of convincing to get them to go along with a change that could affect their children s education , said robert williams , a law professor at rutgers university who wrote a book about the state constitution i think there is a broad segment of the population that believes we 've got to address this problem of disadvantaged innercity students , professor williams said even those who are angry about the millions of tax dollars going to urban schools would not necessarily want to see the word thorough tossed out people think of that word as a sound underpinning , no matter what kind of school they send their kids to , said lynne strickland , executive director of the garden state coalition , which represents middleclass and wealthy school districts new jersey is not alone in promising a thorough and efficient education maryland , ohio , pennsylvania and west virginia use the same phrase , and colorado and idaho also use thorough but while most of these states have faced school financing lawsuits , none have seriously considered changing their constitutions , said terry whitney , a school finance expert with the national conference of state legislators he said it was a lousy idea all it does is say they are going to change the constitutional language so they are no longer required to provide this type of education , mr whitney said that to me does not make for good public policy assemblyman john rooney of northvale , a new member of the assembly education committee , said that rather than eliminate the words thorough and efficient , the legislature should amend the constitution to clarify that thorough and efficient cannot be defined in financial terms money has never solved the problem , so the court s solution is wrong , he said i would push a bill that limits their power to make us keep spending but that would not stop wealthy suburban districts from spending more every year , forcing property taxes up and provoking the court to insist that city schools get the same amount in the form of state aid to end the game of catchup , the legislature could merge some of the highspending districts , limit their spending or look for ways to trim spending on teacher salaries , which are among the nation s highest none of these changes would be popular , to put it mildly but they would surely have more of an impact than rewording the constitution , which might only tempt legislators to ignore their responsibilities not just to urban schools , but to every child in the state
why are we still ranting , dissenting , defending , brooding and quarreling gloating when writers we love appear , ready to hurl thunderbolts when they do n't about the modern library board s hubrisridden list of what it considers the best novels published in english since our century began \?

federal prosecutors have brought the first insider trading charges after an investigation into possible illegal trading that occurred in shares of the lotus development corporation before it was bought by ibm in a 3 billion deal in 1995 robert m cassano of croton falls , ny , was charged on dec 24 in federal district court in manhattan , court papers show gerad p mazzone , an acquaintance of mr cassano , was charged yesterday both men are accused of participating in schemes that generated about 200 , 000 in illegal profits for a total of six people the schemes are said to have stemmed from a leak from an ibm employee , who was a relative of mr cassano , concerning the company s confidential plans to buy lotus , the developer of lotus notes software , in 1995 the government has not identified the relative but has described the person in court papers as a family member of mr cassano who worked at ibm headquarters in armonk , ny , and obtained the information from another employee in two apparently unrelated cases , federal prosecutors last year charged two other investors with lying to the government about their trading in options in lotus stock neither man , however , was charged with insider trading and both have since pleaded guilty an assistant united states attorney , george s canellos , declined to comment yesterday on the two insider trading cases or the progress of any investigation into lotus trading but in documents filed yesterday and dec 24 in the insider trading cases , the government asserted that the lotus scheme began in spring 1995 , when mr cassano s relative at ibm tipped him off to the company s plans to make a tender offer for lotus then , mr cassano , according to the documents , passed the information on to mr mazzone , who was described as an engineer for a manhattan printing company , and suggested mr mazzone purchase shares of lotus and secretly share any profits with him later , court documents show , mr cassano agreed to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the lotus trading the stock was trading at about 32 a share before ibm made its offer on june 5 , 1995 it later agreed to acquire lotus for 64 a share mr mazzone then went ahead and bought lotus shares on june 2 , 1995 , and sold them on june 5 , after the tender offer was announced , realizing 27 , 520 in illegal profits , the documents said he then paid mr cassano just under 4 , 000 , according to the complaint at this point , mr mazzone told three other people two coworkers and a cousin about the pending lotus offer , according to the complaint , which includes an affidavit signed by michael j degnan , an agent with the federal bureau of investigation each of those three people then bought shares or options in lotus stock and sold them after the june 5 announcement , making a total of 157 , 000 in illegal profits , the complaint says none of the those three were named in the documents or charged one coworker later paid mr mazzone 17 , 800 , the complaint said the united states attorney s office in manhattan also charged mr mazzone with obstruction of justice , witness tampering and perjury in connection with his attempts to dissuade a witness from testifying truthfully to the securities and exchange commission the sec s boston office initiated the lotus inquiry in 1996 , court papers show at a hearing yesterday in federal district court , mr mazzone sat quietly , responding only to tell a magistrate , kevin nathaniel fox , that he understood his rights magistrate fox released mr mazzone on his own recognizance his lawyer , susan g kellman , said he vigorously intends to fight these issues the government also charged mr mazzone with a separate count of insider trading in the shares of another company , spectrum information technologies inc prosecutors did not specify the amount of money they said he had made in those trades , in 1993 the government said in court papers that mr mazzone made the trades after learning from a relative in the company about pending licensing agreements by spectrum with major telecommunications companies mr mazzone also tipped off mr cassano about the spectrum agreements , according to court papers , and mr cassano made his own trades in spectrum securities prosecutors did not state how much he made on those trades mr cassano was charged with insider trading counts in both the lotus and ibm trades mr cassano has pleaded not guilty to the charges he declined to comment when reached by phone last night later , prosecutors said in court papers , mr mazzone sought to obstruct the inquiry into the trades by trying to persuade mr cassano to testify falsely to the sec the complaint said that mr mazzone told mr cassano that each of the three people he tipped off had denied in testimony to the sec having any knowledge of ibm s plan to acquire lotus you could tell them , look , i do n't remember if i said anything specific or take the fifth on it , mr mazzone is quoted as telling his source , unaware that the fbi was recording the conversation , the complaint says when the source asks mr mazzone how bad could it be \? if the sec learned that the information originated with his relative at ibm , mr mazzone is quoted as saying it s insider trading that s how bad it could be
the national basketball association warns its players that if they leave the bench to join an oncourt fight , they will be suspended and fined national hockey league players incur automatic suspensions for leaving the bench for an onice altercation the national football league tells its players to stay away if a fight breaks out among other players or face the imposition of fines major league baseball , on the other hand , has no rules stipulating automatic disciplinary action for players who run onto the field from their dugouts or their bullpens to join a fight in progress after seeing , either live or on tape , the brawl at yankee stadium tuesday night between the yankees and the baltimore orioles , fans may wonder why baseball has no rules governing such action various officials said yesterday the reason is simple we 're the only sport where structurally that rule would n't make sense , gene orza , associate general counsel of the players association , said it ca n't be in our sport because there s only one player on the field against nine if a batter , say , hits a double and slides high and hard into second base , riling the second baseman , a fight could ensue , and the batter would be alone amid nine defensive players who are on the field and would not be subject to a rule governing players in the dugouts and bullpens despite the seeming onesided nature of such a potential fight , gene budig , the american league president , said yesterday that the matter would be discussed some people have intentions of introducing it for discussion at our meetings of general managers , he said the general managers meet annually in november one general manager , pat gillick of baltimore , said he favored a rule that called for disciplinary action against players who leave their dugouts , their bullpens or their positions another official , however , said he did not think baseball would ever adopt such a rule because you would have to collectively bargain for it and the players association would oppose it the fight between the yankees and the orioles appeared to be more bluster than brawl until members of the yankees' bullpen charged into the fray that was why graeme lloyd and jeff nelson were suspended and fined in this situation , then , players who left the bench actually ignited the fight rather than joined it the kind of brawl that occurred at yankee stadium resembled a scene that used to be common on nhl ice but after a freeforall between the montreal canadiens and the philadelphia flyers before not during but before a playoff game in 1987 , the league adopted stiffer penalties for players leaving the bench to join a fight , and the scene has not been repeated the first player to leave either bench or penalty box to join or start a fight is automatically suspended without pay for 10 games the second player to do that is suspended for five games without pay the players' teams are fined 10 , 000 for the first incident , and the coaches of the teams face possible suspension and a fine based on review of the incident by the commissioner players who are on the ice and get into a fight incur fiveminute penalties the nba has also stiffened its benchleaving rule , and that is the one the knicks paid dearly for a year ago the league s rules say players who are not involved in a fight must remain in the immediate vicinity of their bench penalty for roaming minimum suspension of one game and a fine of up to 20 , 000 in an altercation between the knicks and the miami heat during their playoff series last year \( as opposed to their fight during this year s openinground playoff series \) , four members of the knicks were seen straying from the designated vicinity after charlie ward of the knicks and p j brown of the heat got into a fight as a result , the knicks' patrick ewing , allan houston and ward were suspended for game 6 and larry johnson and john starks were suspended for game 7 brown was suspended for both games like baseball , the nfl has no specified penalties for fighting or straying into a fight fights in the nfl are pointless and only lead to penalties as well as possible fines and disqualification from the game all of which hurt your team , the league advises its players if players unnecessarily enter a fight area , they will be fined whether their involvement is active or inactive in baseball , the american and national league presidents levy suspensions and fines case by case players have a right to appeal the penalties , but the appeals are heard by the same league presidents who imposed them the best a player can hope for is a reduction of the suspension or fine orza said that onfield incidents can create interesting cases , recalling one incident some years ago where mario soto and claudell washington were suspended for their parts in a fight both appealed , and orza , as the union lawyer , argued for both at separate hearings before chub feeney , the nl president i suggested one day that chub was wrong for suspending washington because soto was trying to kill him with a pitched ball orza said the next day i argued that he ca n't suspend soto because he was just trying to pitch inside
what s in a name \? increasingly for makers of generic drugs , everything a seemingly odd state of affairs for an industry whose stock in trade is cheap noname knockoffs of brands that have lost their patents with too many players in too many parts of the business , companies that primarily sell generics often find themselves lost in the crowd , able to stand out on pharmacy shelves only by cutting prices more and more , though , they are replacing the identically drab scientific labels on their products with brand names of their own , raising prices in step with a higher profile everybody tries to undercut each other on price it all becomes a high wire act , said allen chao , the chief executive of watson pharmaceuticals , a generic drug maker based in corona , calif , adding , we decided the only way to deliver consistent earnings , quarter after quarter , was to go into the branded drug business there have always been some brand names in the generic drug cabinet when a drug loses its patent protection , one company gets the right to sell a generic version for about six months , after which others are allowed in some companies immediately put a brand name on that first version and back it with marketing to doctors and consumers but it is only lately that generics makers have begun to scramble for new ways to add names to their products in some cases , analysts say , they have even tried to come in through the back door by giving an existing generic drug the kind of hold on a market that only a name brand would have tired of waiting around for drugs to come off patent , teva pharmaceuticals usa , one of the nation s largest generics makers , has begun to develop its own patented brands two years ago , the company rolled out copaxone for multiple sclerosis and it now has 10 other products in the pipeline mylan laboratories , another big generics maker , has six new drugs in development , including sulfamylon , a burn medication some companies are buying up branded generics that others have developed watson paid 290 million last year to acquire two lines of such drugs , including the oral contraceptive trivora and dilacor xr for hypertension with the purchase , branded drugs are expected to contribute a little more than half of watson s estimated 550 million in sales this year , analysts say , up from nothing just three years ago and a few companies , like mylan , have entered into exclusive agreements with the suppliers of chemicals and other raw materials for their drugs , arrangements that can have the effect of reducing the number of generics competitors in the case of lorazepam , an antianxiety drug , mylan was able to reduce its top competitors largely to just ativan , the original patented version by american home products in february , after it had the field more to itself , mylan raised the wholesale price of its version of lorazepam by 343 percent , to 79667 for 1 , 000 pills , from 17995 the company attributed the jump to regulatory delays and legal fees from patent disputes , not to its arrangement with a supplier a spokeswoman added that mylan s competitors could have gone to other suppliers in any event , money is at the heart of the generic makers' strategic shift branded drugs whether patented original formulas or generics with names boast profit margins of up to 70 percent or more , twice that of regular generics it s very important to have branded drugs in order to have sustainable margins , said thomas l anderson , president of the united states pharmaceutical division of alpharma inc , the nation s leading maker of generic liquid drugs alpharma started marketing its first branded generic in march the shift has largely escaped the notice of consumers , at least those who have insurance for prescription drugs or still have the option to use cheaper unbranded generics but the sudden price increase of lorazepam and some other generics has upset pharmacists , who are unable to pass along the increases as quickly as they would like it has also riled some members of congress , who have called for investigations the biggest impact has been felt by other companies in the generics industry and by investors , with the stock price of both watson and mylan , for example , climbing more than 90 percent in the last year the generics companies that have changed at least some of their stripes say they had no choice while most executives acknowledge that the generics industry can be enormously profitable , they also say that only a few companies ever share in the bounty there are simply too many players in some categories , and landing the rights to be the first to make a generic version of a popular drug can often be troublesome drug patents now last for 20 years yet by the time a company actually gets a drug to market , its patent has already largely expired , leaving it just eight years on average to be the lone seller at the end of the patent period , companies often sue to protect their exclusivity by raising questions about the ability of generics makers to produce a safe substitute such a challenge can cost a generics maker millions of dollars in legal fees and lost

it had almost all the trappings of a spiritual revival the ministers praised god shouts of amen and hallelujah punctuated melodious hymns that were sung in perfect harmony the scene yesterday was not in a church , but in the notorious 70th precinct station house , a place that has come to symbolize the often fractious relations between the police and minority groups ever since abner louima , a haitian immigrant , said he was tortured there the station in flatbush , brooklyn , has often been the site of angry demonstrations this time , however , about 20 black protestant ministers came to the building s basement to give spiritual support to the roughly 300 police officers stationed there the ministers who organized the show of support said they came to praise the changes in the precinct under its new commander , inspector raymond diaz , who was installed after the alleged torture of mr louima but noticeably absent from the event were any members of new york s haitian community , which has been the backbone of numerous protests over the louima case during the event , billed as a love feast , some of the precinct s officers stood in the background , while others sat stoically as one preacher after another strolled up to the microphones to give personal testimony of encounters with police officers who had gone far beyond the call of duty to help them i love the police , bellowed the rev maria bailey , the pastor of the mount hope pilgrim spiritual baptist church in bedfordstuyvesant no one said they are perfect we 've all come short to the glory of god we cannot judge each other the event at the station house which was part revival , part pep rally was organized by the rev betty neal , a street preacher in harlem who is known for pushing drug dealers out of her block in harlem in fact , in a place known as the borough of churches , only two of the ministers who gathered for the rally came from brooklyn , and most of the others were from harlem the atmosphere was a far cry from some of the scenes of last summer , when protesters gathered outside the station , branding the officers as racists or brutalizers this time , the police were treated to copious servings of soul food ribs , rice , chicken , potato salad , collard greens and sweet potato pie washed down with fruit punch inspector diaz said that yesterday s event would help to improve the morale of a precinct that had yet to live down the louima case the commander said that although morale had improved somewhat in the last six months , it was still low i really appreciate this for the great men and women in the precinct , he said it was a nice gesture that other people from the outside would come and support us the rally took place on the same day that the brooklyn district attorney s office dismissed a state indictment in the case as part of the process of turning over the case to federal prosecutors , who announced last week that they had obtained a federal grand jury indictment the state indictment charged two police officers from the 70th precinct with sexual abuse and assault in the reported attack on mr louima they were accused of ramming a stick into mr louima s rectum two other officers were charged with assault the federal government is charging the four with violating mr louima s civil rights , and if they are convicted , they could face much harsher sentences that they would have faced in state court the federal indictment also accuses a sergeant , who was not charged in the state case , of helping to cover up the reported assault since the attack on mr louima was first reported , many of the precinct s leaders have been replaced none of the 40 officers who attended the rally would comment sister betty , as the rev betty neal is known , said that she did not invite the louima family because the feast was a tribute to the good , hardworking officers of the precinct mr louima s uncle , philius nicolas 2d , is the pastor of the evangelical crusade church , which has one of new york s largest haitian congregations photo the rev maria bailey , the pastor of the mount hope pilgrim spiritual baptist church , prayed yesterday at a rally for the police in the basement of the 70th precinct station house in flatbush , brooklyn \( nancy siesel for the new york times \)
the torrent of falling bricks and scaffolding around the city over the last year had already made gaston silva the most quoted buildings commissioner in recent city history when the crackdown on sex shops happened a few weeks ago to its surprise , mr silva s prosaic department , with its fusty permit books and cranky plumbing examiners , suddenly found itself in the moral wetlands of the adult entertainment industry , enforcing the new zoning law by measuring bikini coverage and counting xrated videotapes it was n't quite what mr silva imagined when he took the job two years ago especially because he now has a new headache the wives of the inspectors , who would prefer to see their husbands checking welds and concrete strength instead of female flesh some of the wives of the inspectors have been complaining , he said last week , shaking his head while trying to suppress a grin they do n't like this duty for their husbands our guys are , you know , building inspectors , and here they are going with vice cops to these places they have a very different background they 're used to different things but somehow and here the grin can be restrained no longer somehow , they 're handling it \( the inspectors have the right to opt out of these assignments on moral and religious grounds for the record , none have done so \) it s been that kind of year for gaston silva , the unpretentious architect chosen by mayor rudolph w giuliani to head the buildings department in 1996 , who has been unable to stay out of the news ever since he got his first badnews beep while on vacation with his family a few days before he started work , after a truck knocked down a sidewalk shed on lexington avenue the subsequent beeps never stopped yankee stadium , the bricks of madison avenue , the selwyn theater , the conde nast building just yesterday , a sheet of bricks fell 39 stories from a midtown skyscraper defying the very human desire to find a pattern in random events , mr silva insists that the spate of building failures cannot be traced to a single phenomenon or trend he does n't joke about premillennial superstitions or the city s jellied moral foundations but when pressed , mr silva , who generally has the last word in the administration on how to proceed after major building accidents , is fatalistic enough to acknowledge that every failure is ultimately a manifestation of human error materials do n't fail people fail , he likes to say , quoting from a large tome on design failures atop his desk some of the incidents , like madison avenue and the selwyn theater , were clearly the result of contractor negligence , and mr silva does n't hesitate to say so others , including the various falling parapets , are more likely due to improper maintenance , while some , including the conde nast building , remain mysteries he said none of the accidents are related to the giuliani administration s policy of selfcertification , begun by his predecessor and enthusiastically continued by mr silva , under which architects and engineers are allowed to assert that their plans meet city specifications to receive a permit and speed through bottlenecks the city is supposed to spotcheck the projects for compliance , although inspectors say such checks are rare some architects and engineers say that mr silva , calm and rarely given to angry displays , has failed to put the fear of god into the construction community but though he acknowledges the presence of shoddy , irresponsible contractors , he has an architect s faith in professional competence , and says many people have the wrong idea about the department s abilities the buildings department can never guarantee that a building is built properly , he said we do guarantee that a process has been followed , an application filed by a licensed architect or engineer , but we do n't build the buildings even when an inspector goes out , he s only looking at a small fraction of what s out there unlike many of the mayor s appointments , mr silva is not a longtime giuliani loyalist , having entered city government when the koch administration appointed him to the landmarks preservation commission he had n't even met mr giuliani when he was moved in 1996 from the board of standards and appeals to buildings his true love is design , particularly 17thcentury italian architecture , but his refusal to discuss local buildings reflects a careful diplomacy often noted by his colleagues in the private sector he was a master mediator and problem solver , said james stewart polshek , a prominent local architect for whom mr silva worked on several major projects , including the renovation of carnegie hall there are different kinds of architects , and he was a managertechnician at the most sophisticated level mr silva , 45 , one of the few commissioners who drives himself around town , spoke no english when he fled cuba in 1960 with his parents , who became teachers after growing up with three families of relatives in one house in river edge , nj , he graduated from architecture school at the university of pennsylvania , and now lives with his wife and two young children in a brownstone in prospect heights , brooklyn and no one is complaining that he is spending much more time on the conde nast accident than on certain other establishments in times square photo gaston

uncovering what it called a caviar smuggling scheme worth millions of dollars , the federal government yesterday indicted three men , two of whom run a distributing company that supplies caviar to retail shops and restaurants in new york city , as well as throughout the country the distributors , based in stamford , conn , were charged in federal district court in brooklyn with illegally smuggling thousands of pounds of russian sturgeon roe into the united states from poland the indictment accuses the company , gino international , of transporting some of the supply by hiding it in luggage on many commercial flights from poland to kennedy international airport none of the caviar was refrigerated , the authorities said , nor could proper papers for the caviar be produced the government would not disclose the names of retailers or restaurants that buy caviar from the company , only that it was one of the largest distributors in the area the government seized some of the caviar at kennedy , where federal agents and inspectors have been enforcing tough new international caviar regulations intended to stop the flow of illegally harvested caviar the operation at the airport has intensified over the holiday season the peak time to indulge in caviar and has roiled the lucrative caviar industry until recently , it was not difficult to import mislabeled , old , previously frozen or blackmarket caviar into the united states the government says such caviar amounts to 50 percent of the trade but now , agents from the united states fish and wildlife service who are enforcing the regulations can easily test the dna of a single egg , revealing whether caviar is , in fact , the grade , provenance and variety promised on its label locally , retailers and chefs are scrambling to destroy questionable caviar and replenish their holiday stocks industry sources say that more than nine tons of caviar is sold in the city between thanksgiving and new year s eve , and up to 10 million is spent on the delicacy in yesterday s indictment , zachary w carter , the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york , brought charges against eugeniusz koczuk , the owner of gino international his business associate , wieslaw rozbicki , and andrezej lepkowski , of warsaw , poland , a man the government said recruited couriers to smuggle the caviar each man was charged with seven counts related to smuggling endangered wildlife into the country if convicted , each could face a fine of as much as 250 , 000 and a maximum of five years in prison on each count in addition to destroying the 2 , 000 pounds of unlawfully imported caviar they seized , the government is requesting up to 2 million in restitution for sales of illegal caviar before the seizure all three were released on bonds leaving the courthouse , mr koczuk , speaking through a translator , would say only this is all a big misunderstanding that will be made clear soon last april , the united states joined 140 other nations to enforce caviar importing regulations drafted by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora , called cites \( pronounced sightease \) mr carter said that the united states is the world s leading importer of caviar more than 80 tons of caviar with a declared wholesale value of 1 , 889 , 911 and a retail value of as much as to five times that much is legally imported into the united states each year uncounted additional tons are concealed in suitcases , packed in shipping containers , or shipped through the mail without permits and are most likely blackmarket products throughout the caviar industry , a markup of 100 percent is not uncommon black market caviar can be marked up by suppliers as much as 500 percent and still cost less than legitimately imported caviar most retailers responded to questions about yesterday s indictments with shock , fear and rage it s a terribly unfortunate thing when people do things like this , said saul zabar of zabar s , whose upper west side store has long waged holiday caviar price wars with macy s he said his store has taken every action to protect the public according to the indictment , millions of illegal fish eggs have been smuggled into the country recovering them all evokes visions of needles in haystacks on numerous occasions , the indictment says , the three defendants conspired to smuggle shipments of caviar by concealing them in the luggage of airline passengers , whom they paid a 500 courier fee none of the passengers have been charged gino international is accused of having sold 19 , 000 pounds of caviar with a retail value of more than 8 million between april 1 and nov 3 , 1998 , but it received government permission to import only one shipment of 88 pounds of caviar , the indictment says one thousand pounds of the smuggled caviar was seized by the agents at kennedy , and 1 , 000 pounds of the unrefrigerated caviar was seized from mr koczuk s garage in stamford , the indictment says while frozen caviar can have a shelf life of up to two years , fresh caviar begins to deteriorate within a week if not properly refrigerated many caviar dealers say that before the cites regulations , tons of blackmarket caviar were imported that is what explains the glut of cheap caviar we are seeing , said hossein aimani , the president of paramount caviar , an importing company in manhattan traditionally , some caviar traders routinely mix grades of caviar , combine frozen with fresh caviar and employ numerous other schemes to increase their profits but now , according to the fish and wildlife service , a dna test can reveal such scams if one egg in a shipment of a ton does not match its accompanying paperwork , the shipment will be seized and destroyed already , some caviar importers are railing against enforcement of the regulations eric sobol , the chief executive of madison avenue caviarteria , an importing company based in long island city , queens , with two retail outlets in manhattan , said he was challenging the impoundment of one of his shipments in a civil case a magistrate recommended in favor of mr sobol last friday the government is challenging that recommendation a judge s ruling is expected by thursday meanwhile , with six shopping days left until christmas , caviar shipments continue to land in new york and federal investigators continue investigating them , egg by egg tips for finding the freshest caviar a consumer s best protection against buying mishandled caviar is shopping at a trusted retailer if the retailer cannot provide copies of the import permit for the caviar it is selling , it is possible that the caviar was imported before regulations requiring such permits went into effect at the very least , such caviar will be old , and more than likely it will have been frozen before it was imported if it is no longer frozen , it will have a shelf life of less than two weeks while there is very little correlation between price and quality of caviar this year , very inexpensive caviar was almost certainly imported before new import regulations went into effect high prices alone do not guarantee impeccable caviar , but in tandem with a reliable and wellestablished dealer , they usually do photo caviar confiscated as a result of tough enforcement of new international regulations intended to stop the flow of illegally harvested eggs \( susan farley for the new york times \)
teenage pregnancy is an integral part of the loop of urban poverty it is caused by , and in turn causes , many of the other problems that prevent young people especially young women from realizing the full potential of their lives in an effort to prevent such pregnancies , and knowing the advantage of peers reaching out to peers , the state established the teen pregnancy prevention program in 1987 , now in place in nine cities in new haven , 10 eighth graders from each of the comprehensive middle schools jackie robinson , roberto clemente and fair haven participate in a yearlong training program its motto is diplomas before diapers , and its mission is to reduce teenage pregnancy and prepare young people to become healthy , responsible adults the program creates an atmosphere where youth can see themselves as winners , by completing their education , exhibiting their acquired skills , and being seen as role models in their communities , says mary russell , director of new haven s program , which receives 120 , 000 in funding from the state students are picked through a competitive process those accepted participate in mandatory twiceaweek training sessions plus some programs on weekends those who maintain a 90 percent attendance rate receive a 75 stipend at the end of each of the two 14week sessions those selected , says ms russell , are the kids we can help develop we do n't turn away a students who are in every club , but we encourage kids who are not joiners to get involved the initiative provides programs to help young people postpone sexual involvement and parenting , build selfesteem , develop leadership qualities and improve communication and decisionmaking skills the curriculum also covers information and discussion of drug and alcohol use and violence prevention several recent studies show a decline in the teenage pregnancy rate nationally , especially among africanamericans \( although the pregnancy rate is still significantly higher than for the teenage population as a whole \) reasons cited include more reliance on abstinence , more consistent use of birth control and better education about the effects of aids the teenage pregnancy rate in new haven from 1988 to 1995 fluctuated between 159 percent and 187 percent , but rose to 191 percent in 1996 ms russell is quick to disavow any responsibility for those statistics we wish we could be in charge of the whole thing , she said , referring to all teenagers in the city , because then there would be a lower teen pregnancy rate she says that in the seven years she s been involved with the program , none of the former participants have had babies as far as she knows participants must have written parental permission to go into the program , and submit copies of their report cards each quarter , proving that they have passing grades each group has an instructor and an outreach worker the attitudes of the parents are very good , says alfreda edwards , the outreach worker for the jackie robinson group they are really accepting of the program the program serves the students enrolled and their peers enrollees are trained not to give advice , but to listen and to be the first link in the chain to refer others to appropriate help at a recent afterschool session at jackie robinson , a reporter asked the students about their involvement they can talk to us if they do n't feel comfortable talking to adults , said one young woman asked what he would do if a girl said her boyfriend was pressuring her to have sex , one of the two boys in the group immediately said he would suggest to the girl , tell your boyfriend how you feel , that you are not ready the other boy agreed the instructor , sandra duhaney , makes the distinction between the participants sharing their own feelings about what they themselves would do in a situation , and advising someone else about what to do for example , she said , if someone is pregnant , they ca n't tell her to have an abortion , or to have the baby or to put it up for adoption the young people all agree that teenage pregnancy is a big problem they have strong opinions about why teenage sex is not a good idea if you get pregnant at a young age you wo n't have any way to handle the finances , said stephanie crenshaw the only thing that might help is welfare , but you can only stay on that for 21 months they seem acutely aware of connecticut s eligibility period for welfare the shortest of any state in the country they say it s changed some teenagers' views about having children one points out that a teenage body is not fully developed yet , making pregnancy a health risk another risk is sexually transmitted diseases a third says that teenagers who have sex are just irresponsible they do n't know what they 're doing being a teenage parent , they say , makes it hard to finish school , hard to get a job , hard to find day care for your baby and this was a big one you ca n't go to parties or do a lot of things you want to do they also said that girls who have babies often drift apart from friends who do n't have children the new haven public schools offer both a special school for pregnant students polly mccabe and a free day care center at wilbur cross high school only one student thought these services might actually encourage teenagers to have babies all the rest said such programs would n't be nearly enough to make up for the cataclysmic negative change in the lives of young parents one of the things they hope to convey to their peers is that , contrary to popular belief , not everyone their age is having sex there is a lot of pressure , says a participant in the program they would feel less uncomfortable not having sex if they know others are not either a sophomore at hillhouse high school who participated in the teen pregnancy prevention program while an eighth grader said it made a big improvement in his life the young man said , it gave me the selfconfidence to do some of the things i am doing now he is active in sports and he credits the teen pregnancy prevention program with making sex education interesting and relevant i have an older brother who had a kid , he said , and it messed up his life i look forward to not having kids , hopefully , until i graduate from college

rich mushroom ragout the thick , restorative minestrone was another crowd pleaser two golden oldies currently out of favor with the ido n'teatanythingfried crowd , calamari and zucchini , were so good

both the caesar and tricolor passed the taste test but would have been more impressive on larger plates main courses had their ups and downs two strikeouts among the pastas were the gnocchi in a bland , hohum meat sauce and a special of shrimp risotto whose texture should have been more creamy earning high marks were the classic spaghetti carbonara loaded with bacon , onion and cheese and a special of homemade ravioli filled with a soothing butternut squash puree in a butter sauce spiked with fresh sage all entrees are accompanied by the same copycat vegetables one evening it was broccoli , on another it was greenbeans and carrots the menu is packed with veal and chicken offerings the moist , tender chicken scarpariello was delicious , but garlic lovers will wish for more of it chicken cutlets crowned with asparagus and a melt of parmesan cheese made friends , as did veal with mushrooms and white wine and the tender veal piccata two specials batted 500 the grilled veal chop was succulent and pink as ordered , but scampi in white wine and garlic were overcooked and dry at dessert time , skip the ordinary miniature pastries not made on the premises and try the homemade carrot

chicago , aug 10 in a case that has sent chills across this city , two boys , ages 7 and 8 , have been charged with murdering an 11yearold girl striking her with a rock , sexually molesting her and suffocating her with her own underwear apparently to take the bright blue bicycle she had been riding , the police said today juvenile justice experts said they knew of no case in which younger children had been prosecuted for murder in the united states prosecutors and the police said today that on sunday evening the boys confessed to the july 27 killing of ryan harris , an honorroll student who had just finished fifth grade after killing ryan in an alley behind a building on chicago s south side , they stashed her bicycle so they could retrieve it later , the police said then , they said , the 8yearold rode his bicycle home and watched cartoons and the 7yearold went home to play with a puppy today , the boys appeared for a probable cause hearing in juvenile court , their feet swaying above the floor as they sat before judge gerald t winiecki the 8yearold s lawyer had him stand on a chair at one point so a witness could see him better the 7yearold spent most of the hearing drawing hearts , a house and a rainbow with colored pens on one of his lawyer s yellow legal pads slayings by children in recent years have stunned the nation and led many states to take a tougher approach to juvenile crime chicago has seen several horrifying crimes involving children , including a 1994 case in which two boys , 10 and 11 , dropped a 5yearold boy to his death from the 14th floor of a housing project but the ryan harris case has struck an especially painful nerve in this era , the ages of these offenders is very frightening to hear about , said mayor richard m daley children are growing up much , much faster judge winiecki ruled there was probable cause to try the boys on juvenile charges in the slaying and ordered them held overnight at hartgrove hospital , a psychiatric hospital in chicago judge winiecki instructed reporters at the probable cause hearing not to disclose the boys' names the new york times had decided not to do so in court and at a news conference , the police and prosecutors described how they believe ryan was killed the police said the 8yearold boy knew ryan , who lived in the workingclass suburb of lynwood just south of the city but who was staying with a godmother in chicago s impoverished englewood neighborhood this summer so she could attend a day camp at a high school there they said that on july 27 , ryan and the 8yearold went to ride their bicycles around the high school and ended up in an alley behind a building there , the police said , they were met by the 7yearold , who was a friend of the 8yearold , and the boys began throwing rocks detective allen nathaniel testified today that the 7yearold told him he threw a rock that struck ryan in the back of the head and knocked her off her bicycle , apparently leaving her unconscious the detective testified that the 7yearold told him that the boys moved her bicycle to a wooded area about 20 feet away and they both took one arm of ryan and dragged her to the same wooded area then , the detective testified the 7yearold told him , they began to play with her he said they began to play with her 'very softly' he said they pulled her panties down after he

washington , sept 22 imagine placing your hardearned nest egg with an investment adviser who , in trading for your portfolio , uses a brokerage firm that pays his rent , gives him vouchers for rental cars , travel or theater tickets or buys new carpet for his office outrageous \? perhaps but according to a survey of brokerage and investment firms released here today by the securities and exchange commission , the practice is all too common in a longawaited report on the use and abuse of soft dollars , the commission rebates that investment firms receive for steering business to some brokerage firms , the sec reported that more than a quarter of the brokerage and investment advisory firms make questionable use of the money it did not name the firms as a result , many investors are probably paying bloated commissions which , in turn , lower their investment returns about 1 billion of research and other services are purchased annually with soft dollars , the report said the money is supposed to pay for research that will help investment managers put together portfolios for clients it can also go to buy items covered by a safe harbor , including publications or computer systems through which research is transmitted to a firm but an examination by the commission s office of compliance , inspections and examinations of 75 brokerage firms and 280 investment advisers found that 28 percent of investment advisers and 35 percent of brokerage firms provided or received items outside the safe harbor about 20 firms , or 7 percent of the investment advisers surveyed , engaged in egregious fraud by siphoning off softdollar money for undisclosed uses , said lori a richards , director of the compliance office under the quirks of securities laws , trading soft dollars for questionable goods or services is generally not illegal as long as there is full disclosure to investment clients but the commission found that almost none of the 28 percent of advisers who received questionable goods made adequate disclosure over all , only half the advisers examined described their softdollar practices in sufficient detail to allow their investment clients to understand what was going on the use of soft dollars is predicated on disclosure to the client , ms richards said , adding , but the disclosure is pretty inadequate at some firms , the people responsible for drawing up the disclosures were not aware of the softdollar deals being made by the firm s investment managers or other employees , she said not all of the questionable uses of soft dollars were as blatant as buying theater tickets others included paying a consultant to design a web site and renting a bloomberg machine for the marketing department s use one large investment firm spent 882 , 000 in client commissions to pay for 13 analyses of its own performance , which were then used to market its services to potential customers the report recommended that the commission adopt new recordkeeping and disclosure requirements for soft dollars and the commission s division of market regulation will seek to clarify which types and uses of electronic equipment bought with soft dollars conform to accepted research practices but the report stopped short of calling for a ban on any of the softdollar practices , and several of its recommendations were simply that the sec reiterate its current softdollar guidelines one of our goals is to make firms less likely to buy items that are outside the safe harbor by increasing their disclosure burden , ms richards said that cautious approach angered some critics representative john d dingell , the democrat from michigan who is the ranking minority member of the house commerce committee , said in a statement that the sec s recommendations for addressing the problems exposed by its report fall woefully short the sec has found serious , and in the case of disclosure , widespread violations and problems in what are known as softdollar practices , said mr dingell , who previously urged the sec to examine the issue the best and strongest recommendation is for better recordkeeping , but this requirement should have been on the books long ago , mr dingell said the rest of the commission s recommendations amount to stern and unenforceable lectures before the commission adopts any new rules concerning disclosure or other softdollar restrictions , it must put the proposals up for public comment therefore , some investment and brokerage firms might soon get a chance to directly comment on the commission s findings some industry groups , like the association for investment management and research , have already urged their members to disclose more about their softdollar practices linda rittenhouse , the association s vice president for regulatory affairs , said that several big investment advisers , including a handful of mutual fund companies , objected that some of its recommendations were burdensome and overbearing the sec proposals outlined are very much in keeping with what we recommended , ms rittenhouse said but i think we have n't heard the last word from the sec on the issue indeed , arthur levitt jr , chairman of the sec , said in an interview that the line between good and bad softdollar practices is much too narrow to suit me he added that he did not believe that soft dollars could be eliminated altogether , but said , i believe better disclosure and close enforcement attention is a step in the right direction one group that emerged from the report looking particularly clean was the mutual fund industry gene gohlke , associate director of the compliance office , said that the examinations found no mutual fund firms that had used soft dollars to buy products or services outside of the safeharbor provisions but some fund companies could do a better job of disclosing their softdollar practices , particularly to the funds' boards of directors , ms richards said
washington , jan 15 the man who has accused labor secretary alexis herman and his former business partner vanessa weaver of influence peddling was in turn accused today of a host of misdeeds , including sexual harassment , looting his business of 100 , 000 and blackmail as the countercharges flew , from lawyers for ms weaver , president clinton quickly rose to the defense of ms herman , whose nomination to the labor post was jeopardized last year over questions involving her ethics ms herman too appeared before television cameras to deny any wrongdoing before flying with the president to new york for a day of politicking the defense of ms herman and the counteroffensive on behalf of ms weaver came a day after the disclosure that the justice department was considering whether to ask for an independent counsel to examine the accusations by the businessman , laurent yene , a citizen of the african nation of cameroon who arrived in the united states five years ago mr yene has maintained that he and ms weaver arranged for kickbacks to ms herman when she headed the office of public liaison at the white house , before moving to the labor department ms herman and ms weaver are longtime friends whose relationship became an issue during the confirmation fight last year mr yene has said he and ms weaver tried to use that friendship to gain access to top white house officials for some of his clients , including one who was seeking a government license for a satellite telephone system mr yene s accusations are not completely new he made some of them last year to congressional investigators who were preparing for ms herman s confirmation proceeding but none ever figured in the hearings , presumably because investigators could not verify them on wednesday , though , mr yene added a new twist , saying he actually delivered an envelope of cash to ms herman at her home when she was a white house official today three of ms weaver s lawyers said mr yene s accusations were part of a vendetta that began shortly after he and ms weaver had ended a professional and personal relationship they lived together from 1994 until september 1996 , said one of the lawyers , jeffrey fried , who described mr yene as a con artist who had stolen about 100 , 000 from a company the couple owned together mr fried also accused mr yene of paying an american woman 60 , 000 to marry him so that he could obtain a green card that would allow him to work in the united states in addition , the lawyer said mr yene had met with him twice and demanded money to keep from making trouble for ms weaver and ms herman mr yene initially sought 250 , 000 , mr fried said , but then cut his demand in half ms weaver s lawyers also said they had court and police documents showing that since arriving in the united states five years ago , mr yene had been accused by several other women of sexual harassment the company that mr yene and ms weaver owned has been sued by one of the women mr yene , 42 , could not be reached for comment clint jackson , a washington lawyer who has represented him , did not return telephone calls ms weaver s lawyers say they have been unable to find him to serve him papers related to a new lawsuit that accuses him of misappropriation and slander officials involved in the justice department review involving ms herman said they had been aware of the accusations against mr yene but had nonetheless undertaken the inquiry because the law that provides for appointment of independent counsels sets so low a threshold the law requires that the justice department open a preliminary investigation if it finds specific evidence of a serious crime from a credible source clinton administration officials said ms herman would ultimately be exonerated asked about the influencepeddling accusations before leaving for new york with her , the president replied , i do n't believe that for a minute shortly before the trip , ms herman issued a statement on the front steps of the labor department and vowed to cooperate with the inquiry i want you to know that these allegations are not true , she said , refusing to take any questions on the matter ms herman and ms weaver , a consultant and lobbyist who has made large contributions to the democratic party , have known each other for more than a decade ms weaver bought ms herman s management consulting firm for 88 , 000 in 1993 , shortly before ms herman joined the government the justice department review is focusing on the relationship they had when ms herman was the white house public liaison , a period in which ms weaver took several clients and business associates with important issues before the government to meet ms herman in may 1996 , ms weaver and mr yene introduced ms herman to a singapore businessman , abdul rahman mr rahman soon became a 15 , 000amonth client of the couple , retaining them to help line up support for a government license for a 560 million satellite communications venture being developed by a small washington company , mobile communications holdings inc white house officials say ms herman never intervened in the matter , although records suggest that someone in her office made contact with the federal communications commission about the bid for a license , which was ultimately denied during ms herman s confirmation proceedings last year , mr yene told congressional investigators and reporters of several news organizations , including the new york times , about his business dealings with ms weaver at the time , he never made any accusations about handing ms herman cash and he said he had no documentation to support an accusation he did make that he and ms weaver had promised to kick back to ms herman 10 percent of the fees from clients to whom she was introduced among the other news organizations that mr yene approached last year were the washington post , usa today and abc news on wednesday evening , brian ross of abc broke the story that the justice department began a review of mr yene s accusations last fall mr ross said in an interview today that he took mr yene to the justice department last fall , at mr yene s request , and introduced him to an official there to outline the charges against ms herman and ms weaver that involvement was criticized today by one of ms weaver s lawyers , e lawrence barcella , who said abc had initiated an investigation and had then proceeded to play it up , leading the evening newscast with it it s quite apparent what s gone on here , mr barcella said they walk yene into the justice department , trigger an independent counsel review under a legal standard that is incredibly low and then , wham , promote this big exclusive story about an independent counsel review mr ross said today that he could not comment on details but that the network was preparing a report to explain how it had handled the yene case photo president clinton and labor secretary alexis herman joined jesse jackson yesterday at a rainbow coalition conference in new york \( andrea mohin the new york times \)

the premise was simple enough now that i am closer to my second childhood than to the first one , would i be able to find any spaces as dark , dank and nurturing as the poolrooms of my adolescence \? it was in these vaguely disreputable parlors , up stairways or below street level , that at the age of 15 i found refuge from the purposefulness of school , from dreams of glory and fears of failure , and though i probably did n't realize it , from the looming rituals of sex and courtship once you walked into places like the long defunct one on burnside avenue in the bronx , you were immediately comforted by the notion that your parents would not be happy if they knew you were there it was n't quite like running away to join apache dancers in marseilles , or visiting a joss house , but the poolroom had an unmistakable yet acceptable touch of the sinister that was so alluring back then , when we were in a hurry to grow up and used forged draft cards to buy beer we were exploring various sins , and the pool hall was indeed an academy of more than just billiards like so many of the old haunts , the place on burnside had cuspidors , brass or chrome bowls on the floor that were also known as spittoons men walked in to take numbers almost everybody smoked and put out the cigarettes on the floor a lot of people were passing through before graduating to jobs , college , women , but some stayed longer we knew who the lifers were , and we were not quite sure whether we were impressed or scared by them the man who ran the place was a muscular , bigbellied man named ralph , who wore a sleeveless undershirt i used to associate with the actor burt lancaster but today would make more sense on the model kate moss he dispensed wisdom and lore he would tell us about wonderful hustles in which sharks who were on the lemonade that is , people who were hiding their own true speed by pretending to play worse than they could suckered fishes into highstakes games he would tell us about the guy in thick glasses who attracted attention by holding out a 10dollar bill and asking for change for a 5 he would tell us about the legendary ralph greenleaf , who played in the 30 s i am particularly grateful to him for repeatedly telling me that i was never going to be any good , that i had no heart and that all things considered i should concentrate on my schoolwork in those days we would visit pool halls in many boroughs , watching games of eight ball , nine ball , pocket apiece , captivated by fierce matchups downtown , in more ornate places like julian s on 14th street and mcgirr s on times square , where women , then known as girls , would rack up the balls at the start of each frame , we watched games in which losers paid out with thick wads and we learned lessons that went beyond applied geometry and vector analysis to human nature we learned about who we could trust a lot and who we should trust less we realized that some people who could win when they had nothing riding on the game often lost when the stakes went up , while others did much better for money than for fun we also learned that there were people who used a lot of english on their stories , and that just because this kind of thing was fun to listen to , you did n't have to believe all of it well , that was then what about now \? the search centered on greenwich village , the east village and chelsea , where the yellow pages showed a relatively large concentration of billiard parlors , though far fewer than there used to be the first stop was fat cat at 75 christopher street , just off sheridan square it was promisingly subterranean , as cut off from the world as a mine but there were patches of dayglo light , two pingpong tables at two of the eight pool tables being used , pairs of young women played against each other at two other tables men were playing with women on what appeared to be dates back in the 50 s , this was unthinkable moreover , there were no longer any overhead strands of beads with which one kept score raising your stick and moving 3 , 4 or maybe even 10 beads over to mark a run used to be a matter of delight , accomplished with a flourish now , players just rotated a dial on the end of the table with their thumbs to keep track of the balls they sank it s much harder to rub it in this way than by flicking the overhead markers so that everybody in the place can see what was what also , no one seemed to bang the heels of their sticks on the floor to signal appreciation of an opponent s good shot finally , the cd s on the jukebox played all the time when pool rooms had spittoons , they did not have jukeboxes a friend accompanying me on this exploratory ramble was young enough to advise me that the music was being performed by the artist formerly known as prince , the fine young cannibals and the eurythmics we played eight ball my stroke had disappeared over the previous four decades , but i was sure it would come back i told myself it was like riding a bicycle at least i did n't rip the felt we played for a while and then wandered over to soho billiard , off houston street at 298 mulberry street , a groundfloor establishment with big picture windows we asked for a table smoking or non \?

for most musicians who make it into the rockandroll hall of fame , the induction ceremony is a deep breath of satisfaction after a career s uphill climb here is what happened to lloyd price at last week s ceremony his name did n't appear in the advertisements for the show his request to be introduced by old friends isaac hayes and kenny gamble was rejected in favor of a young singer with more cashregister appeal \( tony rich \) his acceptance speech was not put in the teleprompter , and unlike those of the eagles or fleetwood mac , his remarks were cut short on tv even his trophy was damaged he had to hold up a borrowed one for the cameras the rock industry , of course , has the attention span of a threeminute song last week s hit is passe last year s act is a joke considering that it has been almost half a century since mr price s pulsating first hit , lawdy miss clawdy , pierced the color line and made it to the white side of the pop charts , mr price understands why many younger rock listeners have never heard of him and so , having waited for years while other seminal figures from the world of 1950 s rhythmandblues made it into the hall of fame , mr price chose not to seethe about a succession of slights instead , he did what he became famous for he picked up the microphone and let loose a rackety version of his biggest hit , stagger lee , backed by the likes of john fogerty and allen toussaint , that many critics considered the evening s highlight even at the beginning , i always figured the next hit would be the last one i ever had , said mr price , 62 , joking about it all a few days later in the stateoftheart digital recording studio in the basement of his home in the high westchester suburb of pound ridge i was n't expecting nothing else , and i do n't expect nothing right now i just laugh and go about my business , and things usually work out it was precisely this kind of determined nonchalance and a warmth that comes through on every single that kept mr price s life from becoming one of those hardluck blues songs about a struggling black artist reduced to obscurity by white businessmen beyond his music , mr price s lasting gift to the industry may have been his living proof that black highschool dropouts from new orleans can become financially successful in a treacherous business through pure savvy and force of will when other performers were signing away rights and royalties , mr price kept his , even forming his own publishing companies and record labels when other acts had to beg and bribe nightclubs for attention , he built his own club , lloyd price s turntable , at 52d street and broadway , on the site of the old birdland none of this endeared him to the recording industry , which saw him as a dangerous maverick , and mr price and his supporters suspect it may have had something to do with his treatment by the hall of fame suzan evans , executive director of the hall s foundation , said that nothing of the kind was true and that she was surprised to hear mr price felt insulted but jack newfield , who has written several new york post columns lamenting the industry s neglect of mr price , called him the curt flood of rockandroll , the rebel who showed a generation of musicians how to stand up for themselves i never wanted a manager or an agent , because i wanted to understand myself what the business was all about , mr price said it was more than a show and maybe that was resented down through the years , because i'm the one who slipped through the crack it s been that way since mr price s childhood in kenner , la , in the 1930 s one of 11 children of a laborer and his wife , he was carrying 15pound blocks of ice on his back by age 7 and dreaming of how music might lift him to a place where klansmen did n't roam the night in sheets at 17 , when he was discovered by the great rb producer dave bartholomew , he asked his parents to emancipate him in court , allowing him to make his own contracts the insistent plea of lawdy miss clawdy can still be heard above fats domino s piano and through the churning mono of the recording the song brought thousands of white kids into a new world truly , that s one of the reasons why i got drafted in the service , he said it was a revolution underground that nobody could stop the lady at the draft board said washington wanted me in the army their children were dancing to 'lawdy miss clawdy' whatever the reason , the effect of his service was to stop his music until 1955 when he returned , he had been supplanted by a frenetic piano player whom he had recommended to his label little richard so mr price threw himself into new hits like stagger lee and personality his star and many others faded with the arrival of the beatles , after which he opened a club and joined with boxing promoter don king in 1974 to present the famous match between george foreman and mr price s teenage friend muhammad ali during the 1980 s , he turned his energies to building subsidized housing in the bronx , producing about 70 units in the tremont section but nothing else provided the thrill of making records , and he is now finishing work

imagine the world s strongest foursome one table whom would you expect \? perhaps the top players , as measured by the world bridge federation that would include two americans , bob wolff and bob hamman , whose longtime partnership recently dissolved measuring performance in the last 10 years , there would be two other americans , eric rodwell and jeff meckstroth , whose partnership is very much alive judged by lifetime performance , two italians , benito garozzo and pietro forquet , can claim seats the top women , judged similarly , would be the american kerri sanborn and the englishwoman sandra landy but if strongest means most influential , one could invoke the shades of dwight d eisenhower , winston churchill , mohandas k gandhi and deng xiaoping if one defines strength in terms of financial power , there would be no contest a game was played in seattle in june at the home of bill gates of microsoft , whose guests included warren e buffett of berkshire hathaway , one of his two closest rivals for the title of world s wealthiest man the third was katharine graham , the former publisher of the washington post the fourth was sharon osberg , gates s bridge teacher , who contributed master points rather than cash to the total around the table everyone was so enthusiastic that the game went on for seven hours none of the deals proved memorable on another occasion osberg , south on the diagramed layout , outwitted buffett , who was west but her play would have fooled many a world champion the contract was six notrump , reached simply when north made a strong rebid , south used blackwood en route to slam the opening heart lead was won with dummy s ace south counted 11 tricks , and saw that the 12th would probably have to come from the diamond suit this requires a guess about the location of the ace and queen most players would postpone the guess until late in the play , which is often the right strategy but it is not right here south s best chance of making a diamond trick is to play the suit immediately obviously the result is predetermined if both the ace and the queen are in the same hand , so south simply worries about split honors there are two expert strategies one is to lead the 10 from dummy at the second trick , with the reasonable expectation that east will cover with the queen if he has it playing low would permit the declarer to take two diamond tricks with a holding headed by acejack or kingjack osberg followed a second path by leading low from dummy and putting up the king this lost to the ace , but west had no idea that east held the queen he played a second heart , and south was now able to bring her backup plan into action she took the heart king and ran five club winners to reach this ending diagram the lead of the last club squeezed east , and the slam was made in spite of the misguess in diamonds diagram
how do investors in internet stocks feel this year \? \) that , for the less technologically attuned , is not a garble but the symbol used by the digerati when they want to crack an online grin despite a recent pullback in such stocks , these investors have many reasons to smile to name just a few , the online bookseller amazoncom is up 401 percent so far this year , the search engine provider yahoo has risen 657 percent and doubleclick , an online advertising agency , is up 322 percent from its public offering on feb 20 people committed to mutual fund investing can also benefit from such returns unbeknown to most , there are three tiny funds that focus on internet stocks the munder netnet fund , the www internet fund and the internet fund each has a track record of more than a year now which in the realm of cyberspace passes for a long time the big question , however , is whether any investor really needs such a fund after all , it is not as though other funds have been ignoring internetrelated stocks have all these informationtechnology and communications funds overlooked the internet \? asked an incredulous michael stolper , a financial adviser in san diego is it very thoughtful of them to create something more specific or is this marketing run amok \? he asked about the specialized internet funds but internet fund managers say this is an idiosyncratic business that can benefit from special attention the internet is such a young industry that it s often impossible to use traditional valuation methods , said paul cook , comanager of the munder fund many of these names are really storydriven if , in fact , it is only marketing , the funds need a new ad campaign none has more than 8 million in assets , and they are therefore not listed in the mutual fund tables of the new york times or of many other newspapers the ride in these funds can be wild , too despite the 464 percent return of the www internet fund over the 12 months ended april 17 , for example , the fund was basically flat for all of 1997 a result of doubledigit losses in the fourth quarter \( the average technology fund returned 411 percent over the 12 months , and 84 percent in 1997 , according to morningstar inc , the financial publisher in chicago \) but with minimum investment requirements of 1 , 000 , the funds are a cheap way to get exposure to a highflying sector , without betting it all on a single stock the most challenging thing in picking internet stocks is going to be figuring out who is going to be around two years from now , said michael stout , senior analyst at morningstar munder netnet , with 8 million in assets , is the largest of the three funds , and its fund complex , munder capital management , based in birmingham , mich , is well known most of its other funds are sold through brokers and carry loads , or sales charges , but netnet is a noload fund that is marketed directly to investors over the internet this also might explain its puny assets seven munder portfolio managers , some of whom work on other funds , run the portfolio and the fund takes a broad view of its investing universe for companies to be considered for inclusion , they have to be directly involved in building out the internet or be seen as a prime beneficiary of internet trends , said paul cook , one of the managers an example is cisco systems , which makes , among other kinds of computer hardware , switches that allow computers to communicate with one another over the world wide web a big portion of the company s sales , however , is not directly related to the internet the fund s other 40 or so stocks include microsoft , which gets only a tiny fraction of its revenues from the internet , and n2k inc which sells cd s on line another big holding is cendant , whose business includes sales of everything from books to cars over the internet its stock fell 46 percent on april 16 after the company disclosed accounting irregularities owning relatively established companies like microsoft and cisco is intended to lend stability to the portfolio we bring a conservative background to investing in a space that seems on the surface to be unconservative , said steven appledorn , another manager of the fund the www internet fund is managed by lawrence york of www advisors in lexington , ky , and is registered for sale in 20 states , including california and new york the fund has no load but charges a steep 05 percent 12b1 annual marketing fee like munder netnet , it owns about 40 stocks and has a broad mandate we believe the internet will cause a convergence of broadcasting , data and telecommunications , mr york said , so he invests in these areas he tries to reduce risk by dividing assets among three tiers of companies , which he refers to as adolescent , midlife or mature , based on factors like their market dominance and the breadth of their business lines his mature holdings include cisco systems and microsoft one midlife company is qualcomm , a maker of communications systems and email software and an adolescent is checkfree , which makes software used to process electronic payments among these four , it is the company most closely tied to the web the purest play on hardcore internet stocks is the internet fund for a company to be considered for our portfolio , they have to derive a large majority of their revenue on or from the internet , said ryan jacob , the fund s manager who is also director of research for ipo value monitor , a research firm in new york that specializes in initial public offerings mr jacob was named to run the 18monthold fund , whose investment adviser is kinetics asset management of north babylon , ny , just last december of the 25 stocks in the fund s portfolio , the biggest holding is cmg information services , a venture capital company that invests in internet startups other big stakes are in yahoo , the search engine with one of the strongest brand names on the web , and eggheadcom , formerly egghead inc , which has abandoned traditional retailing to sell its goods almost entirely over the internet mr jacob said egghead s internet sales roughly doubled , to 2 million a week , in the first three months of the year most of the internet companies have gone public over the last two or three years , and we have followed these companies from the venture capital stage through their ipo s , he said most are still not profitable , but the underlying fundamentals are exceptionally strong , mr jacob added revenue growth has been 50 percent to 100 percent quarter to quarter very few industries can boast that kind of growth chart wired wonders \? the total returns on three funds that market themselves as internet offerings munder netnet , www internet , the

washington , oct 8 the nato effort to persuade the yugoslav president , slobodan milosevic , to back down is following a clear track , senior american and nato officials said today it is designed to ratchet up the political and military pressure , while providing him various opportunities to change his mind first , the american envoy , richard c holbrooke , will try to win mr milosevic s compliance during a lastditch mission to belgrade beginning on friday if mr holbrooke fails or if his mission is protracted , nato countries will vote within days to increase his leverage by giving the last required permission to the nato supreme commander , the gen wesley k clark , to begin air strikes against serb positions and troops that goahead known as an activation order requires the unanimous vote of all 16 nato members afterwards , general clark could proceed on his own timetable but first nato intends to make a significant display of its preparations the forward deployment of attack aircraft , for instance the military plan has already been agreed upon a series of phased attacks , intensifying at each step , with pauses built in to allow mr milosevic and his military commanders to back down the last phase an intensive attack on military installations anywhere in serbia may require another nato political vote first , the officials say the same pattern held true when nato bombed mr milosevic to the bargaining table in 1995 , over bosnia , and nato never did have to go to the final stage of its attack if mr milosevic simply intends to defy the international community , nato s goal will be to destroy his capacity to inflict violent repression on the kosovars , mr clinton s national security adviser , samuel r berger , said mr milosevic s main backing is in the security forces and special police , not in the regular yugoslav military , which is not likely to want to have its expensive aircontrol and command systems blasted by nato nato aims not to destroy mr milosevic but to persuade him to comply the point , a senior nato official said , is to negotiate and to get aid to refugees nato has no intention of going to war against serbia or on behalf of an independent kosovo , the official said mr milosevic , the administration official said , has pulled out of kosovo only about 60 percent of the troops and special police that nato is insisting leave mr milosevic must withdraw the forces sent into kosovo since february and keep in barracks the forces normally stationed in kosovo , the officials said before february , there were 12 , 500 troops in kosovo and about 6 , 500 special police , american officials said there are now about 18 , 000 troops and 11 , 000 special police , the officials said , and while some of the troops are in barracks , none of the special police are if mr milosevic complies , nato wants clear procedures to monitor his continued compliance , so that his troops do not pour back in to kosovo to do that , the west will need more than the 50 or so diplomatic observers currently in kosovo some nato countries feel strongly that a number of nato ground troops must be used , in addition to troops from other organizations , for adequate monitoring american officials , reluctant to put american ground troops into kosovo , oppose the use of nato troops , though the use of nato aircraft and intelligencegathering is foreseen it is only in the last few days that mr milosevic has begun to take seriously nato s threat to use force , the administration official said the nato official was blunter milosevic does n't doubt nato s capacity to carry out these attacks , but he does doubt our will we have to convince him the question becomes whether you just have to shout more loudly , or actually hit him before he gets the point
why are images of men in movies these days so desolate when it comes to real love , real sex , real families , real children and real work \? why has the art form become so detached from what is true and good \? why has our collective imagination concerning the male sex become so perverse and hallucinogenic \? in short , why has the film industry declared an open hunting season on men \? if you 're like me , eager for a rush of inspiration that comes from seeing a manifestation of something heroic , excellent or at least a little dignified on the silver screen , 1997 was a disappointing year for representations of manhood men first ! leave the women and children behind , an impulse embodied by one of the primary characters in titanic , is not an uplifting message under those jeans is something wonderful waiting to get out , a concept at the heart of boogie nights , produces no surge of pride certainly there was no character around like the honorable clark gable in it happened one night , who does n't take advantage of the affianced claudette colbert \( you better go back to your bed \) some of the worst offenders in this regard were films declared by critics to be among the year s best here , for example , is a short list of acclaimed pictures over the last six months that sucked the soul out of my body , registering zero on my epiphany scale in the company of men , in which the male characters not only do n't protect those who are vulnerable , they prey on them these men are callous , vulgar , egocentric and manipulative they lie they cheat they do n't even show respect for their mothers you want to kill them the only flush of pleasure you get from this movie is in leaving the theater and reciting the incantation god forbid that life should imitate art boogie nights , that foxy exhibitionist of a film in which the human body , the english language and a prurient audience are reduced to their bare minimum and burt reynolds , a fatherly neoaristotelian philosopher of sleaze , lectures on one of the great , elevating aims of life to hold an audience after the climax the ice storm , a story of suburban families living in a 1970 s sodom and gomorrah , where the needdriven adults are turned on by the idea of being adolescents again and having whatever they want the only heroic or even mature men in the movie are historical figures alluded to in conversation the high point is an attempt at crossgenerational dialogue hi son , i'm back from my trip oh , were you gone \? only slightly more uplifting were the epiphanic fakes , mockheroic movies about manhood that offered some cheap thrills but little genuine rapture from the cultural right there was the edge \( let s call it the ceo fights the bear \) , about the moral and intellectual superiority of wealthy men and their manifest destiny to lead lost in the alaskan wilderness with two clueless pros from the fashion world , anthony hopkins \( the ceo \) is courageous , selfsacrificing , farsighted he knows how to fish , trap , find the true direction , flavor meat with gunpowder , start a fire with ice , polish shoes with banana peels and best of all , he knows how to kill the bear perhaps the most startling scene is the moment when one of the other two men , an africanamerican wearing dreadlocks \( harold perrineau \) , is instructed by hopkins to do something useful make a spear a basic message of the edge , it seems , is that dominance hierarchies are natural , with youknowwho at the top not much cause for celebration the movie blows up this particular image of manhood until you wish it would just explode from the cultural center came the safe air force one , a publicspirited pipe dream starring an impeccably valiant harrison ford as commander in chief and family man with baseball glove and medal of honor in hand , he flies the presidential plane and defends the world against hollywood s latest \( and rather vaguely defined \) communistislamicmale monsters and from the cultural left there was a life less ordinary a spoiled rich girl played by cameron diaz is kidnapped by a white workingclass man \( ewan mcgregor \) who has lost his job to a robot she is the one who shows us what masculinity used to be all about as the kidnapper cooks , faints , cries , wants to get married and finds it difficult to cope , she is unsentimental , calculating and in control she chops wood and drinks him under the table go in hard and fast , she tells him you 're going to be a success when he finally takes a bullet for her , they fall madly in love this film is witty \( men only want one thing they may want it more than once , but it is still only one thing \) and manages to offer the viewer some perverse pleasure , even a kind of romance , in the idea that a blatant reversal of traditional gender images is better than no gender images at all but with all the juggling of stereotypes , virtue tends to get lost such movies certainly do n't induce a sense of masculine pride in the male viewer they induce anxiety , as one begins to wonder whether the only way to be a male hero these days is to be a billionaire , the president of the united states or a woman that s fine if you 're rich , presidential or a woman , but it offers little hope of salvation for most men
jerusalem , april 29 it has been the fashion among israelis on this 50th anniversary of their state to feign indifference to the jubilee , and israeli commentators have expended considerable ink in analyzing why they explain it as a reaction to the difficulty of celebrating when driving into a shopping mall still requires a security check , when unemployment is high , when the most bitter conflicts are no longer with the arabs , but among jews between believers and nonbelievers , between right and left , between messianic believers in settling the land of israel and those who would trade land for peace they note that after 50 years , there is still no peace dennis ross , the indefatigable american mediator , is back in israel for what seems the thousandth time , still searching for a way to extract the oslo process from the thickening mud of mutual distrust , and prime minister benjamin netanyahu snarls defiantly , i will not capitulate to the us not surprisingly , this tangle of problems and passions is reflected in the variety of events and demonstrations for independence day , which began this evening with fireworks , rock concerts and parties around the country the director of the jubilee program , doron shmueli , banned any reference to the oslo peace agreements from the official celebrations on thursday , prompting loud protests from the left reform and conservative jews plan to bring men and women to pray together at the western wall , in defiance of orthodox strictures rightwing israelis plan to mark the anniversary by laying the cornerstone for the contentious jewish housing project in har homa , in arabdominated eastern jerusalem leftwing forces are calling for mass demonstrations to oppose them all this might well explain why the israelis are approaching their jubilee with a strong ambivalence yet anyone who has lived in israel also knows that complaining and selfsearching are a venerable tradition among the jews , long preceding their state for every gripe , there is also a blueandwhite israeli flag fluttering from a passing car or gracing a house and when pressed , israelis will acknowledge a profound pride verging on awe in which they hold the remarkable achievement many say miracle that is israel today grumbling is an integral part of israel s story , the historian tom segev wrote in the newspaper haaretz but israel at 50 seems to be one of the greatest success stories of the century in the same paper , the columnist yoel marcus presented a detailed list of the problems that drive israelis to view themselves as a poor , forlorn samson nonetheless , he concluded , we are still here , a small but devilishly clever nation , a small country with the soul of a superpower if there is indifference , argued zeev chafets , a columnist for the jerusalem report , it may well be toward the woefully mismanaged and politicized official program , and not the anniversary itself maturity , and not malaise , is the reason that people are n't fired up by the official jubilee festivities , he wrote most israelis are very proud of this remarkable country , and not a few of us are in love with it on independence day , and throughout the year , we will celebrate israel s 50th at the beach and in synagogues , at intimate dinner parties and outdoor rock concerts we may even drop in on some official ceremony but do n't count on it in interviews with men and women who remember that friday afternoon of may 14 , 1948 , when david bengurion read out the declaration of independence in tel aviv , many were troubled by various aspects of the state that has evolved the bitter conflicts among jews , the absence of peace but they were unanimous in voicing wonder that a people dispersed for 2 , 000 years in 140 countries , speaking 100 tongues , managed to return to their ancient homeland and to start speaking its ancient language i did n't think that in 50 years we would have five million hebrewspeaking people , with such industry , agriculture , research and development , nor that we would have five wars , and win them , said shimon peres , the former prime minister , who was at bengurion s side when the state was declared only by looking past the daily crises and disputes is it possible to truly assess the magnitude of that feat from 600 , 000 embattled jews in 1948 , many traumatized survivors of a concerted effort to eradicate their people from the face of the earth , israel has grown into a strong and prosperous country of almost 6 million from a struggling patchwork of communal farms , it developed into a global power in high technology , with a percapita income approaching that of some european countries from a makeshift militia battling against enormous odds , it shaped a regional military superpower even the founding legends have matured beyond recognition the same northern swamps that were drained so the embattled pioneers could eke out a subsistence are now being refilled by a nation sufficiently prosperous to care for its ecology

gertrude of stony island avenue by james purdy 182 pp new york william morrow company 1995 what ever happened to james purdy \? though his early fiction earned him wide recognition some 40 years ago as an author of major stature , he has been all but absent from the american literary scene for a decade or more his recent books , while appearing to considerable acclaim in britain , have been accorded scant attention on these shores , where they have seen print thanks mostly to the efforts of relatively small publishing houses gertrude of stony island avenue is vintage purdy a slim , dialogueheavy book consisting of short chapters and paragraphs , purdy s 16th novel bears a particularly strong resemblance to his third , the nephew \( 1960 \) in that book , a retired smalltown schoolteacher named alma sets out to compose a memoir of her recently deceased nephew , who lived with her and her brother , only to realize that she never really knew him at all in the new novel , an aging , timid chicago woman named carrie kinsella who , like alma and many other purdy characters , leads a grim , uneventful deathinlife begins taking notes about her daughter , gertrude , a famous artist who died two years earlier always uneasy with gertrude s flamboyant carnality , the specifics of which she never wished to know , carrie now finds herself reflecting that her daughter at least lived , while she has not lived at all \( carrie , by the way , was also the name of a libidinous windy city painter in purdy s 1964 novel , cabot wright begins \) fearing that she failed her daughter and chagrined that they never loved each other though this , she says , was the one thing both of us wanted carrie becomes obsessed with learning as much as she can about gertrude s life , which was mostly a mystery to her over the objections of her husband , vic , and despite her own delicate constitution \( she is constantly taking smelling salts \) , carrie determines that she has found her life s purpose in dead vanished gertrude love , death , family , emotional estrangement these are among purdy s major themes , and few writers have written less sentimentally about any of them in purdy s world , the absence of love can be a source of agony but then , so can its presence the family , time and again , is the context within which that agony is lived out day by day , and the setting beyond which a protagonist must journey in search of illumination , intimacy and identity yet here , as is routinely the case in purdy , that search yields ambiguous results carrie s quest leads her into the orbits of one offbeat personage after another vic s sister , gwendolyn , a worldly expatriate who , like gertrude , has lived evelyn mae , a rich cryptographer and literary scholar who likens carrie to demeter , the earth mother who lost her daughter persephone to the king of the underworld and cy mellerick , a young lawyer who bears an uncanny resemblance to carrie s longdead first love these encounters are marked by an odd inconclusiveness though they seem to point toward certain developments and resolutions , loose ends accumulate gwendolyn initiates an ambitious effort to help carrie , yet returns abruptly to europe gestures of selfrevelation are made , but real interpersonal knowledge remains elusive we none of us , i'm afraid , know anybody or know one another , says alma s brother boyd in the nephew , and the line would not be out of place in gertrude , in which carrie s friendships , for all their peculiar intensity , remain in some sense unconsummated , like flirtations in feverish dreams a truth that purdy seeks to underscore here and one that is central to his fiction is that even lives that seem thoroughly banal are far more mysterious , far harder to understand and to explain , than most of us recognize or acknowledge as carrie puts it , behind all this tame , insipid life we were leading on stony island avenue , there was in existence something after all mysterious , strange , and yes frightening to touch another person s life , in short , is to touch a mystery \( no veteran of purdy s fiction will find the title of his new novel puzzling , by the way for in purdy s world , every heart is a stone and every man an island \) another essential truth for purdy is that language must play a role in any attempt to shed light on that mystery carrie discovers early on that she is not the only member of her family who has turned to writing in an effort to make sense of things first she finds gertrude s record book soon afterward , she runs across a stupendously long catalogue , entitled an index of the forgotten items of america , that vic has been secretly compiling for decades yet both works are incomplete and the latter seems crushingly pathetic in its failure or should one focus not on the failure but on the heroic scale of the effort \? the answer , like much else here , is deliberately unclear in the end , all that is certain is that purdy is as profoundly conflicted as ever about the ability of writing to penetrate mystery words , after all , may serve as much to conceal as to convey the essence of a self , of life , of the world certainly this is the way they are often used by purdy s characters , whose conversation , as tony tanner has observed , reflects the ways in which words can take the place of emotion , providing an illusion of communication when they are in fact obscuring or distorting what we have to say the use of language to conceal is , indeed , a recurring motif in gertrude both the narration and the dialogue are written in english that is often stilted purdy s characters eschew contractions , interject phrases like by george and employ oldfashioned words like tomfoolery one might almost conclude that gertrude is set in some bygone time except for the fact that one of vic s favorite words is confab \( these kinds of mixed signals are typical of purdy , whose design is , in part , to keep readers constantly offbalance \) by using formal , antiquated language , purdy draws attention to the artificiality of civilized society and reminds us of the dark human realities that churn beneath its surface moreover , the occasional deliberate awkwardnesses \( when carrie , reaching an epiphany , feels she is descending , demeterlike , into the underworld , she says not the farther i descended , the darker it grew but more fearful darkness increased with my continued descent \) have an effect rather like that of a subtly warped camera lens they invite us to attend more carefully to the way the elements of the world around us actually interconnect , as opposed to the ways in which familiar social and literary conventions have conditioned us to perceive that world and there s the rub many readers are so thoroughly accustomed to more conventional means of seeing and representing that they may well dismiss a book like gertrude as simply puzzling , offputting , weird this is unfortunate , for purdy is a powerful writer whose work deserves a far wider readership in his own country than it has enjoyed in recent years to be sure , his insistence on setting his fiction on evershifting ground , his combination of compassion and ardor with an absolute rejection of any sentimental impulse , and his consistent refusal to tie up the loose ends can prove frustrating even to highly sophisticated readers but most people with lively minds will find the rewards of purdy s art to be worth the effort it is to be hoped that the publication of gertrude of stony island avenue will draw more such readers to this singular american visionary drawing
southport , england , july 14 scott hoch stood by the 18th green today at the royal birkdale golf club with his hands in his pockets trying to stay warm he looked as if he had just stepped out of a refrigerator the chilly weather is a major reason hoch , one of golf s most consistent money makers , has only played in two british opens since he joined the pga tour in 1980 hoch does not like cold weather he does not like the st andrews golf course , one of the fabled sites on the british open rotation and because hoch believes in speaking his mind and playing where he chooses , his decision to shun the british open in past years to play in warmweather tournaments in the united states has not made him a fan favorite in europe but when hoch signed a fiveyear contract with yonex last winter , one of the stipulations called for hoch to play in all four major championships , including the british open so there was hoch today at his third british open , dealing with the elements , dealing with probing questions and preparing for the year s third major , which begins thursday morning as usual , hoch was candid while he was impressed with the royal birkdale layout , he was not pleased with temperatures in the 50 s and winds gusting to 25 miles an hour all things considered , hoch would rather play golf near his home in orlando , fla but would n't it be interesting if hoch , the reluctant british open player , won his first major at the tournament that he has avoided so often \? that would show that god has a sense of humor , hoch said , smiling at the thought i thought that might happen , until i got over here and saw the weather this is not my type of weather i'm not sure it s anybody s type of weather but i'm not just here trying to go through the motions i 've always felt i 've had a game good enough to win hoch s game has been good enough to win eight tournaments on the pga tour and six tournaments internationally during a successful and steady career from 1994 through 1997 , only tom lehman , phil mickelson , davis love 3d and greg norman earned more on tour than hoch , who took in slightly more than 4 million yet , hoch has never won a major , and his biggest disappointment came during the 1989 masters , when he missed a twofoot putt that would have won on the first playoff hole , and eventually lost to nick faldo in his two previous british opens , hoch missed the cut in 1990 and tied for 68th in 1995 so , winning here this year , at age 42 , would rank as the highlight of his career a lot of people think the british open is the most important tournament in the world , hoch said the atmosphere you ca n't beat there s none other like it that s the part i 've missed by not playing the crowds are probably the most knowledgeable of all we play this and augusta they 're very supportive of their game over here but not everyone in the galleries this week will be supporting hoch , who has become an easy target because of his infrequent appearances yet , most people were polite to hoch during today s practice rounds a couple of them said , 'we better get your autograph , because you 're not here that much , ' hoch said hoch believes some of the criticism has been unfair he has traditionally done well in summer events on the pga tour played opposite the british open , and traveling to europe in midsummer more often would have forced hoch to miss some of his favorite events this is my time of year where i make hay , hoch said when you play over here , it s very difficult to play in any tournament before or after plus , i love hot weather my hands seem to lose feeling quicker than other guys i 've had them checked for circulation problems , but they have n't found anything so hoch has skipped the british open , and he has taken the heat for it asked if he would have played this year s open if not for his contract , hoch smiled and said i'm not sure maybe i would have just the grief i have taken alone may have made me come but i'm not an actor who can go and play up to people , just because i want to change their opinion i'm truthful i get myself into trouble being honest other guys , you ask them a question , they 're going to skirt the issue some other guys out here are a lot different to the press than what they really are i would n't say they were actors , but they know how to play the game that s one class i missed in school asked if yonex would expect him to play the british open in 2000 at st andrews , a course that hoch still loathes , hoch said i 've already let them know there s an upcoming british that i was n't going to play in i 'll probably have to do something for them , maybe go to japan but i'm sure they would n't want me to play where i do n't care to play but this week , hoch plans to make the best of his experience when the interview ended , he went back to signing autographs , hoping the british fans understood that his past absences were nothing personal he also hoped for warmer weather by thursday if conditions are like this , it 'll be difficult for me , hoch said all i know is , it s warmer in orlando photo scott hoch , who as a rule shuns the british open because of the chilly climate , practicing yesterday on the royal birkdale golf club course \( associated press \)

atlanta , july 6 at the atlanta botanical garden , they have been anticipating this event like the flight of kahoutek curators and security guards have been standing watch around the clock web sites and telephone lines have been updated daily to keep the citizenry informed for more than a week , enthusiasts have trekked through the lobby of the fuqua conservatory , cameras in hand , in order to monitor and record the progress and then on saturday afternoon , days before anyone expected it to happen , the world s largest and perhaps rarest flowering plant , the amorphophallus titanum , began to bloom in botanical terms , this is not unlike the birth of a giant panda at the national zoo only six times in history , including once last month at the fairchild tropical garden in miami , has the plant flowered in cultivation in this country and the curators here believe that none of the previous phallusshaped plants has matched the 6foot2inch heighth of this one that explains why officials at the botanical garden here plan to lord it over their competitors by printing tshirts proclaiming , our amorphophallus is way bigger than yours horticultural humor size , of course , is not everything and with the amorphophallus titanum , a native of sumatra that is also known as the titan arum , it is the stench that counts as well upon blooming , the flower emits an odor that is most frequently compared to that of rotting flesh , all in a ploy to convince beetles and flies that the plant is carrion once lured to the titan arum , the bugs pick up pollen and transport it to other flowers not for nothing is the plant known in sumatra as bunga bangui , or corpse flower when i came in yesterday it smelled like a cross between a dead animal and a rotting pumpkin , said ron gagliardo , the botanical garden s curator of tropical plants and the man who nurtured the titan arum from a seedling with a diet of bone meal and chicken manure you get used to it , but in the first few minutes it was a little nauseating even for me the smell today , while noticeable , was far from repugnant , at least partly because the conservatory was ventilated with a constant flow of cooled air carolyn white , a security guard , did her best to console those who seemed disappointed that the smell was bearable it was really bad yesterday , she said the botanical garden is normally closed on mondays , but opened today so that visitors could view the titan arum before the flower curled and shed , a process that is usually completed only two or three days after the blooming begins as parents lined their children in front of the plant , the youngsters pinched their nostrils with their fingers and made disgusting gagging sounds many visitors noted that in an era when the other side of the planet is only a web site away , it was refreshing to be astounded by a work of nature there s so much in the world that we 're unaware of , said sister marian , 49 , a bespectacled dominican nun who carried a canon camera how many times in your lifetime do you get to see something like this \? mr gagliardo , who was certain that his ward would not bloom until wednesday or thursday , was visiting friends in denver , some 1 , 200 miles away , when he received the blessed news in a telephone call on saturday night like a father absent for the birth of his child , he sped to the denver airport early sunday morning and talked his way on to a crowded flight i went up to the desk and showed them a picture and said , 'have you ever seen this plant \? ' the 33yearold mr gagliardo recounted they said , 'why are you showing us this \? ' and i said , 'because it s my plant and it s blooming and i 've got to get back to atlanta' technically , the amorphophallus titanum is a compound flower with a series of small flowers hidden within a vast vaselike spathe the grayish spadix shoots skyward from the base of the spathe at any rate , the amorphophallus titanum is larger than the largest single flower , the rafflesia arnoldii , also from sumatra and its mystique is only enhanced by the difficulty of its cultivation , the unpredictability of its flowering , and the remarkable speed of its growth since the bud of the atlanta plant emerged from the soil on june 12 , it has grown an average of five to six inches a day while pleased with today s show , officials at the botanical garden were disappointed that they were not able to artificially pollinate the plant , an unprecedented feat officials at the fairchild garden in miami collected pollen from their plant last month and supposedly sent it to atlanta , but it never arrived the pollen , mr gagliardo said dejectedly , seems to be lost in the mail photo ron gagliardo , curator of tropical plants at the atlanta botanical garden , with his amorphophallus titanum , the world s largest flower \( michael a schwarz for the new york times \)
poughkeepsie , ny , july 29 after an acrimonious eightmonth trial that revived the racially divisive tawana brawley case , steven a pagones was awarded 345 , 000 in damages today by a dutchess county jury that had found that the rev al sharpton and two other men had defamed the white former prosecutor by accusing him of abducting and raping the black teenager the jury s award was sharply lower than the 395 million mr pagones originally sought , an amount that was reduced to 150 million after the jurors ruled that not all of the statements in mr pagones s original complaint were defamatory the jurors said afterwards that they had not been told how much mr pagones was seeking none of the parties tried to tell the jurors that figure during the trial the amount of the final verdict was approximately what mr pagones has said he spent waging what became an emblematic struggle to clear his name but it is not clear whether mr pagones will ever be able to collect the full amount all three of the defendants say they have limited means the defendants portrayed the damage award as a victory mr pagones appeared subdued , but maintained that the advisers had been held accountable with that , he declared his decadelong legal battle over , saying , the jury put this case to rest the jurors decided on july 13 that mr pagones had been defamed by mr sharpton and two other advisers to ms brawley , c vernon mason and alton h maddox jr , in ten of 22 instances he cited although the jurors found that mr sharpton slandered mr pagones more times than the other two defendants , they assessed lower damages against him two jurors said afterwards that they thought mr sharpton had been duped into believing ms brawley s story they set mr sharpton s total damages at 65 , 000 mr maddox s damages were 95 , 000 mr mason s damages were 185 , 000 mr pagones also sued ms brawley , who never appeared at the trial her damages are to be set later by the judge at a news conference after the verdict , three of the jurors adopted a tone of reconciliation , saying they had respect for all the participants in the case and several took issue with the news media s portrait of the trial as an unruly circus mr pagones , several jurors said , had been wronged but the jurors said they did not want to hurt the three advisers , who had portrayed their fight on behalf of ms brawley as a singular battle in the decadeslong civil rights struggle the jurors said that in setting the amount of the award they had taken a cue from the message mr pagones gave during his 25 days of testimony he did not want to destroy them , said the jury foreman , patrick j cody , a warehouse worker he wanted them held accountable mark urbin , another juror who spoke at the news conference as mr pagones looked on , said , steve said it himself he did n't want to hurt these guys during the trial , mr pagones repeated his version of a legal mantra it s not about money to summarize his position that he was taking on the advisers because they had crossed the bounds of civilized behavior with their accusations in their remarks today the jurors said they agreed mr pagones appeared dazed after the jury s decision and did not display the celebratory mood he showed after the july 13 verdict but he said the jurors had been right i did n't want to destroy anybody , he said , ironically , because they did n't care about destroying me but he said his long battle was over it s time to heal , he said the three jurors said they came to no conclusion about what happened to ms brawley when she disappeared for four days in november 1987 , but they said it was clear that mr pagones had not attacked her in 1988 , a grand jury ruled that ms brawley s story was a hoax and specifically exonerated mr pagones the jurors said they were surprised when reporters told them the magnitude of the damages mr pagones had sought one of the jurors , glen heinsohn , said the jurors thought the amount they assessed was a lot of money compared to what they earn he said he earns 20 , 000 but it was immediately clear from the advisers' reaction to the verdict that its size was a surprise and left them saying that mr pagones had won only a symbolic victory mr sharpton said that the verdict s size would negate its impact as a political symbol as i run for mayor in 2001 , he said , it s now going to be very difficult for anybody to raise the issue because of the size of the award michael a hardy , mr sharpton s lawyer , declared the verdict a major victory , reminding reporters that mr pagones s lawyer , william e stanton , had asked the jurors to hit the advisers with a large damage award to shut them up mr maddox , who was often the most combative of the advisers , said this was the greatest comeback in american jurisprudence pagones was looking for 395 million and we ended up getting only a slap on the wrist mr mason , a disbarred lawyer who is now a theological student , hugged mr pagones after the verdict and said it brought closure to the case we have fought the good fight , he said outside court but asked if he still believed that mr pagones had assaulted ms brawley , he declined comment
earlier this week , matt franco pointed out to lenny harris that none of the current mets had a pinchhit home run this season franco and harris are the mets' top two pinchhitters , and franco told harris something should be done last night at shea stadium , franco went out and did it with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning , he belted a 10 pitch from the los angeles dodgers' jeff shaw into the rightfield stands to tie the score at 11 and save rick reed from an undeserved defeat three batters later edgardo alfonzo doubled todd hundley home from first base on an 02 pitch , and the mets had a thoroughly satisfying 21 victory after coming back against one of the best closers in the league alfonzo has been struggling to be more consistent at the plate this season , and his gamewinning double , which trenidad hubbard fumbled in center field , was a huge hit but franco s home run just might have been bigger it caused shaw to blow his first save in 10 tries with los angeles , and it might have helped mets second baseman luis lopez even more than it did reed when hundley came home , it was hard to tell who was happier , lopez or reed that was because lopez s twoout error in the top of the eighth had led to an unearned run , the only run the dodgers scored off reed \( 127 \) , who pitched nine strong innings afterward , many mets made a point of saying how happy they were for lopez reed allowed just six hits , while striking out six batters and walking none , to barely outduel carlos perez a whopping 88 of reed s 127 pitches were strikes perez , who was making his dodgers debut after being traded from montreal on friday , gave up two hits in seven scoreless innings when asked who he thought was happier , he or lopez , reed said we 're probably running a big race right now but probably luis i really felt bad for him he was pretty upset about that he was really down when todd scored , he hugged me i hugged him you 'd have thought we won the world series what the mets had done was turn the tables on the dodgers and their allstar closer , one night after los angeles had rallied against john franco for a ninthinning victory rick reed was exceptional , matt franco was better with one swing , and fonzie rose to the occasion , said an ecstatic bobby valentine , the mets' manager one little miscue and they put a run on the board but in the ninth inning , there were n't any heads hanging in that dugout and there could have been the game marked the mets debut of tony phillips , who played left field and batted in the leadoff spot the mets had passed on phillips during spring training , when they could not come to terms on a contract with him so phillips , a 16year veteran , bided his time until he was ready to play again , spending most of his summer playing golf in arizona in late june , he decided the time was right to try again phillips , 39 , said that he had been following the blue jays before instructing his agent , tony attanasio , to call them two days later , phillips signed with toronto when asked if he had followed the mets , too , and was aware of their struggles from the leadoff spot , phillips said not really well , i'm lying yeah phillips was 0 for 4 with a walk last night and heard some boos mike piazza was 0 for 3 and heard boos and then lopez made the error but the mets did not give up later , valentine laughed when he recalled that matt franco had said during batting practice that he was going to work on a home run swing i told him 'i like your line drives there s nothing wrong with that , ' valentine said it just shows you he does n't listen to me i 've never seen that exact thing happen before especially on a pinchhit franco , who actually hit a ball over the fence before batting practice on a softtoss swing , said lenny and i have been teasing each other , saying we can hit them out in batting practice , so let s go it was a good time to hit my first one out inside pitch tommy lasorda , the dodgers' general manager , insisted yesterday that the word interim was still very much part of his title and asked whether he had any interest in two mets with whom he has strong ties manager bobby valentine , who is under contract for two more seasons , and the former dodgers catcher mike piazza , who can become a free agent after the season lasorda said i said this , and i mean it sincerely i will never talk about any player or manager under contract bobby valentine is the manager of the mets and i hope he s happy i think he should stay right here as for piazza , lasorda said i always wanted mike to finish his career with the dodgers but mike belongs to the mets willie blair and jorge fabregas , who were acquired from the arizona diamondbacks on friday , arrived from milwaukee and were in uniform last night blair was told by valentine that he would be used out of the bullpen for the first time since 1996 they know i 'd rather start , said blair , who is 415 with a 534 earned run average and who leads the major leagues in losses but coming over to a contender , i'm willing to do anything down the road , i hope they 'll give me a shot valentine

means discounted tickets were available at the theater development fund s tkts booth last weekend for performances last friday and saturday nights broadway art this is the new york production of yasmina reza s french comedy , a hit in london and paris , and its assets are clear but modest it s short , slender and often funny the sketch of a plot a friendship among three men is threatened when one buys an allwhite abstract painting , something scarcely cuttingedge contemporary by the standards of today s art world similarly , the play itself belongs to an older tradition that once flourished on broadway the sleek , pleasant comedy of manners with an intellectual veneer that allows audiences to relax at the theater without feeling they 're wasting time it s an impeccably tailored piece of work , with virtues nicely underscored by matthew warchus s disciplined direction and astute performances from alan alda , victor garber and alfred molina it s not emptyminded but at

convincingly and disarmingly as possible this work , performed by the four sterling actors who created their roles for the druid theater company in galway , ireland , is on many levels an oldfashioned , wellmade play yet it feels more immediate and vital than any new drama in many seasons the basic plot sounds familiar , like a bucolic cousin to the heiress a plain middleaged woman , trapped in a life as a caretaker to her infirm but ironwilled mother in rural ireland , is offered a last chance at love but mr mcdonagh and the director , garry hines , are masterly at building up and subverting

nearly 15 months after the publication of the landmark scientific paper announcing the creation of dolly the sheep , the first paper has appeared extending cloning to another species this time the clones are holstein calves , created from genetically engineered fetal cells the result is not other dolly , because dolly was made from an udder cell of an adult animal the new feat , cloning from fetal calf cells , is easier because the younger the animal , the easier it is to clone its cells but it has great practical importance , experts said it means that scientists can slash the time to make a genetically engineered calf from three years , with current methods , to nine months , with cloning for companies like advanced cell technology inc , of worcester , mass , which made the clones , it now becomes much more feasible to create genetically engineered animals to produce valuable drugs in their milk or to serve as organ factories for people because their cells are altered to prevent the immune system from attacking them it is amazing how well this apparently works , said dr randall prather , a cloning expert at the university of missouri i think that people are finally seeing the applications of cloning the investigators , dr james m robl of the university of massachusetts at amherst , dr steven l stice of advanced cell technology and their colleagues , first announced the cloning of three calves at a scientific meeting in january their paper , published yesterday in the journal science , provides additional data in an interview , dr stice added that the group had now produced four additional live calves from genetically engineered fetal cells to make the three calves described in their paper , the investigators grew cells from a 55dayold male holstein fetus in the laboratory , and added two innocuous marker genes to the cells then they began the tedious cloning process they slipped 276 genetically altered fetal cells into 276 unfertilized cow eggs whose own genetic material had been removed their goal was to have the eggs take up the genes from the fetal cells and use them to direct the development of calves after growing the eggs with their new genes for a week in the laboratory , the investigators were left with 33 embryos they transferred 28 of them to 11 cows that served as surrogate mothers four calves were born one died from a congenital heart defect when it was five days old although dr stice and dr robl are the first to publish , several other research groups report that they , too , have used cloning to produce genetically engineered calves cloning is still inefficient , dr stice said , but it is far better than the conventional method of creating cows with added genes , which involves injecting genes into embryos few embryo cells take up the added genes , and even fewer use them the researchers said in their paper that 500 cow embryos would have to be injected with genes and transferred to surrogate cow mothers to produce one genetically engineered calf in contrast , they said , with cloning , they transferred nine embryos , on average , to four cows to get one live , genetically altered calf moreover , the investigators noted , the gene injection method requires two generations to produce an animal that has the added gene in every cell this is because genetically altered cells end up peppered throughout the animal to get an animal that has the gene in all of its cells , scientists must breed animals made from the genetically engineered embryos , looking for offspring of females that have the gene in their egg cells or males that have it in their sperm cloning , in contrast , accomplishes this goal in a single generation dr robl and dr stice also addressed a puzzling question is a cloned animal the age of the cell from which it was created or is a clone its own chronological age \? the fetal cells used for cloning had grown and divided in the laboratory for so long that they were near death from old age yet , those cells still produced cloned calves that were as young as calves are supposed to be if the cells being cloned had not started their life spans anew , the calves would have died because their cells would have given out from old age , dr stice said in a separate experiment , the investigators took the aged fetal cells that had grown in the laboratory and started to clone them then they took the resulting fetuses and studied their cells the cells had the life spans expected of normal fetal cells , dr stice reported but one question lingers when will another dolly a clone of something older than a fetal or embryo cell be born \? last august , dr robl and dr stice announced that they had cows that were pregnant with fetuses cloned from adult cells but , dr robl said , none of their five fetuses survived beyond 50 days of pregnancy researchers at infigen inc , in deforest , wis , announced that they , too , had cows pregnant with fetuses cloned from adults dale schwartz , the company s president and chief executive , declined to say what became of those fetuses dr jeanpaul renard , the research director of france s national agricultural research center in jouyenjosas , says he has a cow pregnant with a fetus cloned from cells of a 2weekold calf this cow is expected to deliver during the summer , dr renard said in a telephone interview cloning experts said the pace of the research was actually quite rapid cloning , dr prather said , is not a trivial matter scientists are still at the earliest stages , he added , trying to figure out how to make it more likely to succeed there are also practical considerations , like timing the experiments exactly so the surrogate mothers are ready for the embryos , and then losing months if a pregnancy does not go to term you start lining up cattle and trying to get them to come into heat , dr robl said cows only cycle every 21 days , and their gestation period is nine months dr stice echoed these remarks , saying these are long and extended experiments and if we lose pregnancies at 60 or 70 days , it means we have to start all over again
new delhi , feb 23 with results in india s general election barely a week away , the country s largest state , uttar pradesh , slid into something approaching political farce today , with unpredictable consequences for the two main political groups fighting for power a day of turmoil in lucknow , the state capital , ended with rival claimants of the post of chief minister in the state government encamped in the chief minister s office suite , each appealing to the police to throw the other out the state , with 140 million people , was effectively without a government political chaos is not new in uttar pradesh , which has seen a succession of revolvingdoor governments for at least five years but the spectacle in lucknow between the candidates representing the two major political parties created a sensation even in distant parts of india it encapsulates the chaos that many indians fear will develop in new delhi if the national election follows the pattern of three previous elections since 1989 in failing to produce a clearcut winner two of three main rounds of voting have been completed in the staggered , statebystate polling made necessary by the vast indian electorate of 600 million the third round is set for saturday while events in lucknow cannot have any impact on the choices made by the 450 million voters in districts where votes have been cast , indian political commentators say they believe that the 150 million people eligible to vote in a dozen states this weekend could be influenced until saturday , uttar pradesh was governed by the bharatiya janata party , the core group in a hindu nationalist alliance expected to be the largest bloc in parliament after the election but the party s hold on power in the state was broken when the congress party , the most powerful of the socalled secular parties , worked with smaller , likeminded parties to lure back about 30 members of parliament who had defected to the bjp , depriving it of a majority in the uttar pradesh legislature barely 36 hours after a new government was sworn into office in lucknow under a congressbacked chief minister , the state s high court , sitting in the ganges river city of allahabad , issued an order voiding the dismissal of the incumbent chief minister pending a hearing on a countersuit by the parties that formed the new state government sworn in over the weekend the incumbent , kalyan singh of the bjp , immediately reoccupied part of his office in lucknow , only to find his rival for the post , jagdambika pal , refusing to vacate an adjacent part of the office as the impasse dragged on into the night , mr singh and mr pal issued competing calls for police action while mr singh described mr pal as an impostor , mr pal said he had taken an oath of office and would remain in the post until the congressappointed governor of the state , romesh bhandari , dismissed him what kalyan singh is doing is illegal and unconstitutional , mr pal said close to midnight , mr pal gave up the contest and left the office , saying he would battle in the courts senior congress party officials who helped engineer the political upheaval in the uttar pradesh legislature were saying little about their motives but the purpose appears to have been to undermine bharatiya janata s assertion in the national election campaign that it is the only party that can provide the country with political stability , since no other political group , including the congress party , is likely to come close to the 240 seats in the 545seat parliament that opinion polls have forecast for the bjp alliance the polls have forecast at most about 170 seats for congress that would be 100 seats more than many indian commentators expected the party to win before its campaign was taken over by sonia gandhi , the italianborn standardbearer for the nehrugandhi family that ruled india , under congress governments , for most of the period since independence in 1947 mrs gandhi has electrified the campaign , drawing more than 12 million people so far , according to some estimates , to more than 100 campaign rallies around the country most indian commentators expect the days after the election results are known , possibly as early as next tuesday , to be filled with efforts by the two main parties to round up a parliamentary majority by forming alliances with parties outside their blocs in this , congress , even if it wins fewer seats than bharatiya janata , could emerge with an advantage of the parties not already pledged to the two main contenders or to a third major contender , the united front , none seem likely to favor the hindu nationalists while some voters going to the polls on saturday seem likely to sympathize with the bjp , the events in lucknow might aggravate the impatience of others , leading them to support the congress party , especially at a time when mrs gandhi is reminding vast crowds of the heyday of congress rule map of india showing location of uttar pradesh two men in uttar pradesh claim to be the state s chief minister

elizabeth , nj , sept 25 the police and customs inspectors today captured nine stowaways from the dominican republic who had spent five days on rough seas in the hull of a chinese container ship apparently they were surviving on candy bars , cookies and bags of water , said john leyden , a regional director of passengers and enforcement for the federal customs service they were living in the crevices between empty containers while the ship was at the elizabeth port authority marine terminal , six of the stowaways scrambled from the ship s hold at 8 am when crew members opened the hatches to load the empty containers , and four of them tried to escape by jumping as much as 60 feet down from the ship s deck into newark bay , said lieut erich herkloz of the new jersey state police marine unit the three remaining stowaways were found hiding inside the vessel , which is named the li bai , lieutenant herkloz said mr leyden said three of the men were treated for dehydration at a local hospital , while the rest were turned over to immigration officials the stowaways , who were in their late teens or early 20 s , will probably be deported , he said the captain and 35member crew of the li bai were apparently unaware of the stowaways' presence , mr leyden said the li bai , owned by the chinesepolish stock shipping company , was picking up empty cargo containers , and the crew planned to reload , a spokeswoman for cosco north america , the company leasing the ship , told the associated press the vessel , which could hold 300 cargo containers , stopped in venezuela before sailing to the dominican republic , the authorities said stowaways from south america and the caribbean will often be found transporting cocaine , mr leyden said , but no drugs were found in this case some of them have family members in the metropolitan area , so it seems obvious they were trying to enter the country illegally to start new lives , he said mr leyden said the customs employees who helped apprehend the stowaways were inspectors on hand for a routine check of the ship lieutenant herkloz said that none of the men who jumped from the ship s deck were injured they were cold , he said photo new york city police officers in a scuba boat searched newark bay in new jersey yesterday for dominicans who had stowed away in a chinese ship nine stowaways , some suffering from dehydration , were captured \( associated press \)
jerusalem , dec 21 prime minister benjamin netanyahu today accepted the inevitability of his government s downfall , striking a deal with the political opposition to hold new elections sometime next spring late tonight , an overwhelming majority of the parliament , including mr netanyahu , voted to dissolve his foundering government after an unexpected lastminute effort by the prime minister to establish a unity government failed almost certainly , the political fallout will extend to the americanbrokered israelipalestinian peace agreement , which president clinton tried to salvage in a diplomatic mission here last week early in the day today , before a chaotic session of parliament even began , both sides agreed to withdraw a scheduled vote of no confidence in the government , which by law would have propelled them into early elections in 60 days too soon for anyone s taste instead , they switched procedural tactics to dissolve rather than to topple the government , entering furious negotiations on the election date , although none was set tonight the israelis immediately moved forward into what is bound to be a turbulent campaign , with battles for leadership on both the right and the centerleft as early as tuesday , it is expected that members of mr netanyahu s likud party will come forward to challenge him and that a new center party , as yet unnamed and undeclared , possibly headed by a popular former army chief of staff , will emerge to chip away at support for the two major parties , likud and labor to the fury of palestinians , the israelis are likely to maintain their freeze on compliance with the landforsecurity peace plan until after elections are held , sometime between march and may while the palestinians issued a statement tonight imploring the israelis to honor their commitments , some expressed hope at the prospect of a new israeli leadership the impression among palestinians is that any change is better than the current situation , said ziyad abu amr , a palestinian legislator there is a freeze anyway , and if this means that in a few months there could be a hope of implementation , then palestinians can live with it , although the uncertainty will be hard in a televised speech to parliament that came across as the opening salvo in his election campaign , mr netanyahu presented his defeat as a failure of parliament rather than his own as he was furiously heckled by left and right , he predicted that he would be reelected prime minister because , he said , a majority of israelis , if not the members of parliament , support his tough stance toward the palestinians either you replace the people or you replace the parliament , he said and i agree to replace the parliament under the israeli system , the prime minister and the parliament are directly elected by popular vote it was a raucous day in parliament , in which the political situation evolved and devolved by the hour several times , dan tichon , the speaker , threw up his hands and shouted wait a minute ! what s going on here \? moments after the parliament rejected mr netanyahu s lastminute plea for a 72hour delay in which to explore the possibility of a national unity government , 81 of 120 members of parliament voted to bring down the government , two years before its term expires technically , the bill , sponsored by the labor party , requires a second and third reading , both expected next week but the vote tonight , which ultimately came as no surprise , opened the election season , into which mr netanyahu promised to gallop like a stallion racing to battle even before the vote was taken , posters went up across israel today carrying the labor party s campaign message , designed by american political strategists for its leader , ehud barak one israel , the billboards said , for the sake of everyone and not just the extremists this message tries to strike at a perception held by many israelis that mr netanyahu has often acceded to the will of the far right in order to keep his governing coalition together after he signed a peace agreement with the palestinians in october , mr netanyahu s rightwing coalition fell apart in the last few weeks , the prime minister was seen to have lurched rightward once more , seeking to regain support as he issued ultimatums to the palestinians after a surge in violent unrest in the west bank last week , citing what he said were a host of palestinian violations of the most recent peace accord , mr netanyahu chose to disregard the agreement s timetable , refusing to transfer a chunk of the west bank to palestinian control as the schedule demanded his cabinet endorsed the freeze on sunday , setting a slate of conditions some of them unlikely ever to be accepted that the palestinians must meet before israel resumes carrying out the accord while the palestinians issued a statement tonight imploring the israelis to honor their commitments , some expressed hope at the prospect of a new israeli leadership the impression among palestinians is that any change is better than the current situation , said ziyad abu amr , a palestinian legislator there is a freeze anyway , and if this means that in a few months there could be a hope of implementation , then palestinians can live with it , although the uncertainty will be hard
a 9yearold boy who was absent from his thirdgrade class in a brooklyn school for 165 days and who did not take mandatory reading and math exams was promoted to the fourth grade during the 19961997 school year anyway , school officials said the case prompted a call for the new york city board of education to develop minimum attendance standards and for disciplinary action against the school s principal the boy , whose name was not made public because he is a minor , was a student at public school 91 in district 17 in the crown heights section of brooklyn and attended only 17 days of school in the third grade , according to a report released by edward f stancik , the special commissioner of investigation for the board of education the child failed to show up altogether after oct 21 , 1996 , mr stancik said school administrators conducted four attendance investigations , but none was properly handled , the report said mr stancik s office has recommended that dr rudy crew , the schools chancellor , discipline the principal , solomon long , saying he showed a disregard for thirdgrade promotional standards under rules issued by the chancellor s office , third grade students are required to earn a minimum score on standardized reading and math exams but there are no minimum attendance requirements mr long said that his administrators and mr stancik s investigators found that the boy had been taken to florida by his mother after a dispute with her husband the child s name , mr long said , was left on the school rolls until it could be purged in january , when such action is usually done we knew about the kid , mr long said everything was investigated the child was found to be with his mother the issue went away for a year now , i have no idea what this is all about we can document everything mr stancik s office called for the board of education to adopt a minimum attendance policy in february 1997 , after an investigation into the death of nadine lockwood , a 4yearold who was starved to death in washington heights in manhattan one of nadine s sisters was promoted to the seventh grade in district 6 despite missing 128 days of school in one year , officials said although the case of the student at ps 91 did not end in tragedy , it again highlights the need for minimum attendance standards , mr stancik said in a statement , as well as the need for strict enforcement of the regulation that bars students who fail to take required standardized tests from being promoted
of all the days to plunk your annual contribution to junior s college fund into the market , you picked july 17 , the exact day that the standard poor s 500stock index hit its 1998 high now his kitty for 1998 is worth 81 percent less than it was when you started do n't fret too much according to some numbers crunched by towers data , a research firm in bethesda , md , flubbed markettiming decisions , while hardly the best way to maximize returns , have proved to be far from disastrous for those who keep their money invested say an investor picked the absolute worst day to invest 10 , 000 in the s p 500 in each of the last 10 years a total investment of 100 , 000 by the end of 1997 , the investor would have ended up with a pot of 246 , 476 not a bad return for a klutz by contrast , the data show that by picking the best day each year to invest in the s p 500 index the market low for the year the same investor would have ended up with 306 , 414 after 10 years none of this is particularly shocking over a 10year period in which the market has almost always charged higher the trend is seen in the fact that 6 of the 10 annual market highs identified by towers were in december seven of the 10 lows were in january john hancock funds , the money management firm in boston , incorporated the results of the towers research into this year s prospectus for john hancock s growth funds it was good marketing as well as good market timing the prospectus was mailed to shareholders during the first two weeks of july , in time for the market high richard teitelbaum
mathematics may not have the same following as basketball and football , but the competition is no less intense when the state s 85 high school teams compete with numbers it was evident on a recent afternoon , when about 150 students from 16 high schools , pencils and calculators in hand , gathered in the cafeteria of jonathan law high school in milford for the sixth and final contest of the greater new haven mathematics league s 199798 season and the competition did not end there the best teams and individual performers go on to state , regional , or national meets a visitor quickly learns , however , why a math meet is not a spectator sport basically , it s like watching students take a series of written tests carol hegyi , a retired math teacher from foran high school in milford and the league s secretary and statistician , explained how a meet works a team consists of five students , with an a and b team allowed from each school a student competes in three of five 10minute rounds , each covering a different subject area , usually arithmetic , algebra i , geometry , algebra ii and trigonometry there are three questions per round , worth one , two and three points in the sixth round the team works together to solve five problems , worth three points each after the scores were tabulated for the meet at jonathan law , ms hegyi announced the final season rankings , based on the sum of the best five meets for each team choate rosemary hall in wallingford and hopkins school in new haven , the perennial powerhouses of the league , were the top two finishers , choate with 455 out of a possible 525 points , and hopkins with 339 points most other teams did not fare nearly as well six had between 100 and 200 points , and three had fewer than 100 points choate swept the first place individual awards david speyer , with a perfect score , was the top senior andrew lin , the top junior , and yoon chay , the top underclassman neither choate nor hopkins have any problem recruiting students for the math team both schools hold tryouts at the beginning of the school year and have to turn students away at other schools , it s a bit different brian festa , the coach of new haven s high school in the community says , i have to try to drag students , find them in the halls , drag them to the event , although , he adds , in the last couple of contests we 've had a nice little group of students who have been recruiting one another mr festa and other coaches cite the difficulty they sometimes have in attracting top students , who may be drawn to other extracurricular activities even at choate and hopkins , the best math students do not necessarily join the team there are some very talented math students who have absolutely no interest in competition , says the choate coach , david doster rosemary benedict , who served as hopkins' coach for about 10 years before becoming junior varsity coach two years ago , explains that some of the top students are more of the thinkers they like to have time to ponder problems , dislike the time pressure of a meet , and may not do well under those conditions she is amazed by how well the students who join the team do because it s all timed and they have to think very quickly students who compete say they do so because they have fun and enjoy the atmosphere of competition everyone gets really into it , says eunice hahn , a senior at hopkins i especially enjoy the team round , says sid govindan , a junior at amity regional high school in woodbridge , where we get to work together to solve problems the questions are much harder the time pressure is an attraction to sichen sun , a senior at amity we have to think through the problems and find the easiest way to solve them in the time limit we have , she says nicholas pastore , a junior at north haven high school , says the problems make you think a little more than at school where you have problems drilled into you at a meet you have to be ready for anything coaches cite additional benefits for math team participants , including strengthening their records for college applications , meeting students from other schools who like math as much as they do , seeing where they stand in a broader group , and , most basically , learning more about mathematics they might see things that we normally would n't teach them , and it gives them an experience in a wider range of mathematics , says the cheshire high school coach , john kosloski mr doster emphasizes that the meets help students stay current in areas of math that they might otherwise let slide , such as geometry , which many students take early in high school when asked whether other students follow the math team , clifton lin , a junior at amity , complains , we do n't get as much respect as we deserve math team students and coaches alike reject the stereotype of math wizards as nerds the nerd stereotype is totally bizarre , says tom pytel , a senior at naugatuck high school it does n't matter who you are anyone can enjoy it it feels good to compete with people of some intelligence at hopkins , kids respect kids doing well at anything , says coach benedict it s not like you are a nerd if you are on our math team but the stereotype is still alive in some schools even today , coach festa says , there s still that awful stereotype of someone who does well we do n't have a large enough group to really lead the school in terms of math excellence the teams that finished in the top half of their league \( there are six connecticut leagues \) will go on to the state meet on april 7 at union carbide in danbury , where schools are divided by size into three divisions twelve to 15 connecticut teams will attend the new england meet on april 24 in canton , mass in both the state and new england contests , choate and hopkins place first or second in their respective divisions \( medium and small \) year after year connecticut will send two teams of 15 students each , along with 10 alternates , to the national meet , held at the end of may at three sites simultaneously penn state , the university of iowa and the university of nevada , las vegas teams attend the meet representing states , counties , cities , regions or schools , and now also come from canada and russia historically , math competition has been a boys' game it s hard to get the girls , says coach benedict there s still a stigma that it s not a feminine thing to do but the balance is slowly shifting ms hegyi says that in the 80 s connecticut sent only 2 or 3 girls to the national meet each year now 8 to 10 go the hopkins team has increased its female participation from none or one to several , including a female cocaptain they 're out there and we 'd love to have them , says mr kosloski , the cheshire coach there are some quality female students and we miss having them on our team photos ounheuane phouadara , left , and mike kasmin

the greatest generation by tom brokaw illustrated 390 pp new york random house 2495 in the spring of 1984 , tom brokaw writes in the introduction to the greatest generation , i went to the northwest of france , to normandy , to prepare an nbc documentary on the 40th anniversary of dday prepared for a conventional assignment , brokaw , the anchor of nbc nightly news , went through what he describes as a lifechanging experience as i walked the beaches with the american veterans i was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done brokaw found himself recalling his childhood on an army base in igloo , sd the grownups all seemed to have a sense of purpose whatever else was happening in our family or neighborhood , there was something greater connecting us all , in large ways and small what brokaw calls his missionary zeal for the men and women of world war ii is admirable , but missionary zeal and historical fact are not always compatible with the best of intentions , he reinforces two myths the myth that world war ii was an uncontroversial war , and the myth of generations brokaw writes the vietnam war deeply divided not only the country but the world war ii generation as well but the world war ii generation had earlier been divided by world war ii on the eve of pearl harbor only 31 percent of americans were willing to go to war against germany and italy once the war began , dissent was suppressed they faced great odds and a late start , brokaw writes of americans during world war ii , but they did not protest in fact , many of the leaders of anticoldwar protests , like the pacifist a j muste and the poet robert lowell , had protested american intervention in world war ii the world war ii generation , brokaw writes , made breakthroughs in medicine and other sciences they gave the world new art and literature they came to understand the need for federal civil rights legislation they gave america medicare generations do not discover cures or write books and why give credit for civil rights legislation and medicare to an entire cohort , rather than to the liberals who backed these reforms particularly when the reforms were opposed by conservative veterans of world war ii \? equally questionable is brokaw s attempt to contrast the values of the world war ii generation with those of later generations there is a common theme of pride in all that they 've accomplished for themselves , their families and their country , and so little clamor for attention , given all they 've done in 1980 , 77 percent of vietnam veterans agreed looking back , i am glad i served my country still , in the greatest generation brokaw succeeds in his goal of memorializing the experiences of representative americans in the deadliest war in history as he notes , they were proud of what they accomplished but they rarely discussed their experiences , even with each other it is a tribute to brokaw s skill as a reporter that he has managed to elicit so many memorable stories from reticent people brokaw recounts the heroism in combat of people like the navy medic bob bush , who lost an eye and suffered serious wounds during the fight to take okinawa while holding off japanese troops and administering plasma to a fallen marine much of the book , though , is devoted to americans who contributed to the war effort in less conventionally heroic ways like dorothy haener , whose wartime work in industry led to a career as a united auto workers organizer , and mary louise roberts , whose medical unit , offered the option of leaving the combat zone of anzio , decided if the infantry was going to stay , we were going to stay noting the irony that the united states fought against racist germany with a segregated military , brokaw describes how black americans fought both the enemy and discrimination martha settle putney , a wac , remembers to this day the anger she felt when a group of german officers , who were pow s at a garrison in the des moines area , were invited into the the fort des moines officers' club while the black officers were barred the wartime experiences and subsequent careers of celebrity politicians and journalists are amply recounted , but it is the ordinary american heroes that linger in the memory brokaw takes us to kerry corner , the irish workingclass neighborhood not far from the leafy sanctuary of harvard yard and introduces us to the romeo club \( retired old men eating out \) none became a highly decorated hero or senior officer , but the boys of kerry corner , and millions more like them from neighborhoods across the country , were the muscles and bones of the us armed forces , he writes perhaps the most moving story is that of daphne cavin , a beautician in lebanon , ind , whose husband , raymond kelley , went to war only months after their marriage and was killed in france in june 1944 at the age of 22 daphne had children in a later marriage , but keeps a scrapbook called lost love remembered among its contents is a sonnet daphne had written that raymond was carrying when he was killed it begins when you come home once more to me , it is unlikely , dear , that i shall be articulate the words i 've wanted so to say , i 'll try in vain to speak brokaw says , the paper on which it is written is stained with the blood of his mortal wounds brokaw writes that no block of marble or elaborate edifice can equal their lives of sacrifice and achievement , duty and honor , as monuments to their time in the great generation , he has compiled a moving scrapbook as a tribute to the members of the world war ii generation to whom we americans and the world owe so much drawing \( patrick chappatte \)
honor s voice the transformation of abraham lincoln by douglas l wilson 383 pp new york alfred a knopf 30 we think we know him but what do we really know , especially about the private man whom we all suspect to be somehow crucially tied to the public one \? historians are forever doomed to ignorance about the early life of abraham lincoln , began the last best hope of earth \( 1993 \) , a brief volume that summed up more than 20 years of learning about lincoln by the pulitzer prizewinning historian mark e neely jr now comes douglas l wilson with honor s voice , a solid new portrait of the private lincoln between the ages of 22 and 33 , during the years 183142 , that puts him in a strikingly fresh light the book starts not from the president s legendary greatness but from his actual beginnings wilson , the saunders director of the international center for jefferson studies at monticello , focuses with careful intensity on otherwise antiquarian oral reminiscences that help illuminate lincoln s rise wilson tells a story about a search for identity and selfdefinition , and follows lincoln s very exacting road of selfeducation , his finding of a vocation in law and politics , and the partial resolution of his painfully difficult relations with women the evolution of his religious outlook might illustrate his education raised a baptist , lincoln never outgrew a sense of fatalism , even a nameless sense of doom but he had the strength to go against the grain , and he quickly found the skeptics he read in thomas paine about a young woman engaged to be married , and while under this engagement she is , to speak plain language , debauched by a ghost it is the story of the virgin mary the law student , while teaching himself the rules of evidence , wrote two manuscripts of religious skepticism , long lost but also long remembered by his contemporaries according to john t stuart , his first law partner , lincoln went further against christian beliefs than any man i ever heard as he advanced in politics , lincoln muted his heathenish talk , but even during this early period he learned to present himself , when necessary , as an unfortunate victim of unbelief a hypocrite \? wilson s readers can decide but lincoln was certainly someone with a sense of selfpreservation and someone at this time a very long way from the second inaugural in politics and law lincoln rose from successful frontier fighter to peacemaker who fought with words at times the words were not honest , and relied on smear and innuendo yet lincoln carried a compulsion to help the helpless , and learned , to quote the shakespeare he had come to love , that the best of men have pow'r to hurt and will do none his most troublesome problem was women the young man who had lost his mother at the age of 9 always felt awkward around them except for older women he loved ann rutledge , she died and he fell apart friends and , in time , work helped lincoln back from a perhaps suicidal mental breakdown the depth of his grief suggests to wilson that ann s death challenged the core of his being his central goal in life , his wish to rise , to shape and even to control events , now seemed nothing but foolish vanity ambivalence characterized his later courtships and various marriage proposals a possible reason for this , at least for a period of time , may have been a fear of syphilis not an unknown disease in his world wilson does not credit stories of lincoln s possible love children but notes two episodes with prostitutes if once or twice , why not more often \? his longtime law partner , william h herndon , thought that lincoln had a strong if not a terrible passion for women he could hardly keep his hands off nor would he get married until he was 33 as lincoln the outsider learned to be an insider , deep anxieties beset him about his ability to make a living , about success in law , about polite society his journey led him from country to village to town , where he found the exciting , highborn mary todd a superficial courtship was followed by a commitment to marry in a brief diversion , he became smitten by another woman , but mary did not let go as his brotherinlaw put it , lincoln in his conflicts of dutyhonor and his love went as crazy as a loon in time he recovered the ability to rule himself , strengthening his selfrespect by getting married love , wilson suggests , seems to have had very little to do with it lincoln s road , therefore , was both harder and swampier than legend or scholars have allowed the difficulties and temptations wider , the fears and depressions deeper by 34 he appeared to have overcome his troubles , but not many signs of future greatness had yet turned up after 130some years of lincoln appraisals , how can a scholar , especially one as extraordinarily careful and fair as wilson , create a startlingly new lincoln \? wilson s achievement stems in part from the respect the culture has acquired for oral history \( which often gives voice to the voiceless \) and from his having put together , with his colleague rodney o davis , the szold professor of history at knox college , the definitive edition of the reminiscences of about 250 people who knew lincoln herndon s informants letters , interviews , and statements about abraham lincoln \( 1998 \) the two men have also been assembling , but have not yet published , the similarly massive recollections of herndon himself the person who knew lincoln better than anyone but mary todd historians have long used these oftconflicting , difficulttoread manuscripts , but wilson s familiarity with them is unsurpassed
a bull market might have taken it as good news the eastman kodak company yesterday reported thirdquarter earnings of 398 million , up nearly 72 percent from the quarter last year , and a penny a share ahead of analyst forecasts it was way ahead of schedule on its costcutting campaign it had stopped the cash hemmorrhage from its portfolio of digital products yet investors reacted as though they had been kicked in the stomach kodak s shares plummeted 111875 , or more than 13 percent , to 72375 the reason kodak s earnings may have been up , but its revenues declined in a jittery market , good news whispers , bad news shouts the strong negative reaction astounded most analysts anyone who looked for topline growth in 1998 simply does n't understand the kodak story , said rebecca f runkle , an analyst with morgan stanley dean witter you buy kodak for its costcutting initiatives and its ability to drive earnings growth still , many analysts sympathize with the investors' angst kodak is doing the right things , but they ca n't force growth , said b alexander henderson , an analyst with prudential securities research patience is scarce on wall street these days , added jonathan rosenzweig , an analyst with salomon smith barney the thesis on kodak has always been , 'they 'll cut costs today , grow top line tomorrow , ' he said investors are wondering how far away tomorrow really is clearly , no one was cutting kodak any slack news that could be viewed as a glass halffull was seen as a sign of one in dire need of a refill an example during a conference call with analysts , kodak s chief financial officer , harry kavetas , said that the company would spend about 100 million for employee bonuses in 1998 a bull market might have agreed that kodak s robust earnings entitled employees , many of whom received no bonuses last year , to a share of the pie instead , analysts reacted simply to an unanticipated hit of 20 cents a share it s yet another cost we never thought would be in there , mr rosenzweig said that sort of glumness cast a pall over all kodak s bright earnings numbers the company reported net earnings of 398 million , or 121 a share , on revenue of 342 billion its profit from operations as a percentage of sales rose to 185 percent , from 115 percent a year ago and it said it had reduced annual costs by 650 million , 150 million more than its target for the year as a whole how many stocks can you think of where you know you 're going to get at least a 20 percent earnings increase just on costcutting \? asked ulysses yannas , an analyst with mercer , bokert , buckman reid but none of that could compensate for revenue that fell nearly 10 percent overseas , sales dropped by 17 percent , or 231 million , to 18 billion the slide was dizzyingly steep in emerging markets an area that kodak has historically counted on for its fastest growth sales were down by 55 percent in russia , 22 percent in china , 33 percent in south korea nor did domestic sales , which fell by 106 million , to 159 billion , provide much succor in the united states , sales of film , kodak s highestmargin product by far , was down by 10 percent even motionpicture film , which mr kavetas has always called a star performer , showed its first sign of weakness in several years we did n't lose share , he said people are making fewer movies still , the domestic numbers are not as somber as they look kodak sold its retail film stores last year , cutting out a chunk of revenues it shifted about 80 million in revenue to a joint venture , kodak polychrome graphics changes in the way it accounts for promotional expenditures caused another 52 million hit even the shortfall in film sales may have been temporary , caused by retailers miscalculating demand and overstocking the previous quarter retailers order too much film they work off their inventory they order again , said jack l kelly , an analyst with goldman , sachs this has been kodak s story forever but perhaps most important , kodak is addressing its sales slump headon the company invested more than 700 million in china this year at home , kodak continues to invest heavily in a digitization strategy , an attempt to use digital technology to bolster conventional photography sales for example , kodak has teamed up with america online and intel to enable consumers to receive their processed photographs in digital form for now , these are all net costs but kodak assumes they will soon yield robust sales we delivered less topline growth than even we had expected , mr kavetas said now we are going to turn the big guns onto the initiatives that drive topline growth table qtr to sept 30 1998 1997 ch rev 3 , 419 , 000 , 000 3 , 787 , 000 , 000 97 net inc 398 , 000 , 000 232 , 000 , 000 716 sh earn 121 71 sh out 329 , 900 , 000 329 , 100 , 000 results are for the third quarter yesterday s closing price 72375 down 111875
uniondale , ny , feb 7 friday was a busy day for islanders general manager mike milbury he traded four players , a minor leaguer and a thirdround draft pick for four players in deals with two teams by the day s end , milbury said he felt that the islanders were a vastly improved team maybe , but they were not good enough to earn a victory against the devils today after dominating the first period , the islanders faded in the second and third periods and lost , 32 , at nassau coliseum the devils have beaten the islanders in all four meetings this season today s game was the last for both teams before the 17day break for the olympics martin brodeur had much to do with the devils' success , as usual he made 33 saves , including a couple of spectacular stops in the final two minutes to insure the devils' third straight victory today it was brodeur , islanders coach rick bowness said he was sensational the islanders , skating with two of their four new players , played perhaps their best 20 minutes of the season at the start of today s game relying on the skill of zigmund palffy , who scored the islanders' second goal , the speed of the newly acquired joe sacco , and the goaltending of tommy salo , the islanders outshot the devils by 126 in the first period and took a 10 lead on a goal by kip miller miller , who was called up from utah of the international hockey league on friday night , beat brodeur with a slap shot inside the far post 5 minutes and 51 seconds into the game but the devils quickly reestablished themselves , tying the game at 11 on a goal by the rookie patrik elias at 1 26 elias , who leads all rookies in goals with 15 , knocked a rebound past salo , who lay prone after making saves on scott neidermayer and doug gilmour doug bodger and brian rolston scored the devils' other goals bodger scored at 17 17 of the second period after the islanders twice failed to clear the puck out of their end he was fed the puck by dave andreychuk , skated in from the blue line and fired the puck past salo rolston scored at 3 40 of the third period on a wrist shot from the top of the left circle , with salo screened palffy s goal , his 30th , came at 15 29 from the right circle , beating brodeur under his glove brodeur foiled the rest of the islanders' attempts in the islanders' first deal on friday , milbury sent bryan mccabe , todd bertuzzi and the draft pick to the vancouver canucks for forward trevor linden in the second deal , he sent travis green , doug houda and the minor leaguer tony tuzzolino to anaheim for sacco , center mark janssens and defenseman jj daigneault linden , who had not played in the canucks' last six games because of a sprained knee , will not join the islanders until after the olympics , in which he will play for team canada when he was announced as a scratch today , he received a loud welcome from the capacity coliseum crowd daigneault , who was not reached in time to leave for new york on friday , also did not play sacco , a right wing , created several scoring chances for himself today , and janssens was a force in the faceoff circle when you get three or four new guys , you 're not as sharp , devils coach jacques lemaire said but in a matter of time , they will adjust in addition to the islanders' latest improvements , there were hints today from both milbury and the prospective coowner steven gluckstern that detroit s unsigned free agent sergei fedorov is still in the islanders' plans i 'd still like to have a very talented center , milbury said but he said none of the trades made on friday were made in the hopes of eventually reaching a deal with the red wings for fedorov slap shots devils defenseman ken daneyko was cleared by the national hockey league yesterday to return to play following alcohol rehabilitation daneyko , who resumed working out with the team tuesday , is expected to return to action after the olympic break photo devils goalie martin brodeur watching the puck after stopping a shot by the islanders' dan plante yesterday \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)
purchase , ny , jan 31 when the knicks and the miami heat meet on the court , as they will at 1 pm sunday at madison square garden , the game usually features its fair share of hazards there are the wrecking balls that alonzo mourning calls his elbows charles oakley is a threat to anyone on the court , as well as the fans seated within the first few rows there is even the possibility of a p j browngenerated somersault but there is little doubt that the smallest player on the floor , tim hardaway , is the most dangerous while the rest of the combatants spend their 48 minutes banging , bruising and belittling one another , hardaway stands outside it , usually about 25 feet from the basket , raining points and terror on the knicks when miami surfaces on the schedule , coach jeff van gundy s days and nights are filled with ideas , imagined and usually discarded , about ways to stop hardaway while game 5 s benchclearing brawl may be the enduring memory of last year s eastern conference semifinal matchup between the knicks and the heat , it was hardaway who delivered the most painful blows in that series , time after time van gundy tried one player after another on him , but none could stop the stocky point guard when he caught fire the knicks have slowed him at times since he joined the heat , but they have always been susceptible to his most combustible moments in last year s playoff series , hardaway dominated the action , scoring 13 straight points at one point in game 2 , and finishing the knicks off with a 38point effort in game 7 last wednesday in miami , in the first meeting between the teams this season , hardaway broke loose for 15 fourthquarter points , including the decisive 3point field goal in the final minute of an 8884 heat victory he s really a great offensive player , van gundy said he s a great postup player , so when you 're playing point guards on him he can take them in the post if you use bigger players to take him out of the post game , they are a little more vulnerable on the perimeter but certainly we can do a better job last year , in the playoff series , he was shooting in the mid30 s until game 7 so , we have , in the past , done a good job the last two times we 've played them , he s dominated the game the 31yearold hardaway is a bigtime player and a bigshot maker , but you would be hard pressed to find anyone who believes he is as big as he claims to be listed at 6 feet , 195 pounds , hardaway is estimated to be in the 5foot10inch range but his repertory belies his size , with a postup game learned on the playgrounds of chicago , and a jumpshot range that seemingly extends to midcourt the knicks tried charlie ward on him last week , after chris childs suffered a concussion that sent him to the hospital after just two minutes childs , a good lowpost defender , might have helped if he had n't been injured , but it s doubtful he would have made a big difference after all , van gundy tried the 63 john starks on hardway in the fourth quarter , then gave the assignment to the 66 allan houston all to no avail when you have a neon light like he does , it s hard to take anything away , said childs , who returned to practice today and hopes to play on sunday he s such an aggressive player , so i think you have to be up into him more than backing up off him and letting him come at you you give yourself a better chance if you 're dictating where he goes instead of him dictating he can go down low and he can shoot the ball , added starks normally , they post him up but he can beat guys off the dribble anybody who can do that is going to make it double tough to cover him he s kind of like michael jordan , where he s got three or four moves he can go to so you just have to play him he s the type of guy who can do a lot of things with the ball you do n't try to lock in one thing because he can fool you a lot of times with the way he dribbles the basketball starks s use of the dreaded mj word shows just how much respect he has for hardaway i do n't think anybody stops him , because he s a great postup player , van gundy said but it s not about totally shutting any one guy out in a game it s limiting him i think that s the key with anybody the last two games we 've really struggled limiting him it s not impossible to stop players like hardaway or jordan , who dominate the ball obviously , they 're talented offensive players but you ca n't go into the game believing that you have no answers if you do n't believe that you can stop them , you ca n't win you have to have answers one of the problems with stopping hardaway is that he does not rely on a pet move once renowned for a killer crossover dribble hardaway s game has blossomed again in miami his numbers initially dipped with the heat after his trade from golden state in february 1996 , and he tested the freeagent market the next summer the knicks expressed interest but opted for childs , partly because of concerns about hardaway s knee \( hardaway sat out the entire 199394 season because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee \) so he returned to miami and has caused the knicks to endure secondguesses ever since i think their whole team is more effective in transition , and he s the catalyst there , van gundy said he gets the big guys involved running the floor he gets voshon lenard spotup 3pointers he s great breaking teams down and he can shoot the pullup 3 that s the problem of the whole thing he s a multidimensional player as far as his ability to shoot the 3 , to drive and finish , and to drive and deliver people the ball you have to keep in front of him but you ca n't keep in front of him at the expense of relaxing on ball pressure that s the challenge and you 've got to pick him up a good full step beyond the 3point line to me , he s got balance in his game he penetrates , but he does n't overpenetrate and dominate the ball too much he shoots the 3 well , but he does n't shoot it too much to detract from other players and at the end of the fourth quarter , you know it s going to be him rebounds chris childs said he will test himself in warmups before sunday s game to determine whether he can play against miami it feels funny being out there , he said your reflexes are n't the same and you 're kind of groggy , but i got through it ok the doctors said that is to be expected it s a postconcussion syndrome they said it would be like that for a couple of days hopefully , tomorrow when i get to the arena to warm up it will feel a little better the headaches are going to be there the knicks will also make a gametime decision on buck williams , who did not practice today with a sore left knee photo tim hardaway \( photograph by associated press \)
teheran , iran , dec 4 an attack on visiting american businessmen and the assassination of a prominent dissident here have caused fresh unease among critics of the government , who say they fear a campaign of violence by conservative forces the same concern is being expressed by foreign diplomats , who say they suspect that the attacks carried out on a single weekend last month may have been staged with at least the tacit approval of conservative elements in the government the assaults have been condemned in strong terms by president mohammed khatami , a relative moderate who commands broad popular support but the conservative figures who still wield most power in iran have expressed fewer regrets , adding to the view that the attacks may have been part of an internal power struggle this shows that there are powerful forces in iran who are not going to let their critics go unanswered , one western envoy said and this is not a softie regime since mr khatami s election 19 months ago , the conservatives who control iran s parliament , judiciary and the post of supreme leader have battled hard to block his agenda and to silence his allies , even arresting one of his top supporters but the attacks , on the weekend of nov 2122 , are being seen by many here as marking a worrying new turn these events have sent a very great shock through the society , said abbas shayegan , a critic of the government who was close to the dissident who was assassinated , dariush foruhar they were well thoughtout by the government with the intention to oppress among the reasons diplomats and others mentioned as cause for their suspicions of official acquiescence were the fact iranian security forces were uncooperative in responding to reports of the nov 21 attack on the americans their minibus was attacked by men wielding crowbars who had used their cars to block a hotel driveway as the group returned from a trip inside iran none of the 13 americans in the delegation were hurt , but many bus windows were shattered in the attack , which one wellinformed diplomat described as a meticulous and precise an iranian police officer ultimately escorted the americans back to their hotel , but not before the group was left waiting for more than an hour for a police response the next day , diplomats said , iranian officials promised that security forces would escort the group to the airport for a flight out of the country but a senior western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said that no visible iranian escort ever arrived an iranian group calling itself the devotees of islam has taken responsibility for the attack , saying that it was intended to discourage the kinds of renewed private contacts between iran and the united states advocated by mr khatami the assassination of mr foruhar and his wife , parveneh , who were stabbed to death in their teheran home , has prompted a louder outcry mr foruhar , who was wellknown for his nationalist and secular views , was prominent among opposition leaders whose activities are officially banned but usually tolerated at a funeral for the slain couple last week , thousands of mourners chanted slogans that included down with despotism ! the foruhar home was said by mr shayegan and other activists to have been under roundtheclock surveillance by iran s ministry of information , the country s intelligence service they said that surveillance cameras were known to have been trained on entrances to the home , and that it would have been impossible for the assailants to enter or leave without the information ministry s knowledge no one has been arrested in connection with the attack , and no one has taken responsibility for it the activists said they feared the killings were intended as a warning to other opposition figures critical of the government
his perfect game created a cottage industry for david wells , whose locker is now stuffed with memorabilia requiring his signature there will always be another beanie baby or ticket stub or baseball for wells to scrawl his name across the perfect game , too , heightened expectations of wells and , others believe , wells s expectations for himself sometimes regarded as undisciplined in the past , wells marches onward toward his first 20victory season he pitched a fourhit shutout last night to beat minnesota , 70 , at yankee stadium , in his first game against the twins since he pitched the perfect game may 17 there were no unpleasant surprises for the 37 , 413 who watched the yankees have won the first six games of their current homestand , outscoring their opponents by 5512 and trailing in only 3 1 2 of 54 innings they have won 9 of their last 10 games , for an unthinkable record of 86 victories and 29 losses they are 57 games over 500 for the first time since sept 10 , 1939 they have a monopoly on victory wells has won 15 of his last 16 decisions since losing his first start of the year , and with perhaps 9 starts remaining for a team that loses once or twice between full moons , the odds of him realizing 20 victories are excellent after sparring with managers and coaches over the years over his conditioning or other alleged violations , wells is concentrated and focused , like all those around him the perfect game , yankees manager joe torre said , called a lot of attention to him he added , that could be the reason why he s so consistent wells is permanently on notice , in other words if he has the ability to pitch a perfect game , he has the ability to win another member of the organization says wells sometimes worried that others did not have faith in him , did not believe in his ability but that has never been the case , said the person maybe the only person who was n't sure if david had it in him was david maybe the perfect game changed that wells was terrific before the perfect game , even better since 101 with a 256 earned run average over his last seven starts , dating to june 20 , opposing batters have just 1 hit in 35 atbats with runners in scoring position torre mentioned that on those nights wells did not have his great stuff if his curveball was missing , if his fastball did n't have its usual zip he had fought and battled and found a way to win unfortunately for the twins and typical of the yankees , wells did have his great stuff last night good fastball , said jorge posada , his catcher very sharp curveball , cut fastball , sinker and a changeup everything brent gates quickly ended the question of whether wells would throw backtoback perfect games against the twins the second batter of the game , gates bounced a chopper down the thirdbase line , the ball kicking past scott brosius for a double wells then retired paul molitor and ron coomer on easy flyouts , ending the twins' only scoring threat of the game it s typical of how he pitches , said molitor , referring to his first atbat i think i saw seven or eight pitches a couple of fastballs , a couple of sliders , a couple of curveballs he does n't establish a pattern without any clues , the twins were lost wells faced three batters over the minimum , striking out four and walking none , as his teammates hammered the former yankees prospect eric milton paul o'neill slugged a tworun homer in the first , posada s runscoring single capped a threerun rally in the third , and milton coming back from a sore shoulder was gone by the fifth inning , when posada smacked another tworun double torre watched from the dugout , stoic as ever , on a milestone day for him torre was managing the mets on aug 6 , 1977 , when the san francisco giants beat them , 73 felix millan had three hits for the mets , ed kranepool went 0 for 4 , willie mccovey played first base for the giants pat zachry an unusual and talented pitcher of his time , as wells is unusual and talented suffered the defeat that reduced torre s managerial record to 3131 , 500 the yankees' victory last night improved torre s career record to 1 , 168 victories and 1 , 168 losses , the first time he had reached 500 since that night more than 21 years ago after leaving the mets , he managed atlanta and st louis , before joining the yankees prior to the 1996 season , 109 games under 500 frank torre , his brother , had mentioned to joe before this season that he might have a chance to reach 500 again but neither had an inkling , the manager acknowledged , that it could be done this summer neither had an inkling the yankees could be so good neither imagined the possibility of 120 victories some of his players were aware of torre s record derek jeter sat next to torre in the dugout in the eighth inning and asked , in his playful manner , are you nervous \? torre replied , just do n't leave me there slim chance of that the yankees seem to be jetting torre past 500 hopefully , we 'll continue to run in the plus direction , torre said i do n't want to have to get to 500 any more times in my career inside pitch the yankees have held leads in 40 consecutive games , tying the major league record held by the 1932 yankees the last time the yankees played a game in which they never led was june 28 , against the mets the yankees have held a lead in all but one of their 52 home games photos david wells held the twins to four hits and pitched to just three batters over the minimum last night in improving to 152 \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c1 \) alex ochoa watched paul o'neill s firstinning homer sail over the wall as derek jeter rounded the bases \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c3 \)

amplification , bringing the audience firmly back to the words after all , it was reading night at the kgb bar in the east village soviet memorabilia crowded the walls about them ashtrays were overflowing red stripe and guinness were being consumed in this decaflattefree zone , a dark , smoky watering hole at 85 east fourth street near second avenue , across the street from la mama experimental theater company if downtown is the city s hothouse of literary fiction , kgb is at the heart of what s going on right now , said fran dilustro gordon , founder of the tonier reading series at the national arts club on gramercy park south they have the best of contemporary american literature , and the audiences are full of young writers just beginning their own journeys and lately , what began as a grungy salon of the downtown lit pack has begun to develop an outsized reputation not only is its claustrophobic space frequently overwhelmed by crowds spilling into the ancient tiled hallway and down the stairs , but kgb has burnished its own mystique with the publication this month of the kgb bar reader the anthology of 28 stories was edited by ken foster , the curator of the reading series , and it is already in its second printing in this virtual age , there is a hunger among audiences to see writers in the flesh now , said laurie stone , a cultural critic at the village voice who is coordinating her own new reading series at the bat theater company in tribeca there are thousands of auctorial readings in the five boroughs every year nearly two dozen just about every night solely in the city s literary superstores , including the 18 barnes noble emporiums , the two borders books and music stores , and the tower records bookstore the reading roster is swelled by dozens of events at public libraries , universities and other institutions , from the 60yearold motherofallseries at the 92d street y to sessions at galleries , theaters , cafes and a legion of impromptu spaces that include public parks but none of the others inhabit a former ukrainian social club that was once a meeting place for coldwar communists and socialists on the walls are stalinist woodcuts , world war ii communist antinazi posters , a picture of valentina v tereshkova \( the first woman in space \) , hammerandsickle flags and the odd lenin bust and balalaika most of the bar s artifacts had been stored in the building itself they were dusted off to serve nightowl capitalism as emblems of retro commie chic initially this dismayed some of the leftward literary grazers at kgb these days , the bar is better read than red i had my very first drink here with my father when i was 5 , said denis woychuk , the bar s principal owner , who leases three other floors of the redbrick building , excluding the offices of the ukrainianamerican league , which still functions in the basement the league operated the building as a private social club from 1948 to 1988 mr woychuk s father once worked for the league , and the secondfloor space was the social club s bar like everyone else in the joint , mr woychuk has his own literary resume as the author of two children s books and a memoir of his work as a lawyer for the mentally ill kgb s noirish past also included a stint as a speakeasy , the palm casino , under the control of lucky luciano we have carefully fostered the rumor that lucky hung out there all the time , said melvin jules bukiet , a part owner of kgb , who teaches creative writing at sarah lawrence college and has written two novels and two collections of stories it s my favorite place to read , said rick moody , author of the ice storm , who has taken the lectern there four times in comparison with other places , kgb is casual and more open to experimentation and spontaneous magic , he said if the fouryearold kgb series draws boldface fiction writers and memoirists such as junot diaz \( drown \) , a m homes \( the end of alice \) and kathryn harrison \( the kiss \) , it also highlights newcomers like jaime clark and david ryan they met as writing students at bennington college in vermont and will be reading together on nov 8 part of the draw is kgb s status as a neighborhood bar , beckoning with its scuzzy redandblueneon sign , one flight up the marble treads worn down by generations of ukrainians kgb gets its share of bikers and roistering fraternity pals who join the bar s gardenvariety downtown panartistic clientele of academic types , painters , wouldbe filmmakers , actor gonnabes and assorted wordworkers kgb is the kind of place that requires a bouncer for its tough earlyhours weekend crowd
cape canaveral , fla nov 8 john glenn , the world s oldest space traveler , said today that he slept like a log his first night back on earth after a nineday shuttle mission at the discovery crew s first news conference after their return , senator glenn admitted that he did n't feel too hot when he emerged from the shuttle upon landing on saturday mr glenn , 77 , who in 1962 became the first american to orbit earth , said he struggled against gravity i was walking straddlelegged to keep my balance a little bit , he said i'm probably 95 or 98 percent back to normal now nasa doctors said none of the astronauts showed significant medical problems after a journey of 36 million miles and 134 orbits around the earth stephen k robinson , 43 , a mission specialist , said he had gashed his head traveling through a tunnel inside the shuttle going kind of fast , but that he had not lacked for doctors on board they just jumped with delight , he said mr glenn steered questions to his crewmates lieut col curtis l brown jr , 42 , the shuttle s commander lieut col steven w lindsey , 38 , the pilot scott e parazynski , 37 , a mission specialist and the senator s attending doctor in space 35yearold pedro duque , another mission specialist and the first spaniard to go into space , and chiaki mukai , 46 , the payload specialist they 're the heroes of this thing as far as i am concerned , mr glenn said some other members of the discovery crew said they were grateful for the interest mr glenn brought to the space program the attention is wonderful and i hope it does last , said dr parazynski , whom mr glenn called count dracula because he was always drawing blood from him the crew and their families flew to houston today after the press conference for a welcoming ceremony and 17 days of testing at the johnson space center mr glenn , who is the subject of geriatric research , faces more blood tests and urine collection , as well as cardiovascular , bone loss and sleep studies he will not be allowed to drink alcohol or caffeine and his sleep , exercise and food consumption will be monitored at the press conference , mr glenn said the space trip had left him with both a sense of accomplishment and a little let down that the whole thing is over he said this would be his last attempt at space flight in deference to annie , his wife of 55 years she s been through enough , he said i owe her some consideration at this point in life mr glenn , who will retire from the senate in january after representing ohio for 24 years , is expected to return to his home in the washington area around thanksgiving , but he is scheduled to undergo sporadic testing for the next six months today he said he had not discussed followup relationships or anything like that with nasa , but wanted to help promote the benefits of the space program he said he also planned to work with students at ohio state university and his alma mater , muskingum college in ohio , to address the cynical and apathetic attitude he sees in the country asked to compare his discovery flight with his first trip into space , he said the first flight was the first orbital flight we ever tried we were just trying to find out if we could do it or not now , we had 83 different research projects on this one flight , things of tremendous value they 're out there on the cutting edge of science he did note the difference in the shuttle itself , which was far more spacious than the tiny cockpit he occupied on his first flight in describing the unflattering effects of weightlessness on the crew , mr glenn singled out dr mukai , noting , chiaki had the roundest face i 'd ever seen dr mukai laughed at the comment and had only praise for her fellow astronaut i was so amazed and impressed by senator glenn , she said he encourages me quite a lot asked by an 83yearold reporter if there was hope for people of my generation , mr glenn said there s a lot of hope you should run your life not by the calendar but how you feel , and what you 're interests are and ambitions old folks have dreams and ambitions too , like everybody else do n't sit on a couch someplace photo in front of a 1962 photograph of himself , john glenn spoke with reporters at the kennedy space center yesterday about his latest flight \( associated press \)
a laserbased system for detecting air turbulence and other invisible hazards to planes has been tested at kennedy international airport in new york with results that could improve airline safety the technique uses lasers to listen for the sound of rapidly moving air the first application is for detecting the wake behind large jets , which can toss smaller planes much as the wake of a large ship can swamp a rowboat scientists also hope they can adapt the technique to hear the microbursts that cause wind shear , a deadly hazard to planes at low altitude , and to detect clearair turbulence , another danger to aircraft the technique had a twoweek tryout recently in the patchy grass at the end of kennedy s runway 31 right as inbound jets screamed overhead every few minutes at 200 feet and 200 miles an hour , a team of scientists tested two laserpowered ears soon , they hope , the lasers will let them pinpoint distant dangers that radar can miss , like wind shear and clear air turbulence , the phenomenon that jostled a continental airlines plane bound from los angeles to honolulu last thursday , injuring several passengers a similar incident happened to a us airways boeing 757 on sunday , forcing an emergency landing in oklahoma city and injuring seven already , the scientists are adding to the data base about the corkscrewlike vortex that comes off each wingtip of planes in flight , generating turbulence that can cause planes following too closely to lose control the scientists say the technique could also help in spotting tornadoes there is mounting evidence that all of these weather phenomena and manmade vortices generate sound , said frank l rees , the inventor of the system , which is based on a formerly secret navy method for listening underwater for ships and submarines radar is the main method for tracking distant objects or weather phenomena , but radar cannot see movement in air , unless the air contains fairly substantial objects , like raindrops or hail the idea of the new system , socrates , or sensor for characterizing ringeddy atmospheric turbulence emanating sound , is to use lasers , which are far more precise than radar waves , in what amounts to seeing sound , rather than hearing it the federal aviation administration has provided about 35 million for the project in the last two years the new york test , which ran from may 11 to friday , involved two such ears , a few hundred yards from the touchdown zone on kennedy s main runway one ear , which stretched across the path of incoming planes , was formed by two tripods , one firing a lowpowered laser and the other holding a reflector another pair of tripods , also with laser and reflector , sat parallel to the planes' path the pulses of laser energy , in a color invisible to the eye , made a roundtrip of about 640 feet in clear air , when there are no vibrations in the air , the beam s travel time was constant but light slows as it passes through denser air , so when a sound wave from an aircraft crossed the path of the laser , the compressed air at the beginning of the wave slowed the light , making the roundtrip slower and seeming to make the distance longer a human would be hardpressed to tell the difference , but computers in a nearby trailer can the path appeared to get longer by about one angstrom , or about a billionth the width of a human hair the amount of delay measured as a fraction of a second is so small that there is no word in common use to describe it it is equal to a second divided by the number 1 followed by 15 zeroes the scientists , from mr rees s company , flight safety technologies , of new london , conn , and lockheedmartin ocean , radar and sensor systems , of syracuse , gathered around a computer screen in a nearby trailer , which displayed what could be called voiceprints of the passing jets the ear stretched across the path of the jets shows engine noise , the sound of air pushed aside by the plane and , after it has passed overhead and reached the runway , even the sound of the thrust reversers the ear parallel to the planes hears the engines as a brief burst , but a few seconds after the plane has passed , it hears the vortices , as they slowly drift to earth boeing 747 s make a roar , but 737 s seem sometimes to whisper past and the hefty 757 makes a noise like an even larger plane , because of a feature in its wing design for the experiment , scientists are also using conventional microphones , to match sounds against the voiceprints they are making once that is done , said dr richard m williams , of lockheedmartin , the next step will be adding more ears and integrating their measurements to pinpoint the sound source this is possible because unlike a human ear , which hears sounds from all directions , these pick up sounds only from what is ahead or behind them with an array of lasers , each reading helps pinpoint the direction of a sound each absence of a reading indicates an area that the sound could not have come from in addition , if two parallel lasers hear the same sound , the computer knows which one heard it first , and , therefore , which direction the sound is coming from measuring the interval between the arrival of sound at one ear and then another , the computer can figure out how far the source is from each laser and thus can find the source by triangulation that could be an especially important tool at kennedy at most other airports , air traffic controllers can rely on a terminal doppler weather radar to spot wind shear , but kennedy and la guardia airports have none , because of opposition , based largely on fears of radiation , from people near sites where the faa wanted to build the radar opponents have won support from senator alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york , leaving the agency stymied if a groundbased system works , the next step would be to put a laser on a plane and shine the beam straight ahead tiny particles in the air , far smaller than what radar can see , move in concert with the air , and if a laser can reflect off them and back to the plane a computer could analyze their movement and spot turbulence photo sam kovnat , chairman of flight safety technologies , at kennedy international airport with equipment that uses lasers to detect air turbulence \( vic delucia the new york times \)
the cavendish invitational pairs is by far the strongest event of its kind in north america , and there is nothing quite like it anywhere in the world before play starts , each pair is sold in a calcutta auction , and the proceeds are eventually shared in accordance with the tournament results it will be played in las vegas this weekend , and the 120 contestants include almost all the top american players and a sprinkling from other countries argentina , australia , china , france , germany , israel , italy , the netherlands , new zealand , poland , romania and scotland last year the calcutta pool totaled 1 , 288 , 500 , and most of the money went to players and their supporters who were not favored in the original auction two italian pairs finished second and third , but apart from them none of the top 10 in the calcutta earned any cash fifth and sixth places at the finish went to two australians and two argentines who were ranked 53d and 60th in the auction the winners in the field of 60 pairs were michael seamon of miami beach and harry tudor of miami , who were 32d in the calcutta this was an astonishing result for tudor , who had won two years earlier with a different partner on his only other cavendish appearance this year he will try for his third victory at the start of the 1997 event , tudor as north gambled on the diagramed deal and survived his partner showed a strong hand with six diamonds and five spades , and he might well have contented himself with a jump to five diamonds his actual fourdiamond bid was roman keycard blackwood , and he jumped optimistically to slam when his partner showed three aces if west had led a red card he would have defeated the slam , but he selected a club even now , seamon needed good breaks in the minor suits he won with the club ace , crossed to the diamond king and ruffed a club then he ruffed a spade and ruffed a club , establishing three winners in the dummy when he then played the ace and another diamond , it was all over the heart king could be overtaken to provide three discards for spades on clubs not surprisingly , seamon and tudor were the only pair to bid and make a slam they gained 425 imps , the maximum , based on a comparison with the other 29 tables if the slam had failed , they would have finished fifth instead of first diagram
west point , ny , sept 15 it has played football for 108 years , 1 , 011 games in all against teams from across the nation it maintains a narrow edge over navy in one of the oldest and most resonant rivalries in college sports but the history of army football takes a modern turn saturday when a pair of teams without a victory square off at michie stadium when army \( 01 \) faces cincinnati \( 02 \) here , the black knights will turn the page on more than a century as an independent to compete in their first game as the newest member of conference usa it is the beginning of an era when fox sports net , new rivals such as southern mississippi and postseason games like the liberty bowl will become part of army lore along with glenn davis and the commanderinchief s trophy in the view of army athletic officials , it is vital to remaining in the mainstream of bigtime college football this shows our commitment to playing division ia football , said al vanderbush , army s athletic director we were playing a couple of division iaa schools and getting criticized for it other schools were using it to recruit against us this makes us more competitive , gives us an identity , and i believe kids today would like to look up and see there is a conference championship to play for and an allconference team to make more important , beyond just survival , it shifts army s focus to getting a greater share of the millions of television dollars flowing into college football besides a competitive schedule and the promise of bowl games , army now gets a marketing outfit the conference dedicated to making it network and cableready army is not alone in trying to reposition itself in an increasingly competitive race for television dollars and bowl payouts last may , the presidents of eight western universities , including air force , stunned the college athletic community when they announced they were leaving the western athletic conference to form their own league they cited everything from unmanageable travel the conference stretched from hawaii to houston to the dilution of geographical rivalries but the fact that television and bowl money did not stretch far when divided by 16 teams was perhaps the clincher even notre dame , the only major power among the eight remaining division ia independents , which has its own fiveyear , 45 million television contract with nbc , is talking to big ten officials about joining the conference to insure economic health and stability just as in professional sports , the driving factor in this climate of change is television money the big ten commissioner , james e delany , estimates the annual market for college football television rights at 300 million and growing in the new bowl championship series that abc will televise , for example , the title game will be worth from 11 million to 12 million a team jon d litner , senior vice president for programming at abc sports , says that like the makers of soft drinks , schools are fighting for shelf space and are turning to highquality marketing and aggressive representation there s an enormous amount of revenue that television generates , litner said i'm sure schools are making decisions on who they affiliate with because of television abc , along with espn also under the disney umbrella is the biggest player in college football and will broadcast 21 of 26 postseason games conference usa , in its third year of existence , offered army access it did not previously have to a television contract and two bowl games it also offered a schedule of midmajor southern universities with which academy officials believed a school of 4 , 000 cadets none on true athletic scholarships could compete the conference is composed of cincinnati , tulane , memphis , louisville , houston , southern miss and east carolina , and its champion earns an automatic berth in the liberty bowl , which last year had a 11 million payout per team in addition , the humanitarian bowl in boise , idaho , will hold a place for another conference usa team , worth an additional 750 , 000 to each team and the conference s deal with fox sports net pays immediate dividends in exposure five army games are scheduled to be televised this season and the number could reach nine last year , three army games were televised , including the navy game the television and bowl opportunities are attached exclusively to the conferences anymore , said army coach bob sutton the independents out there do n't really have a voice we have a broad recruiting base in the south that we 're going to reach more effectively every game is going to mean something in the conference standings kids are going to see us more and we 'll be validated as a program the athletic budget at army is 15 million , of which 3 million comes from the government , primarily to cover salaries revenue from football carries the academy s 25 other athletic teams vanderbush said attendance and concessions at army s home games , television contracts and donations connected to the football program account for the vast majority of the remaining 12 million army will continue to play air force and navy for the commanderinchief s trophy and , in an essential piece of deal making , did not give up its television rights for the annual classic against the midshipmen the armynavy game , recently renewed by cbs through 2008 , is among the most lucrative in college sports the previous contract was worth 1 million a year for both army and navy , which remains an independent , and vanderbush said that had increased significantly , although he would not give a figure vanderbush , the army athletic director , said that the conference usa affiliation is initially worth an additional 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 a year to army , though the windfall is largely offset this year because the black knights lost a home game in the switch to the conference schedule conference usa is part of the bowl championship series , but is guaranteed a place in only one of the four bigmoney games fiesta , rose , sugar or orange if one of its teams finishes no 6 or higher in the series' ranking still , the conference receives 800 , 000 this year just for being a part of the series , according to mike slive , the conference s commissioner slive said flatly that army would make more money in conference usa than it would have as an independent in turn , he said , the other schools in the conference have acquired a valuable commodity to bolster their status in the marketplace we get its storied tradition and great football history , which helps our name recognition , slive said contracts and governance are conferencedriven the revenues are marketdriven our goal is to be at the table and be ready to move up and take our share vanderbush said that the role of athletic director had evolved from that of administrator to that of businessman and entrepreneur that thought was echoed by athletic directors at places like southern methodist , texas christian , rice and the five other universities who were divorced by their higherprofile mates in the wac and retain the name of their conference but little else roy kramer , the longtime commissioner of the powerful southeastern conference , anticipates more conference realignment fortunately for army , it has made its move my athletic directors can divide , kramer said and unless you have something valuable to bring , conferences may get smaller before they get bigger photos joe benson , a senior tight end , leading army

san diego , oct 19 his team trailing , two games to none , san diego padres manager bruce bochy wrestled today with who his starting pitcher would be in game 4 of the world series the pitching coach dave stewart had said he would like to give kevin brown , the game 1 starter , an added day of rest and give joey hamilton a world series start but if brown is healthy he has been suffering from sinus problems it seems he will pitch on three days' rest in game 4 then he can go in game 7 , bochy said , perhaps optimistically i support boch , stewart said whatever boch decides to do , i support that and it sounds as if bochy is leaning toward brown bochy said brown felt a lot better today still , stewart is concerned about brown , who has thrown a careerhigh 288 1 3 innings \( including the postseason \) , which is 43 1 3 more than the nearest yankee , david wells but when asked if the series being 30 or 21 made a difference in who would start , stewart seemed to say yes , though both scenarios eventually led back to brown should sterling hitchcock outpitch david cone and the padres win on tuesday night , game 4 would take on added significance because with a victory , stewart said , that might turn the series around and , who would the padres want pitching a mustwin game \? no one more than brown how about if hitchcock loses and the padres go down by 30 \? then , stewart said , you have to go with your best starter in an elimination game that , of course , is brown either way you want to start him , is the conclusion stewart arrived at but , stewart said , he s had a long , long , long year you know what you 're going to get with kevin brown , stewart said what you do n't know is how effective he will be based on the amount of innings he has already pitched the days of the 300inning pitcher are over it just does n't happen anymore which is why stewart had said after sunday s game 2 loss i was n't really sold on starting kevin in game 4 anyway so , if we can afford to hold him , i 'd prefer to do that one thing the padres certainly cannot afford is another loss we have to pitch better and catch the ball , bochy said we ca n't give new york extra outs or atbats and we ca n't walk guys they do a lot of good things they are obviously an outstanding ball club we have to play well to beat them and since the seventh inning of game 1 , when they lost a 52 lead , the padres have not bochy and tony gwynn have been in a similar situation , however they played on the last padres team to make the world series , in 1984 the padres lost that series , 41 , to detroit , but in the national league championship series , the padres lost the first two games in chicago before going back to san diego to win the next three and the series bochy likened the 1984 plane ride home from chicago to a funeral gwynn said we were done we were toast and we knew it the guys already had travel brochures out still , the yankees are not the cubs and when gwynn was asked what the padres need to do better to defeat the yankees , he shot back , we ai n't beat them yet , so i do n't know inside pitch the padres' charter from new york did not arrive in san diego until 5 30 am monday ken caminiti was one of a number of players who did not participate in the team s optional workout today caminiti was home nursing a sore groin , although manager bruce bochy said caminiti would be ready to play game 3 sterling hitchcock , san diego s scheduled starting pitcher for game 3 , has been suffering from flulike symptoms , as have many of the padres i feel a little congestion , but it s no big deal , he said hitchcock , who came up through the yankee organization , was asked what areas the yankees told him he needed to improve on and what kind of feedback he had received when he was a member of the organization pretty much learning how to pack my luggage and leave , hitchcock said , eliciting laughter there was n't a whole lot of correspondence that way the padres' owner , john moores , on yankee stadium now i see why george steinbrenner needs a new stadium i saw yankee stadium when i was a kid on television it seemed much grander the aisles are smaller the vendors do n't have room and the neighborhood was very disappointing

brussels , nov 26 the clinton administration has presented nato with a farreaching program that seeks to define what the alliance has become since the cold war ended , and sets out its goals for the next century but the proposals are running into european opposition that threatens to undermine a 50thanniversary nato summit meeting in washington in april nato diplomats say the agenda for the meeting is intended partly to convince congress that nato is still central to american security , but it has raised european concerns that the united states is trying to turn the organization into a freewheeling global vehicle for its own interests at the root of the differences lies the american conviction that nato should now be seen as an alliance of interests , as much as one dedicated to the defense of a specific territory washington believes those interests may in some instances push the members into farflung activities , for example , to counter chemical and biological weapons and the spread of nuclear weapons or terrorism of course , when america talks of the defense of interests , and not just territories , it leads to continued suspicions that the united states is seeking to globalize nato , said a senior official nato is still euroatlantic , but we should not artificially exclude what we might use nato for the washington meeting amounts to a watershed for nato it is intended to define nato s new strategic concept after almost a decade of largely improvised adaptations to the postcoldwar world it will also set out a doctrine that takes the allies a very long way beyond the commitment to mutual selfdefense that lay at the core of the washington treaty of 1949 that set up the north atlantic treaty organization but after a summer and autumn largely consumed by the crisis in kosovo , and in the light of an american agenda clearly intended to represent president clinton s legacy for the alliance , there is widespread concern at headquarters here that agreement is far from assured a european official said the need to adapt and to formalize the changes that have taken place since 1989 is not in dispute but he said several european countries are concerned that washington wants to push the alliance too far beyond its core european commitments , and may be exaggerating threats to justify this the americans have put a program on the table that calls for nato to play a major role in controlling and countering weapons of mass destruction nuclear , biological and chemical , he said but we worry that america may be creating a new 'threat perception' that will scare our populations with visions of anthrax and gangrene , while allowing nato to become a global organization france , always concerned with what it sometimes calls american hegemony and keen to develop europe s own military abilities , and germany , whose new coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens has a broadly antimilitarist bent , are among those wary of giving nato too sweeping a mission russia is also deeply concerned in particular , officials said , a sharp conflict exists over washington s determination to include in a new mission or vision statement \( the precise term is under discussion \) a stipulation that the alliance may , in exceptional circumstances , act without a specific mandate from the united nations security council in the absence of this margin for maneuver , american officials contend , nato would effectively place itself at the mercy of a russian or chinese veto of a mission , even in the face of an overwhelming humanitarian crisis the lesson of kosovo is that we need a modicum of flexibility , a nato diplomat said a security council mandate is highly desirable but we should not tie our hands in advance during the kosovo crisis , despite russian opposition and the absence of a specific security council mandate , nato authorized possible military action against serbia american officials , including the special balkans envoy richard c holbrooke , said this decision amounted to an important precedent , but european officials generally argued that none had been set joschka fischer , germany s foreign minister and a green party member , is among those who have argued passionately that the rule of law would be threatened and competing regional security blocs encouraged if nato asserted even a limited right to act without an explicit security council mandate we are looking at language that would say something like , 'nato will act under the authority of the united nations , with an appropriate legal basis and , as far as is possible , a un security council resolution , ' one official said but this is a difficult issue that is certain to involve painful discussions other

despite the presence of michael jordan at the bargaining table for the first time in more than a month , there were few encouraging signs yesterday that the fivemonthold national basketball association lockout would end soon owners and players , negotiating for the first time in 13 days , exchanged angry words during bargaining sessions in manhattan that began at 11 am and ended at 11 30 pm after the 12 1 2hour session , commissioner david stern said it s more likely that we wo n't have a season than we will have a season as strange as it sounds , we left on pleasant terms , agreeing that we could n't agree now i think we sit and watch and wait as the season slips away we both made minor adjustments they were n't significant enough to meet our needs no talks were scheduled for today , but the players' negotiating committee was scheduled to meet this morning asked if the players were willing to give up a year s pay , billy hunter , the executive director of the union , said , if they compel us to miss the season , we 'll miss the season the players again asked for a mediator to try to settle the dispute , but stern rejected the request we made progress , but not like we expected , said larry miller , the utah jazz owner one participant , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the afternoon session was less than amicable and several times talks almost broke off completely but enough key people on both sides decided that an open dialogue was better than none at all , the participant said the two sides broke for lunch after meeting for almost two hours they met again for nearly five hours before caucusing between about 6 30 and 7 30 pm neither the owners nor the players took a dinner break there was a sense of urgency conveyed by stern he was said to have made an impassioned plea to the players that losing the season would have a devastating effect on the league madison square garden s president , dave checketts , also grew emotional , a league official said as he was giving a comprehensive presentation of the nba s plan for a collective bargaining agreement , checketts argued with the union s chief outside counsel , jeffrey kessler , and other union lawyers but it was jordan s presence that created the biggest stir he got out of a limousine at about 1 45 pm and took an elevator one flight up to the bargaining session in town for a board of directors meeting for oakley sunglasses , it was jordan s first appearance at the negotiations since oct 28 a marathon session that ended at 1 am in a manhattan law firm though jordan questioned owners about their proposals yesterday , he stayed for only four hours about 5 45 pm he left for a family engagement and returned three hours later the two sides still argued over how to divide roughly 2 billion in annual revenue over the next five to seven years the recent stalemate was prompted by a failed negotiation on nov 20 , a session in which both sides claimed more progress than at any since the lockout began on july 1 but within 48 hours , all progress was shelved the union was upset about an owners proposal that would severely limit the signing of the free agents who can sign for any amount over a team s salary cap the owners then accused the union of reneging on its acceptance of a complex tax formula that was to be used as part of an escrow system in the final years of a proposed sevenyear plan it was unclear late last night whether they had made progress on those economic issues or any myriad others that separate them we felt our last offer gave them what they wanted , which is cost certainty , alonzo mourning said yesterday morning they 're trying to take everything from us this lockout will not end until the owners get as much as they can from the players russ granik , the deputy commissioner , said there s a sense of urgency , but the owners have said they wo n't operate our business in a way that makes no financial sense given that it will take about a month for training camp and freeagent signings to take place after an agreement in principle is reached , the earliest the season could start provided negotiations produced a settlement in the next week would be the second week of january that timetable would mean about a 48 to 50game schedule , figures that straddle the line of being considered a legitimate season photo michael jordan arriving at yesterday s nba allday labor talks in new york jordan stayed for four hours of negotiating \( associated press \)
george steinbrenner , robert kraft , billie jean king and martin jacobson tucked into full plates last week whether or not we join them in giving thanks is irrelevant we do n't sit at their tables steinbrenner was the big turkey , as usual he s code blue wherever he goes , a walking car alarm , suddenly looking fuzzier compared with charles f dolan , the cablevision mogul , who may or may not buy the yankees and hire steinbrenner to run all the new york sports teams who would be surprised if the deal were dead because the boss was too pushy \? the image of steinbrenner trundling out on the ice to show wayne gretzky how to get physical makes my knees freeze , so imagine what it does to the stealthy chuck dolan wants the yankees for the same reason that television networks want to own their hit shows it keeps costs way down this excuse is less endearing than wanting to own sports teams so you can strut around town , throw luxury skybox bashes and harangue big guys while they are showering robert kraft may be able to do all those things in hartford , a city that seemed more amused than ecstatic last weekend when it seemed as though the new england patriots had chosen it over boston after all , people in massachusetts still call people in connecticut swamp yankees yet bostonians must know something , since they originally sent the patriots packing to foxboro the lively mayor of hartford , michael p peters , quickly dismissed my questions about the importance of a football team to a city that had lost much of its claim to fame , the insurance industry , and was in danger of losing even its ballet company for lack of support the patriots would merely be part of the chemistry of our comeback , he said , opening a pr window for the city he reminded me that hartford had the rage of the american basketball league and that the university of connecticut s nationally famous teams would be playing in any new hartford facility peters is right on , of course in the expansion era , a pro team can no longer bestow major league status on a city merely by moving in but if every other whistle stop has a franchise , you look low rent without one on the other hand , a great college franchise may be a better bet when was the last time a university left town because the owner wanted skybox , food and parking concessions \?

the word playground usually conjures up images of swings and sandboxes , but the mercer playground , being built on a narrow strip of land on the west side of mercer street between bleecker and west third streets , will have none of those instead , it will include a long snake path for inline and roller skating , a spray shower , plantings , benches and open space where youngsters can get together and talk the playground , scheduled for completion in the fall at a cost of 340 , 000 , is designed for preteens , not toddlers the project started taking shape in the early 90 s when the lower manhattan neighbors organization opposed a proposal by new york university to create gardens , basically plantings behind a chainlink fence , on the site the group argued that the community would not have enough access to the fencedin greenery instead , it proposed a park for youngsters 8 to 12 there is a playground for younger children just south on mercer street , in front of the nyu coles sports center the group also proposed that the land be permanently transferred from the department of transportation , which has owned it since the days of the master builder robert moses , to the parks department group members say nyu opposes that plan a university spokesman declined to comment instead , the parks department has been allowed to use the land an architect and member of the lower manhattan neighbors organization , peter wormser , came up with a design idea , and a parks department landscape architect , chris crowley , included one of the animal motifs popular with the department these days the community group raised 100 , 000 toward the playground and 100 , 000 for a wroughtiron fence around it when councilwoman kathryn e freed successfully lobbied the council to allocate the remaining 240 , 000 last june , the last piece fell into place it was not easy getting all the competing constituencies to agree on the park this was a test of persistence , said enid braun , president and founder of the lower manhattan neighbors organization it was just basic obstinacy on our part janet allon diagram on a narrow strip on the west side of mercer street , a new park designed to appeal to children over 8 is taking shape completion is set for fall

guatemala , oct 17 forensic teams from three countries have tried to unravel the mystery , but have come to radically different conclusions nearly six months after juan gerardi , a roman catholic bishop and outspoken human rights advocate here , was bludgeoned to death , a solution to his slaying appears further away than ever , even as the political controversy surrounding the case continues to grow despite mounting evidence to the contrary , the guatemalan government continues to maintain that the killing was a crime without a political motive , and imprisoned a dog that prosecutors say took part in it but the roman catholic church and human rights groups say elements of the guatemalan armed forces were involved in the killing , and point to the increasingly bizarre turns the case has taken as proof of an official coverup as a result , bishop gerardi s death has become a major test of the 1996 peace accord that brought an end to 36 years of civil war here and was supposed to install the principle of civilian supremacy with prosecutors now implying that the bishop was the victim of a homosexual crime of passion committed by a priest , many guatemalans appear to be increasingly suspicious of the government this is the most significant case of recent times , but what we have is an investigation designed to cover up , not reveal , the truth , said frank larue , director of the center for legal action in human rights , a leading human rights group here if impunity is tolerated in this case , it will be an enormous step backward for guatemala and for the rule of law in this country at a news conference here friday , jean arnault , director of the united nations mission that is monitoring the peace accord , called on the government to show bravery and determination in its investigation and not let a single clue go unexplored public suspicions of official involvement in the killing and of a coverup are a perfectly reasonable hypothesis that in our judgment is fully justified , he said if we think of the recent history of guatemala , we know that groups exist that have both the capacity and the motive to carry out a political crime that has the appearance of a common crime , said mr arnault , who under the terms of the peace agreement has the authority to investigate the case the murder of monsignor gerardi , he added , continues as a shadow over the state of justice in guatemala skepticism over the official version has taken root because on april 24 the bishop made public an exhaustive study of human rights violations conducted by a church group laying the groundwork for possible prosecutions , the report concluded that the guatemalan armed forces and other official bodies were responsible for 80 percent of the 150 , 000 deaths and 50 , 000 disappearances that occurred during the war two nights later , as he was returning from dinner with relatives , bishop gerardi , who was 75 , was beaten to death in the garage of his residence mario orantes najera , a fellow priest and the bishop s housemate for the last eight years , reported finding his bloody and battered body that night almost immediately , the police said the killing was a common crime with no political links and arrested carlos enrique vielman , 24 , a homeless man who often slept in a park across the street from the parish house but he was released after it was established that his right arm had suffered injuries that made it impossible for him to wield the eightpound concrete block that the police say was the murder weapon in july , the case took an even more surprising twist when the parish house was surrounded by 70 heavily armed police officers and father orantes was arrested , along with the parish cook , and accused of the killing at that point , government officials began to describe the murder as a crime of passion , leading to news reports , which father orantes has repeatedly denied , that the clergymen may have been involved in some sort of secret homosexual group on oct 21 , prosecutors formally charged father orantes with the killing as proof of father orantes s supposed involvement in the killing , which he denies , prosecutors described bites on the bishop s body that they said came from a dog that is owned by father orantes and responds only to his commands the dog , a crippled 11yearold german shepherd named baloo , was also taken into custody , and , like father orantes , is still being held but the baloo hypothesis now appears to have collapsed late last month , with a threeman team of american forensic experts looking on at the request of the roman catholic archdiocese , the bishop s body was exhumed and a new autopsy was performed by a spanish coroner whom human rights advocates accuse of covering up military atrocities during el salvador s civil war in a report made public last week , the american experts concluded that bishop gerardi was assaulted by at least two attackers , if not more , and that he was struck by another weapon , probably a metal pipe , before his head was smashed with the concrete block they also determined that the dog s involvement was physically impossible , noting that none of the wounds on the bishop have the specific characteristics of a dog bite or tooth mark

belfast , northern ireland , may 23 no one was a more stubborn or obstreperous opponent of the northern ireland peace agreement than the rev ian paisley so moments after its resounding passage was announced at the king s hall here this afternoon , yes supporters encircled the no preacher , taunting , dinosaur ! they thrust hastily produced placards in his face that bragged , 70 yes then , encouraging mr paisley to get out of the way of the new irish politics , they broke into a lusty chant of cheerio , cheerio , cheerio ! such unrestrained , boastful glee is uncommon in dour , beatendown northern ireland but the peace agreement s supporters managed to do the politically unthinkable in a place where compromise has not been part of the vocabulary they built a coalition even more remarkable because it was so brittle that included a majority of catholic nationalists and a large share of protestant unionists the first group wants this british province to merge with the irish republic the second wants to retain union with britain the 71 percent who voted yes in the referendum on friday decided , as they say in ireland , that half a loaf is better than none most catholics favored the agreement from the start , viewing it as a chance to gain more influence in a province where they are in the minority but the commanding victory came about because supporters appeared to persuade more than half of the wavering unionists to consider one argument above all others like it or not , the treaty is at least an attempt at peace this is what john major , the former british prime minister borrowing from president clinton called the politics of hope p j mara , who ran the campaign for the agreement in the irish republic , explained it in an interview before he began the effort late last month our focusgroup research shows that the one argument that transcends others is , 'this is our best chance in a generation to get peace' the prize of peace transcends every other argument while the accord was always expected to pass and indeed registered an even more convincing majority in ireland , backers in northern ireland faced a big hurdle in pulling unionists to their side polls showed that a large share of the roughly one million prospective voters in the province were undecided in the closing days , and that many of the undecided were moving to the no camp their biggest objection was a provision that calls for the accelerated release of political prisoners but supporters managed to halt the loss of support by dispatching britain s prime minister , tony blair , and other prominent politicians , who conceded that there were distasteful elements but repeated over and over that the accord could not be cherrypicked their pitch was that , though flawed , it was the best hope for peace so many celebrities swarmed into belfast seeking support that one disc jockey quipped , nobody would be surprised to see the queen , the pope and the spice girls at this point another strategy of the supporters in the closing days was to reach out to young protestant voters , who were viewed as perhaps less intransigent than their parents , as well as to women , who might find the peace message particularly appealing to win over young people , the yes campaign sent fiveminute videotapes to 15 , 000 firsttime voters the tapes featured rock bands and young people s testimonials that the accord offered a chance at peace and in its appeal to women , the campaign ran a fullpage newspaper advertisement the morning of the vote with the photograph of an infant born the day before once again , the message was peace for the children the last week was worrying for us , said quintin oliver , who ran the yes campaign in northern ireland but we turned it around sydney elliott , a senior lecturer in politics at queens university belfast , said the supporters ran a lackluster campaign until the end , but were helped by their opponents' inability to put forth a positive message ultimately , many people chose to put aside their suspicions , fears and hatreds for the larger goal of peace in recent interviews throughout ireland and in this province , many said that while they were not particularly optimistic about peace , they were open to giving it a chance veronica tate , for one , was not overjoyed about having supported the accord i had nightmares over it , she said after voting on friday at a west belfast school that is riddled with bullets from years of quarrels what if it does n't work out \? mrs tate , 47 , a catholic , said the referendum could backfire and trigger more violence so why did she take her chances and vote yes \? it s very important for the grandchildren , she said as for those who want mr paisley to exit , stage right , the master of no had one thing to say paisley is not going away photo with 71 percent of voters in northern ireland approving the peace accord , the alliance party celebrated yesterday at king s hall in belfast where britain s secretary for the province called it a resounding victory \( reuters \)
albany , april 16 they advertised it as the end of backroom deals and furtive agreements between powerful politicians this year , legislators conceived the state spending plan in public meetings , opening the wonder of budgetmaking for all to see but still there were deals there was 2 , 000 for the drum and bugle corps of the bronx youth sports club and 18 , 000 to build a playing field for the lady lumberjacks softball team at north tonawanda high school chautauqua county will get 150 , 000 for a methane digester , otherwise known as an electricity generator fueled by cow manure and so it is spent , hundreds of millions of dollars in member items , otherwise known as oldfashioned pork according to a report issued today by an antitax group called changeny , lawmakers approved more than 5 , 000 pet projects , at a cost of 350 million up from last year s 175 million no one here was particularly surprised by such legislative largesse , coming as it does in a year when legislators are up for reelection , the economy is healthy and the state is awash in cash but while the open process was supposed to hold lawmakers more accountable for their spending practices , fiscal conservatives said that when it came to porkbarrel spending , it had the opposite effect unfortunately , involving more legislators meant involving more spending , said brian backstrom , vice president of changeny this open process took the form of everyone getting together , thinking of as many projects of possible and deciding to fund them all despite their reputation , many member items provide an economic shot in the arm for communities of all sizes most listed in changeny s report are for libraries , schools , fire departments , arts programs and centers for the elderly but even spending that appears to have only honorable intentions often has purely political roots take the 100 , 000 to teach students around the state about the irish potato famine the legislature passed a law in 1996 requiring social studies curriculums to include a modern historical view that the famine resulted not just from a blighted potato harvest but also from britain s policy of exporting other crops that could have kept its irish colonial subjects alive the legislation was sponsored by assemblyman joseph crowley , who represents a largely irish section of queens and whose constituents may well remember his effort on election day several community groups and local government agencies contacted today said they had not been expecting the money the legislature decided to give them , and had no idea what it would be used for for instance , chuck cornell , executive assistant to the chautauqua county executive , did not know what a methane digester was or why the county needed one i could spend all afternoon trying to figure out why we 're receiving it , he said someone will have to get back to you that someone turned out to be assemblyman william l parment , a democrat from ashville , who explained that a dairy farmer in clymer had written him asking for state funds to purchase a methane digester so he could reduce the amount of cow manure polluting the water and soil around his farm if the system works , it might be expanded to dairy farms across the state to curb pollution , said mr parment , who added that he did not know the farmer receiving the grant he s just a constituent who wrote to me and said , 'hey , i 've got a problem , ' mr parment said we just want to show this is an effective way of managing manure but if budget negotiations remain open to the public , and especially if the economy slows , the public might start protesting porkbarrel spending , mr backstrom of changeny said before that can happen , legislators need to be far more forthcoming about which member items they want to include , long before they pass a budget , he said legislators still believe that the more bacon they deliver , the more they will be loved , he said but the average taxpayer is sick of that thinking it was n't evident in the brief open process that took place this year but it will become apparent in the coming years , when there wo n't be enough money to go around as it turns out , legislators spent less on pork last year than changeny expected , mr backstrom said the group had predicted that porkbarrel spending would reach a record 600 million in 199798 , including 450 million set aside by gov george e pataki and the leaders of the republicancontrolled senate and democraticled assembly for community projects of their choosing but none of the 450 million , which was to be raised through borrowing , was spent mr pataki has the power to veto member items , but he may be loath to do so in a year when he and all the legislators are up for election legislators defended the member items included in this electionyear budget , saying it was by no means frivolous to spend 10 , 000 on road signs that would lure tourists to the national warplane museum at the elmiracorning regional airport , for example , or 3 , 000 on a surveillance camera for a park in athens sheldon silver , the assembly speaker , said the antitax group was being unreasonable i think they were critical of the governor s original budget , too , so they were never happy , said mr silver , a democrat from manhattan the fact is that the economic plan that was put out to meet the needs of the people is consistent with the needs of the state mr parment , the assemblyman responsible for the methane digester , agreed , saying he did not understand why fiscal conservatives assailed member items year after year his items include 25 , 000 for three public libraries and 15 , 000 for basketball courts in his district , projects that are pretty mundane but important to the average citizen , he said i do n't know why my items always show up on their list , he said it s not like this stuff is exotic , like palm trees swaying in the breeze chart at a glance the other white meat the changeny report lists 5 , 000 spending items worth 350 million that it considers pork barrel pet projects added by legislators that were not requested by the governor some examples money to

five months after a search committee began looking for a new chancellor of the city university of new york , strong candidates have declined even to consider the job because of the divisive political battles surrounding the institution leaving a pool of early contenders that some of its trustees call unimpressive stephen j trachtenberg , president of george washington university , who said he discussed the job with the search firm working with the cuny committee but was not ready to move , said the perception among many academics was that decisions are being made politically the role of the mayor and the governor and the trustees would seem to be more robust than one would expect , and that diminishes the role of the chancellor , he said i have a different kind of board that lets me be president if i succeed , they pat me on the head if i do n't , they kick me in the pants but they are not constantly pulling up the plant to see how the roots are doing nancy nichols , a partner at heidrick struggles , the executive search firm that has been working with cuny to find a permanent replacement for its former chancellor , w ann reynolds , would not say how many candidates she had called nor discuss any names but she said politics has complicated the search in recent months , cuny has drawn particularly harsh criticism from mayor rudolph w giuliani and gov george e pataki over remedial studies and standards they call lax clearly , the whole remedial issue , and the fact that it was in the paper every day , did n't make the job easier , ms nichols said but it insures that we wo n't be talking to people who will be politically naive about the job the committee , which is headed by anne a paolucci , cuny s chairwoman , and includes trustees , faculty and students , began to interview candidates this week ms nichols said the tough search was still in its early stages , adding that she was committed to helping the board have rich choices although other educators contacted about the position in recent months declined to discuss their conversations , some said they shared mr trachtenberg s concerns new york is impossible right now , and i think the real quality people will feel that way , said one college president who was approached about the cuny job but declined to be considered he talked only on the condition of anonymity everyone understands that a board has the right and the responsibility to set policy , he said the question is whether this board has moved beyond policy to the results cunybashing has become a political and public spectacle in recent months , with mayor giuliani leading the way since his reelection in november , mr giuliani has attacked cuny again and again and has suggested that private universities or education companies would do a better job educating students this spring , as cuny s trustees tried to find a way to improve remedial education , the mayor told his appointees on the board that they should hold out for a measure that totally removed remedial students from the university s bachelor degree programs a measure that he and the governor helped shape and that the board adopted last month other trustees railed against what they saw as political interference , saying they had not seen anything like it before mr giuliani has also set up a task force to recommend how to privatize remedial education at cuny and to offer a broad assessment of the university , another action that has many faculty members and some trustees upset but not everyone saw politics as a barrier to finding a good chancellor some education officials said political involvement was a fact of life and should not necessarily frighten away candidates this is not so sui generis , although it seems that way because a couple of issues have cropped up , said sheldon steinbach , general counsel for the american council on education in washington strong candidates are in the eye of the beholder maybe this kind of situation cries out for a less traditional candidate but richard chait , a professor of higher education at harvard university , said the situation would probably put off many candidates the city university of new york was a kind of prototype for what an urban university system should look like , but recent events would cause most candidates with choices to be wary , he said as of early this week , there were about half a dozen names on the search committee s working list , including richard ekman , the secretary of the andrew w mellon foundation , and ronald k shelp , the former president of the new york city partnership , according to people close to the search committee these people said the number of educators coming from big and prestigious public university systems with the kind of experience needed to run a major university like cuny was limited those on the current list include william c gordon , the provost at the university of new mexico theodore r mitchell , vice chancellor for external affairs at the university of california at los angeles charles w manning , chancellor of the university system of west virginia , and fred gainous , chancellor of alabama s community college system none of the people on the list , except one , returned telephone calls seeking comment yesterday mr ekman sought unsuccessfully to return a call but could not be reached later in the day for comment
the first pipers had yet to hit fifth avenue , but the parade had already started at adrian flannelly s midtown studio on madison avenue nineteen members of the artane boys band , a vision in red and blue from dublin , wedged themselves into the studio and broke into when irish eyes are smiling in the reception area outside , irish eyes were scanning the room for sight of mr flannelly , who swept in a few minutes late to preside over the day s festivities you could forgive him , because he had been busy at gracie mansion yesterday morning with the launch of his own recording , ireland and beyond , a compilation of irish classics and american standards he plays on the piano you could say he plays them with feeling , if only for the fact that he can play at all eight months ago to the day , his right hand was reduced to a numbed fist when an eightfoot mirror fell on it and severed the tendons surgeons at our lady of mercy medical center in the bronx fixed the hand but mr flannelly was still in a fix , since he had little patience to endure months of physical therapy instead , he prescribed for himself a regimen of daily piano playing , with his goal being to record an album to benefit sick children in a way , the whole endeavor brought him back to his roots , both as a musician and as an immigrant who came here in 1959 from county mayo his own trauma , during which he said doctors at one queens hospital dawdled as they waited for instructions from a surgeon and confirmation from his insurance company , made him think about what newcomers to this country sometimes faced immigrants coming here , and not just irish , when they land in this town and end up with a sick child , what difficulties they must go through , said mr flannelly , the host of a widely popular irish radio program on wkdmam \( 1380 \) nothing brought this home to me more than by being a patient with a condition that was clear to me but complicated by virtue of what my insurance would stand such thinking runs in the family , since he is the nephew of paul o 'dwyer , the silverhaired , bushybrowed political firebrand and former city council president mr o 'dwyer had sponsored him to come to america and helped him get a job as a piano player in mickey carton s band , itself a united nations of musicians , that performed at jaeger house , then an irish dance hall in yorkville that fit into a family tradition , mr flannelly said my uncle was obviously somebody who had clearly instructed us in multicultural relations with jews , hispanics , blacks and italians those gigs led to others , including concerts where he tried to shake off the corny oldtimey songs that he hated , like who threw the overalls in mrs murphy s chowder \? after he started his radio program in 1970 , he eventually began to get away from playing concerts , since his show was delving more and more into political and social issues facing the irish on both sides of the ocean it became difficult for me to go about the music circuit , he said people who were supposedly fans of mine were saying , 'play more damned music , ' but that was not on my agenda' what was on his mind were issues like immigration he personally delivered thousands of applications from irish immigrants seeking visas in a government lottery more recently , he has talked about common concerns with other groups who come to the united states our only strength is in the general overall immigrant community , he said our issue today is not about irish immigration today , it has to do with immigration , period how immigrants are treated it took his own treatment to bring him back to the keyboard he knew he had to do something different the moment doctors talked about months of physical therapy they said he needed discipline i have none at all , he said not for stuff like showing up for appointments and talking out chunks of my life sitting and waiting i 've always been a bad patient because of a very short he paused for a few seconds as he looked for the right word attention span but he was able to focus on the idea of helping children at our lady of mercy and a dublin hospital that recently started a collaborative effort he thinks that children are one way to bring people together , despite whatever differences may exist among adults or music critics i'm sure there are better cd s than this one , he said by the same token , it has a message and , i'm told it s not that bad photo adrian flannelly
roxanna slade by reynolds price 301 pp new york scribner 25 several years ago in the book review , anatole broyard recounted a conversation he had had with a psychiatrist who said that novelists wrote better about depression than happiness most of his clients , the doctor said , compensated themselves for even the most debilitating melancholy with bouts of mania or at least indulgence , whereas novelists , including the best of them , seemed to ignore this psychological truth and linger on the alienated and the grim reynolds price has waged a lifelong oneman campaign to redress this particular imbalance a chronicler of decency , pluck and joy , in novel after novel he has given us the weight and worth of the ordinary over the years his titles themselves have recorded a world view more positive and receptive to grace than is usual in the late 20th century a long and happy life , a generous man , the source of light , private contentment , good hearts , clear pictures , new music , a whole new life , the promise of rest even the inevitable irony in many of the titles leavens rather than contradicts his characters , burdened as they may be with disasters that occur even in the midst of carolina comforts , recognize their good fortune , like hutch of the great circle trilogy , who despite the bitter sadness and loss he knew was bound toward him had long stretches of joy all his life and he trusted pleasure or like buck , of the story full day , who all his life tried to show women the boundless thanks he felt for their being it may be in such a spirit of thanks that price has produced two major novels written from a woman s point of view , kate vaiden , which won a national book critics circle award in 1986 , and now roxanna slade , the fictional autobiography of the uneventful life , of a 'wellbroughtup' white southern girl who is also , inevitably , a helddown woman with insufficient air to breathe this narrator is aware of how very few human beings of any sex or background are called to anything grander than dinner and selfaware that she has kept my chin tucked and lived my life that such a character provides implicit chastisement to novelists of the grim and alienated sort is the only knee bend price offers postmodernism this is in many ways an oldfashioned story in an oldfashioned voice that is to a large degree the point of it tolerant in matters racial and sexual but with the perfectly modulated pitch , just slightly prim , of someone born in simpler times , roxanna passes her stout judgments on the century it is part of price s habitual technique to take a strong , nononsense sort of person and burden him or her with a situation that is at once usual and apocalyptic accident , cancer , suicide , aids that is the way with roxanna dane , born in 1900 , whose story begins on her 20th birthday as she takes off with her brother for an outing , meets and powerfully falls in love with an extraordinary young man , and sees him die within the space of the same short afternoon though his influence will carry through the rest of her days in the quick tragedy , she is strangely redirected toward the young man s brother palmer they marry roxy has a son a second child a perfectly shaped little boy who never breathed dies at birth a daughter is born roxy is locked into a lifelong power struggle with her motherinlaw , olivia , whose beauty , suffering and strength she nevertheless clearly sees and when she learns of palmer s longtime infidelity , she sees no better option than to make the best of it the best proves remarkably tolerable meanwhile roxanna suffers the losses that belong to every life and that , pressed into 300 pages , shock us with the ubiquitousness of mundane drama she loses a father to senility , a mother to stroke or heart failure , her brother to drugs , her husband to brain tumor and very nearly loses a granddaughter to adoption at her own misguided insistence none of this is presented as in the least extraordinary anybody could die , it was no hard skill depression too is a fact of life roxanna calls it the blues , even when she is blinded , suicidal , unable to catch her breath in midlife the mood is so dark that she feels fried in anguish , and she throws herself from a moving car , not with the intention of death so much as meaning to fling herself into change it is her sister leela who perceives , you invented your own shock treatment , and indeed , there is time for five more decades , calm as my hand , in which to live her credo life , in the world i occupy , is an adequate blessing i would be a person who worked at proving , to however few doubters through the hardest times or easy days , that the actual world is worth all your strength it helps in the telling of this story that roxy has had from youth a not always comfortable tendency to speak plain truths in a time when you did n't just ask sane people , even your family , to lay out their inmost feelings solely because you were curious to know , she nevertheless notices that she had sunk into telling leela and even my mother exactly what i felt since she speaks now from the 1990 s , in her 90 s , this forthright predilection allows her to register more or less explicitly her strong opinions of the gains and losses of our times she reminds us , with a hint of the lecturer , that divorce was so uncommon that she had not met a single divorced person by the age of 23 , that a 27yearold man was beginning middle age , that 50 miles was a great distance and travel both arduous and dangerous , that pregnancy was a hard dark tunnel , but that , on the other hand , there was nothing like the big drug cafeteria that s apparently waiting on any corner today she can be blunt about the nouveau euphemisms of postfreudian and politically correct culture recalling nursing her newborn , she observes that those were the days before bonding was invented a sentence worth examining in its economy , since it implies a peculiarly postvictorian syndrome of judgment , obligation and sentimentality roxanna is not sentimental about family \( or anything else , though she will tell you i think well of snakes \) she takes more than one sharp poke at family values whatever foolishness any politician or tv preacher tries to peddle today about human families as the peak of all striving let me tell you plainly that in my youth and young womanhood , the families of many people thought to be decent as bands of angels were nothing but factories for driving souls crazy and she notes that not much has changed reality turns out to be much the same as it s always been that many children are born maimed and agonized , that many mothers suffer thereafter and die in poorer darker places , that many healthy children grow up under hails of meanness nevertheless , family holds her in both its constricting and its supporting threads , and her final reconciliation is so complete that she houses , befriends and makes an heir of her husband s bastard daughter in one way this tale represents a novelist s version of millennial fever we will see many characters taken through the 20th century as it draws to a close since this century has been in many ways a more interesting one for women than for men , many of these books will be about women roxanna slade is not only an example but exemplary drawing
the port authority of bridgeport harbor has a billiondollar redevelopment project on the drawing board hotels , office buildings , museums , cruise ships , highspeed ferry boats and more are in the plans but the port authority and the city s harbor master , joseph savino , are occupied with a nagging bit of the past three barges lie on the harbor bottom , at the mouth of the pequonnock river , and the national register of historic places must be navigated before they can be removed since the barges sank , in 1974 , they have rotted away so that now only a few waterlogged timbers can be seen above the water , and then only at low tide below the surface , divers documented gaping holes in their hulls they are erie canal barges , however , among only a few still in existence , and their historical significance has proven to be something of a complication , not for the major part of the harbor redevelopment plan , but for the fringes of it where city officials would like to provide direct access to downtown bridgeport for boaters if i have to leave them there , mr savino said , it will limit the recreational boating i can get in there he said he has asked the connecticut historical commission to remove them from the national register john w shannahan , director of the commission , has replied that his office appreciates the city s desire for economic and recreational improvements in bridgeport harbor and also acknowledges that the longterm preservation of these vessels will best be accomplished through their relocation but relocating them may not be an easy task mr savino said the three barges the elmer s dailey , the priscilla dailey and berkshire no 7 are in such poor condition that he believed they would fall apart if an attempt were made to haul them out such a salvage operation would also be expensive , no matter what its prospects for success then too , he asked , where am i going to put them \? who would want them \? enter james correnti , a graduate student who learned of the barges' existence while studying marine affairs and archeology mr correnti , whose area of academic study is focused on the management of maritime cultural resources , said the three large wooden barges are of a design typical of the transition between small wooden barges of the 19th century and large , modern metal barges they 're rare in that case , he said mr correnti said the city could attempt to salvage the boats and try to find someone to restore them or , if the boats are too deteriorated , videotapes , photographs and documents could be compiled for posterity mr shannahan , on the other hand , suggested they could be relocated offshore in long island sound as a marine habitat and underwater archeological preserve either way , mr correnti said , before anything can be done , a marine archeologist has to do down there and determine if they can be salvaged without breaking up only one of the three barges , the elmer s dailey , built during world war i , ever plied the erie canal the priscilla dailey , built in 1929 , worked the champlain canal , and the berkshire no 7 , built in 1935 , never worked either canal the three were used to haul bulk cargo along the new jersey , new york and connecticut coasts from 1941 until 1972 , when they were tied up in bridgeport the boats range in size from the elmer s dailey s 105 feet and 100ton displacement to the priscilla dailey s 111 feet and 311 tons only the elmer s dailey was motorized , the result of a retrofit in 1928 the other two were towed by tugs in 1974 they sank at their dock , and have rested there ever since shortly before they went down , their owner , george w koenig \( who has since died \) , had the three vessels placed on the national register of historic places mr savino said a recent survey of the barges , done by state police divers in training , convinced him that they are beyond repair and should be broken up and removed i do n't dispute that they 're historic erie canal barges , he said , but in that condition , nobody can enjoy them or even see them he is worried the city would be required to recover them whole , which would be expensive as well as difficult these are n't the only barges known to be sunk in bridgeport waters there are five others , two in johnson s creek , an inlet off bridgeport harbor , and three in black rock harbor at a cost estimated at more than 100 , 000 each , removal would cost the city almost 1 million , mr savino said but if it were done , it would provide space for many recreational boat moorings , open up new fishing spots , and avoid the navigational hazard posed from waterlogged timbers breaking from the vessels and floating just under the surface he noted that the state is considering establishing a fund that municipalities can use to remove sunken barges none of the other sunken barges would impede the city s bridgeport harbor redevelopment project , which is called harbour place the developer , alex conroy , of the conroy development company in greenwich , said he believed only a project as large as his could succeed you ca n't do it piecemeal , he insisted , you need to create a new destination
the senate has betrayed its obligations with its pitiful performance on nato expansion instead of illuminating the complex issues involved in extending the alliance eastward , and weighing the potentially grave consequences , the senate has treated the matter as a legislative afterthought , flippantly fitting a few hours of debate between other bills with discussion soon to resume on whether to approve membership for poland , hungary and the czech republic , the senate can redeem itself by taking an exacting look at the most important foreign policy decision america has faced since the end of the cold war that is the senate s constitutional duty , and it must not be forsaken just because trent lott , the majority leader , does not seem to appreciate the difference between amending an international treaty and debating a highway bill the reason the constitution requires a twothirds senate majority to approve or revise a treaty is that vital american security interests are usually involved in this case , the senate must decide whether to commit american military forces , including nuclear weapons , to the defense of warsaw , budapest and prague that alone should give the senate pause for all the white house s smooth talk about expanding democracy and prosperity in europe , the enlargement of nato comes down to a military commitment the movement of armies and weapons around europe has financial and political costs , none of which can be predicted with any certainty today the senate has no idea whether nato expansion will cost 15 billion , as the pentagon predicts , or 125 billion , the price once cited by the congressional budget office nor does it know how much of that burden washington will have to bear the white house has provided no military rationale for expanding nato eastward while europe is at peace and democracy and free markets are taking root in russia instead , the ratification resolution promiscuously opens the door to nato military actions almost anywhere in the world that startling expansion of nato s license to conduct military operations demands extensive debate astonishingly , the senate is being asked to approve all this without even the most basic analysis of potential threats in europe or a description of how expansion is likely to affect american military forces that information should have been the subject of intensive review by the senate armed services committee , but was not it is to be provided by president clinton no later than 180 days after the senate votes that is no way to run a government mr lott may be content to tell his constituents that he approved nato expansion after a few hours of perfunctory debate without knowing the cost or the military and political implications , but other senators ought to take their obligations and the nation s security more seriously the matter should be referred back to the foreign relations and armed services committees for the careful analysis it should have received in the first place
detroit the financial bane of detroit auto makers has been the laggard shares of their stocks those have tended to sell for only seven to nine times their earnings per share , less than half the market average for big companies investors have feared the american auto industry s reputation for faltering badly during each recession and have refused to pay higher multiples of earnings even as auto makers have amassed huge cash reserves and cut their longterm costs last spring , the chrysler corporation , which has a particularly bad reputation for encountering trouble during recessions , seemed to have found a nifty way around investor distrust it agreed to merge with daimlerbenz ag , which has traded at a higher multiple in the german market , where investors have regarded auto stocks more favorably when news of the merger broke on may 6 , chrysler s shares climbed to 95 times expected 1998 earnings up from 81 times earnings the day before daimler s american depository receipts rose to a priceearnings multiple of 258 , from h 243 but those gains have proved temporary while investment bankers and auto analysts still expect the deal to be completed , the weak performance of chrysler s stock since may is an unusual example of the perils of an allstock merger with a foreign company chrysler shares closed at 408125 yesterday , down 625 cents from where they had been the day before news of the merger first appeared six months ago chrysler s stock is now trading at 75 times the consensus forecast of 1998 earnings , according to earnings estimates from the first call corporation , which tracks stock analyst opinions daimler s stock is now trading at 161 times expected earnings this year , though a small part of its drop since may reflects the payment of a special dividend auto stocks have dropped since may , and german auto stocks in particular have suffered as consumer demand in europe begins to weaken and the strengthening german mark of the last two weeks has eroded the value of car exports to the united states because the chryslerdaimler deal is a transaction in which both companies' stockholders exchange their shares for stock in a combined company , daimler s difficulties combined with a fall in american auto stocks have left chrysler s shares right back where they were before the deal was announced two weeks ago , salomon smith barney lowered its rating on daimler s stock to a buy from a strong buy , partly because the company s huge revenues from selling mercedes cars in the united states were being hurt by the mark s growing strength since chrysler s stock now moves in tandem with daimler s stock , the recent weakness of the american dollar is thus hurting chrysler a paradox for any american auto maker , which normally tends to profit from a weak dollar chrysler s priceearnings multiple of 75 is now slightly less than the ford motor company s multiple of 79 the multiple for the general motors corporation is 119 when calculated with its strikedepressed 1998 earnings , but only 65 when calculated with its expected 1999 earnings chrysler s stock now has the lowest average recommendation from analysts of any of the big three auto makers , though the difference is fairly small , according to first call but anyone who believes that the combined company , daimlerchrysler ag , will thrive should buy chrysler stock rather than daimler shares , said mark rowen , an analyst at salomon smith barney that s because chrysler is selling at a 10 percent discount to daimler , based on the conversion ratios used in the merger there has been no sign that the problems at chrysler and daimler will derail the transaction , which has already been approved by both companies' shareholders and was always intended as a strategic move rather than as an outright sale of chrysler the only remaining step in the merger is for daimler stockholders to tender their shares for exchange if fewer than 90 percent of the daimler shares are submitted , the deal will receive less favorable tax treatment but the fall in daimler s stock since the merger announcement makes chrysler more attractive to german shareholders and the merger even more likely to take place a person involved in the merger said that there had been no discussions about reworking the terms of the deal hedge funds , traditionally active in arbitrage trading of merger stocks , appear to have suffered little harm from chrysler s difficulties , said tom burnett , the director of merger insight , a new york firm that researches mergers for institutional clients the reason is simple hedge funds tried to borrow daimler stock and sell it short to protect themselves against any breakup of the deal but few daimler shareholders have been willing to lend their shares , preferring to keep them and exchange them for shares in the combined company so hedge funds and other arbitragers have been cautious about holding chrysler shares , mr burnett said chrysler and daimler are seeking to minimize taxes by treating the deal as a socalled pooling of interests the rules for such transactions require chrysler to undo the effects of its recent stock repurchases by selling 30 million shares an unenviable task in a market so weak that goldman , sachs just postponed its own plans to become a publicly traded company for fear that its newly issued shares would command a meager price chrysler s difficulties have attracted little comment on wall street , and its need to sell a lot of stock is part of the reason big investment banks are lining up to handle the transaction , particularly as other stock issuances are drying up , and the banks' analysts are reluctant to offend chrysler by discussing its problems publicly for now , the only auto maker that seems to have found a way to push its priceearnings multiple out of line with the industry is ford the auto maker posted a 1595 billion onetime accounting gain in the first quarter when it revalued its 80 percent stake in the associates , a consumerfinance company , before spinning off its stake in the business to ford shareholders none of the analysts following ford have included this noncash gain in their calculations of the company s priceearnings multiple but at least one financial information service does so , assigning a priceearnings multiple of less than 3 to ford as a result patricia little , ford s manager of corporate accounting and financial reporting , who calculated the onetime gain to comply with an obscure tax regulation , said that her role had prompted some jokes at the office , such as a suggestion that she deserved a raise i sort of bragged to our cfo that i produced more earnings than anyone else in the company , but he did n't really buy that , she said
nine years after the demise of shoreham , a new analysis of america s largest deadend industrial project has identified a victim beyond the obvious ones , the customers and shareholders of the long island lighting company and taxpayers around the united states , who will share a waste of more than 5 billion on the reactor the other victim , according to a newly retired policy planner at the nuclear regulatory commission , joan aron , is government suffolk county , new york state , the nrc and the rest of the federal government suffered a huge loss , she argues , not of money but of trust they lost not only the trust of the public but the trust of each other , according to ms aron in a new book , licensed to kill \? the nuclear regulatory commission and the shoreham power plant \( university of pittsburgh press , 1895 paper , 45 cloth \) , ms aron also argues that the true impact of the shoreham debacle has not been felt yet , because one of its key products has not been tried yet , a reformed system for licensing future nuclear plants , designed by the commission to prevent future shorehams the new system calls for a single license to be granted before constructon begins , and not , as in shoreham s case , a construction permit and then an operating license when construction is done the new system will backfire and make nuclear power even less acceptable to the public , she argues , because it reduces the opportunity for public input ms aron has taken on a difficult subject the writing of contemporary history because so many of the people involved in the story have their own passionate perspectives but in a review of the shoreham saga , ms aron , who joined the staff of the nrc in 1976 and worked there on and off until early this year , makes a case that governments acted in ways that no one should be proud of and that will have future effects there s a large stake in making a decision that is perceived as 'correct' from all standpoints , including technical , economic , environmental , and policy considerations , she writes none of the contending parties lilco , the nuclear regulatory commission , new york state or suffolk county had confidence that the other participants were making an honest effort to achieve good public policy moreover , no party had confidence that the outcome would be 'right' or that the process would lead to the correct decision consequently , each party felt vindicated in departing from the customary rules governing the process and engaging and engaging in questionable practices to achieve its ends the nuclear regulatory commisison refused to consider a 20mile emergency planning zone in place of a 10mile zone because the larger area might have doomed the plant , she said suffolk refused to seriously consider emergency planning because it might have been possible lilco plowed forward because it assumed , wrongly , that if it got a license to run the plant , the plant would run the nrc granted the plant a test license that resulted in radioative contamination and thus raised the eventual price of decmmissioning , because it could not cope with any other outcome , and nobody put the whole situation in context and cut a deal earlier that would have saved everyone time and money , she argues government , of course , is also the cause of the debacle , with one level launching the utility and its ratepayers on a vast industrial project , while another created obstacles that would insure it was all a waste in a telephone interview , ms aron said that in the end , another problem was that no one in government would take responsiblity for solving the problem , of a reactor inspired by the too cheap to meter thinking of the 1950 s , reaching completion in the postthree mile island , postchernobyl 1980 s , when the dominant question was what would happen if an emergency required an evacuation had anyone been willing to take responsiblity , you probably could have put an extra road on top of the lie , or planned for some dunkirklike , imaginative way of getting away , said ms aron , in a telephone interview building another roadway on top of the long island expresway and then operating the reactor , she said , would have been cheaper than abandoning it but the failure to take responsibility , she said , was partially what s wrong with the decisionmaking process ms aron knows about governmental cooperation and the lack thereof an associate professor of political science at new york university from 1969 to 1976 , she is also the author of the quest for regional cooperation a study of the new york metropolitan regional council shoreham is still very much a factor in long island s energy situation , giving the area the highest electric rates in the mainland united states and driving an effort that dates from the days of gov mario m cuomo to restructure lilco but events beyond the control of anyone on long island have rendered it less important than it might have seemed in april 1989 , when shareholders of the company voted to accept a deal to kill the plant
austin , tex , nov 3 george w bush set down his peanut butter and raspberry jelly sandwich and wrinkled his nose , as though the aide on the other side of the tiny campaign plane had tossed him liverwurst by mistake but it was n't the sandwich it was that word someone just said dynasty , he repeated with a sour edge in a dynasty , you do n't have to earn anything in a democracy , you 've got to earn it the 52yearold mr bush was bouncing around the state on one of the final swings of a steamroller of a campaign that , today , saw his reelection as governor of the nation s second largest state on the same day , his brother , jeb , 45 , won the governorship of florida , the nation s fourth largest state , rebounding from a narrow loss in a race for the job four years ago george w bush s crushing margin over his democratic challenger , garry mauro , helped propel the entire republican statewide slate into office and gave the party a shot at control of the entire executive and legislative branches of government for the first time in 120 years jeb bush s smaller margin over buddy mackay in florida also gave the republicans control of the governorship and the legislature for the first time this century and it put the republican party in control of redistricting following the 2000 census in two populous , linchpin states their grandfather was a united states senator from connecticut their father was president of the united states maybe it s not a dynasty but it s not liverwurst , either this was supposed to happen four years ago , when jeb bush made his first run for governor in florida many close to the family had considered the younger brother the more astute politician , and it surprised some that it was the older brother alone who won in 1994 george w bush said he had a photograph from his inauguration that he found himself looking at every now and then in it , he is taking the oath of office while , in the background , his father can be seen wiping away a tear and there , on the other side , is jeb , he said he s looking happy and proud , but also something else , maybe a little sad , too it s a tough moment , tough for me to look at i love my brother , you see something else has happened in those intervening years george w bush emerged as the early frontrunner in virtually every poll for the republican nomination for president in 2000 , a goal that he has not yet said he desires but that today s bush victories will go a significant way toward making more possible there is no doubt that having two brothers and two sons of a former president as governors of two of the largest and most politically pivotal states in the country , and one of them as a potential presidential candidate , makes the bushes one of the most remarkable political families of the 20th century , said ralph reed , a republican strategist in atlanta it s the legitimate manifestation of a republican dynasty , said rich bonds , a former republican national chairman who has known the bush family for many years less clear is what it means to the two states what s a dynasty to do in the 1990 s \? most government officials and political observers in austin and tallahassee believe that it will do neither brother much good at home to have a sibling running another state , no matter how sizable they will have to make their own way with their own legislatures but there is no doubt that if george w bush does decide to run for president , having a brother in the governor s mansion in tallahassee will be very , very helpful it is rare for american political families to produce two governors at the same time , said stephen hess , a senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington who wrote the book , america s political dynasties , in 1966 usually , he said , such dynasties are centered in a single state the tafts of ohio , the adamses of massachusetts , the frelinghuysens of new jersey , the longs of louisiana though there are exceptions , which mr hess calls freefloating dynasties the kennedys began in massachusetts , but later made their mark in new york and maryland the only other family to hold two governorships at once was the rockefellers , in new york and arkansas one has to go back to the washburns of the years during and just after the civil war to find a family with so many political stars of such national reach , mr hess said during that period , four washburn brothers were congressmen from maine , illinois , wisconsin and minnesota , two later became governors , one became a senator and one was secretary of state under ulysses s grant but the washburn dynasty burned out in one generation and when you talk about the bushes , you are not talking about a family of ward bosses in chicago , mr hess said these folks are us senators , vice president , president , governors of two of the largest states in the country we 're talking about quite a powerhouse it is sure going to be an advantage if george w bush decides he wants to run for president
it may have happened after albert belle turned down the thermostat in the cleveland indians' clubhouse he liked the climate rather cool when someone perhaps suffering frostbite turned it up again , why , albert naturally took bat in hand and smashed the thermostat into little pieces or maybe it was after some other tantrum or incivility perpetrated by belle , but it miffed one of his teammates , eddie murray , who grabbed belle by the front of his jersey and shoved him up against a wall a few years ago i'm tired of your moody inanities , said murray or unprintable words to that effect other players froze murray was not the most effervescent of personalities himself , but he was an elder statesman on the club , and someone the other players respected belle backed off another indian teammate , carlos baerga , had said , no one can figure albert out no matter , for albert continued to be a prize catch for a baseball team , and in recent weeks has been romanced by several clubs , the yankees included yesterday , he sealed a deal with the baltimore orioles for 65 million over five years , after having played left field the last two seasons for the chicago white sox for only 11 million a year , 2 million a season less than he 'll be earning in the baltimore outfield the man instrumental in this was none other than eddie murray , now a coach with the orioles eddie was on the phone a lot with albert , said john maroon , a spokesman for the team , trying to convince him to play here he did what \? albert has grown up a lot in the last few years , murray said he s someone who comes to play every day everyone knows what kind of offensive threat he is , but he s also a much better defensive player than people give him credit for many people wonder why anyone would want to pay someone like albert belle this kind of money , especially with his offthefield record , which includes antisocial behavior like the thermostat incident , imbroglios with the news media , confrontations with various citizens that have brought the police to his doorstep , and a gambling situation that has been resolved add to this a seeming problem with the orioles in which belle joins cal ripken , whose national popularity as homespun allamerican would seem to be oil and ointment the fact is , the orioles need hitting and belle is one of baseball s best hitters over the last eight seasons , he is the major league leader in homers , doubles , runs batted in , extrabase hits and total bases , batting 328 last season with 49 homers and 152 rbi the fact is , ripken , at 38 , is losing much of the steam at bat and ability to cover ground in the field that had made him one of the game s best players the fact is , there is more than meets the eye in regard to both belle and ripken for all belle s headlined irascibility , he is a dedicated ballplayer he lusts to win when the white sox were n't drawing , despite belle s hitting , jerry reinsdorf , owner of the white sox , spoke with belle , asking him to be more cooperative , to tip his cap to the fans , to be more amenable to the press i'm not comfortable smiling when we 're not winning , he said it s not me i play better when i'm angry and he stayed true to his surly self when a former indians teammate went to shake belle s hand during a batting practice , belle turned his back they 're like any other team , he said , they 're the enemy ripken is a loner of sorts on his team , too he stays at a different hotel on the road , holds himself somewhat aloof and distant in the clubhouse teammates have expressed resentment at this and felt it hurts the chemistry of the team what we need on the team is more passion , more fire , said frank wren , the new general manager of the orioles we hope belle can instill that an old saying just may apply be careful what you wish for , you might get it ripken s consecutive game record of 2 , 632 which ended when he took himself out of the lineup at the end of last season made him a fan favorite , the bluecollar worker supreme but he has been slipping , moving grumblingly from short to third , and in 1999 he may even be asked to play first base belle , 32 , possesses a similarly diligent work ethic as ripken in the last seven years , belle has missed only a handful of games and he has the longest current consecutivegame playing streak , at 334 games ripken s current streak , if you 're counting , is seven
an ambitious plan to expand sotheby s headquarters on york avenue and 72d street into a department store for art with a sleek glass and granite facade and a sculpture garden on its roof has reached a critical stage in the city s approval process the plan , which is expected to cost more than 100 million , will be reviewed and given a public hearing tomorrow by the new york city planning commission it is expected to receive strong support the fourstory former kodak warehouse that has been sotheby s new york home for 18 years is intended to become an elegant 400 , 000squarefoot , 10story building it is scheduled for completion in september 2000 and has been designed to address the needs of an auction house poised for business in the 21st century the building s interior will have a 10story atrium with escalators , providing views of seven floors of exhibition space each department will have its own space to show objects year round , not just during the sale season for years , both sotheby s and its archrival , christie s , have been starved for space christie s finally decided to leave its park avenue and 59th street site for 300 , 000 square feet in rockefeller center the move is expected next year for these companies , whose total business has more than doubled over the last 10 years , physical expansion has become critical as each continues to grow from being merely auctioneers to also running ancillary businesses like real estate , insurance and storage sotheby s chairman , a alfred taubman , who made his reputation and his fortune designing and building upscale shopping centers in affluent communities like short hills , nj , and stamford , conn , has taken an active role in the plans for the building expansion ever since he and a group of investors bought the company in 1983 , he has made it a priority to oversee the renovations of sotheby s offices all over the world mr taubman hired three manhattan architectural firms to work on the new york headquarters kohn pederson fox has designed the exterior , swanke hayden connell has created the interior plans , and richard gluckman , who has just completed the whitney museum of american art s new permanent galleries , has designed the building s top floor for both sotheby s and christie s , finding enough space in a location convenient to art and antiques buyers , in a neighborhood where precious paintings , furniture and objects can be moved in and out safely and efficiently , was close to impossible both explored many of the same sites , among them the former alexander s department store at lexington avenue and 59th street , the site where b altman stood at fifth avenue and 34th street and an old storage company on the upper east side sotheby s also contemplated joining a team of architects and developers applying to build on the new york coliseum site , but abandoned the idea we did a lot of research , said diana d brooks , sotheby s chief executive we met with about 150 clients and sent letters to over 250 in the end we came to the conclusion that people like where we are it s easy to get a cab , and for those coming to the city from connecticut or westchester there s not much traffic and parking is n't a problem the location seems to make sense now , but when sotheby s gave up prime space at 980 madison avenue , near 76th street , everyone thought the move to faraway york avenue was crazy the business was far smaller then , and york avenue was less of a residential neighborhood than it is today local residents are poised for a fight , although the community board has approved the project it will be as busy with the trucks and twice the number of loading bays as bloomingdale s , said paul higgins , president of the 72d street association i surmise that every resident will take a 10 percent discount in the value of their apartments because it clearly sends a signal that this is a commercial district , not a residential one sotheby s plans call for six floors to be built on top of the fourstory building , tripling its exhibition space at the planning commission s public hearing , it will ask for a zoning change to allow commercial rather than residential space to be built on the site it will also seek a special permit to build what is essentially a 150foottall building with setbacks contrary to rumor , the plans include neither art galleries nor antiques shops as tenants none of the art galleries sotheby s has bought over the years , like the andre emmerich gallery or deitch projects , will move to 72d street either this is not the first time sotheby s has thought of developing its york avenue site in 1985 , sotheby s signed a deal with mr taubman under which his real estate company would develop a residential tower on top of the building a zoning change in 1990 gave sotheby s approval to build one floor of space for itself and 27 stories of apartments but the plan was abandoned the business has changed so much , mrs brooks said back then , we only had a 250 million auction business in new york today it s 900 million the economics are so different today that building a highrise no longer looks financially appealing
the rampaging national hockey league players and their shutmymouth teammates who represented , if that s the word , the united states in the winter olympics last month in japan may on occasion understandably possess a skewed view of right and wrong the small group of players believed to have vandalized the team s living quarters in the athletes' village to the tune of 3 , 000 , and their teammates , have all thrown up a wall of silence in regard to naming the offenders the united states olympic committee had threatened sanctions against the hockey players , from banning all of them from any further olympic participation and withholding commemorative items , to not allowing them to make any scheduled visit to the white house the usoc said yesterday that it would announce a course of action today , while there was some advance word that the committee would pursue a team apology and greater financial restitution to the japanese despite the enormous influence and power of both the usoc and the nhl , it appears that neither will be able to identify the miscreants and a team apology would hardly seem more than a tweak of the ear lobe which is what nhl players are used to anyway they learn as soon as they enter the league that while rules prohibit fighting , morality is another issue fighting is sanctioned by the authorities , the very referees supposedly in attendance to curtail brawling watch two hockey players flail away at each other while all three officials on the ice become mere spectators why \? because in the upsidedown ethics of the nhl it is considered a fair fight if two combatants are standing and punching each other when one player drops to the ground , the referees intercede so , the hockey mentality has it , boys will be boys which brings us to the situation regarding nagano the nhl which reimbursed japanese officials for the damage is continuing to conduct an investigation into the incident , following the united states team s disappointing elimination in the tournament the funloving hockey players ran around breaking chairs , tables , a bicycle and sprayed other players with fire extinguishers , causing minor skin damage to mike richter , the rangers' goalie , who was asleep in his bed at the time the usoc did not view this as sidesplitting humor , but as a humiliation none of the players would say who wrecked the joint and the guilty parties themselves these tough , allstar hockey players did not have the strength of character to come forward on their own mike moran , a usoc spokesman , said , this is one of the most serious violations of our code of conduct that we have ever had by individuals or a team at the games but bill guerin of the edmonton oilers , a member of the united states team , said that the situation has been blown out of proportion blown out of proportion is becoming one of the favorite phrases in sports it was used earlier this week by latrell sprewell , who is now saying that he did n't actually choke his coach , p j carlesimo , even though carlesimo testified that he was having trouble breathing during the encounter what seemed to happen , if we are to understand the player , is that somehow carlesimo s neck got in the way of sprewell s hands as for the united states hockey team , doug weight of the edmonton oilers said we 're big guys and the chairs are n't real strong some were broken while we were just sitting on them , playing cards so how come no chairs were reported broken when sumo wrestlers sat on them \? what is underblown by these 23 hockey heroes is that none are taking the principled responsibility for correcting the wrong stonewalling has been notoriously commonplace among police officers the blue wall of silence but that has been changing it takes courage to stand up in the face of peer pressure an admirable , gutsy man in this regard is sheldon kennedy , who testified , when he was a forward with the boston bruins , that a juniorleague hockey coach of his had sexually abused him , as well as , it turned out , hundreds of other boys who played for him while a few other players came forward , they did so under the cloak of anonymity not kennedy referring to the threat of a team penalty in lieu of naming the malefactors , brian leetch of the rangers said recently , what it sounds like to me is elementary school yes if they act like children , it is only proper that they be treated as children
russia s huge default on its debts , and the harsh terms it is offering to those foreigners who made the mistake of lending money to it , have petrified investors and are making capital much harder to get for other countries around the world for that reason , the default is also increasing the risk of global recession economically , russia has never been as important as it was politically investors had assumed that the west would do whatever was necessary to prop up the russians , if only to keep nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands in fact , there seemed to be an assumption that private loans to nearly any government carried an implicit western guarantee , although none had been promised i would not give one nickel to help any creditor or investor , said treasury secretary robert rubin nevertheless , in previous bailouts engineered by mr rubin , whether in mexico in 1995 or korea last year , investors in government bonds did well because that seemed necessary to avoid economic collapse it was not news that russia had big economic problems , or that the government had been unable to solve them but until last week investors still thought default was all but impossible in june russia was unable to borrow all the rubles it needed , even at extraordinarily high interest rates but it was able to borrow 125 billion in dollars from foreign investors , who were promised about 12 percent a year for five years an investor who bought one of those bonds in june , and tried to sell it now , would lose nearly twothirds of the money invested and naive investors are not the only ones who have suffered funds managed by the international financier george soros lost a lot of money , as did credit suisse first boston , the big investment bank what went wrong \? the international monetary fund package assembled this summer proved to be far too small , given the chaos in the russian government the imf lacked the money to put together the much larger package of aid that would have been necessary to avert default , and major western governments , including the united states , refused to put up their own money in an interview with a german newspaper , stanley fischer , the deputy director of the imf , blamed chancellor helmut kohl of germany for the west s failure to act now , with the safety net withdrawn , the ruble appears to be in free fall those who lent money to russia are being forced to trade in their old securities which promised extraordinarily high returns for lending money for only a few months for securities yielding lower interest rates over a longer time the risk is that , even assuming russia is able to honor its latest promises , the rubles it pays back will be worth far less than the ones it borrowed it is not clear now who is really in charge in moscow president yeltsin s choice of viktor chernomyrdin as prime minister needs parliamentary ratification , which may not be forthcoming unless he can reach agreement with the communist leadership of the duma and even if that happens , there is no guarantee the government will be able to collect taxes and actually administer the country the outlook for the russian people is grim so too may be the outlook for countries far away from russia , with economies and governments in far better shape investors , having awakened to the reality of risk , now are pulling money out of emerging markets from hong kong to brazil at best , many governments will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow , putting a damper on growth at worst , they will find new capital unavailable at reasonable costs , and will have to strain to repay loans as they come due russia s direct importance to the world economy may turn out to be far smaller than its impact on investor psychology perhaps the damage can be limited , and investors will decide that russia s problems should not affect their views of , say , argentina but if not , economic incompetence in postsoviet russia could prove to be a bigger threat to world capitalism than stalin ever was
when they rewarded themselves two weeks ago with an impromptu vacation , the members of the new york state legislature were feeling pretty good about themselves after all , they had just passed a budget in what was for them nearrecord time only 13 days late instead of 68 or 104 or , like last year s , 126 and they had reached their agreement through an unprecedented process holding public negotiating sessions rather than working behind closed doors some members went so far as to suggest that the budget signaled a new era in albany , one in which the legislature would at last assume a role equal to the governor s and while lawmakers were clearly aware that gov george e pataki could veto sections of the budget , they left town convinced that he would n't dare this was an election year , they told anyone who would listen , and the state had a big surplus then reality intruded as the legislators filed back to the capitol yesterday , it was clearly not the dawn of a new epoch so much as a sorry continuation of the same old story the bright new budget they were so proud of lay in tatters , and the governor they claimed to have outfoxed was taunting them not only had he cut more than a billion dollars in spending and borrowing , he had singled out the very projects closest to the hearts of the legislative leaders and he had done so , lawmakers complained yesterday , knowing that revenues were running even higher than expected this a great process i love this process , mr pataki gloated at the news conference where he announced his vetoes , and he seemed to mean it one naturally wants to understand a miscalculation of this scale is n't it only in the comics that a pudgy , bald boy rushes toward a football time and again , hoping vainly that , at last , things will be different \? in stories without pictures , let alone in real life , people are supposed to learn from their falls to be smarter , tougher or at least less hopeful yet from their comments before and after the governor s vetoes , it would seem that legislators had no idea they were about to be blindsided again a lot of us felt really happy , assemblyman dick gottfried , democrat of manhattan , lamented it kind of slapped people in the face who were feeling justifiably pretty good about what they had done legislators even seem to have convinced themselves that their lovely budget was fiscally prudent and that they were spending less than the governor had originally proposed , a contention disputed by just about every group that could wade its way through the multivolume document but the truth is that the lawmakers' warm feelings about their budget follow directly from its generosity it is a lot easier to negotiate a budget and to do so publicly and in a timely fashion when everyone who comes to the table is promised exactly what he wants when new money is set aside for schools and for mental health , for child care and for college students , and when , on top of that , there are promises of hefty tax cuts when , in other words , the future is imagined as infinitely rosy mr pataki jumped to take advantage of the legislature s misplaced confidence , in part because he had a miscalculation to correct apparently worried that he would be facing a tough democratic challenger this fall , the governor , back in january , offered a bloated spending plan of his own , which his old allies attacked with surprising vigor his budget , they charged , was a betrayal of his principles , a big fat electionyear spendathon intended to buy off voters even if none of the spending mr pataki vetoed this week is restored , this year s budget will still be a big fat electionyear spendathon it still promises tax cuts as well as spending increases at well over three times the rate of inflation no matter how the wrangling over the vetoes and the newfound tax revenues plays out , new york is still headed toward unprecedented budget gaps by the governor s own calculation , there will be a gap of at least 4 billion just two years from now but thanks to his muchpublicized vetoes , who is going to remember that mr pataki took the lead in the spending binge \? the governor has recovered at relatively minimal political cost his reputation as a fiscal conservative all thanks to the state legislature no wonder he s gloating

there was one red holzman who was barely mentioned and certainly not eulogized in the newspapers this weekend , or yesterday at the parkside memorial chapel in forest hills , queens this holzman was not considered the architect of new york s most sophisticated sports team , or , as dave checketts lovingly called him , the patriarch of the knicks this holzman seldom inspired his troops to see the ball , or the game of basketball as a means of joyful collective expression this holzman won no championships , no playoff games this holzman , the one i knew best , still was remarkably true to his core , faithful to his employer , loyal to his players , even those who deserved less none of those whom holzman coached during his socalled comeback years , 1978 to 1982 , were in the chapel yesterday to hear checketts , the president of madison square garden , deify holzman in a quivering voice a great coach who forced his will on a group of players , checketts said , with a nod to those who lifted the level of their sport and united once more to carry their old coach in his coffin , to the hearse , on the way to his eternal rest there was no need to mention names no one could confuse ray williams with earl monroe , sly williams with dick barnett holzman , who returned to the bench after an absence of one season plus 14 games , never publicly complained about what he had come back to never compared a single player to those they could not measure up to in the championship past never distanced himself to protect the luminous standing he had earned red played the game with the hand he was dealt , and never once said , 'why me \? ' said his longtime friend , norman blass he was , in fact , talking about the leukemia that finally claimed holzman last friday night at the age of 78 same idea holzman jumped at the offer of sonny werblin , the checketts of his time , to replace willis reed he never worried if he could make himself look good the no 1 draft pick that year was a mercurial guard named micheal ray richardson reed had put him right in the lineup , but that was n't holzman s way he harnessed the kid s mistakeridden game by sitting him down one night in cleveland , a furious richardson called a couple of reporters over to his locker following another night on the bench this old man does n't want to play me , richardson stammered , loudly i'm calling my agent , tell him to get me out of here print it richardson did n't see holzman a few feet behind him , shaking his head know what the funny thing is \? holzman hissed as i passed him by he thinks you 're going to help him things had started to change about then , butch beard said yesterday out on queens boulevard , after serving as pallbearer with reed and the rest but red was so good at what he did , and he truly believed the only way to win was to have the players learn to motivate themselves beard played some point guard for holzman in the mid1970 s , then retired in a huff himself when he suspected reed was about to cut him , a few days before reed was fired beard got home from the barber shop in louisville one afternoon and found a message from holzman come back and be my assistant , holzman said the returning coach was more accustomed to working by himself , in the years before the invention of the clipboard but , yes , the changes in the average player had come , certainly to the garden from the time holzman s championship knicks had ruled the town , new york as a sports city had become perceptibly meaner , as well steinbrenner had risen murdoch had a newspaper the bigmoney era in which athletes , as checketts said , were seen as assets and pawns was born it was n't as easy for a company man to hold the line players , reporters and even some owners did n't want to hear it anymore i can tell you that he was the fairest guy i 've ever seen , always honest , and you just do n't see that anymore , beard said in 198081 , holzman took an athletically gifted team out of training camp it happened to be an allblack team , an organizational first i said , 'red , do you know what you 're doing here \? ' beard said he said , 'i do n't care if they 're red , black or green they 're the best we have' that team won 50 games , and werblin gave holzman a 10year contract , with the right to become general manager at eddie donovan s expense along the way one day when the team was in denver , werblin slipped me the details of this deal by phone at dinner that night , i sidled up to holzman , after we had both had a couple of drinks , and said , in a singsong , i know something you do n't want me to he snorted and said , yeah , what \? though his lips were always sealed , this was one company secret he did n't mind getting out holzman had resented donovan s conspiring to replace him with reed two years before when it was said yesterday that this was a man without ego , no one would deny he had fierce pride as it turned out , holzman never got to be general manager he did n't last long as coach a trade or two did n't work out the following season , the knicks lost 49 those troubled young players never did learn to motivate themselves and on the last day that season , knowing he was as good as gone , holzman was asked if he wished to say something about a team that had , essentially , given up had cost him the life style he loved not now , it s too close , he said maybe i 'll say something soon holzman looked away , then back with his trademark sly grin probably not , he said , softly he never lowered his standard , never did knock a player never will
an increasing number of new york city s subway cars lack efficient speedometers , according to a report released yesterday by city council speaker peter f vallone council employees inspecting 540 operator s compartments in trains on the nos 1 and 9 lines found that only 17 percent of them had working speedometers of 353 inspections on the no 6 line , 15 percent had speedometers that showed the wrong speed or none at all , mr vallone said the june investigation found many more subway cars missing speedometers than a similar investigation found in 1996 mr vallone said the results were especially disturbing because the national transportation safety board had urged city transit officials in 1990 to install speedometers in every subway train he also said he especially could not understand the lack of speedometers given that in 1995 , after a fatal crash on the williamsburg bridge , transit officials installed speed limit signs throughout the system lawrence g reuter , the president of new york city transit , said the report was misleading because speedometers were not crucial safety measures the signal system tells train operators when to slow down and even stops a train if it is going too fast , he said
washington , oct 8 after much wringing of hands , reading of the constitution and consulting of priests and pollsters , almost every member of the house of representatives from new york , new jersey and connecticut did what party leaders asked today on the vote to begin an impeachment inquiry only 2 of the 50 members from the three states broke party ranks in voting on the republicansponsored measure , which passed by a vote of 258 to 176 both were democrats carolyn mccarthy of long island and jim maloney of connecticut ms mccarthy , a former republican who joined the democratic party just months before winning her seat in 1996 , called her vote the hardest she had taken in congress she said she agreed with democratic leaders in wanting some limits set on the inquiry , but felt that an openended investigation was better than none the only way we are going to bring this whole investigation to a close and to get the truth is to move the process forward , she said in a statement mr maloney is facing one of the toughest reelection fights of any house member , against a republican who had vowed to attack him if he opposed the inquiry in explaining his vote , mr maloney , a firstterm congressman , said , this is a very serious matter that has to be dealt with , and this is a way to move the process along so we can get back to the issues that affect the people several democratic fence straddlers , including representatives louise m slaughter of new york and bill pascrell jr and robert e andrews , both of new jersey , made up their minds late wednesday after what they said was much anguish and more than a little pressure from the house democratic leadership hamilton s words struck me , said mr pascrell , before loosely paraphrasing alexander hamilton , a founder of the city of paterson , which he represents if we have an inquiry and it s all over the place , the country will suffer and we will only divide the nation more and more most democrats echoed the position of president clinton and other house democratic leaders in saying that the nation wanted congress to focus less on investigating the president and more on important issues like crowded schools and the global economic crisis we need to get back to work on the issues affecting the people , mr andrews said several democrats from the region had already made their opposition to the inquiry known before today s vote , including representatives charles e schumer , nita m lowey and charles b rangel , all of new york but that did not stop them from delivering fiery floor speeches attacking the republican measure we have become a modernday kangaroo court , said representative gregory w meeks of queens among the only republicans from the region to speak in support of the measure was representative vito j fossella jr of staten island mr fossella , a firstterm congressman , said he hoped future generations would view today s vote as our finest hour , upholding what our founding fathers and every generation since has looked for and yearned for the notion of freedom , the notion of liberty , the notion of the rule of law

possible hot button and its toughest images stick even when its lurid selfaggrandizing , presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials , spins out of control in a show of de nirolike fury and versatility , mr norton plays a savage , racist killer who learns the error of his ways through simpleminded but brutally effective plot devices and trying to protect his younger brother \( mr furlong \) hotheaded and sensationalistic , but startlingly tough \( janet maslin \) beloved , starring oprah winfrey , danny glover , thandie newton and kimberly elise directed by jonathan demme \( r , 172 minutes \) a transfixing , deeply felt adaptation of toni morrison s novel , with all the complexity \( and occasional opacity \) that entails taking on the most enticing yet daunting job of literary adaptation since the english patient , mr demme succeeds in bringing the novel s pulse to the screen though it begins too slowly and literally , this daring effort escalates into a gripping , imaginative film that mixes memories of slavery with the occult and that is n't quite like any other its linchpin , ms winfrey , is more often a person acting than an intuitive actress but she plays her character , a onetime slave literally haunted by her past , with enough presence to hold the film together the other major performances are extraordinary , especially ms newton s in the bizarre title role \( maslin \) the celebration , directed by thomas vinterberg \( r , 100 minutes \) working under a set of selfimposed restrictions that are meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty , this danish director shows off dazzling ingenuity the story of a family reunion that becomes a blacktie , psychebashing blowout is told with a handheld camera , without any special lighting or props or sound , and the effect is invigorating rather than austere imaginative angles , nimble editing and fluid , agile camera work keep the film spinning as a large danish cast

all the allen tics but none of the filmmaker s comic flair the bitter breakup at the center of the film \( with ms davis as the journalist s beached wife \) is regularly upstaged by gueststar segments , a few of which stand out in witty relief against an otherwise weary backdrop charlize theron dazzles as a capricious , headstrong model , and ms griffith plays a pampered movie diva with aplomb best of all is leonardo dicaprio s brief , wicked appearance as a badboy wonder \( maslin \) central station , starring fernanda montenegro , vinicius de oliviera and marilia pera directed by walter salles

brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey ms montenegro s tough , bravura performance is one of the year s very best \( maslin \) dancing at lughnasa , starring meryl streep , brid brennan , michael gambon , kathy burke and catherine mccormack directed by pat o'connor \( pg , 94 minutes \) ms streep is grand , as are the other principals here , in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from brian friel s delicate play and if mr o'connor has lost some of the play s intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly , he s also gained a good deal in the way of lovely irish scenery and quaint rural charm set in 1936 , the story presents a family of five unmarried sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the return of their gently eccentric brother from many years' missionary work in africa rather than major dramatic events , this beguilingly atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter these characters' lives \( maslin \)
washington , dec 15 a corporate helicopter that snapped apart at the tail just after takeoff in april 1997 , crashing into the east river and killing a passenger , had been improperly repaired with a part that is vulnerable to metal fatigue , members of the national transportation safety board said today the part , a type of hollow rivet , has also probably been used in other aircraft in places where it might fail , officials said one safety board member said that the federal aviation administration may eventually need to require that aircraft brought in for maintenance be inspected for hollow rivets installed in inappropriate places this problem is probably more widespread than we can imagine , said the board member , john goglia , a former aircraft mechanic who said he himself had installed many such hollow rivets as substitutes for solid ones the fasteners , called blind rivets , resemble the heavyduty picture hooks sold at hardware stores that can be pushed through a small hole , expanded behind the wall and pulled snug without the installer s having access to the other side blind rivets can hasten aircraft repairs because they do not require mechanics to remove internal parts to get access to the inside mechanics at the colgatepalmolive company , the owner of the helicopter that crashed in new york , installed the blind rivets in december 1992 when they replaced a part of the tail that had cracked when the tail later cracked again , leading to the 1997 crash , the rivets were partly to blame , investigators say a federal aviation administration advisory document , which was cited by safety board members meeting today to discuss their staff s findings in the east river crash , says blind rivets can be used with the approval of the aircraft or rivet manufacturer but les dorr jr , an faa spokesman , said that the wording of the document could be confusing and that the aviation administration did not mean for mechanics to rely solely on the rivet manufacturer s advice at the safety board s meeting , mr goglia displayed a technical document from textron inc , the manufacturer of the rivets used on the colgatepalmolive helicopter , saying that blind rivets could be used to replace solid rivets but other textron documents noted that while blind rivets are as strong as solid ones in resisting shearing or stretching , they are less able to withstand repeated bending , which is exactly the stress they were subject to on the helicopter s tail the safety board postponed formal conclusions but did find a number of other safety problems in examining the new york crash one is that even as more and more of the helicopters , bk117 s manufactured by the german company eurocopter , were developing cracks in the same spot as the one in the new york case , eurocopter was telling customers that it was safe to reduce inspections , the board s staff said initially , the manufacturer recommended inspections every 1 , 200 hours of flight , then every 2 , 400 and finally every 3 , 600 but in inspections ordered after the crash , investigators discovered that nine bk117 s had developed such cracks colgatepalmolive had continued to inspect at 1 , 200hour intervals even after eurocopter said 3 , 600 hours was safe but its mechanics did not detect the new crack , possibly because it developed quickly at eurocopter s american headquarters , in grand prairie , tex , the director of technical support , tim ruddick , said that the company did not know about the cracks when it lengthened the inspection interval since the crash , eurocopter has ordered inspections every 300 hours , as well as the addition of several pieces of reinforcing metal the colgatepalmolive crash may also have been worse because of relatively lax federal rules for corporate flights , according to the board staff for example , the pilots were not required to take recurrent emergency training , and the captain , edward thurn , had had none for three and a half years , investigators said but board members said they were not sure that more recent training would have made the captain react more quickly and there are no simulators for bk117 s , limiting the amount of emergency training that crew members can do in contrast to the rules for commercial flights , federal regulations for corporate flights do not require the crew to tell passengers where life vests and emergency exits are , and the colgatepalmolive crew apparently did not do so , said robert hancock , the board s investigator in charge of the case that may be one reason the two passengers were unable to escape the helicopter when it crashed into the east river after taking off from the east 60th street heliport , investigators said the pilots managed to get out of the submerged , upsidedown helicopter the two passengers were brought up by police divers after 15 minutes one could not be revived

residents of new orleans in 1833 drawing on a darker chapter of local history for fever season \( bantam , 2395 \) , hambly plunges us into the appalling spectacle of a city caught in the grip of the yellow fever epidemic of 1834 bronze john , as the suffering citizens call this baffling plague , has made a charnel house of the city , with its rumbling deadcarts and overflowing cemeteries and hospitals no better than holding pens for the dying by virtue of his skin color and his medical skills , benjamin january , the paristrained surgeon who made more use of his talents as a musician in a free man of color , has access to the worst of these pestilential places , and it is through his intelligent eyes that we see the worst of the horrors but bronze john is n't responsible for the freed slaves who are disappearing from town , and january must use cunning to penetrate the color bars that are scrupulously observed by all class levels of this rigidly stratified society from the highborn creoles in their river mansions to the uncivilized americans brawling on the levee , hambly speaks all their languages , knows all their secrets and brings them all to life the strangest things happen

are the oddly mutilated bodies that turn up in this and similar fires finally , there is the crafty pyromaniac who appears to be orchestrating these deadly bonfires from her prison cell these are strange doings , all right , but none so curious as the narrative devices that dampen scarpetta s spirit and the reader s enjoyment whether by design or oversight , too much of the story refers back to the plot of an earlier book the psychopathic villain \( also from the previous novel \) never makes a personal appearance several of the arson fires take place off stage and scarpetta herself is moody and out of sorts nobody can touch this toughminded pro when she s digging for body parts at a crime scene or boiling bones in her new hightech lab but here cornwell burdens her with so many extraneous emotional issues that she s too pooped to confront the killer face to face there is a certain type of mystery a kind of let s pretend adventure beloved by children of all ages that thumbs

he handles with cheery good humor the message itself was plain enough , he says i did n't have to go rooting around looking for subtext even when the fantasy wears thin and the scenery looks like

and tries to make sense of the message he gives her although shards of narrative having to do with a previagra designer drug called adam i and a missing colony of oversexed bonobo chimps are pursued

ghost town by robert coover 147 pages henry holt company 24 near the end of ghost town , robert coover s exuberant , wordrich parody of an american western , a photographer shows up to take pictures of a man about to be hanged what ensues is a wonderfully brief and witty takeoff on art criticism , gallows humor of a literal sort it was his studied opinion , the man said , spreading out his samples and compelling attention , that a photograph of one hanged man has a more melancholical aspect about it than do those of groups , though men strung up in multitudes of a dozen or more not only provide peculiar challenges and opportunities for the enterprising photographist , being less of a stereotype , as might be said , but they also have a way of opening up the foreground of pictorial scrutiny and drawing attention to those who have not yet been hanged several of the features of mr coover s new novel are contained in that passage there is the utterly deadpan appreciation of the grotesque , for example , and the comically vernacular elegance of the writing as well as mr coover s almost lubricious sense of the mythic ghost town is a funny , ribald and , as the photographer might have put it , melancholical story , set in the sere and surreal landscape of a place called the territory the territory is a place where zane gray or louis l'amour might have set their stories , and mr coover s book is an affectionate and mostly delicious parody of what they would have written i say mostly delicious because it is extremely difficult to sustain a parody through more than a few pages once the reader gets the joke , the rest has a tendency to become a variation on the theme , and can get tiresome quickly mr coover s parody does flag here and there , becoming repetitive his evershifting landscape , a cross between brett hart and salvador dali , shifts once or twice too often but that is a minor problem when mr coover reaches a high point , as he does with his photographist , the point is high indeed , and these points come frequently enough to rescue the book from its moments of languor we begin with a lone cowboy riding toward an empty horizon , and within one or two pages , two elements of the book have already become apparent one is mr coover s striking gift for language , his ability to create a narrative tone in perfect harmony with the universe of his story no resistance , our narrator says when the cowboy comes across a well and tries to crank its rusty handle like wagging a dead man s bones this is a book of constant stylistic inventiveness the second element is the mock mythic quality of a story in which the author mimics an archetype but then both lampoons and exceeds it beer is drawn , begins a description of a saloon in mr coover s ghost town an ear is torn off a bony bald man in a white shirt , yellow suspenders , and black string tie bangs out a melody on the grand piano , against which a buxom rougedup lady with wild orange curls leans , singing a song about a good girl who went bad here and there , as we follow mr coover s cowboy on his antic and fierce adventures , we reach a metaphysical moment as the cowboy reflects philosophically , striking a blunt , roughneck , profanitylaced existentialism that seems actually to improve on sartre he is a drifter , mr coover has his narrator tell us , and one whose history escapes him even as he experiences it , and yet to drift is to adventure and to overstudy one s history is to be ruled by it , and he is above all a free man , intent on pursuing his own meaning even if there is none mr coover s cowboy , never given a name , dwells in a treacherous , unfeeling universe , a place where there is not only overwhelming danger and despair but where mirage and reality blend and interchange constantly and duplicitously he sees things that are suddenly behind him or that continue to recede toward the horizon as he approaches them when he finally enters the town where the action of ghost town takes place , it is empty , as ghost towns are , but soon it is filled with a motley crowd representative of all of the western archetypes there are the gamblers with scars , halfbreeds , lynch mobs , the gunmen who plug holes in their rivals' hearts as casually as they would toss back a shot of redeye there is the overendowed saloon singer who falls for the cowboy , and the schoolmarm who dresses in strict black and corrects everybody s grammar there are indians and settlers , rattlesnakes and mustangs and the desert surrounding the town like a hostile ocean around an island mr coover s characters , including the cowboy , speak in a dialect of the author s invention that has the feel of authenticity to it we 'da hung yu straight off , the cowboy is told at one point , yu dodrabbid nogood thievin varmint , but on accounta yu wuz wunst a lawman , yu 'll git a trial , fair'n square , and then we 'll hang yu the story itself , insofar as there is a story , consists of an ever more farcical series of adventures , in which the cowboy , who becomes sheriff , desperately escapes the amorous intentions of the saloon singer several times he is about to be hanged or otherwise maltreated , and each time mr coover invents some new way for him to be rescued in the end , a sort of final confrontation takes place in which the cowboy voyages through the town , whose features and inhabitants are seen as if in funhouse mirrors , in an act of redemptive but unrewarded virtue no good deed goes unpunished , the saying goes , and the cowboy is punished by a kind of eternal return , back to the condition he was in when we first met him , making his lonely way through a world so unsteady that we are never sure what exactly is dream and what has actually happened it is a testimony to the power of mr coover s writing that when we take leave of our hero , we are left with deeper feelings , about loneliness and the futility of the quest for meaning , that go well beyond what the usual satire would provide photo robert coover \( stathis orphanos henry holt \)
garth h drabinsky likes to visit the theater he just finished building in manhattan and watch the crowds stream in to see the musical he just finished producing i stand in the lobby , and i try to look nondescript , he said in a recent interview i'm wearing just a sweater and a pair of cords and so many people have walked over and said , 'thank you for this gift' the theater and the show , they call it a gift mr drabinsky is the president of livent inc , the torontobased entertainment company the theater is the opulent ford center for the performing arts , and the musical is , of course , ragtime and if mr drabinsky s picture of himself is perhaps selfconsciously humble , it s a bit incomplete for the accomplished theater producer is also a highrolling entrepreneur and in presenting his new show in his brandnew theater , he is himself the star of a highstakes epic going on in the wings much of livent s future depends on ragtime , a show he first presented in toronto 15 months ago and that has cost upward of 12 million to put on in new york the show represents a bold foray into the relatively new world of corporate theater financing , and it comes with considerable risk should ragtime not become a megahit , selling out the house for months , if not years , to come , then the growth of mr drabinsky s highly leveraged , expanding theater empire could be imperiled mr drabinsky and livent are part of what is beginning to look like a corporate takeover of broadway that is tearing down the old order the disney company , with its productions of beauty and the beast and the lion king is , of course , a highly visible part of the theater landscape and less wellknown partnerships and joint ventures , like dodger endemol theatricals and jujamcynpace are also helping to transform the anachronistic live theater business with the resources of contemporary corporations still , livent \( pronounced lyevent \) , which operates without partners , remains the world s only publicly held company whose main business is live theater production if its shows falter , its safety net is small now nine years old , livent has systematically broadened its range of productions by now it has presented musicals it has acquired \( phantom of the opera , kiss of the spider woman , joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat \) it has produced revivals on its own \( show boat , candide \) , and it has made one successful venture into original drama \( barrymore \) but before ragtime , it had not entered the notoriously highrisk arena of original musical production , and that is where the company has staked its future it has four more new musicals in development and with ragtime , it has leaped in without a shred of wariness a second production has been running in los angeles since last may , will move on to vancouver in the spring and then open this fall in a theater mr drabinsky is building in chicago a third is to open in april in washington , then tour nationally a fourth is to open in sydney , australia , next year to do all this , livent has borrowed heavily , which means that the success of ragtime will be measured by extraordinary standards it will not be enough if the show draws an audience simply to pay for itself and turn a profit rather , livent is counting on the new york production to propel the others , and thus to create a ragtime revenue stream to help the company retire its debt and finance future projects historically , livent has put on far more restorations of previously mounted shows than newly originated ones , and new productions entail far higher financial risk , said edward lawrence , an entertainment industry analyst with standard poor s , the bond rating agency that last fall gave livent a double bminus rating , warning investors that as a bond issuer , the company is a risk in the near future , the agency concluded , the overall outlook for the company is negative over the next three years there are aspects of the company that could lead to its deterioration , mr lawrence said financing little trouble winning backers mr drabinsky s vision is essentially to spurn the longstanding and increasingly enervated methods of financing and producing new shows and to bring sharpelbowed corporate business practice to an arena where it is more or less untried what makes the offstage drama particularly interesting is that so far , he has had little trouble winning financial backers in the fall , when the company wanted to restructure its debt and floated a 125 million bond offering , it was oversubscribed , despite the standard poor s assessment and an equally ominous one from moody s , which considered it a high risk despite a lagging stock price it closed at 881 yesterday equity analysts have been generally bullish , with paul marsh of cowen company recently predicting that shares could rise to 18 by the end of the year what 'ragtime' means is many things , said roy furman , vice chairman of furman selz , an underwriter of the bond offering first it will be a validation of garth s uncommon producing style , his unusual taste and vision second , it will be a validation of him as an individual , that he was able to build this theater at the same time he s doing the show that would have drained anybody and financially it s immense it s going to be a gold mine
roadster how \( and especially why \) a mechanical novice built a sports car from a kit by chris goodrich illustrated 206 pages harpercollins publishers 18 you can understand easily enough why chris goodrich decided , in his middle 30 s , to build by hand from a kit what he calls a streetlegal roadster he had fallen in love with as he himself describes the project in the introduction to roadster how \( and especially why \) a mechanical novice built a sports car from a kit i pictured it as a great adventure , a break from 15 years of writing and editing and reporting , the opportunity to learn some skills completely foreign to my professional existence it was a chance to trade in abstract ideas for concrete objects , subjective interpretation for objective measurement the more elusive problem is why he decided to write a book about the experience , a book that describes the actual steps in the process and investigates at some length the implications of what he is doing not that he does n't do the job well enough in fact , roadster is consistently provocative and diverting mr goodrich makes you fond of his car , a caterham super seven \( based on a 1957 lotus design \) , which various car magazines cited by the author have described as follows a brutal , forgiving , funny , frightening little vehicle that does n't accelerate so much as explode off the line as spartan and unadorned as a rowboat to enter it in winter is like climbing into a frozen sleeping bag with a wooden leg the caterham felt like superman unable to find a telephone box in which to change back into his clark kent persona mr goodrich describes just enough of the process to keep you happily engaged he is n't great at technical description , and the sparseness of illustrations is frustrating \( there s no picture of the car he s building \) but you get the idea of what he s up to the inventorying of parts , which to his regret he never completed the singlehanded mounting of the chassis onto sawhorses the waiting for missing pieces to arrive the bleeding of the brake liners the lowering of the motor onto the chassis mounts , and the longawaited moment of turning on the ignition it starts ! and then , after 14 months of work on it i walked around the seven , checking for oversights , but found none my senses were indescribably alive i drank in the noise , the smell , the vibration , the success he concludes , the damn car was real ! the difficulty with roadster is the connection between the activity of building the car and what mr goodrich spends most of his book writing about for the one does not follow seamlessly from the other contradictorily , having taken up his project in order to escape abstraction , in his free time from building the car he goes back to reading books and thinking abstract thoughts this leads him to the paradoxical discovery that the automobile was largely responsible for the specialized , balkanized , expertisedominated world i longed to flee to illustrate what he means by this he launches on a history of the car and the social consequences of its mass production , among them the obvious ones like air pollution , traffic jams and road deaths , as well as more subtle ones like the suburb , the mall , the office park , the billboard , even talk radio , the asphalting of the landscape and the fact that more us land is devoted to autos than to housing yet the most significant consequence of the car for mr goodrich was the creation of the assembly line by henry ford and the invention of planned obsolescence by alfred p sloan jr of general motors as mr goodrich sees it , these innovations combined to rob work of its core meaning , to strip labor , as he puts it , of everything but monetary value all of which makes sense as mr goodrich presents it but such heavy analysis eventually compels the reader to look more closely at what the author is doing by building his car is he really emulating heroes of his like thoreau and simone weil , who altered their lives radically to explore the true meaning of work \? if so , how could he afford to give up his job as a journalist writing for california lawyer and spend 27 , 000 for his car kit \? his overt answer to this question is that while building his car in his brother s garage in hastingsonhudson , ny , he worked three days a week for a new york city trade magazine , that his wife was an editor in a new york publishing house and that he had socked away the money from a house in berkeley hills , calif , he had sold at a hefty profit but between the lines you read that he comes from a family of wealth his forebears include elizur goodrich , a yale divinity professor whose family almost certainly invested in eli whitney s firearms plant just outside new haven , and noah webster , the dictionary maker his father , a professor of classical chinese language and literature , needed to work for his own psychological health discussing veblen s theory of the leisure class , mr goodrich ends up by asking could i really be building the seven , this vehicle of quintessentially honorific crudeness , to advertise my economic and social freedom \? to patronize rather than to learn , exploit rather than experience \? he concludes , i hoped not , but those questions remained unanswered to this day the feeling you have when closing roadster is that these questions are answered , that by begging comparison with walden and zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance , his book seems a little frivolous and selfindulgent this is n't to say that it is n't good fun and stimulating only that up against the heavyweights , roadster comes away with its fenders a little bent photo chris goodrich \( jerry bauer harpercollins \)
washington , dec 4 with the house judiciary committee just a week away from a scheduled vote on articles of impeachment against president clinton , the white house challenged the panel s inquiry tonight by demanding several days to present a defense that would slow the committee s deliberations responding to the committee s invitation to appear next tuesday , the president s lawyers sought to move the impeachment inquiry in a new direction while raising doubts in the public mind about the proceedings' fairness and scope they asked for three or four days to call witnesses and raise questions about the legal and constitutional basis for the inquiry in the opening passage of a letter sent to the judiciary committee this evening , the two top white house lawyers dealing with impeachment , charles f c ruff and gregory b craig , said the stakes were extraordinarily high short of a declaration of war , they wrote , there is no more significant or grave constitutional process than the impeachment inquiry currently under way in your committee should the house of representatives approve an article of impeachment against the president and send it to the senate for trial , the impact on the national government and on the american people as a whole would be profound for that reason alone , this process must be deliberate , thorough , fair and expeditious representative henry j hyde , the illinois republican who heads the judiciary committee , hopes to have it vote on impeachment late next week he did not immediately respond to the white house proposal the tone of the white house letter signaled an effort to present a vigorous defense of the president against accusations of perjury , obstruction of justice and abuse of power raised by kenneth w starr , the independent counsel many in the white house assume that the politically polarized committee will vote along party lines to approve at least one article of impeachment the counterarguments the white house hopes to present next week appear aimed at moderate republicans who are still trying to decide whether to vote for impeachment on the house floor we made the decision that we want to go up and demonstrate that these proceedings have not been fair , said joe lockhart , the white house press secretary none of the allegations that have been made rise to the standard of impeachment it s that simple this is not a bank shot republicans said they saw the white house move as an effort to stall the proceedings until january , when a new congress convenes in which their house majority will be trimmed by half , to only six votes but mr lockhart denied that the white house proposal was a delaying tactic he said the committee could still vote on articles of impeachment by the end of next week if the president s lawyers were allowed four days to make his case the white house letter echoes complaints that mr clinton s partisans have raised throughout the process they maintain that the committee s republican majority has conducted a partisan inquiry that has not provided mr clinton an adequate opportunity to defend himself against the charges raised in mr starr s referral with the committee rapidly approaching a vote on impeachment , the white house clearly wants to slow the process and raise issues it says have been given short shrift in the panel s accelerated schedule the white house said it wanted to present three panels of witnesses over three to four days to discuss what constitutes an impeachable offense , the standards for prosecution of the acts that mr starr has attributed to the president , and prosecutorial misconduct we feel it is essential to the president s defense that we be able to call our own witnesses and present our own arguments to address these important questions , mr clinton s lawyers wrote to the committee the white house proposed a daylong seminar on each of those questions but did not disclose any list of witnesses it intended to call to make its case the president s lawyers said they would present a summation of mr clinton s defense at the end of the panel discussions the white house has contended all along that mr clinton s misleading statements under oath about his relationship with monica s lewinsky do not constitute perjury , and therefore do not justify impeachment the president has steadfastly denied tampering with witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice , and has also said that nothing he did constituted abuse of power as part of its defense , the white house wants to use the hearings next week to showcase once again what it calls mr starr s misconduct when mr starr appeared before the committee two weeks ago , mr clinton s lead private lawyer , david e kendall , grilled him for more than an hour on what mr kendall contended were leaks from the independent counsel s office , intimidation of witnesses , selective presentation of testimony and deceptive investigative techniques mr kendall did not raise a single point in defense of the president s actions , however now the white house says mr kendall was not given enough time to defend the president with the exception of one hour of time provided to us for questioning mr starr at the end of his appearance before the committee , the letter this evening said , the white house has been foreclosed from playing any role in the impeachment proceedings we anticipate , the letter concluded , that we will require no more than three to four days of the committee s time to deal with the topics identified above , at which time counsel for the president will present a final argument as to why , given the law , the facts and these circumstances , this committee should not report out articles of impeachment to the full membership of the house of representatives photo president clinton at the white house speaking about the economy yesterday while his lawyers prepared a counteroffensive \( associated press \) \( pg a9 \)
miami , sept 12 some made an effort to ignore it , insisting it was none of their business others found themselves drawn to every word , unable to put down the newspaper or turn off the computer the report by the independent counsel kenneth w starr on the monica lewinsky affair did not seem to change many minds in florida , but its lurid details and its case for the impeachment of president clinton have raised partisan passions here in a state that the president lost in 1992 but won in 1996 , where registered voters are nearly equally divided between democrats and republicans , many are shocked , angered and ashamed they are wondering what is next for a country mired in the tawdry goingson between a married president and a woman not his wife i'm angry , said roseanne scheck , 37 , a democrat and a social worker in tallahassee who said that she considered mr clinton s sexual relationship with monica s lewinsky to be his family s business it s not anything we need to know about it does n't have to do anything with this country s politics , educational system , social service system that report , it just might as well be in the national enquirer in the orlando area , julie mclachlan , 29 , a republican with two children who works as a court stenographer , directed her outrage at mr clinton , who she said could have saved the country expense and embarrassment by owning up to his actions at the first opportunity as far as i am concerned , this is the beginning of a global and moral collapse of our young people because of the example he has set , ms mclachlan said released on friday , the report and its salacious details spread quickly among the public through the internet , television reports , radio chatter and parties this morning , newspapers like the gainesville sun published the complete report in special sections , while others like the miami herald , the tallahassee democrat and the st petersburg times ran several pages of excerpts floridians interviewed today around the state applied words like silly , titillating and gross to the report s graphic descriptions of sexual encounters but said they were more concerned about the big picture whether americans had become the world s laughing stock , whether the nation would be scarred forever , whether anybody would ever again want to run for president now i'm afraid public figures are going to have even less of a private life , said connie tessmer , 31 , a computer programmer and a democrat now people are going to be more apt and dig up dirt but , you know , maybe that will make government officials think twice maybe it will work out good in the long run mr starr cited 11 possible counts for impeachment on grounds of perjury , obstruction of justice , witness tampering and abuse of authority , all revolving around mr clinton s liaison with ms lewinsky among floridians interviewed today who said the president should resign or face impeachment , many said they were most offended by the apparent with which mr clinton lied to his wife , to the country and even , some believe , under oath it would have been private business if he had admitted right away that , yes , i had an affair , said carl bennett , 38 , a tallahassee plumber and a republican then you could have moved on but whenever you start the lying , the trying to cover it up , that s when it became a public problem sue powell , 51 , a web site designer for a christian internet service in fort lauderdale , said she had read about 40 pages of the report to weigh the facts for herself and concluded mr clinton should resign because , it s not just hesaid , shesaid it s shesaid and here s the evidence that backs up what she said , said ms powell , who is registered as an independent voter i think he has the morals of an alley cat , she said he really has lost credibility among the people we ca n't believe a word he says and even the things he s saying now i had an improper relationship but it really was n't sex come on , get real in miami , roberto montes de oca , 49 , a social worker and a democrat , said it troubled him that mr clinton did not seem to stop to think of the consequences of lying about the affair to the american people but he and others interviewed who opposed impeachment said it troubled them more that the country would forget the good mr clinton has done during his presidency and that a great president could face removal from office for what amounts to adultery he s not a sex offender , mr montes de oca said it has no repercussions for the nation it s a problem for him and his wife , not me nobody would lose a job over something like that i was shocked someone dared to investigate this stuff and then report about it , mr montes de oca said , adding that he worried about the extent to which the president might have lost the respect of congress , cabinet members and others it s morbid , he said the investigators give the impression of being sexually repressed people feeding on the things others do some found the graphic descriptions of sexual encounters in the report necessary because of mr clinton s insistence that certain acts were not , in fact , sex but mr starr s failure so far to produce evidence against mr clinton in the areas he originally set out to investigate , such as the whitewater land deal , has led many other to question his motives and cast him as the villain in the public spectacle i think he s just out to get clinton , said ms scheck , the tallahassee social worker anything and everything that he can possibly find , he scoops up it s just annoying at this point he did n't find anything with whitewater and now he just kept on with it until he found something hector e fernandez , 26 , a miami optician , said it s embarrassing that ken starr has nothing better to do with our money if they were investigating everyone that had an extramarital affair and had to lose their job thee would be one million people suddenly unemployed but patricia hooper , 66 , an artist and a republican from orlando , said she supported mr starr because he stood for what he thought was right and did n't back down and run away because it was the president mr montes de oca , who supports mr clinton , did not blame mr starr , either it was his job , he said people criticize but they keep reading , and the media keeps fanning the issue as if this were a soap opera it shows total immaturity it s like being in high school

seattle each of us was going to build a kayak so attuned to its environment , so highly evolved , so sturdily elegant , that it could withstand 30foot seas , hurricane winds and bashings from the claw of a hammer in doing so , we would be joining an ancient tradition from the aleutian islands , the cold alaskan chain where nothing grew beyond knee height , where no one had ever seen a living tree and where the boat makers thought the driftwood they used was a gift from the sea gods we would be building an aleutian skincovered baidarka , a very , very seakind boat , our instructor said it is at once flexible , safe and svelte if you do them right , they will be like your personality , he said one may be playful one may be conservative i had come to corey freedman s boatbuilding workshop in seattle because i wanted a vessel that i could hoist onto the roof rack of my honda civic by the second hour of the workshop , however , i was a changed woman i was ready to reserve baidarka books from the library and dip into fanatically detailed baidarka bulletin boards on the internet , with discussions of the proper placement of spirit lines , the meaningful decorations that are hidden on the boat s frame mr freedman is one of just a handful of specialists who teach the nearly forgotten craft of building sea kayaks , as baidarkas are commonly known our small class last month at the center for wooden boats , a nonprofit educational organization in seattle , included a reggae music promoter , a retired neurosurgeon , an artist and mother enamored of anything arctic , and me , a journalist who had n't touched a router or countersink since seventh grade but mr freedman was ready for us in overseeing the construction of more than 350 boats over the last five years , he has developed a lowkey manner that put us at ease immediately all sorts of people have taken his course , he said , including many slight women , like me , who seem to be drawn to lightweight boats \( a baidarka weighs about 30 pounds \) nobody , though , has ever given him a hard time jerks do n't build these boats , he said mr freedman , 37 , might seem an unlikely baidarka guru he grew up in west orange , nj , 20 miles from manhattan and about 4 , 600 miles from the bering sea , where baidarkas originated at the age of 17 , after seeing baidarkas in books and at the smithsonian , mr freedman decided that he wanted to live in the northwest and run a boatbuilding school eight years ago , a casual acquaintance suggested that he consider the town of anacortes , wash , where he found and bought a barn to house the operation he holed up there for a year and a half to figure out how to build the best baidarka and lost 35 pounds in the process he now runs spirit line kayaks , which operates the school and makes custombuilt boats on the first day of class , we took several baidarkas out for a wobbly , rudderless spin on lake union in the middle of seattle , dodging sailboats and marveling at our spindly , sixinchwide paddles and the kayaks' translucent skins the memory of that brief cruise stayed with us as we worked nine consecutive 10hour days to cobble together our own crafts , bending cedar ribs fresh out of the boiler , tying 572 rib lashings with what feels like heavy , sticky dental floss and sewing on skin to be tight as a drum we worked without blueprints , glue or metal just yellow and red cedar , bamboo pegs made from whittled chopsticks \( they 're strong , rotresistant and affordable \) and nylon for the lashings and skin the coating is the same kind of urethane used on parking garage floors none of the 350 boats has ever had a puncture as we worked , we came to understand the reasoning behind some of the baidarka s quirkier features , including its bifurcated bow the lower part extends the keel , improving the boat s ability to hold a course the upper part acts as a hydrofoil , lifting the boat above heavy seas the ushaped bottom helps the paddler stay upright in swells , and the truncated stern helps the boat maneuver when waves come from behind with these boats , you do n't paddle them , you wear them , mr freedman said , recalling how the native alaskans would tie themselves into their baidarkas to avoid falling into the frigid sea mr freedman gets his wood for the projects from an 80yearold miller in concrete , wash , who salvages logs that were cut 30 or 40 years ago and cast off because of flaws the red cedar for the deck beams was fished out of baker lake , in the mount bakersnoqualmie national forest , while the yellow cedar ribs came from the cascade mountains east of seattle our seminar cost 850 including materials a bargain , considering that professional builders charge several thousand dollars for a new baidarka , and even fiberglass kayaks have retail prices around 2 , 500 once we had finished lashing and sewing our boats together , we decorated , stained and coated them my baidarka smelled of linseed oil and cedar , wood taken from places where i had hiked just this summer as i lifted her easily and prepared to slip her into the water , it was easy to think that such materials , and the old knowledge of what to do with them , were of sacred provenance photos the writer applies urethane to an aleutian baidarka built by another student in the class she took at the center for wooden

bangkok , thailand photos of the thai king adorn the walls of most local companies and homes but at the wanglee company , that honor is reserved for the sage , sepiatoned likeness of tan siewwang , forefather of one of thailand s most famous business clans mr tan sailed to thailand from southern china more than 130 years ago , and he died early this century but his portrait is not all that remains the family dynasty he started , known by the thaichinese name wanglee , is now in its fifth generation with interests that span manufacturing , agriculture , real estate and banking , the wanglees are as well known here today as the carnegies or the rockefellers were in america a century ago they have kept their sprawling empire intact through loyalty to mr tan s conservative business philosophy , the canon of which can be summed up in four words thou shalt not sell the wanglees still own every parcel of land mr tan bought , and they have never offered outsiders large stakes in their companies what belonged to our family 100 years ago still belongs to us , says vuttichai wanglee , a fourthgeneration heir and managing director of wanglee , which still uses the riverside trading house where mr tan worked it is our culture not to risk what greatgrandfather built this allinthefamily rule has served the wanglees well through several wars , the japanese occupation and a dozen military coups but it will not survive asian financial crisis faced with an ultimatum by the thai central bank to raise fresh capital , the wanglees are reluctantly preparing to sell a controlling stake in nakornthon bank , the family s crown jewel , for a fraction of the price it would have brought a year ago our ancestors could never have imagined that it would come to this , said thamnu wanglee , the bank s president , slowly shaking his head but they also could never have imagined such a crisis the sale will do more than embarrass a member of the thai business aristocracy the collapse of asian financial markets has struck a blow a fatal one , some economists say at perhaps the most outstanding feature of thai business the domination by a few wealthy chinese families , and the cozy network that nurtures them as in indonesia , chinese represent a small fraction of the thai population , but straddle every line of business nowhere is that as true as in banking twelve of the 15 commercial banks are chinese family operations the wanglees' nakornthon bank is relatively small , with about 2 billion in assets but shareholdings in even the largest banks , led by bangkok bank and the thai farmers bank , are structured to insure family control even in diverse family empires , banks are the prized possession thailand has not granted a new fullservice banking license in 40 years , creating a familydirected plutocracy of 15 that rivals the finance ministry in their power owning a bank is one step removed from royalty , a longtime banker here said but today , many blame that insular system for the nation s financial trouble family banks often make loans based on relationships socalled name lending giving more weight to a company patriarch s reputation , and the collateral he offers , than to business plans and cash flow critics say such practices allowed thai companies to rack up too much debt and pumped air into real estate and stock market bubbles the thai government is determined to change the system , clearing a path for western banks in this longcloistered market the international monetary fund has made an overhaul a central condition of its 172 billion bailout package the changes are already striking the central bank has nationalized four banks this year , wiping out foundingfamily shares two other banks have fallen into foreign hands , one to the dutch banking giant abn amro , and the other to the singapore development bank the rest are scrambling to raise funds in a way that insures longterm family control , but few see that as likely for more than one or two of them the era of family banking is over , said amaret silaon , head of a government body overseeing disposal of bad bank assets whether the families like it or not , thailand now needs professionals at the helm the wanglees customized their businesses to avoid just such a fate mr tan , the founding father , insisted on selfsufficiency he bought land along the chao phraya river in bangkok so that his company could handle rice and silk cargo ships on its own jetties to this day , it owns more than half a square mile of prime riverside property wanglee rice mills also sat on wanglee land in his final days , mr tan established the wanglee company as a perpetual corporation , making all his descendants there are about 200 today equal shareholders , the better to prevent infighting that might splinter the company as if to stress continuity , the wanglee company remains where it was a century ago , on a pier by the river the tarmac is made of cobblestones shipped from china as ballast on silk ships inside , vaultlike teak doors and woodcage cashier windows have been faithfully maintained a chinese scribe on the payroll drafts handwritten company

rainbow six by tom clancy putnam , 2795 tom clancy does n't waste any time in the first 10 pages of his latest actionpacked novel , there s an attempted airplane hijacking that is quickly and professionally foiled by one of clancy s familiar heroes , the former navy seal and cia operative john clark who happens be to traveling on the very same plane to england to set up a special multinational antiterrorist force called rainbow six coincidentally , just as the force is getting on its feet , there is a sudden outbreak of bad behavior across europe a bank robbery in switzerland , an attempted kidnapping in austria , an assault on a spanish amusement park none of these dastardly crimes can be handled by local forces , so clark s shadowy group , chockfull of munitions experts , sharpshooters and allaround daredevils , struts its stuff , inevitably saving the day intercutting between scenes of the arduous training and exciting exploits of rainbow six , clancy eventually uncovers an even larger crime as the group receives mounting evidence of a diabolical scheme to wage biological warfare , a plot to contaminate the world with a deadly virus joining forces with a former kgb agent , the bad guys are using terrorist attacks to advance their own evil ends , which will all be revealed at the next olympic games in australia clancy obviously puts no credence in the advice that less is more , but his mammoth book is meticulously researched and carefully plotted even though the conspiracy he writes of seems farfetched the author has his own ax to grind , and when he refers to saving the planet he s not talking about the ozone layer or endangered species suffice it to say that when all is said and done , he stands little chance of being asked to appear as a guest speaker at the next sierra club convention charles salzberg
the rev joseph a o'hare , a jesuit 50 years this summer , is well trained in his order s mission to find god in all things , to pluck the moment of the spirit from a working day but even he was surprised to encounter traces of the divine at the new york city campaign finance board well , i do n't want to be overly pious about it , but it has been very inspiring at times to meet candidates running for the first time , said father o'hare , the chairman of the board and the president of fordham university the city council candidates from different parts of the city , minority candidates who were mounting their first campaigns and who said they would never have been able to do it without public matching funds these are people who felt they could make a difference , who were not overly cynical about the system , and i have been inspired and instructed by the quality of these people there are many people who could have led the campaign finance board during its tumultuous 10 years , even others who could have been as scrupulously tough and evenhanded in meting out fines to three mayors and assorted other political bulldogs but perhaps no one else could have discovered religious inspiration within the finances of the city s politicians , surely the rank underbelly of new york s political system it is that characteristic , along with a passionate belief in the moral imperative of campaign finance regulation , that has made him a hero to goodgovernment groups and editorial boards around the city , to the point that even mayor rudolph w giuliani overcame his earlier annoyance and twisted father o'hare s arm last week to remain on the board another five years and , of course , the roman collar helps he s indemnified by his collar , said martin s begun , another member of the finance board and the chairman of the jewish community relations council it gives him a certain latitude , where others would be more targeted for some abuse by all the politicians who are so outraged by the decisions of the board one of the civilities still remaining in our society is that people tend to respect clergymen , restrain themselves because of them we should all wear one that s one of the reasons mayor edward i koch first appointed him as chairman of the nascent board 10 years ago , aware that father o'hare s position as a roman catholic priest and as president of fordham would enhance a reputation of hardheaded integrity in a way , there s something almost facile about selecting a clergyman when a symbol of wholesomeness is needed , but father o'hare has exceeded the pat expectations by becoming a forceful advocate for the campaign finance system , even urging tighter limits on contributions and more matching funds for small donations none of that is particularly surprising to those who know his personal interpretation of the jesuits' mandate of public service , who have watched him rise in his 15 years at fordham to become a major figure in new york s civic life the son of a police officer and a public school teacher , father o'hare , 67 , grew up just a few blocks from the university s rose hill campus in the bronx and entered the jesuit order at age 17 , attracted by its commitment to social justice when i decided i wanted to be a jesuit , the models that attracted me the most were the labor priests , like father john corridan , he said , referring to the priest loosely portrayed by karl malden in on the waterfront , the 1954 movie about corruption on the hudson docks it s not an otherworldly kind of spirituality it s the kind very geared to involvement in the present time fordham , when he took over , was somewhat academically sleepy , but its reputation and endowment have increased significantly in the following years , drawing students well beyond its traditional base in the city s parochial schools faculty members say that the growing popularity of new york city as a college destination and father o'hare s insistence on academic excellence are the major reasons why the number of applications to the school is double what it was in 1991 during most of those years , father o'hare also found time to lead the finance board , which was originally housed in his office at the school s lincoln center campus he said he hoped that he would not be reappointed when his term ran out last month , believing that it was time for a new leader after a decade but he was surprised to hear that the mayor and the city council speaker , peter f vallone , wanted him back during last year s mayoral race , the finance board fined mr giuliani s campaign 243 , 490 for accepting contributions beyond the legal limits , and the mayor s campaign was not happy with the board s interpretation of the law but the mayor , who because of term limits will not be running for city office in 2001 , was perhaps mindful of an incident in late 1993 , when mayor david n dinkins refused to reappoint father o'hare after the board fined the dinkins campaign 320 , 000 mr giuliani forced out mr dinkins s choice and reappointed father o'hare upon taking office in 1994 , criticizing the former mayor for acting in anger father o'hare , with his perpetual look of detached amusement , admits that he was far more of a political innocent in the early days , back when some people grumbled that a priest supervising politicians might have certain unrealistic expectations his laugh makes it clear that those expectations are as permanent as the collar photo the rev joseph a o'hare , chairman of the new york city campaign finance board \( librado romero the

this is not an abstract dispute but it is one that might well bestir the spirit of william s paley the late mr paley , the founder of cbs and a onetime chairman of the museum of modern art , might be upset to learn that when morley safer , coeditor of 60 minutes , approached officials at moma earlier this month about doing a segment for the network s sunday morning show on the widely acclaimed jackson pollack retrospective exhibit , he was turned down flat moma s director , glenn d lowry , explained in an interview why he said no to mr safer , one of the network s most celebrated journalists we get hundreds of requests from serious journalists to do pieces on moma and its exhibits , mr lowry said we went with them rather than someone who does driveby shootings he did not elaborate of course , mr safer had once opined on 60 minutes that most contemporary art was worthless junk still , he characterized his conversation with mr lowry as strong but civil but mr safer added i 've never been brutalized by a museum director like this i think it s revenge for my earlier pieces , none of which involved the museum of modern art i explained fairly carefully what i wanted to do with the broadcast , he continued given the fact that pollack is a difficult artist to understand , i said it would be useful for kurt varnedoe , the show s director , to explain the artist s work he said that s fine , but not with you mr safer , who described moma as a humorless comintern of contemporary art , was nevertheless amused at mr lowry s characterization of his take on the subject actually , the first contemporary art piece i did , which aired on '60 minutes' in 1993 , was more like a sniping than a driveby shooting , he said still , that s a pretty good one for a museum director the sunday morning audience wo n't be there , but the pollack show , which closes feb 2 , wo n't lack television coverage at least 10 shows have already been shown or been shot on the exhibit , including segments on cnn , the news hour with jim lehrer , the charlie rose show and the bbc , said a moma spokesman , who insisted on anonymity and discussions with two other networks are in the detail stage , the spokesman added kenneth n gilpin photo morley safer
six female employees in the accounting office at the city university of new york have filed a federal lawsuit accusing the cuny controller , anthony hladek jr , of sexual harassment and fostering a climate of sexual harassment in his office the suit says mr hladek and other managers frequently made sexual jokes and comments and decorated the office with sexually explicit pictures the plaintiffs also say the office had a christmas grab bag filled with sexrelated objects , including colored condoms and seethrough lingerie the harassment started when mr hladek became controller in 1985 , the suit says the suit also contends that women in the office were denied promotions and raises because of sexual discrimination , and that university officials , including members of the chancellor s office and some trustees , were aware of the discrimination but failed to take any remedial action the lawsuit was filed in state supreme court in the bronx in july mer and moved to federal court in august the case is before judge jed s rakoff of federal district court in manhattan and depositions are being taken a copy of the suit was sent to the new york times this week by a person sympathetic to the plaintiffs john c schnaufer , the plaintiffs' lawyer , said none of the women could comment because the case is in litigation mr schnaufer , a partner with dean schnaufer in white plains , said efforts to settle the case outside court had been unsuccessful louis pechman , a manhattan lawyer representing mr hladek , said yesterday that his client could not comment because the matter was in court a lot of this has been blown way out of proportion , and some of it is ancient history , he said tony has treated the women in the office with dignity and respect , added mr pechman he said that 9 of the 20 managers in the office are women and that mr hladek had hired and promoted many of them in a statement issued yesterday , cuny said it was studying the allegations we take the charges of sexual harassment and discrimination very seriously , and comply with federal , state and city laws prohibiting such conduct in the workplace , said jay hershenson , cuny s vice chancellor for university relations at the university s accounting office on west 57th street , which is separate from cuny s administrative quarters on east 80th street , sexual decorations abounded , the plaintiffs say in their suit they say the door to mr hladek s office and the office bulletin board were covered with postcards of naked and scantily dressed women , some in sexually explicit poses , and posters and calendars with similar pictures were hung around the office the suit also says mr hladek called women vulgar names , commented on their physical attributes and boasted of his sexual prowess and encouraged other employees to do the same mr hladek , 48 , joined the cuny accounting office in 1981 he earned a bachelor s degree in accounting from cuny s baruch college and worked for 10 years for the state comptroller s office before joining cuny the women who brought the lawsuit hold middle and lowerlevel administrative jobs in an office of about 70 employees they are evelyn lopez , an assistant loan coordinator maryjo kranacher , director of trusts and gifts management rochelle messing , deputy director of financial reports helen flaherty , a senior administrative assistant loretta sodela cruz , a college accountant , and alice wise , an assistant accountant although ms lopez and ms flaherty work in the accounting office like the others , they are employed by cuny s research foundation , which was also named as a party to the lawsuit the professional staff congress , a union representing several of plaintiffs , filed a grievance on behalf of all of its members in the accounting office in january , charging that the controller had created an intimidating , hostile work environment and had violated the university s policy against sexual harassment the grievance was put on hold in late august until the lawsuit is resolved mr schnaufer , the plaintiffs' lawyer , said he could not say why the case was filed only this year , except that you reach a point where you say , 'i do n't want to do this anymore' cuny employees close to the plaintiffs say the sexually explicit pictures were removed from the office this year the employees added that the women had requested that mr hladek be removed from the office while their allegations were being considered , but the request had not been granted
kohlberg kravis roberts company and the texas pacific group are proposing putting 600 million of badly needed capital into oxford health plans , a person close to the negotiations said yesterday under the deal , which could be completed as soon as next week , the two buyout firms would provide 300 million in equity financing and raise an additional 300 million in debt for oxford , the troubled managed care company though the details are being worked out , the firms could end up with 15 percent to 20 percent of the company , the person said none of the parties would comment on the talks though the serious interest of such savvy investors as kohlberg kravis and texas pacific , which became actively involved about a week ago , could be seen as a sign of confidence in oxford s future , there are also signs that its financial problems could be worse than many investors expect oxford , whose stock has been shattered by announcements in recent months that it has seriously underestimated its medical costs , said earlier this week that it had received a shortterm loan of 100 million from donaldson , lufkin jenrette , with an option to borrow 100 million more , and that it would seek longerterm financing sometime in 1998 analysts speculated that the bridge loan could signal that the company was running short of money it suggests that the company s financial situation is more shaky than investors perceive , said roberta walter , an analyst with merrill lynch according to the person close to the negotiations , oxford needed the shortterm loan to meet the capital requirements of regulators in several states an oxford spokeswoman declined to comment on the company s capital needs the person close to the talks said that for the deal to go through , kohlberg kravis was insisting that norman payson , a physician and former chief executive of a rival company , become oxford s new chief executive dr payson , who founded healthsource inc before selling the company to the cigna corporation , was reported last week to be the leading candidate for the job if chosen , the person close to the talks said , dr payson would assemble a management team , including a chief financial officer , to help turn around the company the buyout firms would also require more information about the company a possible obstacle to the deal could be the company s rising stock price oxford shares closed yesterday at 199375 , having gained in recent days on a mix of speculation and the news that michael price , a respected value investor , had accumulated more than 5 percent of the stock when kohlberg kravis and texas pacific initially expressed interest in the company , the stock was a third lower than it is now other investment firms , including a consortium of other buyout firms , are also said to be looking at oxford , although it is unclear whether they are as far along in the process though the possibility of backing from kohlberg kravis and texas pacific might cheer investors , the transaction is hardly a done deal oxford is continuing to review its options , and kohlberg kravis has pursued other companies to no avail it made a takeover offer for wellpoint health networks , a california hmo , for example , but the deal never took place and though any new private equity investor like kohlberg kravis would have information that is unavailable to current shareholders , no one should assume that the worst is over many people expect further bad news later this month when oxford announces its fourthquarter results the new investors might think its core commercial business is profitable , but oxford s losses over the next quarter or two could be sizable , and a new chief executive could insist on taking large writeoffs moreover , the involvement of buyout firms like kohlberg kravis , whose services do not come cheap , could suggest that oxford ran out of other possible sources of capital the company , which has no debt on its books , might not have been able to persuade a bank to lend it money at lower rates , for example , because the loan appeared too risky common shareholders would run the risk of dilution as the outside investors took their share of the company this could be offset by any significant gains in the stock this is a strategy forcing change , said douglas sherlock , a health care industry analyst in philadelphia but the strategy would also place more risk on the common stockholders if the new equity investors got preferred stock or some sort of senior security

when easterners learn you 're from nebraska , you can divide them into three irritating groups those who wonder if you can milk a cow , those who assume you can ride , and those who ask , did you live in a town , or \? keep going , i always want to say \( next time i will \) fred astaire , marlon brando , johnny carson , darryl f zanuck , william jennings bryan , to name a few typical nebraskans were they too plagued with such questions \? the one that made me wince was , can you ride \? i loved cowboy movies as much as the next man , and to confess to getting no closer to an equine than hopalong cassidy s on the screen and to not knowing a pommel from a cantle seemed to me both unmanly and the essence of wimphood coming to long island cured all this they say there are more horses on long island than people whether or not we twoleggeds are , in fact , outnumbered , it is true that i finally lost my saddle virginity here a westerner coming east to learn to ride \? a paradox , perhaps , but a lucky one because i was taught by a fabled horsewoman , fanny gardiner a woman whose britannicalike knowledge of horses is legendary to fulfill childhood dreams , it had to be western riding not that effete english stuff \( save the hate mail from years on tv i have plenty i have n't even opened yet \) i soaked up fanny s expertise one day a rodeo cowboy said to me , seein' you come along that ridge i thought at first you were fanny gardiner a compliment to swoon for i told fanny and she said in her noextrawords way , yeah , i mark my riders at an auction somewhere upisland , fanny found a horse for me for 500 \( early 70 s \) i got a handsome rhone gelding registered quarterhorse whose official name , to my distress , was twilight time i called him time the day i bought him , i could n't keep my mind on anything else after a show taping i was told i had said aloud in the middle of a guest s sentence , i think i bought a horse beginning western riding is a rude surprise because it looks so easy , but when the horse trots , you ca n't keep from bouncing all over the saddle the saddle horn is particularly a hazard \( ahem \) to the male student trotting , you feel like a piledriver and that night , as fanny says , you 'll be eatin' dinner off the mantelpiece then , one day , you have the glorious breakthrough when you get it suddenly you and the horse and saddle are a smoothworking unit and you ca n't bounce at long last you can , to put it awkwardly , kiss your saddle sores goodbye what if i got the part of a beginner in a movie , i asked fanny , and had to bounce \? stiffen your legs , she said it works a pope s a little knowlege is a dangerous thing applies to the novice rider as when someone suggests getting on john wayne s horse i 'll explain when people would say to me , gosh , you 've met everybody , i always sullenly thought , but not john wayne it seemed fated to be so then one day at a meeting at universal in hollywood , somebody casually mentioned that the duke was shooting , over on the western set i did n't have to ask which duke i'm told i fell silent and floated out of the meeting with a possessed expression the next thing i knew i was muttering audibly , my god , there he is ! then , i was standing beside the familiar image that s burned into every moviegoer s sensibility the mounted figure of john wayne it was like gazing up at mount rushmore and he was saying , gee , it sure is good to meet you it felt like an organ tone went through my body the last two words elided , of course , into meetcha fade to an hour later there s a break in shooting and someone said , hey , dick , why do n't you get up on dollar \? to be able to say i had sat on john wayne s horse , the fact that i had begun riding lessons plus a boost put me smack in the saddle that the great man had just vacated dollar was big as a house and for me it felt like trying to straddle a diningroom table what happened next still scares me either i inadvertantly gave dollar the wrong signal or a wasp stung him he took off like a rocket in sheer fright , bouncing and flapping atop the crazed steed , i held onto anything i could grab as we surged through a crowd of extras old ladies in sun bonnets diving for cover in my mind i pictured cavett kills extras in stupid stunt and heard the very real voice of someone in authority shrieking , who the is that on duke s horse \? ! and there was laughter and it stung dollar suddenly halted calmly where we started as if nothing had happened descending , shaken and shaking , i could barely focus on the livid party yelling in my face what if something had happened \? we 've got three quarters of this picture in the can ! touched by his concern for dollar , i offered , i'm glad you do n't have to change horses in midscene lame , i know , but what about me \? seemed too obvious i slunk off , grateful for life and limb and that the duke had not been there to witness the alleged fun
pittsburgh , june 3 for the mets , the initial impact of having mike piazza in the lineup has apparently worn off rather quickly after a week of pounding out hits , the mets were stifled tonight by a pitcher with a 27 record coming into the game pittsburgh righthander jon lieber shut them down on four hits over eight innings on his way to a 30 victory that completed a threegame sweep for the pirates at three rivers stadium that guy was working in hyperspeed , greg mcmichael said of lieber gee whiz , he must have had a date or something lieber , an 11game winner last season , outdueled an extremely unlucky rick reed \( 63 \) , who saw his fivegame winning streak end with his first defeat since april 21 reed has given up two runs or less in each of his last seven starts when reed departed , he had faced only one batter over the minimum 18 of his 64 pitches over six innings , he allowed just two hits , one on his first pitch of the game but that first one probably cost him the game with an insideout swing , jermaine allensworth smacked that first pitch over first base and hustled to third with a triple when butch huskey slipped at the rightfield line as he tried to field the ball on the wet turf al martin followed with a runscoring nub of a groundout up the firstbase line three pitches , 10 , said reed , who struck out five and walked none in lowering his earned run average to 237 he was pretty much unhittable from there on but lieber , who walked one and struck out seven , had the only run he would need still , aramis ramirez gave him two more for insurance with his first major league hit the 19yearold dominican rookie s basesloaded tworun double to left field off mcmichael in the pirates' seventh snapped an 0for24 skid and brought a welldeserved standing ovation from the crowd of 17 , 691 i just thought , 'what are they doing \? ' ramirez said later of the fans' support for him as he went to bat i'm doing nothing here in the big leagues to get to ramirez , mcmichael had pitched around jose guillen , who was batting 337 when the game began but mcmichael said he did not know that ramirez was still looking for his first major league hit i just knew he was n't guillen , who s batting 350 , the reliever said when you 're pitching , you have to take your chances somewhere these new mets have looked a lot like the old mets the last three days after punishing pitchers for 100 hits and 54 runs in piazza s first seven games with the team , the mets \( 3123 \) collected just 17 hits \( 6 , 7 and 4 \) and 5 runs \( 3 , 2 and 0 \) in the three games here as a result , they are now 73 with piazza , who went 0 for 4 tonight , his first hitless game as a met even john olerud struck out three times for the first time this season that s the way it happens in baseball , manager bobby valentine said , after his team hit a combined 185 over the last three nights everybody gets really hot together and they 're probably going to get really cold together , too tonight , the mets' bats were all but frozen in a game that took just 2 hours 10 minutes they stranded carlos baerga at second with one out in the second and huskey at third with two out in the seventh they left a runner on base in every inning inbetween leaving huskey at third really hurt huskey had singled to right to open the seventh in what was still a 10 game and then moved to third on rey ordonez s oneout lineout to right valentine , sensing this might be his best chance against lieber , summoned matt franco to pinchhit for reed lieber hung a slider on his first pitch to franco one of the worst pitches the guy made all night , as a matter of fact , valentine said but franco popped to third to end the threat inside pitch according to a person familiar with the thinking of both dodgers general manager fred claire and hideo nomo s agent , don nomura , the dodgers have had serious discussions with three or four teams regarding a possible trade of nomo the orioles are apparently one team the mets , who contacted claire on tuesday , may be another manager bobby valentine said today that he would not comment on whether he wanted nomo on his staff or whether he had spoken to nomura since nomo was designated for assignment on monday
a celebration of heroism by new york city firefighters degenerated into a bacchanalian brawl at a cafe in bryant park wednesday night as firemen harassed patrons , urinated publicly , exposed themselves , ran through a women s restroom and got into bloody fights with each other and anyone who tried to intervene , outraged city officials acknowledged yesterday it was the most serious breach of conduct by members of the city s uniformed services since 1995 , when dozens of new york police officers went on a drunken rampage at several hotels in washington , groping women , spraying fire extinguishers , running around halfnude and sliding down beersoaked banisters it also appeared to be one of the most embarrassing episodes in the history of the fire department , and while none of the offenders had been publicly identified last night , fire commissioner thomas von essen and other officials vowed a full investigation and vigorous prosecution of any lawbreakers anyone who has acted criminally or in a manner that brings discredit to the department will be severely punished , said mr von essen , who noted that investigators had already interviewed 18 civilian witnesses and would go into firehouses to press the inquiry after joining hundreds of firefighters and their families at medal day ceremonies at city hall with mayor rudolph w giuliani and other officials to honor acts of bravery by comrades , about 40 firefighters gathered at the bryant park grill s awningdraped outdoor cafe behind the new york public library in the late afternoon wednesday , and witnesses said the party soon grew ugly the cafe s manager , bartenders and others told of hours of heavy drinking by firefighters , who were off duty but still clad in their navyblue , brassbutton dress uniforms and they told of a party that regressed from fraternitylike rowdyism that sent furniture flying and patrons running , into a carousing mob that engaged in lewd behavior and sporadic but bloody fistfights the cafe was closed two hours early at 9 30 pm , but the manager was afraid to tell the firefighters they had to leave the police were finally called at 10 30 pm and rounded up dozens of men at the scene they were taken to the midtown south precinct but the only person who was arrested immediately was the cafe bouncer , who , according to his manager , mistook an officer for one of the brawlers and hurled him over a planter onto a patio it s so unfair , the manager , donna simms , said yesterday a fireman in uniform hits someone who is not in uniform and our security is arrested for that \? the debauchery and violence came at the end of one of the proudest days of the year for city firefighters hundreds and their families gathered before a stage set up on the steps of city hall in the late morning to honor acts of bravery last year bagpipes played the banners of engine and ladder companies that boasted medal winners were unfurled mayor giuliani , in an address , called firefighters greater heroes than the yankees medals went to firefighters like stan j sussina , who had been lowered by rope out of a 29thstory window to rescue two women from a burning apartment below , and like ali m pasha , who ran six stories up into a burning building to save a trapped man for most who attended , it was a day of humbling pride but for a few it was something more hubristic it was unclear when the drinking began but by early evening , those who gathered at bryant park grill had begun to behave badly ms simms , the manager , said the firefighters tried to set up a makeshift band drums , a keyboard , a microphone when she asked them to stop , they told her they had permission from the parks department after she still refused , the firefighters began walking through the restaurant s kitchen , drinking beer and puffing cigars , and several wandered into the women s restroom as the night progressed , they became rowdier , ms simms said they were urinating in the park , planters were turned over , and a few chairs , she said it was like a mob , like a big frat party they were an embarrassment but we were afraid to tell them they had to go it got worse , juan dorta , a bartender , recalled flower pots were broken beer glasses were smashed they were out of their minds , he said first they were joking around with each other , then they started to fight with each other , and whoever tried to break it up bartenders , bouncers , whoever they just kept throwing punches another bartender who gave her name only as naomi said , they were punching each other and drawing blood other witnesses said some of the fighting may have stemmed from rivalries between fire companies a police investigator , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said , some exposed themselves , walked about partially nude , urinated in public , entered nonpublic areas of the restaurant , smoked cigars in nonsmoking areas , entered the ladies' restroom and generally carried on in an unprofessional manner the police were finally called but before they arrived , ethan kemp , 31 , a 6foot , 4inch , 250pound lawschool student working at the cafe as a bouncer , saw a uniformed man beating up a civilian and tried to break it up , ms simms said as he did so , officers lawrence j mcdonnell and michael mclean , of the midtown south precinct , arrived officer mcdonnell tried to break up the fight , but mr kemp , who mistook him for one of the brawlers , according to ms simms , flipped the officer over a planter onto the patio the officer was taken to bellevue hospital , where he was treated for chest , back , neck and shoulder pains and released police reinforcements , meanwhile , rounded up about 25 other men at the scene they , along with mr kemp , were taken to the midtown south precinct the police said witnesses were unable to identify any of the men in custody as brawlers their names were taken and all were released , except mr kemp , who was charged with assault , resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration released on his own recognizance after an arraignment last night , mr kemp said i do n't think i was treated fairly i was trying to defend myself i was trying to protect myself from the firemen his lawyer , david kapnor , a legal aid attorney , said his client would hire a private lawyer and noted that mr kemp would cooperate in any investigation i think there s plenty to investigate , mr kapnor said something does n't look very good here
san diego there had been a strange sense in the air the san diego padres , the team that had gone up by three games to none and then by three games to one in the national league championship series , might have some cause for alarm maybe because the heavily favored atlanta braves were the team that had just won its first game in the series , on sunday coming from behind twice and had the cy young triumvirate coming up in games 5 and , if it came to pass , 6 and 7 so messrs smoltz , glavine and maddux were ready and the padres \? well , andy ashby was the padre pitcher next in the rotation , and was slated to start last night why , the padres pitching coach dave stewart was asked sunday night , would kevin brown , the relatively rested ace of the staff , not pitch in ashby s stead \? to use brown , stewart replied , would be an act of panic in the seventh inning of yesterday s game , guess who came in to relieve for the padres \? kevin brown ! was this some kind of act of panic on the part of padres manager bruce bochy \? or was this so brilliant a move that it would dazzle the beastly braves , end this series and catapult the padres into the world series \? brown had been virtually invincible in game 2 , throwing a threehit shutout in atlanta , and striking out 11 last night the padres had taken the lead by 20 , and then the braves had tied the score in the sixth just as they had done the day before and then in the seventh , ozzie guillen led off for the braves with a single off mark langston , who had replaced ashby a huge roar rose from the crowd of 58 , 988 in qualcomm stadium here came the lengthy fastballthrowing , madly intense brown , striding in from the bullpen the crowd stood and cheered his every pitch to pinchhitter greg colbrunn , who struck out colbrunn unaccountably broke his black bat in half on his final swing brown got the next two batters to fly out and pop up this was casey at the mound and reversing the old ode by saving mudville the braves were battling not only brown and the padres , but also their selfrespect they have been to seven consecutive league championship series , and they have won one world series they are either the greatest team of the 1990 s or the greatest alsorans if we do n't advance , the braves' general manager , john schuerholz said , it would be like an unfinished symphony in game 4 , the fans chanted , sweep ! sweep ! when that did n't work , they switched in game 5 to the conventional charge ! charge ! and now bochy was a genius but hold on it s the eighth inning and brown walks the leadoff hitter , ryan klesko he gives up a single to javy lopez , but forces andruw jones to pop to first up comes michael tucker , who had driven in the braves' two other runs brown delivers and tucker parks one over the rightfield wall the braves , improbably , take the lead , 54 at the mound , brown was bent over , his hands on his knees , as though he had just been hit with a karate chop no chants of sweep ! from the fans no charge ! no nothing the ball park was as silent as the moon and they stayed that way as brown was removed for donne wall poor casey he had , sadly , missed the boat again and bochy was a bum the braves scored twice more in the inning to take a 74 lead and when the padres scored two in the ninth , braves manager bobby cox took a page from bochy s book and brought in greg maddux , who , unlike brown , preserved a victory in dramatic fashion until game 4 , the braves had scored just three runs in three games their lumber , as cox had said in so many words , was aslumber then they awoke in game 5 , winning 83 the padres , however , could surely have avoided any thought of panic with the cushion of knowing that no team in baseball history had come back from a threegame deficit to win a fourofseven series oh , there had been two teams in hockey who had accomplished the feat , but that s a horse of a different odor on the other hand , the braves did come back from being down , 31 , against st louis in the 1996 nlcs and , come to think of it , that s precisely where the two teams stood before game 5 not only that , but the braves also won the next three games against the cardinals by pitching their three cy young award winners , john smoltz in the fifth game , maddux in the sixth and tom glavine in the seventh all that was changed this time around was that glavine and maddux would be transposed in the rotation not much of a change if you happened to find yourself in the batter s box wearing a padres uniform we 're still up , three games to two , padres first baseman wally joyner said no , left fielder john vander wal said we 're not feeling any panic none , of course none at all none , perhaps , for game 6 , tomorrow in atlanta , either or game 7 , when brown would presumably next be available versus maddux oh brother , this is getting as good as mcgwire and sosa photo braves' greg maddux was congratulated by his teammates eddie perez , back , and andres galarraga after beating the padres in game 5 \( reuters \)
to the editor re concern among jews is heightened as scientists deepen gene studies \( news article , april 22 \) those disposed to see a cloud in every silver lining have managed to cast doubt on research about the causes of and possible cures for genetic diseases prevalent among ashkenazi jews there are good scientific reasons to focus on ashkenazi jews , given the long history of intermarriage the research is conducted by responsible scientists , many jewish themselves , under stringent ethical guidelines there are no credible reports of misuse of the data while there are legitimate concerns about what insurance companies might do with genetic information , these are readily addressed by pending legislation banning the use of such information by insurance companies and employers those jewish spokesmen who challenge such research raise the specter that the research will give rise to theories about the genetic inferiority of jews but it is a dishonest use of history to fail to recognize the differences between racist nazi eugenics and responsible scientific research to relieve human suffering one can only hope that the jewish community will prove more sober than some of its leaders , who imagine stigma and harm to jewish selfimage where none exist lois waldman dir , commission for women s equality , american jewish congress new york , april 23 , 1998
the question , it seems , is interesting to everyone but dominik hasek i think he s the best , pat lafontaine of the rangers said when asked if hasek is the premier goalie in the world i 've seen him do things that make me shake my head and i ca n't say that about a lot of players he s the best , said jaromir jagr of the pittsburgh penguins , hasek s teammate on the czech republic s goldmedalwinning team at the winter olympics in nagano , japan i said before the olympics 'we 've got the best goalie in the world we have to take advantage of that' and what does hasek say about it \? i hate these questions , hasek said who is better \? patrick roy hasek martin brodeur that is your choice i just love to play hockey i just like to win , and that is why i play hockey hasek , who had 36 saves yesterday in his eighth shutout of the season , a 30 buffalo sabres victory over washington , comes into town tonight to face the rangers at madison square garden the rangers need a victory the way a hungry man needs a meal but their offense has been spotty , and now they face hasek , who is coming off perhaps the greatest individual performance in hockey history it is akin to walking up to the front desk of a motel to check in and seeing norman bates behind the counter while hasek wears his celebrity like a hair shirt , there is no escaping what he has accomplished in the last year like a joe montana or a greg maddux , he has built a body of work that transcends his position last season he became the first goalie in 35 years to be named the national hockey league s most valuable player maybe the problem is that the question is too narrow it no longer seems adequate to discuss hasek in terms of contemporary goalies you now have to ask is he one of the best ever \? or maybe the question should be is he the best hockey player in the world today \? just do n't ask hasek i do n't know if he s the best player , wayne gretzky of the rangers said you make a statement like that and you start a big debate there s lindros , forsberg , jagr , selanne but he s like them because he can win a game all by himself john davidson , a broadcaster and former goalie , said he s the best he s crafted his whole game no one s done it like he has aside from the numbers and the awards , and now the frozen moment in nagano , hasek has a trait shared by most legendary athletes he s got style true , it might not be style in the classic definition but say this for him it is his own hasek s success is derived from two main tributaries his monomaniacal work ethic and his athleticism growing up in the former czechoslovakia , hasek was not fettered by a goaltending coach thus , he was able to develop his own style it is a product of his fertile imagination hasek is a history buff and something of a closet intellectual it starts in the deepest part of hasek s being people who know him will tell you that the intangibles set hasek apart from others he works like a longshoreman he could probably bend spoons with his powers of concentration and , at 33 , he has lost none of his passion for the game sure , that kind of fire can manifest itself in some fairly eccentric behavior but when you can play goal the way horowitz plays the piano , you will be forgiven the odd lapse in decorum he hates to get beat in practice , said petr svoboda of the flyers , whose relationship with hasek goes back to junior hockey in the former czechoslovakia svoboda also shared the olympic gold in nagano he works an extra 40 minutes after the game he never stops working , and he enjoys the game so much he s 33 years old , but he enjoys the game as much as a 16yearold that much is evident davidson tells of watching hasek take a full workout with the czech team in japan the day after his stunning 38save performance against the united states hasek stayed after practice and faced shooters in a penaltyshot drill the next day he stopped all five canadian shootout attempts to lift the czechs into the goldmedal game i 've never seen a goalie work like him , davidson said hasek was drafted by the chicago blackhawks in 1983 , but he turned down the initial contract because he was enjoying his life while playing in the former czechoslovakia he entered the nhl in 1990 , when he was 25 , and played backup for two years in chicago he was traded to buffalo in 1992 it might be unfair to call hasek a hothead it is fair to say he brings a certain artistic temperament to his position early in his career , hasek s armysponsored club team was facing pardubice , his former club team from his hometown pardubice was in last place and in danger of falling out of the first division , and hasek did not want to be a part of that hasek was ordered to take the net against his former club , and he did , for 20 seconds , before he skated off the ice he was suspended for six games and was assigned two weeks in the regular army for that offense the incident also served as a portent for hasek s falling out with buffalo coach ted nolan last season hasek did not like the way the coach treated his european teammates and he did not think nolan gave him any support during his muchpublicized wrestling match with jim kelley , a buffalo news columnist hasek felt kelley had criticized him unfairly during last season s nhl playoffs hasek went public with his concerns , saying it would be better for him if nolan was gone nolan was eventually fired , along with john muckler , who was the sabres' general manager and hasek was booed unmercifully by buffalo fans at the start of this season
to many , the rotting waterfront in greenwich village is an eyesore that should be demolished to make way for the new hudson river park but to preservationists , the granite river wall is a historic treasure although ground has been broken for the park , designs are not final the hudson river park trust , which would approve the plans , has not yet been appointed preservationists say they hope that will give them time to save the bulkhead it does n't look like much , but to me it s one of our most important historic sites , a record of the waterfront s evolution , said bill hine , a neighborhood resident who labored for years to preserve the bulkhead built from the 1820 s to 1936 , from the battery to 59th street , the bulkhead defines the shoreline initial park plans called for removal of many of its massive granite capstones and redesign of the esplanade they were going to use the granite for restrooms , mr hine said that got a lot of people angry in march 1997 , the state s office of parks , recreation and historic preservation ruled that the bulkhead meets criteria for the state and national registers of historic places the bulkhead is associated with historic events , it said , and is a monumental architectural and engineering achievement that reveals historic engineering methods caroline quartararo , a spokeswoman for the empire state development corporation , which is developing the park , said the latest design preserves the capstones in april , the state historic preservation office ruled that the plan would have no adverse impact on historic resources but preservationists disagreed now they hope to persuade the army corps of engineers , whose approval is required for any work that affects the bulkhead preservationists oppose planned cutaways in the bulkhead for waterlevel balconies it s like cutting holes into a landmarked building to install picture windows where none are needed , mr hine said they also worry about plans to bore into the capstones for a new railing , and about the planned removal of belgian paving stones \( said to be ballast from european ships \) from the esplanade , which was covered in asphalt years ago mr hine said they are part of the bulkhead s setting and should be preserved on oct 22 , community board 2 agreed the area project manager for the corps' new york district , roberto barbosa , said we 're working to address these concerns , although we do n't have a timetable it will get done when it gets done david kirby photo preservationists hope they will have time to save the hudson bulkhead \( michelle v agins the new york times \) chart biography of a bulkhead 1820 s construction begins on bulkhead and piers , starting at the battery and moving north with the growth of maritime activity belgian paving stones , possibly ballast on ships from europe , covers esplanade behind bulkhead 1850 s landfill used to build west into the river , from 11th to 23d streets , creating 13th avenue , which no longer exists 1880 peak immigration period begins first and secondclass immigrants are processed on board ships thirdclass and steerage passengers are sent to riverfront warehouses for customs inspections , then ferried to castle garden \( today , castle clinton \) in the battery for legal and medical inspections 1892 immigration station on ellis island is built , replacing castle garden , but immigrants still dock along the hudson 1900 \( circa \) landfill excavated between 11th and gansevoort streets to make room for longer piers and large steamships present river wall is built 1936 bulkhead built to 59th street \( sources greenwich village society for historic preservation , ellis island museum \)
moscow , may 26 after months of highstakes maneuvers , the longawaited auction for russia s last big oil company came to an unceremonious end today no one bid in a setback for russia s economy and jittery financial markets , a deadline passed and none of the western and russian companies that had been expected to compete for the rosneft oil company submitted an offer the failure of today s auction is an embarrassment for the new prime minister , sergei kiriyenko , and his young team who had pressed ahead with the auction despite growing anxiety over the russian economy it also is likely to have a big impact on russia s financial markets keeping the stock market on its downward course , prompting investors to unload their treasury bills , and making it that much harder for the central bank to prop up the ruble the russian markets are in crisis , said a prominent investment banker , who insisted on anonymity this is one more piece of bad news for investors who are already negative on the market oil analysts had warned for weeks that falling oil prices did not make this the best time to sell off rosneft but as the economic turmoil in asia threatened to spread to russia many foreign investors treated the rosneft auction as a barometer of the nation s economy prime minister kiriyenko had insisted on a starting price of 21 billion , which is what the cashpoor russian government desperately needs to hold down its budget deficit and stabilize the ruble but tonight , mr kiriyenko reluctantly conceded defeat a new auction and presumably a lower starting price will be announced by monday or as mr kiriyenko put it , it s extremely likely there will be a reevaluation of the value of the share packet even before today s auction it seemed like russia s economic news could hardly be worse to lure nervous investors , russia s central bank raised interest rates on treasury bills today to 64 percent just last november , the interest rate was 21 percent and the government had hoped to reduce the deficit and drive the interest rate down to 14 percent the international monetary fund has yet to declare whether it will disburse the latest 700 million installment of its threeyear , 10 billion loan program russian officials have been pressing hard for the money and have even raised the idea of additional aid to buttress the ruble today president boris n yeltsin , seeking to show the government s seriousness about dealing with its budget deficit , signed an executive decree to cut the 1998 budget by 12 percent this was not the scenario the government had in mind when it announced the terms of the rosneft auction earlier this year as one of the last remaining privatizations , the oil company had attracted worldwide interest and the yeltsin government did its best to stimulate competition to boost the sales price , the kremlin lifted restrictions on foreign participation and at mr kiriyenko s suggestion , the government decided to sell 75 percent of the shares in rosneft , plus one share that meant whoever won would be able to restructure the company under russian law at first it seemed that there was plenty of potential bidders gazprom , russia s huge natural gas monopoly , was interested , as was royal dutch shell they formed a coalition with another major russian oil company , lukoil british petroleum , for its part , joined forces with russia s uneximbank , creating another potential contender meanwhile , two of russia s most powerful tycoons boris berezovsky and mikhail khodorkovsky agreed to merge their oil companies to create one of the world s largest oil producers yuksi the alliance was widely seen as way to attract a foreign partner and position the tycoons to bid for rosneft but then world oil prices fell and investors fled emerging markets because of the turmoil in asia and concerns in latin america many of the potential bidders began to set their sights on smaller deals as an alternative to acquiring rosneft lukoil has been negotiating a partnership with sidanko , the oil company owned by uneximbank british petroleum , for its part , has teamed up with rosneft to explore for oil in the sakhalin region in russia s far east the yuksi merger never got very far it was put on hold on monday despite the upheaval in the oil and financial markets , mr kiriyenko was determined that the auction should proceed and some analysts today held out hope that bids would still come in one scenario was that gazprom would submit a 21 billion bid as part of a backroom deal in which it received a break on the back taxes but today there were no deals at all the larger issue is how the failure of today s auction will affect the russian economy the government can still salvage the auction by lowering the sale price but the psychological impact on russian stock , bond and currency markets of the failure to attract bidders is more difficult to measure nervous investors have already been disposing of russian treasury bills when treasury bills mature or are sold on the secondary market investors receive the proceeds in rubles the rubles are then converted into dollars by investors eager to take their money out of russia the result is a surfeit of rubles , which puts pressure on the rubledollar exchange rate to prop up the ruble , the central bank has been dipping into its reserves to buy the currency the bank s reserves were 215 billion in november but had shrunk to 155 billion by last week of that , some 45 billion is in gold and not liquid some investors speculate the central banks' reserve may have dwindled even further in recent days seeking to calm investors and ordinary russians , mr kiriyenko staked the credibility of his government on avoiding a currency devaluation we are n't even discussing this issue , given that it must categorically not be allowed to happen , he said
london , feb 21 as finance ministers from the world s leading industrialized countries gathered here today , the united states and its european allies identified a new villain in the asian financial crisis not currency market speculators , not the crony capitalists of indonesia and korea , but the paralyzed japanese government with language not seen since the trade battles that marked the early years of the clinton administration , the president s top economic advisers have in recent days stopped just short of accusing japan of gross economic negligence by failing to stimulate its own economy and by hesitating to clean up its reeling banks , japan , with the world s secondbiggest economy , is undermining the international effort to restore stability to the rest of asia , these advisers argue lawrence h summers , the deputy treasury secretary , has told congress that japan was engaging in virtual policy a derisive reference to its repeated promises to take strong measures to spur its economy and failure to take sufficient action charlene barshefsky , the united states trade representative , declared recently that japan s efforts to end the asian crisis were woefully inadequate president clinton has repeated the message several times in letters and phone calls to japan s prime minister , ryutaro hashimoto , who in the words of a senior administration official , agrees wholeheartedly and then sits on his hands at the opening session of the finance ministers' meeting today , the dispute with japan broke into the open a confidential study of the japanese economy presented to the ministers by the international monetary fund concluded that tokyo s financial initiatives have come far too late and amount to far too little it urged immediate tax cuts and other strong action this year , and gordon brown , britain s finance minister , said that there was a good deal of support for that statement treasury secretary robert e rubin , who is normally cautious about public confrontations with tokyo , said today that japan needed to very quickly get on track he warned that as america s trade deficit increases this year because of a flood of newly inexpensive asian imports , japan faced the danger of fomenting protectionist pressure in congress the criticisms met a strong rebuttal today from japan s new finance minister , hikaru matsunaga i feel the economic measures japan has taken so far have not been appropriately evaluated , he said , telling japanese reporters that in a meeting with mr rubin this morning he had not committed himself to any further actions there is nothing new in japan s and the united states' meddling in the inner workings of each other s economic decisionmaking a decade ago , japan insisted that congress eliminate the federal budget deficit and even had a vague commitment written into an agreement between the countries , with little expectation that it would actually happen but the increasingly public nature of the attacks on japan s economic management , as opposed to its trade policy , have stunned the japanese some officials say they are unfairly being turned into a scapegoat for a regional crisis they did not start and are in no shape to end nevertheless , in private , even senior japanese officials concede that the basic charge leveled by the united states that political paralysis and indecision have prolonged japan s troubles and thus asia s carries seeds of truth we made a series of bad economic mistakes , and now it is politically difficult to reverse them , an adviser to prime minister hashimoto said recently , referring to japan s decision in april to go ahead with a large sales tax increase that stalled the economy s nascent recovery now the strategy is to muddle along , and hope that a giant collapse is n't in the offing that would wipe out everyone that is exactly the fear of the finance ministers who are here this weekend to devise a strategy to contain asia s troubles at the closed session today , the european nations were the first to criticize japan and a critical review of japan s actions dominated much of the session for the japanese , the criticisms sting after years at the fiscal pinnacle , tokyo s bureaucrats are unaccustomed to being portrayed around the world as economic incompetents in a halfhearted effort to defuse the mounting criticism , the governing liberal democratic party on friday announced new measures to spur the economy and to extend 2 billion in new loans to indonesia and other hardhit countries but in doing so , it gave its critics ammunition the measures included none of the steps that president clinton and his aides have called for tax cuts to encourage japanese consumers to buy more , and a detailed , tough plan to close failing banks and restore confidence in japan s financial system so far , japan has promised to pump money into the failing banking system , which is buried under at least 600 billion of what the japanese delicately call problem loans mr rubin has told his japanese counterparts that simply pumping cash into dying banks , without closing weak institutions and tightening oversight of the banking system , would only prolong the problems to drive the point home , some of the former american regulators who shut banks throughout texas and california during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980 s have visited tokyo in recent months , in case anyone wanted their advice they were given a polite reception , one of them reported later , fed some good meals , and offered limousines to whisk them back to the airport i got the impression they did n't want to hear about it , a former regulator said washington s main goal these days is to get japan to agree to buy a large share of exports from south korea and southeast asia , products which are vastly cheaper now that asian currencies have dropped in value by 50 percent to 80 percent so far that is not happening in fact , it is scarcely being discussed in japan , where the domestic economy s troubles overshadow those of the rest of asia the americanled rescue of mexico worked because the united states was growing fast enough to buy up whatever mexico made , robert d hormats , the vice chairman of goldman sachs international , said this week in asia , that should be japan s role as the region s leader , and its richest economy but the japanese seem oblivious to it and if asia comes unglued again , that will likely be the reason why but american officials say they have little expectation that their complaints will yield many real results finance minister matsunaga was appointed to clean up the scandalridden ministry he has little experience in global economic issues prime minister hashimoto is fending off scandals that have rocked his party and the country s banks , which makes public financing to bail them out politically unpopular moreover , mr hashimoto has promised to end deficit spending , and his aides make it clear that japan has little intention of spending the kind of money that would be required to spur the economy the stagnation of the past two years was the fault of the government , said edward j lincoln , a senior fellow at the brookings institution who also was the special economic adviser to walter f mondale when he was american ambassador to japan for a long time , the japanese were in denial , saying things were n't as bad as everyone thought now it is clear that they are that bad , and they are making asia s problems worse photo japan s finance minister , hikaru matsunaga

in the village voice requesting the help of healthy caring women to assist infertile couples though the ad did n't specify the exact nature of such help , it promised 2 , 000 to cover time and inconvenience thus began ms specht s odyssey through the fastgrowing world of assisted reproductive technologies she became an egg donor since she answered that ad in the fall of 1995 , she said , she has had her eggs harvested four times and has been paid 9 , 000 , money she used for tuition , to finance her film projects and to pay old bills on thursday , she graduated with a master s degree in fine arts at 31 , ms specht is one of the veterans of the reproductive revolution , a movement spurred by the desire of many older women to have children and the growing sophistication and acceptance of techniques like in vitro fertilization , which involves fertilizing eggs with sperm in a laboratory and placing the resulting embryo in a woman s womb such procedures are generally more successful when the egg is from a young , healthy woman , experts say and egg donation is becoming an increasingly lucrative way for young women to earn money for college and other expenses dr mark v sauer , the director of the assisted reproduction program at columbiapresbyterian medical center , said his roster of prospective egg donors has doubled in the last three months , to more than 500 the program , which had only about five donors on file as recently as 1995 , now gets 50 to 100 phone calls a week from people wanting to supply eggs dr sauer and other fertility doctors say the surge in interest seems linked to increased publicity about reproductive technologies and to a recent jump in the amount paid for the services of egg donors in february , st barnabas medical center in livingston , nj , began offering 5 , 000 , twice the going rate of most new yorkarea clinics other medical centers , including columbiapresbyterian and advanced fertility services , have matched the higher fee in the old days 10 years ago you could argue vehemently that the motivating factor for donors was altruism and concern over reproductive rights issues , dr sauer said today , the average donor seems to be a graduate student or a coed , and they are clearly doing this because of financial gain though ms specht says she did it for the money , she also says the experience made her feel useful she believes that three children have been born to women who were given her eggs her college education came in handy , she says , making her especially popular among recipients , who chose her as a donor after browsing through her personal profile and glancing at a polaroid snapshot but there were also some miserable side effects , like the time her ovaries swelled to the size of softballs , and the boyfriend who ms specht says ditched her because of the long bouts of celibacy that her regimen required ms specht also says she sometimes worries about the possible longterm effects of repeatedly pushing her body into reproductive overdrive i just have a feeling my body s had enough , she said injections , pain , risks and mood swings unlike sperm or blood donors , women involved in egg programs undergo weeks of blood tests and hormone injections as well as a minor surgical procedure the extraction of the eggs with a needle while the donor is under heavy sedation the hormones can cause bloating , headaches , hot flashes , cramps , enlarged ovaries and mighty mood swings there is some risk , and the more you do it , the more you compound the risk , said dr jamie grifo , director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at new york university medical center you can get into bleeding and infections those things are rare but unfortunately they happen doctors also say the longterm effects of the hormone treatments are unknown , although some suspect that the drugs involved may be linked to ovarian cancer beyond the potential physical complications , there are ethical issues germany , japan and other nations forbid egg donation israel allows only limited use of donated eggs a major concern is avoiding consanguinity , a fancy word for the socially taboo and possibly genetically disastrous mating of blood relatives though experts say it is extremely unlikely that two people spawned from the same donor might meet and mate , most ethicists believe there should be a limit on the number of embryos created by one woman s eggs the american society of reproductive medicine has suggested a limit of 10 , but no federal or state law imposes such restrictions

what if the owners of new york city s myriad sex shops , topless joints and triplex arcades all pooled their resources to make one jawdropping video about the scandalous conduct of the giuliani administration \? and what if it were so secret that absolutely no one had been permitted to watch it apart from a handful of lawyers \? what reporter would n't be just panting to slip it into her vcr \? this columnist certainly was , only to find herself rebuffed by lawyers for the porn shop owners the most they would offer her were some grainy 3by5 s shot directly from the video even these images , they assured her , would be shocking enough for more than two years now , the city has been trying to enforce new zoning laws aimed specifically at new york s many sex shops and for more than two years , the city s sex shop owners have been fighting back , winning stay after stay last week , they won another extension from a federal appeals court that will keep them in business in their current locations for at least another four weeks throughout the wrangling , one of the central issues has been the fate of the shops that the new zoning rules will close down the city s official position is that these shops will be able to relocate but the sex shop owners contend that this claim is a legal fiction the city s real goal , they say , is to drive them out of business so , staying true to form , the city s pornographers commissioned their yettobereleased video an epic , 17hour affair , it features no orgies , no whips and no nudity just a whole lot of empty lots and oil tank farms scattered across the five boroughs its point is to show that many indeed most of the sites that the city has reserved for sex shops are simply unsuitable for making a living off smut to suggest that the people of new york have reasonable access to adult places of entertainment by traveling to the wetlands of staten island or the far reaches of the bronx is an absurdity , said herald price fahringer , the lawyer for the sex shop owners and the sole possessor of the video the commercial viability of the sites is a crucial matter because on their reasonableness hinges the legality of the city s entire zoning plan courts have ruled antismut zoning plans in other cities unconstitutional when they did not provide enough viable locations for those shops already in existence and some that might spring up in the future thus , city officials are at least publicly committed to the claim that the zoning plan is not intended to reduce smut just shift it around asked whether the zoning plan would allow all 150 of the city s existing sex shops to stay in business , albeit in new locations , leonard koerner , the city s chief assistant corporation counsel , responded , absolutely he said the city had counted more than 500 possible sites , which , he added , was more than enough still , some city officials , most notably mayor rudolph w giuliani , have had considerable trouble sticking to the script just after the state s highest court reached a 6to0 decision in the city s favor last month , the mayor positively crowed about the very artful way that the city had left a bare minimum of space for sex shops and pushed to the limit restrictions on where they could operate and he bragged about the hit that the shops would soon be taking our eventual analysis of it is that it will reduce the number in the city to something like 20 or 30 , whereas previously there had been over 200 , he said lawyers for the shop owners admit that the city s plan leaves hundreds of sites where it is theoretically possible to operate a sex shop but , they point out , shops in general and sex shops in particular are not especially theoretical enterprises since this columnist got to see only selected stills from their video , it is hard for her to know what impression the entire epic would make but of the several dozen permissible sites that were pictured , none seemed the kind of place she herself would want to try to sell candy underwear from they included the aquarium parking lot in coney island , a rubblestrewn lot in the hunts point section of the bronx , a nature preserve on staten island and a police department vehicle pound in college point , queens disappointingly , there was no shot of the new york times building , which , theoretically at least , is also available
asbury park , nj , nov 10 in the end , none of it counts for the blue bishops football team not derico bridges s lightning dash for the end zone to seal a comefrombehind victory in the high school team s closest game of the season , won by a point not those fourhour practices stretching till dusk , the merciless speed drills and scrimmages , all done without the benefits of the weight room that opponents take for granted not the associate coach bill hill s clever defenses and other tactics , copied from his pro days playing for the dallas cowboys and cleveland browns and perhaps worst of all , not the team s average 24point victory margin in building an 80 record and an almost sure shot at a state championship after an 18year drought the blue bishops had to forfeit their entire season because two academically ineligible players were allowed to play , so the joyfully earned sweat gave way to tears in the locker room and around this economically depressed city and if that were not bad enough , freehold high school , an 08 team that was scheduled to play asbury park on nov 14 in a consolation game for teams that did not make the state playoffs , forfeited the game , fearing that the mismatch with a team that is 80 on the field might result in injury to its players the heartache is felt so acutely in this city , 60 miles from new york , that even the usually relentlessly cheerful chamber of commerce concedes that it has seen better days poor planning , high crime , competition from other jersey shore resort towns and racial disturbances have all conspired to create a ghost town of weedy lots and shantylike stores and motels along the milesquare city s oceanfront lifeline redevelopment plans come and go , but buildings like the palace amusements remain , rotting , its peeling letters on the ocean side spelling alace amus en the grinning clown face painted on the side now seems more mocking than mirthful even the city s connection to the rock singer bruce springsteen is destined for the nostalgia heap the stone pony , the bar where he and members of his e street band jammed and played impromptu concerts in the 70 s and 80 s , closed in september to be renovated as a mellower dance club called vinyl in the midst of this depression , the blue bishops were something to be proud of , to restore hope they were like heroes here , said tom hayes , president of the 115member chamber of commerce , which is planning a community rally for the team before its final game , the annual thanksgiving day contest against archrival neptune high , undefeated and playoff bound it s not about sports it s about a town down on its luck at the moment and the fact that people cared now , the team has been turned into an object of contention and , to some , shame this is the second consecutive year that asbury park high s football team has had victories reversed and its chance at a championship scuttled last year , the team had to forfeit two games in which it played a student who did not have enough academic credits and was therefore ineligible the forfeits changed a 63 record to 45 and pushed the team out of playoff contention as they did last year , officials blame administrative errors for this year s lapses when i first heard , i thought somebody was lying , said mr bridges , a senior running back who has been courted by several colleges , including rutgers and the universities of michigan and kentucky i thought , 'not again , not a second year in a row' it hurt it hurt all the kids and the city in the aftermath of the latest setback , a city with an estimated population of almost 19 , 000 that had found common spirit in the team is sagging once again asbury players and students are angry , adults are pointing fingers at one another , and some people in the community are reassessing the role of athletics at an academically poor school wesley mclean , a senior who plays drums in the marching band , expressed the prevailing sentiment of students it s just not right the reversal of fortune adds to the muck in a school year already filled with it the very stadium to which the blue bishops returned this school year after a 2 million renovation the team played its home games on the road for more than a year is the subject of an investigation by the monmouth county prosecutor , john kaye , that has led to the indictments of the former school board president , the former school board attorney and a local contractor on bidrigging and related charges the contractor , robert sullivan , was also charged with attempted murder in the stabbing of a construction worker who was a witness in the investigation , said paul feldman , an assistant monmouth county prosecutor mr sullivan and kim a fallenz , the former board attorney , have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail james famularo , the former board president , has not yet entered a plea , and his lawyer , robert s bonney , did not return phone calls this week the investigation continues , mr feldman said earlier this fall , a judge in state superior court in freehold removed three board members , including mr famularo , after concluding that their grand jury testimony included admissions that they stole board money the board members deny wrongdoing and are appealing their removals
washington , july 24 with marion s barry jr now a lame duck mayor , the district of columbia appears headed toward a new political era as elections approach , with a primary in september unlike in recent years , marked by financial turbulence and incessant finger pointing to ascribe blame , the city is on the rebound with a projected surplus this year of 231 million and municipal services that are rapidly improving that would suggest a certain comity among the five democrats running to succeed mr barry , whose remarkable victory in 1994 after a sixmonth prison term on a drug charge brought him a fourth fouryear term but that is not necessarily the case with scant differences among the leading candidates on such critical issues as public safety , economic development and education , they are devoting considerable energies arguing over what could become the central issue of the primary campaign who played what role in the city s fall and rise \? as a question that touches on the everpresent issue of race in district politics , it has drawn a sharp distinction between the three members of the city council who are running harold brazil , kevin p chavous and jack evans and anthony a williams , the former chief financial officer , all of whom are lawyers the fifth candidate , jeffrey gildenhorn , a businessman who has proposed some of the most radical ideas for the city , like legalizing drugs and prostitution , is not expected to mount much of a challenge as the apparent frontrunners , mr williams and mr chavous present voters with the clearest choices mr williams was directly accountable to the financial control board created by congress three years ago to oversee the city until it balanced its budget four consecutive years with another surplus projected for 1999 , the board could shut down in 2001 unless congress decides to extend it to many district residents , particularly blacks and lowwage earners who are sensitive to issues of selfrule and full representation in congress , which the district does not have , the control board and mr williams represent a disrespectful occupation force that has marginalized elected officials more than any of his council colleagues , mr chavous has exploited that perception , criticizing the control board for a heavyhanded approach to running the city and campaigning as a populist who would work to eliminate it even sooner than the law allows in that role , he is the mostly likely candidate to pick up former barry supporters but for other residents , including many whites and middleclass people , the control board and mr williams have been a salvation , implementing fiscal and management changes that elected officials have avoided or ignored the initiatives included hiring a new police chief , installing a board of trustees to run the school system and hiring a city manager to run virtually all city agencies the reaction would appear to reflect at least grudging support for mr williams i would have thought tony would have had a much tougher time than he has , said ron walters , a professor of political science at the university of maryland and an expert on the district you do n't hear much outcry from citizens , like when the board took over the school system there s a level of resignation to this place people think it s necessary to have these changes even if they 're hard to swallow and that appears to be working well for mr williams , who steadfastly defends decisions he made as the financial officer as measures to save the city from insolvency tough choices had to be made , he said at a candidates forum on wednesday night but now that the budget s in balance , we 're in a situation to invest and build yet it also plays conveniently to the other challengers , allowing them to defend their own actions , which have often conflicted with the control board at the forum , mr chavous spoke proudly of his opposition to an economic plan approved by congress and the white house that is saving the district millions by shifting its pension liability , courts and prisons and other functions to the federal government but at the cost of the government s annual subsidy to the district you really need to take a look at who has stood up to the control board and congress , mr chavous said i 've stood up mr williams , on the other hand , hailed the plan as a wise commitment by the federal government at a time the city could no longer afford such responsibilities while mr chavous might have an easy time selling his differences with mr williams , distinguishing himself from mr brazil and mr evans could prove more difficult all three have outlined their visions for the city , but none is dramatically different from the others that , too , could work to mr williams s advantage if mr chavous and mr brazil split the black vote , said mark plotkin , a local political analyst , mr williams , who is black , could win if he draws white voters from mr evans , who is white the democratic winner is likely to face another member of the city council , carol schwartz , a white republican who won 34 percent of the vote against mr barry in 1986 and 42 percent against him in 1994 photo jeffrey gildenhorn answering a question at a candidates night at the university of the district of columbia the other candidates , from left , are harold brazil , kevin p chavous , jack evans and anthony a williams \( justin lane for the new york times \)
menlo park , calif when people on wall street think these days about the entrepreneur jim clark founder of silicon graphics in 1982 and cofounder of netscape communications in 1994 their thoughts most likely involve his third startup , the healtheon corporation that is because healtheon , an online service for the health care industry , is planning a widely anticipated public offering in late september but mr clark , chairman of healtheon and a major investor in it , seems nearly as intent on a separate autumn launching , set for midnovember that is when the 155foot sailboat hyperion , a highly computerized vessel that mr clark began planning in 1995 , is to start its maiden voyage from a port in amsterdam , to the caribbean island of st barthelemy i 've been working harder on this project than i have any time since the beginning of netscape , mr clark , a 54yearold , 6foot4inch lanky blond , said in a recent interview in a modest office here in a dissonant setting above a jenny craig weight loss center , enveloped in the fastfood aromas of a nearby arby s roast beef restaurant though work on the hyperion has involved long hours lately and frequent trips to the netherlands by chartered jet , mr clark shows no signs of travel fatigue as he speaks excitedly about the yacht , which outside experts estimate is costing him 30 million to build \( he declined to discuss such matters \) it s an rv a luxurious rv , mr clark said a selfcontained , extremely sophisticated vehicle made for a harsh environment and it has the most complex nonindustrial automation system that s ever been built if this last superlative sounds like a sales pitch , someday it just might be more than the expensive hobby of a man with an estimated net worth of 600 million , the hyperion has begat yet another clark startup seascape communications , a venture in which he and three former silicon graphics engineers have been developing the technological guts of the sailboat someday , mr clark said , some of their work may find its way into marketable products because no commercial system existed for the completely computerized operating and navigational system that mr clark had envisioned for hyperion , he decided to create his own i had a particular idea in mind , mr clark said i wrote 20 percent of the hyperion s software code i built an underlying set of tools , and the engineers used that as a nucleus the result is an aluminumhulled vessel housing 20 powerful silicon graphics computers , 37 miles of network cables and 500 billion bytes of storage for an electronic log that will automatically record everything that happens with the ship , from changing the oil to hoisting sails totaling 13 , 000 square feet jim is shooting over the horizon and our objective is to meet him on the horizon , said jan bokxem , who as technical project manager is overseeing the installation of the ship s computer systems at the 114yearold royal huisman shipyard in the netherlands the industry is n't ready yet for some of what he s requesting everything on hyperion needs to be controlled and interfaced to computers the ship s data and control systems are automated on a central server computer , where all monitoring data is formatted and entered into a data base that becomes part of the ship s memory the idea is for this data base to help teach the ship , its captain and crew to sail better , using past experience to determine optimal sail settings for specific wind conditions , for example \( not that mr clark is expecting hyperion s captain , alan prior , who has been a crew member in the america s cup and whitbread races , to require much tutoring \) each of the touchscreen computer terminals throughout hyperion will offer passengers amenities like activating towel heaters in bathrooms , selecting wine from the cellar , or choosing a cd from the 700plus titles in a music library with selections from beethoven to u2 but most noteworthy may be hyperion s bridge the control deck , which on most yachts is where the various gauges and monitoring instruments are arrayed on many modern ships , these devices tend to be a hodgepodge of systems from various vendors , with readouts that are difficult to consolidate to provide a single look at overall operations by contrast , hyperion s streamlined bridge has six 20inchdiagonal computer screens displaying virtual instruments designed to look like conventional ones and using software that can automate all of these monitoring functions and integrate them into a single operational system this approach makes it possible for the captain on the bridge , the owner from a remote location and the crew members from various positions on the ship to have access to the information and to give commands assuming they have personalidentification numbers that authorize them to do so even though hyperion s system is sophisticated and complex , it s simple in terms of what the user sees , mr clark said simplicity is the cornerstone of everything technical
the cars and buses can chug through now the regulars can go back to the spa , the hair salon , the wine shop and madison the cat who was holed up in his apartment without food for almost a week can eat and play to his heart s content on its face , madison avenue is back to normal , two months after falling bricks from an office tower closed the street and forced residents to leave their homes on dec 7 but a closer look at the block most affected the west side of madison avenue between 54th and 55th streets reveals something quite different ask barbara spiegel , an actress who has lived at 534 madison for 25 years she has not been allowed to return to her damaged home and has missed callbacks and auditions ask dan reading , a salesman for pfizer inc who had worked out of his apartment at no 536 he , too , has missed crucial appointments , including a dinner at lutece with potential clients or ask m david magnotta , owner of caviar russe at 538 madison his restaurant , which opened in june to glowing reviews , lost more than 100 , 000 in caviar that spoiled after the building was closed it has yet to reopen because of damage to the roof that has yet to be repaired and resulting water damage we have been held hostage , mr magnotta said we wait , and we wait , and we wait some more i can be as angry as i want , but it s not going to be constructive it s a helpless feeling seven people have still not been allowed to return to their homes because of the damage wrought by the bricks which fell from a side of no 540 , a 39story tower , tumbling down onto four much smaller buildings and none of the affected tenants or businesses have been reimbursed for their outofpocket expenses , now totaling more than 20 , 000 for some individuals i'm kind of depressed , frankly , ms spiegel said after staying at several friends' apartments , she is now living in a spartan apartment provided by the macklowe organization , which owns 540 madison all of my rituals , all of my habits , all of my needs , all the things that i do to make sense of my life it s all been disrupted things may change today for ms spiegel and the other displaced residents , who live on the top floors of 534 and 536 madison the city s buildings department plans to inspect the four apartments , and if there is no imminent danger , the residents will be allowed to move back soon , said ted birkhahn , a spokesman for the department it is another story at 538 madison it may be months before any of the businesses there can return , mr birkhahn warned for the tenants , the point person for their troubles has been kevin e neuner , a senior vice president of macklowe , which bought 540 madison in 1996 but for this article , mr neuner said in a brief telephone conversation , i'm not in a position to comment when the bricks began falling on dec 7 , emergency officials quickly ushered residents , shoppers and shopkeepers out of the smaller , adjacent buildings on both sides of the street mr reading did not take his car keys or his glasses james dodwell wore a pair of khaki shorts and did not take his wallet tim curran did not even think about taking his tabby , madison ms spiegel left her apartment in just a robe and slippers she was lucky only 15 minutes after she was evacuated , a brick plunged through her bedroom and landed on her bed at first they were told they would be out for a couple of hours , at most on monday , they said tuesday , said izabell anton , the owner of advanced skin day spa , at 532 madison on tuesday , they said wednesday and i was wondering , this week \?

kofi annan , please call h carl mccall his office has some money for you and not just for mr annan , the united nations secretary general mr mccall , the new york state comptroller , has money for the yankees' outfielder darryl strawberry , former mayor david n dinkins , gov george e pataki and millions of other people whose forgotten bank accounts , uncashed travelers' checks , utility refunds and lost stocks have been turned over to the state the money is waiting to be claimed in the state abandoned property fund , which was established in 1943 and has reached a record 416 billion , a sum larger than the budgets of many nations the 15 million accounts range from the 700 , 000 that a new yorker has left unclaimed , to small bank accounts forgotten by college students who have moved out of the area with no forwarding address , to 8 to 24 refunds for about 15 , 000 tickets for a concert scheduled for the nassau coliseum on aug 22 , 1977 , that was canceled after the featured performer elvis presley died it is my job to collect unclaimed funds and then give them back to the people who deserve them , mr mccall , the state comptroller , said in an interview if you look at the record over the years , you see that we take in much more money than we give out we are trying to change that under new york law , companies have to turn over money they are holding for consumers , like dormant bank accounts and uncashed refund checks , to the state after two to five years , depending on the type of account last year alone , the office received about 304 million in unclaimed funds , but returned only 60 million publishing a list of the names of account holders annually , as required by state law , was not enough to prompt people to fill out claim forms to regain their money , so mr mccall placed the unclaimed funds database on a web site \( http www osc state ny us \) , which has logged 27 million searches since its introduction last july and since this spring , the comptroller s office has operated booths at high pedestrian traffic areas like train stations and racetracks to try to reunite people with their assets this steppedup campaign has brought mr mccall attention , praise and the political boost that comes with mailing out checks , signed by the comptroller , to voters in an election year mr mccall , a democrat , faces bruce a blakeman , the presiding officer of the nassau county legislature , in the november election it is a good thing they are doing by making these appearances , because a lot of people ca n't make it to an office to pick up forms , said linda ramous , a chase bank employee who stopped by the booth at pennsylvania station recently and found that the state had stock dividends in her dead aunt s name because of the web site , the number of claims has tripled to 60 , 000 in fiscal year 1997 from about 20 , 000 in fiscal year 1996 , said theresa bourgeois , a spokeswoman for the comptroller s office but the more people who file , the slower the processing gets mr mccall increased the number of employees handling unclaimed funds to 128 from 116 in january , but claims can take as much as five months to process all 50 states have some method of collecting and returning unclaimed funds , but none of them have collected anywhere near as much money as new york , rich in financial institutions that have to turn over forgotten accounts to the state the 416 billion while small potatoes compared with the 100 billion in state pension funds that mr mccall also controls exceeds or rivals the annual budgets of 23 states california follows new york with an unclaimed property fund of about 23 billion according to the national association of state treasurers , there are about 12 million unclaimed accounts in connecticut totaling 260 million and about 2 million unclaimed accounts in new jersey worth 659 million the state treasurer s office in connecticut returned a record 5 million in unclaimed property last year , said patrick o'neil , a spokesman who added that his state was the first to list names of account holders on the internet in 1995 new jersey returned about 16 million last year , said stephen sylvester , the unclaimed funds administrator with the division of taxation most states use the interest made from unclaimed funds to cover the costs of their unclaimed property operations or for education or economic development programs new york , new jersey and connecticut allow owners to collect limited amounts of interest on some funds claimants must provide state officials with proof of their identity and a connection to the address listed on the account people can also make claims for dead relatives the governor discovered a modest windfall in the last few weeks when he was contacted by an official in the comptroller s office zenia mucha , a spokeswoman for mr pataki , said she thought his unclaimed funds were related to a bank account at a former home in saratoga springs , ny he has already filled out the forms for the claim , she said he does not have much money in there , i can assure you of that

paris , jan 23 emile zola was not the first french writer to speak out on the political issues of his day but more than anything done by , say , voltaire or victor hugo before him , it was zola s dramatic j'accuse , proclaimed 100 years ago this month in the infamous dreyfus affair , that inspired this country s writers to start using their prestige as artists as a way of influencing public opinion in an open letter to president felix faure that filled the front page of l'aurore on jan 13 , 1898 , zola accused the french army of falsifying evidence of treason against a jewish army officer , capt alfred dreyfus , who was serving a life term in prison when dreyfus was finally exonerated , zola s gesture became part of french history and the tradition of ecrivains engages committed writers was born since then , french authors who have assumed the right , even the duty , to play politics are legion , from andre gide and louis aragon to jeanpaul sartre and bernardhenri levy french society , with its cartesian penchant for dialectics , has also come to expect writers and philosophers to serve as its conscience on troubling domestic or global issues even governments have conceded intellectuals a place in the political arena yet if france is the cradle of the ecrivains engages , the tradition exists elsewhere , notably in europe and latin america , but also occasionally in africa and asia today , any list of living writers with strong political identities would have to include aleksandr solzhenitsyn , vaclav havel , gunter grass , dario fo , nadine gordimer , wole soyinka , gabriel garcia marquez , octavio paz , mario vargas llosa and carlos fuentes in places like argentina or mexico or nigeria , without the writer there is often no one to speak out , explained mr fuentes , a mexican novelist who has often taken controversial political positions , not least in his frequent criticism of united states policy toward latin america whether in eastern europe , latin america or africa , it is tyranny that has most often drawn writers into politics , which perhaps best explains why the contribution of writers and other intellectuals to public debate in this century has been minimal in the united states , britain and other longdemocratic countries the closest we came was between the late 1930 s and the early 1970 s with the new york intellectuals , said tony judt , director of the remarque institute at new york university and author of past imperfect french intellectuals 19441956 \( university of california , 1993 \) but they did n't have a national audience , and no one in washington was listening to them or debating with them they were talking to each other today , american politicians may welcome endorsements by , and photo opportunities with , movie stars and popular singers but writers and intellectuals with political agendas wield little influence over the public in countries with dictatorships or weak democratic systems , however , prominent writers often enjoy moral authority , even before publics that have not read their work in cases where books are censored , the impact may be principally abroad , none more than mr solzhenitsyn s denunciation of soviet forced labor camps in the gulag archipelago and when writers are forced into exile , like guillermo cabrera infante in cuba in the 1960 s , ariel dorfman in chile in the 1970 s and , more recently , mr soyinka , a nobel literature laureate from nigeria , their very exile serves as a protest in a few cases , writers have gone from opinionmakers to active politicians leopold senghor , senegal s longtime ruler , was a prominent poet in czechoslovakia , the velvet revolution swept mr havel , a dissident playwright , to the presidency in 1989 \( this week he was reelected president of the czech republic \) mr garcia marquez has resisted several attempts to draft him as a candidate for colombia s presidency , while mr vargas llosa did run for peru s presidency , and was narrowly beaten , in 1990 for mr vargas llosa , however , the bruising experience convinced him that writers should remain writers , albeit writers with political views it was a great waste of energy and enthusiasm , because our effort to improve democracy did not work out , he said today , peru is a dictatorship , camouflaged and disguised , but nonetheless a dictatorship i would not repeat it , but i do n't regret trying still , with freely elected governments now installed in most of latin america and the former soviet bloc , and with the collapse of communism imploding the traditional leftright debate among western european intellectuals , the anniversary of j'accuse offers an occasion for gauging whether writers still have a political role to play except under exceptional circumstances in countries like algeria and nigeria , while exiled writers have little influence over local political situations , they do still serve as witnesses in mexico , where intellectuals have traditionally been close to political power , writers like mr fuentes , as much through newspaper articles and interviews as through their fiction , can also throw light on the country s confused passage from oneparty rule to a multiparty system
brookline , mass the impeachment of their president was not exactly the christmas present most americans expected \( or wanted \) this year this is the time of year when we sing of peace and harmony , not of discord and strife the rancorous ugliness of our public life seemed even uglier in contrast to the holiday spirit of our private lives president clinton and his republican critics in the house of representatives seemed to inhabit two different moral worlds despite their disagreements , however , they did have one thing in common both went out of their way to try to destroy the institutions that had been sustaining them mr clinton has so disgraced the presidency that he was unable to make his recent public statements from the oval office , because that is where his adulterous affair was carried on but the rush to judgment of the house republicans who showed so little respect for the constitution , bipartisanship and the traditions of the house itself demonstrated that mr clinton had no monopoly on tearing down institutions the lust for sex may not be the same as the lust for vengeance , but both corroded the chance to leave behind stronger institutions these sorry events should remind us why institutions are important in the first place to live in a world in which institutions matter is to accept that we often do best if we subordinate our immediate instincts for the sake of getting along with those whose cooperation we may require someday that very restraint is what washington lost altogether in the last year alas , there are signs that ordinary americans are equally impatient with any limitation on their right to do as they please consequently many of their social institutions like the family , the public schools and political parties have been damaged as much as the presidency or congress that is why sentiment is growing , for example , for private schools or even home schooling and why professional athletes insist on free agency and why it sometimes seems americans will not be satisfied until everyone has his or her personal religious denomination institutions show signs of decay for reasons as various as the culture of divorce and the decline of union membership political parties no longer raise money for the candidates they choose candidates choose themselves , raise their own money and then consider whether to turn a small portion over to their parties even businesses have lost their institutional character , as top executives are rewarded for hollowing out the insides of their companies or shipping their production abroad americans , who admire freedom in the economic realm , have come to expect it from their institutions , too why should they do something just because their spouses , union leaders , school administrators , political bosses or corporate employers tell them to \? yet life in the absence of strong institutions promotes its own form of discontent consider the case of political parties weaker parties were supposed to produce stronger citizens put an end to the smokefilled rooms , the thinking went , and replace them with primaries in which many more voters could participate instead , there is less participation than ever true , the old parties were often dictatorial but what has replaced them is anything but democratic candidates no longer visit schools and workplaces instead they deliver their messages from television studios and auction themselves to the highest bidders the voters , fed up with the whole process , stay home and tell pundits how much they hate politics and the journalists who report it the same cycle of discontent is occurring all across the institutional spectrum viewers respond to the glut of television stations by switching between them so rapidly that they are effectively watching none of them parents demand that schools cater to their children in a certain way , then threaten to take them out of the public system , thereby undermining the ability of those schools to exist lost in the rush to decertify our institutions is the recognition that we sometimes have to team up with others to get what we want and that institutions can expand as well as contract our freedom to live as we choose this explains why there are signs , however faint , that institutions are beginning to recover their strength divorce rates have started to decline , labor associations are beginning to awaken , and business consultants now speak of the loyalty effects generated by longterm employees and faithful customers even in politics , expensive campaigns larded with negative advertisements no longer appear to work , making the return of locally rooted parties a possibility , at least yet at the very time we are starting to rebuild the institutions around us , our leaders have gone out of their way to tarnish the institutions around them this should remind americans that they cannot look to washington for much help institutions can be helped indirectly by government efforts by churches to reduce the influence of gangs , for example , probably would do better with some government money than with none but institutions must spring from the energy of those working within them in addition , the partisanship that pollutes washington should be a warning to us about the danger of supporting only those institutions that suit our own ideologies conservatives want to strengthen the family and churches institutions they like but not unions liberals talk about the need for stronger unions or communities but are reluctant to endorse traditional families or to rely on religious institutions to further public objectives we must recognize that for any institution to thrive , all legitimate institutions must thrive commitments in one area teach respect for commitments in other areas bad families make bad citizens and vice versa tocqueville observed that a proliferation of associations made democracy work in 19thcentury america influenced by him , we assumed that institutions would flourish naturally in recent years , as the counterculture joined forces with the corporate culture to celebrate choice at the expense of institutional loyalty , we learned the hard way how fragile social institutions can be we cannot go back to a time when institutions stifled initiative and foreclosed possibility but surely we can find a way to recognize that sometimes the integrity of our institutions requires that we pause and reflect on our choices as we do , we may even teach our leaders a lesson photo \( scott stowell \)

the house of representatives takes up the issue of campaign finance reform again today under pressure from principled members of their own party , the republican leaders have dropped some of the tactics used to block consideration of the shaysmeehan bill , but it still has a long way to go before it gets the fair upordown vote house leaders promised the bill named for christopher shays , a connecticut republican , and martin meehan , a democrat from massachusetts would ban the soft money that allows unlimited specialinterest contributions to political parties these contributions have rendered meaningless the watergateera laws limiting contributions to candidates opponents have been trying to smother shaysmeehan in proposed amendments that would delay final consideration indefinitely but last week , the sponsors and the house leadership announced an agreement that would reduce the number of amendments to 55 total debate will be limited to 17 hours , a deadline that should bring about a final vote before the house recesses aug 7 passage by that date is essential if the measure is to have any chance of getting through the senate this term but shaysmeehan faces a second set of obstacles under a rule imposed by the house leadership , the bill also must get more support than a number of competing campaign finance bills waiting on the runway only then can it move on to the senate , where trent lott , the majority leader , is equally determined to thwart the will of the majority and stave off any serious campaign finance reform this week the bill will have to survive a barrage of amendments , none of which deserve passage some are intended to weaken its provisions many are simply nuisance amendments , like the one to embarrass the clinton administration by outlawing the already illegal practice of offering access to air force one for campaign donations bill thomas , house oversight committee chairman and no friend to campaign finance reform , deserves some credit for working out the timelimit agreement but members of the republican leadership led by tom delay , the majority whip , seem unshaken in their determination to kill shaysmeehan by hook or by crook speaker newt gingrich and dick armey , the majority leader , have to come up with a timetable that will allow the vote they have promised before the fastapproaching recess if mr gingrich and mr armey break their pledge , they will be exposed to their membership as legislators whose word is absolutely useless they will also be the men republicans will blame when the slim majority goes home to run for reelection and has to explain why the party went to such lengths to protect the rights of bigmoney special interests to influence elections
new orleans , july 7 five years ago , the workers at avondale shipyard voted to join a union , with hundreds of them cheering wildly outside the company s headquarters along the mississippi river when the vote count was announced today , there is still no union at the shipyard the 50 , 000 pages of documents furious charges and countercharges stacked in the offices of the national labor relations board are evidence of what took place instead one of the longest , most heavily litigated unionization fights in the board s history at a time when labor unions nationwide are stepping up efforts to organize millions of workers , labor leaders and even some government officials point to the avondale battle as proof that the nation s labor laws are cumbersome and replete with loopholes , and that companies intent on keeping unions out have become more adroit at exploiting them as part of a new campaign to show that stubborn employers can make a mockery of the right to organize , the nation s labor leaders say they are using avondale as exhibit a to show how companies dismiss union supporters and use other illegal tactics to beat back organizing drives these leaders complain that employers are abusing the law to create delays because they realize that organizing drives can fizzle in the five years it can take for courts to order a company to recognize a union that won a unionization election federal officials , acknowledging the problem , say scores of unionorganizing cases are caught up in this legal limbo , as companies file appeal after appeal these include overnite trucking , which is fighting a teamsters' organizing drive at its terminals nationwide , and the santa fe hotel and casino in las vegas , nev , which has litigated for five years against an election victory by hotel workers many avondale workers say they desperately need a union to raise wages at the lowestpaying major shipyard in the nation and to end avondale s high rate of fatal accidents according to the union , 30 workers have died in accidents since 1972 these unhappy factors , the workers say , explain why they voted 1 , 954 to 1 , 632 in june 1993 to join the new orleans metal trades council , notwithstanding avondale s intense antiunion campaign in april 1997 , two years after a hearing officer upheld the election , the labor board certified the metal trades council as the union for avondale s workers , which would normally bring contract negotiations instead , avondale refused to recognize the union or bargain with it and appealed the vote results to a federal court of appeals avondale industries , the nation s largest nonunion shipbuilder , asserts that the vote was tainted by fraud the company , which beat back past organizing drives , insists that unionization would push up production costs and cause it to lose contracts fred feinstein , the labor board s general counsel , said the avondale case had exposed many weak links in the system he acknowledges that budget cuts , the mountain of papers and months of hearings have taxed the board s staff to the hilt it s hard to take issue with the notion that it s frustrating that an election that took place five years ago still has n't come to conclusion , mr feinstein said it s something we 're looking at as an example of the process not being what it should be in the avondale case , a judge with the national labor relations board found that in the company s zeal to keep the union out , it had violated the law more than 70 times , dismissing , for example , 28 workers because they supported the union even though those workers were dismissed four or more years ago , none have been reinstated because avondale is appealing the process to put a union in takes too long , said harry lee thompson , a pipefitter who began working at avondale in 1969 , after returning from the vietnam war five years is too much it s a slap in the face of the working man the aflcio is pointing to avondale as the nation s leading corporate outlaw for the way it has kept unionization efforts at bay the avondale struggle is important because it s a group of workers who have tried so hard for so long to form a union , and they 've had everything thrown in their way , said john j sweeney , president of the aflcio we 're seeing the rule of labor law becoming the rule of hypocrisy corporations that pretend to be upstanding citizens and live off taxpayer money violate fundamental laws that are supposed to protect workers many avondale workers point to what they view as an unfortunate contradiction officials from one federal agency the labor board found avondale guilty of egregious misconduct and an outrageous and pervasive number of labor law violations yet those at another federal department the navy recently awarded avondale a 685 million contract to build amphibious assault craft , with the possibility of 5 billion more avondale workers often say they need a union to get fair wages and fair treatment at the shipyard , which looks like a giant erector set in the shadow of the huey p long bridge wages range from 8 an hour for the leastskilled workers \( 16 , 600 a year \) to 1350 an hour \( 28 , 000 a year \) for welders and pipefitters , including those with 25 years on the job at the ingalls shipyard in mississippi , which is unionized , the top pay rate is 2 an hour higher
on jan 8 , as international banks discussed extending repayment on a pile of troubled loans threatening south korea s solvency , j p morgan company took the unusual step of notifying several big investors via email about how well the meeting was proceeding south korea s economic wellbeing hinged on the talks , and investors and traders worldwide hungered for potentially profitable tidbits about the negotiations although two news services had already reported details about the talks at citicorp s new york headquarters , banks would not issue a public statement about the negotiations until two hours after j p morgan first clued in its own clients j p morgan declined to comment on the matter , but bond traders said the bank had decided to brief investors because goldman , sachs company , a financial adviser to the south korean government , had told its own clients the negotiations were going poorly moreover , goldman , sachs reportedly told clients that j p morgan s plan for a big south korean bond offering designed to raise more money was doomed goldman , sachs denied those allegations our traders and salespeople are not allowed to predict or engage in speculation regarding possible future actions by south korean governmental or banking authorities , said john rogers , a goldman , sachs spokesman while some of the rancor and backbiting swirling around the south korean debt negotiations is simply part of the competitive jousting that typifies wall street , it also reflects how much investment banks value winning the lucrative role of leading a multibilliondollar bond offering by south korea on wednesday , major international banks agreed to swap 24 billion in shortterm loans owed by south korea s banks for new debt that does not come due for one to three years banks that had agreed to extend repayment on loans in earlier agreements were , on average , granted interest rates only slightly higher than those agreed to on wednesday , so there is good reason for optimism about the new plan s broad adoption but the agreement still requires signatures from more than 100 banks moreover , leading industrial countries that have pledged 8 billion in aid to south korea will not release those funds until all banks have signed on and south korea has demonstrated it can raise fresh funds the treasury secretary , robert e rubin , reiterated those conditions yesterday , saying the agreement by itself was insufficient and that south korea must do more to refinance its shortterm debts but optimism generated by the agreement contributed to a strong rallyin the south korean stock market , which reopened today after a threeday lunar new year holiday the main index rose 744 percent to the best level in three months if enough of south korea s lenders approve the agreement , the next crucial step for the country is to raise new money , primarily to refresh the central bank s depleted foreign exchange reserves south korea now has about 12 billion in usable foreign exchange reserves , up from about 9 billion at the end of last year , but far below the 30 billion the country had at the end of 1996 south korea hopes to raise its foreign currency reserves to about 40 billion by the end of 1998 , and the most likely vehicle for doing that will be either one , or a series , of bond offerings getting that business is a prize most wall street firms began aiming for in december , when the parameters of south korea s economic crisis first became publicly apparent at that time , every major investment bank made a bid to be retained as south korea s financial adviser the winners turned out to be goldman , sachs and salomon smith barney inc , a unit of the travelers group goldman , sachs s lead representatives are robert hormats , a vice chairman , and carlos cordeiro , a managing director salomon smith barney is represented by jeffrey shafer , a vice chairman and former treasury department official who helped the federal agency oversee its bailout of mexico in early 1995 goldman , sachs is the former employer of the treasury secretary , mr rubin , but mr rubin played no role in the selection of south korea s financial advisers while mr rubin s ties to goldman , sachs undoubtedly allow the firm to engage in occasional namedropping , none of its competitors have suggested the firm s representation of south korea is inappropriate because of mr rubin s tenure there but a number of goldman , sachs and salomon smith barney competitors have questioned whether the two investment banks have conflicts of interest in simultaneously advising the south korean government in its negotiations with banks and being first in line to lead any bond offerings the two firms declined to comment on that topic but questions surrounding their roles in south korea overlook the fact that they were hired late last year precisely to help the country design and put into effect a new financing plan for 1998 that occurred before it was clear that international banks would even renegotiate south korean loans one assumes that the issuer has the sense to shop the market , so there are n't any overwhelming conflicts there , said john coffee , a columbia university law school professor specializing in securities law financial advisers typically wear as many hats as possible , and that includes underwriting while such measures are never foolproof , firms can erect socalled firewalls to insulate trading and other operations from employees who are financial advisers to a government , as both goldman , sachs and salomon smith barney say they have done j p morgan , for example , is familiar with the practice when it advised the mexican government during that country s economic crisis , the bank , which had a big trading presence in the country , required lawyers to be present whenever its advisers spoke to other company executives to assure that no confidential information about mexico was shared
columbia , sc , jan 8 patrick j buchanan gazes approvingly from a framed photograph on charles m condon s office wall to charlie condon , reads the inscription , who is saving lives while others prattle on about the rights of drug addicts even without that endorsement of mr condon s most disputed act as south carolina attorney general prosecuting pregnant crack cocaine addicts for child neglect and even manslaughter the republican prosecutor s political ideals shine stark and clear instead of an electric chair , he once proposed an electric sofa to speed executions he pushed to preserve the state capitol s confederate flag a symbol that even the conservative senator strom thurmond , republican of south carolina , reluctantly said was too contentious he is attacking video poker , refused to swear in an atheist justice of the peace and firmly supported the citadel s fight to bar female cadets and if he has his way , this welloff , welleducated man from a respected charleston family could stand before the highest court in the land and argue that a crack user s fetus is a fellow south carolinian and has protections under the law in october , a majority of the state supreme court supported mr condon in his assertion that a viable fetus is a person under the state s child abuse laws , and that a woman who uses illegal drugs while she is pregnant can be charged with neglect , manslaughter , even murder the court , by a 3to2 vote , upheld the conviction of cornelia whitner , sentenced to eight years for neglect in 1992 after she gave birth to a baby with traces of cocaine in its blood the south carolina court contradicted five other state supreme courts that threw out similar convictions , and now lawyers for ms whitner are expected to appeal her case to the united states supreme court if the court agrees to hear the case , it will give south carolina s attorney general more than just a place to defend his law it is a wedge into reconsidering roe v wade , said steven bates , the south carolina director of the american civil liberties union it s kind of scary to open that door of opportunity to the supreme court by prosecuting pregnant addicts , mr condon says , he is only trying to protect the unborn , and if a woman chooses , she can get drug treatment and generally avoid prosecution some fear that the prosecutions could be expanded so that a woman who aborted a fetus for a medical reason could be charged in the death of the child \( mr condon has said his office would review such cases but so far there have been no charges connected with abortion \) under mr condon s interpretation of the law , health workers who do not report pregnant addicts to lawenforcement officials could also be prosecuted none has been prosecuted so far and only 23 women have been prosecuted for charges ranging from neglect to manslaughter but what he has done , mainly , is revisit the question of when life begins it is a battle that he relishes you do n't have the right to have a drugimpaired child , said mr condon , 44 , a tall , thin , sharpfaced man who looks good in a suit and graduated magna cum laude from duke university s school of law the child comes from god we think we 're in line with how most people feel in this country we recognize the fetus as a fellow south carolinian and the right to privacy does not overcome the right to life it promises to be a welllighted stage for a politician who , political experts say , likes the glow he is , in a sense , just one of a flood of conservative politicians some , like him , who used to be democrats who have surged into state office in the south yet mr condon is more effective , say supporters , and much more dangerous , say his enemies , than others in this genre of populists he does n't just talk , said david lublin , a professor of political science at the university of south carolina he makes a staunch use of the power of his pulpit , but also the power of his office , to pound out changes in south carolina society dick harpootlian , a lawyer and former prosecutor who lost to mr condon in the race for attorney general , said the political payoff is what motivates this crusade he has the ability to disabuse himself of any beliefs he had and to adopt the beliefs that 51 percent of the people have at that moment , said mr harpootlian , referring to mr condon s party switch in 1990 political experts say that mr condon will seek higher office the governorship or a united states senate seat and he has been criticized by people within his own party for personally prosecuting bigheadline cases but those who see him as a political opportunist see only half the picture , political experts said he seems to be willing to do anything to court the republican rightwing electorate , and he s very ambitious , mr lublin said but he seems to have genuine beliefs , and he seems to follow through on them he s not a hypocrite , which is a rare quality he s very intelligent , he s good at speaking , and even though he s stating his views from the very most rightwing stance , he does n't sound crazy that , mr lublin said , is the thing that makes him so acceptable , or so dangerous , if you 're a liberal
anyone who wonders what a fulllength movie looks like on a computer screen at this moment of technological flux can go to the world wide web site called the sync \( http www thesync com \) and , provided one s machine and modem are of sufficient capacity , summon the silent classic nosferatu made in 1922 , f w murnau s film resurrection of the devil in the form of count nosferatu \( the undead \) remains one of the better adaptations of bram stoker s dracula it may also be the only kind of film anybody will tolerate watching on a computer now that s because it s a silent movie and the image , like all moving images on a computer screen these days , has the heebiejeebies be that as it may , this month the sync plans to make available walls of sound , a 110minute blackand white film , about a friendship between two women , that was made in 1994 and has been shown at film festivals to claim a first for the internet is a dangerous proposition , but the movie is at least one of the first contemporary films to be presented in its entirety at a web site we 're taking a chance , said the director of walls of sound , erica jordan , a young san francisco filmmaker i know the quality is bad designers of homeentertainment systems sometimes speak enticingly about the presentation of movies by computer , but filmmakers usually balk at the notion right now the net is not a way to see movies , said mayra langdon riesman , founder of filmscouts , a wellknown web site about movies \( http www filmscouts com \) and a practiced hand at putting shorter pieces of film on the internet digitized information contained in a movie , especially one with any action , is too vast to be handled by most personal computers and modems , which are n't capable of producing anything beyond rudimentary film quality web operators anticipate that not too many years from now about 2003 , in ms riesman s estimation new technologies will improve the image for the time being , though , film and video viewing on the net is best kept to clips and short pieces ms riesman s site presents a mix of reviews , interviews , movie news and information together with pieces of film moviemakers themselves take to the web to chat with peers , gather information about their trade and promote their wares i get this email from indiewire , which is kind of like getting daily variety , said doug block , a new york documentary maker it has festival reports , openings , interviews it s also a way to get out the word about your own projects and scripts kevin smith , director of the muchacclaimed independent film chasing amy and the proprietor of his own site \( http www viewaskew com \) , also follows indiewirecom part of being in the indie field , he said , is knowing what s going on , who s succeeding , who s not on the web that information is constantly brought up to date occasionally filmmakers show clips of works in progress , but ms riesman said that the real value of the internet to filmmakers was not as an exhibition site but as a production tool people make a mistake when they try to adapt old media to the net , she said this is new media in the future , she added , the web might be used to make new kinds of films in different ways for example , given instant communication on the web , making a movie could become more of a global collaboration filmmakers might want to hire people who are otherwise unavailable or who work better in their own environments , she said the web allows their participation and cuts costs my composer is in japan , she said , speaking hypothetically my screenwriter is in mexico my editor is in new york wall of sand is of conventional origins the movie , ms jordan s first feature , was shown at slamdance , the alternative festival that runs parallel to the sundance film festival in utah each january , and several other festivals in the united states and europe so far , however , there has been no theater release or video the sync at least keeps the film alive it gives people the opportunity to see it , and it s very hard to do that in this world , she said maybe a buyer will be watching , but that s doubtful film buyers are n't on line , and if they are , they do n't have the knowledge to pick the films up , ms riesman said karol martesko , publisher of the magazine filmmaker and a longtime operator of web sites set up for the benefit of independent filmmakers , agrees that inadequate equipment and complexity of access are obstacles to film watching on the web he keeps his own internet presentations and access as simple as possible we design all our sites for the least common denominator , he said given adequate equipment and knowhow , however , movies on the web can be entertaining about 25 films are available at the sync nosferatu and another silent classic in the public domain , the cabinet of dr caligari \( 1919 \) , run at their full lengths of 80 minutes and 60 minutes , respectively while the site has the capacity to show 200 90minute movies , the rest of the films offered are in the 10minute range and fall into four categories experimental \( the arts \) , documentary \( one currently

passes 90 yards in practice with the help of kansas s prairie winds there is a hardnosed lefthander who got sick at midfield but made opponents feel worse with one comeback victory after another there is a perennial heisman trophy hopeful whose candidacy has never quite caught on outside central new york add a former minor league baseball player who has put the quack back in the oregon ducks' attack , and a determined ohio state marksman who has evolved from junior college star to parttimer to bona fide pro prospect and the two juniors the latest model from washington s quarterback factory , who has already said he will enter the national football league draft , and the legend from the mountains of eastern kentucky who leads a sophisticated , recordsetting air attack in total , they are college football s quarterback class of 1999 daunte culpepper of central florida , michael bishop of kansas state , cade mcnown of ucla , donovan mcnabb of syracuse , akili smith of oregon , joe germaine of ohio state , brock huard of washington and if he decides to go pro tim couch of kentucky they are responsible for looks of ecstasy on the faces of scouts in film rooms across the nfl they are solace for the quarterbackhungry teams that watched helplessly as peyton manning and ryan leaf went first and second in the last draft they invite comparison to the class of 1983 , when six quarterbacks were firstround picks , including two certain hall of famers in john elway and dan marino and perhaps a third in jim kelly and they have inspired more than the usual paranoia among nfl scouts and general managers , afraid of tipping their hand about their draft plans of five scouts and executives interviewed for this article , none wanted to be identified and only a few agreed to be quoted all said it was too early to assess the quarterbacks' performances and slot them in the draft they insisted that they needed to see the prospects firsthand at allstar games or the nfl combines or private workouts nonetheless , you know this is a very talented and very deep group of quarterbacks , said one scout for a national football conference team the potential for a great class is there but the class of 1983 only happened once , and it s unfair to measure these guys by that most of those interviewed projected that two quarterbacks , possibly three , would be selected in the first round they all agreed that culpepper held an edge over the rest surprisingly , perhaps , most agreed that couch and huard should remain in school culpepper s numbers are what have brought the scouts to orlando and upstart central florida , which is in only its third season in division ia culpepper led the golden knights to a 92 record by passing for 3 , 690 yards and 28 touchdowns and , over four years , a 2519 record against a schedule heavy on strong southeastern conference teams his 736 completion percentage this season broke steve young s 1983 national collegiate athletic association record but these are the numbers that are eyecatching culpepper is 6 feet 4 inches and 240 pounds , runs the 40yard dash in 46 seconds and handles 455 pounds in the squat a stellar athlete by any measure the professional talent judges like his mobility he is only the third college player to throw for 10 , 000 yards and rush for 1 , 000 yet they say he does not look to run first instead , he reads coverages expertly , rarely makes a mistake when changing plays at the line of scrimmage and instinctively takes what is given to him the reason he is considered an immediate impact player is coaching first as offensive coordinator , and this year as central florida s head coach , the former pittsburgh steeler backup quarterback mike kruczek has treated culpepper to the most advanced tutoring of any of the quarterbacks kruczek has played in our league and is a great offensive mind and teacher , an nfc general manager said he has brought culpepper along further than any of the others of the rest of the senior quarterbacks , kansas state s bishop has separated himself slightly from the pack like culpepper , he is physically blessed at 61 and 210 pounds , he is an electrifying and sturdy openfield runner who is equally adept with his cannon of an arm within minutes against nebraska , he jetted down the middle for 51 yards on a draw play and rocketed a 61yard pass on a precise timing route he has run for 13 touchdowns , and has passed for 21 more and 2 , 503 yards like ucla s mcnown , bishop has a fierce will to win he is 461 as a collegiate starter , including two perfect seasons capped by national championships at blinn college to go with this season s 110 record heading into next saturday s big 12 championship game scouts admire bishop for carrying a team with little football tradition , but they also wonder if his raw competitiveness will slow his development he initiates unnecessary hits at the ends of runs he berates himself and his teammates twice in the last two years , bishop has been told not to talk to reporters by his coach , bill snyder , who acknowledges frequent conversations with his quarterback about keeping his emotion to a controlled rage but snyder also argues that bishop is a quick study , that when snyder decided not to redshirt him after he arrived from blinn , bishop responded by devouring the intricacies of a complicated offense his competitiveness makes him the player he is , snyder said but really he s had a little more than a year within our system and he s learned so much

said craig fugate , chief of the florida division of emergency management should we look at some way to warn these people \? one problem in florida is that its water table is too high for basements they would flood if more homes had had basements , mr fugate said , that would have dramatically altered the death toll this week fewer than 3 percent of florida s houses have basements , he said , so with no underground shelter , residents are advised to get to the lowest floor and go inside an interior room like a bathroom or a closet because tornadoes in florida are usually short , and relatively weak , mr fugate said , communities have not seen the need to invest in more urgent warning systems like the sirens and loudspeakers used in the midwest in addition , many floridians disregard the tornado watches issued by the national weather service as well as the special radio alerts on the possibility of tornadoes from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration a tornado warning , which means a tornado has been confirmed , can come within minutes of an actual touchdown but mr fugate said the state already had planned to equip public buildings with 3 , 000 radios from the oceanic institute , which have a feature that beeps when the national weather service sends a signal although the total damage has not been determined , seminole county officials said they had tallied about 4 million in losses for the 260 homes and 18 businesses destroyed in volusia county , damage estimates exceeded 79 million in flamingo lakes , many residents were already planning to rebuild when a tornado hits there s nothing you can really do , said mark truluck , manager of the construction yard , a store that had set up a makeshift branch in the neighborhood to sell building materials all you can do is go to a safe area like a closet and pull a mattress over your head photos domingo garay , above , brought relatives to help him search through the rubble of his home yesterday in kissimmee , fla the cleanup has begun in central florida after a series of tornadoes on monday \( phillippe diederich for the new york times \) in california , highway 166 gave way in heavy rains near the cuyama river , 20 miles east of santa maria , 200 miles northwest of los angeles , killing two police officers at least nine people died in the storm \( associated press \)
miami , aug 8 when michael abbell , a former justice department extradition chief , and william m moran , a criminal defense lawyer , were charged with the crimes of the colombian drug cartel they represented , lawyers nationwide denounced the prosecution as a government effort to intimidate the defense bar in july , after a retrial , a jury found the two lawyers guilty of crossing the line between criminal lawyer and lawyer criminal , in the words of a federal prosecutor , and convicted them on charges of racketeering and moneylaundering conspiracy , but not of drugtrafficking conspiracy as defense lawyers weigh the repercussions of the case , however , some lawyers are also grappling with a more immediate question where is mr moran \? the 59yearold defendant was last seen on july 17 in the federal courthouse here , shortly after he learned that the jury had reached a partial verdict , and he remains a fugitive people are wondering if he s ok , said jack king , a spokesman for the national association of criminal defense lawyers , in washington it s cause for some concern as to mr moran s state of mind you know what happened to vince foster , mr king said , referring to the deputy white house counsel who committed suicide in 1993 mr moran , who once served as a miamidade county state attorney , and mr abbell , 57 , a former chief of the justice department s office of international affairs and later a criminal defense lawyer in washington , were snared in a 1995 indictment that capped one of the nation s largest drug investigations the case drew nationwide attention not only because it concerns the cali drug cartel and 130 of its leaders and operatives , but also because it accused six lawyers of collaborating in the cocaine business through their representation of cartel members three lawyers pleaded guilty to money laundering and a fourth one to obstruction of justice and conspiring to import cocaine and on july 20 , a jury convicted mr moran and mr abbell , a verdict that will be appealed but that other defense lawyers say is already having a cowering effect in their ranks officials with the criminal defense lawyers group said some members were steering clear of representing the same client more than once and of specialties like drug trafficking and organized crime to avoid raising suspicion about legitimate work what is disturbing about this case is that the government used against the lawyers the very acts that lawyers do in representing clients every day visiting people in jail , preparing affidavits , said gerald lefcourt of new york city , the group s president it puts us on notice that if you really want to be safe , keep away from these cases edward ryan and william m pearson , assistant united states attorneys who prosecuted the lawyers , said the case sent a message only to lawyers who step out of their advocacy role to further the criminal interests of their clients they said the jury found that mr moran and mr abbell shielded cartel bosses from extradition and that they obstructed justice by soliciting phony affidavits to exonerate the cartel leaders and by making payments to cartel operatives who had been arrested and to their families , to insure that they did not cooperate with investigators prosecutors said those charged worked for a cartel faction that imported and distributed more than 200 , 000 kilos of cocaine in the 1980 s and 90 s more than 80 of the 130 indicted have been convicted either here or in colombia , the prosecutors said , including the cartel leaders miguel and gilberto rodriguezorejuela , who are serving prison sentences in their country their acts allowed cartel leaders to sit in colombia and feel more comfortable about what they were doing , mr pearson said of the lawyers the outcome could have been worse for mr moran and mr abbell the jury deadlocked on two drugtrafficking counts that carried a life sentence but the lawyers still face 20 years in prison for each of the two convictions of racketeering and moneylaundering conspiracy , and mr moran could get an five more years for skipping his 750 , 000 bail sentencing is scheduled for oct 20 mr moran seems to have buckled under the stress of two trials , the first of which ended last october in an acquittal for both him and mr abbell on one racketeering charge , and a hung jury on the four charges that the second jury considered the day before he disappeared , mr moran had been particularly distressed when judge william m hoeveler of the united states district court for the southern district of florida dismissed a juror for refusing to follow the law , said mr moran s lawyer , holly r skolnick the juror told fellow jurors that she found some of the laws she had to apply silly , and another juror reported her to the judge lawyers for mr moran and mr abbell said the questioning of the jurors was improper and would be a basis for an appeal ms skolnick said that after that episode mr moran lost hope for a fair trial the stress and the pressure just got to him , ms skolnick said
melbourne , fla , feb 26 if the florida marlins traded greg zaun to the mets , he would run the 72 miles to the mets' spring camp faster than it obviously takes gary sheffield to drive the 155 miles from his home in st petersburg to the marlins' camp here when the marlins worked out today , zaun was at space coast stadium today , eager to leave sheffield was not at space coast stadium , none too eager to arrive he should be there momentarily , jim neader , sheffield s agent , said at 11 20 am , 1 hour 20 minutes after the 61 million right fielder was required by the collective bargaining agreement to be in camp ready to work out but momentarily turned into more than three and a half hours everybody does n't know where i'm at every single second , sheffield said after he finally arrived , shortly after 3 pm i'm the only person who would know that s the way i like to keep it i'm a private person zaun is the marlins' backup catcher the mets have sought him as a temporary replacement for their starting catcher , todd hundley dave dombrowski , the marlins' general manager , declined even to acknowledge he was talking with the mets , but another team official said that talks had been progressing even zaun was aware of the mets' interest in him i 've known for a month and a half or two months , he said i'm keeping my fingers crossed zaun , a 26yearold switchhitter , who last year hit 301 in a limited role behind charles johnson , said the prospect of losing the regular job when hundley was fully recovered from his elbow operation did not dampen his interest in a trade i do n't have any problem with that , he said the chance for me to play every day for more than a week would be monumental for my career right now after spending parts of two seasons with the baltimore orioles , zaun was traded to the marlins in august 1996 he may be the bestsuited player to fill the deadend role on the mets he may also have a bright future in the majors because there is a catching bloodline in his family his uncle rick dempsey was a longtime catcher known for his grittiness and zany antics he got some big hits for us last year , jim leyland , the marlins' manager , said of zaun he did a great job for us he does his work when you call on him , when you go to battle , he s ready he s a competitor zaun said he felt that his performance in a supporting role last season earned him a shot at a starting job he knows that chance will not come with the marlins because johnson is the best defensive catcher in the national league and greatly improved as a hitter he s the everyday guy here , the 5foot10inch , 180pound zaun said i do n't have a problem with that when a team comes along and shows interest in giving you an opportunity to play every day , i definitely want to get out and get that opportunity if he goes to the mets , zaun added , at least i 'll have 200 , 300 times at bat to say hey , this kid can play or he ca n't zaun , however , finds himself in a bind the marlins want to pay him as a backup catcher , but in talking about trading him to the mets , they want the return value for a starter they think i'm such a valuable player , he said , they ca n't trade me for a bag of balls and a pitchback screen and they want some major player for me , but they wo n't pay me the top of the pay scale , which i think i deserve zaun said he has heard that the mets have offered pitchers like juan acevedo and brian bohanon , but he did n't know where the talks stood not eligible for salary arbitration , zaun has been offered a raise from 205 , 000 to 275 , 000 that s the equivalent of five days' pay for sheffield dombrowski said he would speak with sheffield before deciding whether to fine him for being late i think everybody would prefer that he was here , dombrowski said , adding we have a very young team i wish he was here in the sense of leadership sheffield , who disclosed he has been rehabilitating his back , said he considered himself on time dombrowski said he told sheffield s agent the reporting time , but sheffield said i told them i was going to be here thursday nobody told me what time to be here if somebody had given me the time , that s the time i would have been here as for dombrowski s mention of leadership , sheffield said they did n't give me 61 million as a leader i was a guy that was just on the team and they gave me 61 million , so i do n't think anybody can say you have to have the responsibilities to be a leader just because we gave you something they did n't give me nothing i earned it unlike zaun , sheffield does not want to be traded to the mets , or to any team when you talk about trading me , everything has to go through me , he said , alluding to the notrade clause in his contract i'm in total control of that it s not going to happen i do n't care what team they 're talking about this is where i want to be

garrison , ny these are giddy days for scientists in his new book , remaking eden , lee m silver , a biologist at princeton , foresees an era in which humans attain virtually infinite power to manipulate their bodies and minds our descendants will be smarter than einstein and more athletic than michael jordan , he predicts , and they will live for hundreds of years , if not forever recent events lend support to these scifi scenarios two weeks ago , richard seed , an unaffiliated physicist in illinois , announced plans to open a clinic for cloning humans , a notion inspired by the cloning of a sheep last year last week , researchers at the geron corporation reported their discovery of a possible fountain of youth , a method that could prevent the aging and death of cells forgive me for being a bit jaded , but my own recent experiences give me a somewhat different perspective on the potential of these new breakthroughs two years ago my brotherinlaw , a vibrant man in his mid50 s , was found to have cancer he underwent the usual gamut of treatments , including surgery , chemotherapy and radiation and a promising experimental technique using antiangiogenic therapy nothing worked he died last fall since president richard nixon officially declared a war on cancer in 1971 , the united states has spent more than 30 billion on cancer research scientists have taken enormous strides toward understanding how different types of cancer occur , and they have invented sophisticated methods for detecting the disease and tracking its course but overall mortality rates from cancer have remained virtually unchanged since 1971 , and in fact for the 50 or so years for which reliable data exist maybe someday all our research will yield a cure that will render cancer as obsolete as polio i certainly hope so but the record so far does not offer much hope science has also made pitifully little progress at understanding , or healing , our fantastically complicated minds a couple of months ago , while doing research on mindrelated science , i watched depressed patients at the new york state psychiatric institute at columbiapresbyterian medical center receiving electroconvulsive therapy more popularly known as shock treatment , it has been refined since the days when it was portrayed in one flew over the cuckoo s nest patients are given muscle relaxants and mouth guards to prevent teeth and bones from shattering , and dosages are calibrated to reduce memory loss no one has any idea why shock therapy works it s the equivalent of kicking a tv set that is on the blink the relapse rate is extremely high , as much as 90 percent and yet , incredibly , for severe depression , shock therapy is the most effective treatment we have so much for the claims that we are on the verge of abolishing despair and anxiety through drugs the potential of human genetics has also been overrated over the past decade or so , scientists have served up finding after finding proclaiming the discovery of genes that supposedly control complex human traits and disorders like noveltyseeking , homosexuality , schizophrenia , manic depression and alcoholism researchers hope they will be able to customize human personalities through genetic engineering but so far not a single one of these claims linking genes to complex traits has been corroborated by followup studies researchers have made genuine progress in finding genes associated with certain diseases cystic fibrosis , huntington s disease , lou gehrig s disease and earlyonset breast cancer tests are now available for identifying those who carry these genes and thus are likely or certain to come down with the associated disease but none of the promises of therapies based on this genetic knowledge have been fulfilled it is natural for biologists and journalists to focus on the advances of science but given how little progress science has made against such fundamental problems as cancer and mental illness and given how desperate people are for relief from these and other afflictions all this talk about our impending biological omnipotence strikes me as unseemly by drawing attention to science s failures as well as its legitimate achievements , perhaps scientists and journalists alike will present a less distorted , more honest picture of science s real prospects
los angeles , jan 27 at a sleepy tower records in the suburb of encino , andrea stover , 13 , was combing the aisles for cd s with her mother and her younger sister in her hands , she had debut cd s by the rhythmandblues singer usher and the pintsize pop siblings hanson asked whether she would buy followup albums by these artists , andrea responded , why would i get the same group again \? her mother , amy , 42 , shook her head in disbelief it s crazy , she said when i was young , i had to have every grateful dead album i have a great record collection , but they just keep barreling through new stuff they 'll listen to a group all the time and then i 'll never hear from them again a new generation gap is opening up among rock and pop fans the difference is n't necessarily in the kind of music baby boomers and their children listen to after all , oasis emulates the beatles , hanson tries to be the jackson five , and members of pearl jam are avowed fans of the who and led zeppelin what s different is the way they consume that music the elders stood by their favorite bands while the young constantly chase after the new record industry executives say pop music , particularly rock , is changing from a genre that gave rise to career artists \( the beatles , the rolling stones , bob dylan , michael jackson \) to one supported by a succession of young , transient acts and in the concert industry , which earns most of its revenue from babyboomer bands , executives are beginning to panic because most of these younger acts are not building a loyal fan base and their ticket sales are languishing compared with the success of their albums as the comedian chris rock said about the pop scene when he hosted the mtv video music awards , here today , gone today etty lewensztain , 15 , another shopper at tower who was buying her first and , most likely , only cd s by the ben folds five , the aquabats and ani difranco , said i 'd rather get a new band than one i 've already heard diversity is fun i do n't like to stick with one singer this kind of shopping pattern is befuddling the music industry there was a period when every time atlantic put out a new led zeppelin album , we had four million of sales guaranteed , said val azzoli , the cochairman and cochief executive of atlantic records now , i do n't know according to the billboard charts , none of the albums that reached no 1 in 1960 , 1970 or 1980 were debuts in 1990 , the only no 1 debut was by vanilla ice but last year , four bands reached no 1 with their first albums and the three topselling albums of the year \( by the spice girls , jewel and puff daddy \) were all debuts meanwhile , records that were expected to be major successes in 1997 by career artists like janet jackson , the rolling stones , u2 , and even relatively new acts like oasis and en vogue were outsold by these debut albums , as well as those by puff daddy , hanson , the wallflowers and erykah badu but when those debut acts tried to capitalize on their popularity by releasing a second album \( the spice girls s spiceworld \) or by touring \( the wallflowers \) , sales were disappointing the proliferation of choice is one factor driving the change , said pete howard , the editor of the cd newsletter ice in the 1960 s , an average of 45 albums were released a week now the average is 710 cd s a week also , a survey by the research company soundata shows that consumers who once selected record stores based primarily on low prices now look for the widest or most interesting selection furthermore , the survey showed that 40 percent of record shoppers in 1996 , compared with 28 percent in 1993 , will buy a full cd by a band after hearing only one song they liked , giving new musicians with one hit a quick jump up the charts onehit wonders even onealbum wonders have always been a staple of the industry , executives say , but never in the history of rock has the business been so driven by songs \( as opposed to bands \) performed by acts that burst into the limelight out of nowhere and disappear as quickly as they come last year , atlantic was the industry s no 1 label , claiming 8 percent of the market , and mr azzoli credits this almost entirely to debut albums by acts like jewel , duncan sheik , sugar ray and matchbox 20 looking ahead , he said , the only thing i can depend on is that our bigselling acts will be new acts meanwhile , rock acts that seem to have longterm potential \( beck , ani difranco , phish \) are not the ones selling the most albums people s tastes are about wanting things increasingly faster , said guy zapoleon , a consultant for some of the country s top radio stations their attention span and interest in music has become shorter and shorter they want instant gratification , then they tire of things quickly though this kind of turnover does little for artist development , it can be costefficient because young acts generally receive lower royalty rates , smaller advances and eat up less of a label s budget the good news is that your profit margins are better , mr azzoli of atlantic said the bad news is that you have to manage your business differently you ca n't look at the upcoming year and figure out what s going to happen and budget accordingly you do n't know what s going to hit and what is n't
washington , april 23 the senate today narrowly passed a showcase republican bill that would provide a modest tax break for parents who save for elementary and secondary school expenses , including private school tuition but even as the senate republicans tried to seize the education initiative from democrats , they faced a veto threat from president clinton on their legislation the measure passed 56 to 43 on a near party line vote after days of biting partisan debate that displayed the deep differences on education policy the republicans want federal money available for private education , while democrats fear any subsidy that would reduce commitment to public schooling the bill , sponsored by paul d coverdell , republican of georgia , and robert torricelli , democrat of new jersey , would allow family members , charitable groups or private donors to contribute up to 2 , 000 a year for each elementary or secondary student into special savings accounts that could be used for educationrelated expenses , including tutoring , computers and private school tuition the interest on the money and withdrawals from the account would be tax free and could be rolled over for college expenses the accounts , which would cost the federal government 16 billion over 10 years , would be phased out for individuals who make more than 95 , 000 a year senator pete domenici , republican of new mexico , called the legislation revolutionary while senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , excoriated the bill as an attempt to privatize education the house passed similar legislation last year , and now the two chambers must craft a final bill to send to mr clinton with democrats denouncing the legislation as a first step toward using federal funds to subsidize private schools , mr clinton this week vowed to veto it the president has opposed the tax break since last summer , when he threatened to veto the entire balanced budget agreement if republicans did not remove the provision they did but vowed to resurrect it it would disproportionately benefit highestincome taxpayers , mr clinton said tuesday , explaining his expected veto families who are struggling to make ends meet would never see a penny of it today s slim victory indicated that the senate would not be able to override mr clinton s veto of the bill even though the proposal is modest in scope , it gives republicans a symbolic victory as a well as popular education measure to wield on the campaign trail , one that resonates among middle class parents who send their children to parochial and private schools and it gives democrats the chance to portray themselves as the guardians of public education the intensity of the debate waged on the floor this week comes at a time when polls show the american public increasingly interested in education as other concerns , such as the economy and the cold war , have waned the democrats have long held the political advantage on the issue , and mr clinton has made education one of the centerpieces of his domestic agenda but the republicans , who just three years ago were trying to eliminate the department of education , have tried to recoup with an education agenda of their own the agenda centers on tuition vouchers that would allow parents to switch their children from public to private schools , an idea that is gaining in grassroots popularity republicans would also like to diminish the federal government s role in education they succeeded in passing two such proposals on wednesday by a vote of 50 to 49 , the senate approved an amendment to the tax incentive bill by senator coverdell that would convert nearly all federal money for education programs into block grants for participating states the senate also passed a separate provision that would ban voluntary math and reading testing , which mr clinton favors the federal government has been doing too much dictating for the 7 percent of the resources it gives to the states for education , mr domenici said the two measures were considered so extreme by democrats , who claimed they would obliterate federal education policy , that several democratic supporters of mr coverdell s plan withheld their support five democrats voted for the measure today , but three of them , including mr torricelli , said they would reverse their votes in the future if the amendments were not dropped from the final bill three republicans opposed the bill today democrats put forth 12 of their own amendments , among them mr clinton s ideas to promote school renovation and to hire 100 , 000 teachers , but none passed throughout the fourday debate , democrats and republicans took turns blasting each other s proposals while acknowledging that the nation s schools , and its children , are in trouble the one chance they have to escape the plight that they live in is being denied them because people want to maintain the status quo , and the status quo is bankrupt , said senator dan coats , republican of indiana senator kennedy proclaimed that the bill hangs the sign for all to see on the front door of public schools of america , mr kennedy said abandon hope all ye who enter here get out while you can one frustrated democrat complained that the whole debate was nothing but political posturing the senate is busy talking past each other and setting up 30minute spots for campaigns , said senator john f kerry of massachusetts another , senator robert c byrd of west virginia , warned his colleagues the public school system ought to shape up or public support will continue to erode mr torricelli , who broke with his party to become a lead sponsor , said he believes that democrats are exaggerating the bill s negative impact on public schools and underestimating its value the democrats , armed with figures from a recent assessment done by the joint committee on taxation , said the annual savings in interest amount to peanuts 7 to 37 but mr coverdell preferred to highlight the larger picture basing his calculations on a compounded interest rate of 75 percent , he said a family that saves 2 , 000 a year for 10 years would build up 8 , 294 in interest none of it taxed and would have an additional 2 , 322 in tax savings he also argued that the measure simply expanded an existing tax break signed into law by the president last year that allows families to set aside 500 a year for college chart at a glance senate s education savings account bill following are highlights of the education savings account bill passed yesterday by the senate major provisions taxfree savings accounts would be allowed to cover expenses for elementary and secondary education , including that of children in private schools and those taught at home qualified expenses would include \( 1 \) tuition , tutoring , books and supplies , computers and equipment and \( 2 \) room and board , uniforms , transportation and supplementary items \( including afterschool care \) up to 2 , 000 a year could be contributed by parents , other relatives , charities , foundations or employers the bill expands on savings accounts enacted last year that allow taxfree savings of 500 a year for college only withdrawals and accumulated interest would be taxfree , but contributions would not be deductible the savings accounts would be phased out for individuals earning more than 95 , 000 a year and couples making more than 150 , 000 companies would receive a tax deduction for employee education assistance prepaid college tuition plans would be completely tax deductible about 103 billion in education programs would be converted into block grants , under an amendment approved by the senate , if states vote to choose block grants over federally administered programs voluntary national tests in reading and mathematics would be prohibited , under an amendment approved by the senate , unless specifically approved by congress cost the savings accounts would cost the treasury 16 billion over 10 years the total cost of the bill would be 6 billion over 10 years supporters say the bill will encourage a huge private investment in education opponents say that most of the tax benefits will go to the top 20 percent of all income earners and that this money should be spent on school construction , teacher hiring or other benefits to public education

as you watch the gorgeous new production of twelfth night at the vivian beaumont theater , you may find your emotions tested in ways never intended by shakespeare , nicholas hytner \( the man who directed it \) or lincoln center theater \( which staged the play as its own contribution to the theatrical portion of lincoln center festival '98 \) the hytner production charms , maddens , surprises and disappoints you have to keep adjusting to it as if it were the signal of a riveting but wandering fm broadcast twelfth night is scheduled to run through aug 30 , while the festival ends this afternoon with the final performances of two other theatrical productions f ust version 30 , presented by the barcelona company la fura dels baus , at the new york state theater , and the street of crocodiles , a production of the theatre de complicite , at the john jay college theater complicite is the british company that was represented at the 1996 festival by its epic staging of the three lives of lucie cabrol already come and gone village and adam resurrected , presented by the gesher theater of israel , founded in 1991 by a group of russian emigres headed by yevgeny arye , the artistic director at first , they performed only in russian , but now present each production alternately in russian and hebrew with the same actors f ust opened too late for inclusion in this consideration of the festival s theatrical entries , but it is clear that this year s installment has provided a stunning , if accidental \( and far from comprehensive \) overview of the differences between theater in this country and abroad it is not a question of money mostly private here , often subsidized abroad or of technical facilities , but of the nature of the audiences for whom these theaters present their works anyone who has seen the offerings in this year s festival might well suspect that america is a theatrical disaster area , not because the festival entries from abroad were so uniformly fine \( they were n't \) , but because they showed us how narrow and limited are our expectations of theater when audiences are n't open and adventurous , you can hardly expect producers , writers , directors and actors to be audiences get what they want another way of saying they get what they deserve in israel they flock to the gesher , which is offering some startling alternatives to the more conventional works by other local troupes la fura dels baus , whose latest production is described as faust in cyberspace , promises to be alternative theater with a vengeance since its founding in 1983 , theatre de complicite has put on more than 25 productions and played in more than 180 cities in 41 countries on 4 continents the company does n't deal in pap yet its productions of the ionesco classic the chairs , coproduced with the royal court theater , and the three lives of lucie cabrol were popular as well as critical successes in london the new york critics adored the chairs , but the public was somewhat less enthusiastic in this country , filmmaker to the world , we are in the merciless siege of entertainment movie , television and even web yet we have no resident theatrical troupes of national repute our audiences seem to have grown lazy undemanding on a diet of junk food 'twelfth night' in some ways twelfth night is a typical lincoln center theater production it has been done with care mr hytner has a reputation as a heavyhitting director in both commercial and subsidized theaters among his credits the lincoln center theater revival of carousel \( a nearduplicate of the earlier version he staged in london \) , alan bennett s madness of george iii \( both on stage and on film \) and miss saigon twelfth night is a delight if you do n't demand perfection that is , if you can be as charmed by the earnest intentions of socalled name actors , who are not quite ready for their star roles , as by the seriously substantial performances in smaller roles , performed by character actors who are at ease with what they are doing mr hytner s staging of the play beguiles the eye and the ear , much in the manner of the uncontrolled substance apparently being smoked by the bored , lovesick duke orsino and his attendants in the first scene the setting is an illyria that , as designed by bob crowley , has the serene , watery beauty of an idealized kashmir whatever the time of day , whatever the weather , life in illyria is one long , lazy afternoon , scored by exotic music \( by jeanine tesori \) that plays on even when the musicians have left centerstage affairs of the heart , not disputed borders , are the concern in this enchanted land orsino is obsessed by his desire for olivia , a beautiful countess who will have none of him instead , she falls in love with cesario , the duke s comely young emissary , who is actually the shipwrecked viola disguised as a man and who herself is in love with orsino he , meanwhile , is beginning to feel increasingly warm feelings for the beardless cesario , though convinced he is still pining for olivia you do n't have to worry , of course sebastian , viola s twin brother presumed

houston it is snack time in the toddler room at the educare learning center , and patricia jackson and a coworker are handing out crackers to nine little ones seated around the curved table and to joseph , who eats in a high chair while making the transition from the infant room next door your hands go in your lap , ms jackson says cheerfully remember , do n't eat yet we 've got to say grace the children , ages 1 to 2 , are quiet , starting their crackers and juice only after ms jackson finishes saying lord is great lord is good let us thank him for our food each child eats calmly , then goes to the rug where ms jackson has put out a bin of duplo blocks ty shierra builds a tower , stefan says aaayyy and starts to clap , and joseph just bangs two blocks together but everyone plays with the blocks and no one leaves the rug ms jackson , now alone with the children , intervenes only with an occasional do n't grab or be nice and when she announces cleanup time , all the toddlers help put the blocks back into the bin such day care routines are the fabric of life for an increasing number of american preschoolers most children under 5 are cared for by people other than their parents and , according to the census bureau , a rising percentage , nearly a third , are in formal day care centers day care regulations vary by state , with some , like new york , imposing stringent standards , including one adult for every seven 3yearolds other states , like texas , allow more than twice as many children per adult recent visits to three houston centers educare , the magnolia branch ywca and center 532 of kindercare , the largest national forprofit childcare chain offer a glimpse of how such care often forces the workers to change their emphasis from individual attention to group management nationwide , more children are starting day care as young as 6 weeks and spending 10 or more hours a day in centers so questions about what makes good day care have become a prime concern both to parents and to politicians the clinton administration has proposed a 21 billion program to improve the quality and availability of child care and with welfare reform pushing more mothers of young children into the work force , the needs for lowcost , highquality child care are more urgent than ever but there is still passionate debate about how child care affects children while the largest , longestrunning study , by the national institutes of health , has offered reassurance that highquality child care does not interfere with motherchild attachment and fosters intellectual development , other studies have found that most care is mediocre and more than 1 in 10 children are in care that is unsafe and harmful to their development the key issues are how many infants or children one person can care for , how the caregiver is trained and whether the pay is enough to attract and keep good people , said marcy whitebook , codirector of the center for the child care workforce , a nonprofit research and advocacy group in washington for many years , children s advocates have argued for national standards for training , childtoadult ratios and group size but many conservatives say that the government should not favor working parents by investing in child care and that standards should be left to the states texas , and educare , are at the far end of the spectrum , allowing more children per adult than recommended by professional groups , like the national association for the education of young children for accreditation by the association , a center must have at least 1 adult for every 4 babies under 2 , every 6 2yearolds and every 7 3yearolds texas s licensing requirements allow each adult to look after 9 toddlers ages 1823 months , 11 2yearolds or 15 3yearolds while the most expensive texas day care centers often have more workers than the state requires , the more affordable ones tend to use the state standards each of the houston centers visited had a different atmosphere and culture the y program is part of a community center educare has strong christian underpinnings , with quotations from scripture posted in the rooms , and kindercare learning centers is a large corporation , offering stateoftheart toys reflecting their neighborhoods , the y s teachers and children were mostly hispanic , educare s were mostly africanamerican and kindercare s were mostly white even in the largest groups , there was neither neglect nor bedlam the rooms were orderly and pleasant , with care providers who at least while observed by a reporter were unfailingly warm , loving and instantly responsive to any sign of distress i think it s an ivorytower issue at those groups who say one teacher can only take care of four children , said leon j wynn , the founder of educare i know that in the real world our ratios work fine children learn the majority of what they know from other children , and if you are clear on what they are expected to do , they will do it
washington , aug 20 dozens of american cruise missiles struck targets in afghanistan and the sudan today in what president clinton described as an act of selfdefense against imminent terrorist plots and of retribution for the bombings of american embassies in east africa two weeks ago the strikes were launched from ships in the arabian and red seas at dusk it was not immediately clear whether the raids were a military success pentagon officials said that no americans died but that they had no immediate estimate of other casualties or damage with about 75 missiles timed to explode simultaneously in unsuspecting countries on two continents , the operation was the most formidable american military assault ever against a private sponsor of terrorism the targets were identified by pentagon officials as an extensive terrorism training complex in afghanistan , 94 miles south of kabul , and a factory for the building blocks of chemical weapons near khartoum , the sudan mr clinton and his national security team linked both sites to osama bin laden , the exiled saudi millionaire tied by american intelligence to the twin bombings on aug 7 in kenya and tanzania the bombings killed 12 americans and nearly 300 africans mr bin laden , who is in afghanistan , apparently survived the attack , which officials insisted was not aimed at him let our actions today send this message loud and clear , mr clinton said in an address from the oval office there are no expendable american targets there will be no sanctuary for terrorists the president made no apologies for ordering the strikes without permission from afghanistan or the sudan , saying , countries that persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens mr clinton s stonefaced appearance marked his emergence from two days of shelter from a howling political storm he returned to the white house this afternoon from vacation on martha s vineyard , where he was trying to repair family ties damaged by his admission monday of an intimate relationship with a white house intern the president reappeared to describe an operation he had been planning secretly for more than a week , even as he was meeting with his lawyers to prepare a legal and political defense of himself and his presidency in sudan , president omar elbashir called on his people to protest the attack , saying on television , sudanese people will defend themselves earlier the information minister , ghazi salaheddin , said the attack on what the sudanese call a pharmaceutical plant was a criminal act the leader of the taliban leadership in afghanistan , mullah mohammad omar , condemned the bombings , saying they showed an emnity for the afghan people defense secretary william s cohen said the strikes were intended to cause sufficient damage to disrupt them for some time president clinton presented several reasons for the decision to act swiftly and forcefully , rather than to punish mr bin laden through the means of diplomacy and law repeatedly he said mr bin laden presented an imminent threat , quoting his pledge this week to wage a war in which americans were all targets mr clinton added that key terrorist leaders were believed to be gathering today at the compound in afghanistan mr clinton said he had convincing intelligence that mr bin laden s terrorist network was behind the embassy bombings and he accused groups tied to mr bin laden of a host of murderous attacks and foiled plots like killing international peacekeepers in somalia and planning to assassinate the pope but while the republican leadership rallied to support the raids , some members of congress reacted suspiciously , noting that the action followed by three days mr clinton s acknowledgment to the public and a grand jury of his relationship with monica s lewinsky administration officials scorned talk of a connection when mr clinton s motorcade abruptly left the borrowed estate where he was secluded with his wife and daughter , reporters and photographers who were idling at the entrance assumed that he was going to play golf instead mr clinton made a brief dramatic appearance to announce the strikes mr clinton flew to washington for his oval office address as ms lewinsky was testifying for a second time before the grand jury here administration officials said the planning for the mission began nine days ago , shortly after the bombings president clinton was first informed of the planning in the white house situation room on aug 12 and gave the green light for a mission on friday he gave the final goahead in a telephone conversation at 3 o'clock this morning with his national security adviser , samuel r berger pentagon officials denied any plan to assassinate mr bin laden , saying they intended only to damage his network asked whether mr bin laden was a legitimate military target , secretary cohen said , to the extent that he or his organization have declared war upon the united states or our interests , then he certainly is engaged in an act of war
the safeguard of the sea a naval history of britain , 6601649 by n a m rodger illustrated 691 pp new york w w norton company 3995 how many times have seaborne invaders overthrown the government of england since 1066 \? most britons would boastfully reply , none most historians would cautiously respond , one , in 1688 few could list the eight other occasions on which english governments have been toppled by foreign armies 1139 , 1153 , 1326 , 1399 , 1460 , 1470 , 1471 and 1485 let alone the many other major invasions that did considerable damage without changing the established order , and those that overthrew the governments of both scotland and ireland the sea offers no safeguard to those who cannot use it for their own defense the safeguard of the sea , n a m rodger s breathtaking survey of a thousand years of british naval history , examines the slow process by which the peoples of the atlantic archipelago learned , forgot and relearned how to use the sea for their defense it is a story full of false starts aethelstan and edgar in the 10th century , edward the confessor in the 11th , richard the lionhearted in the 12th , henry v in the 15th until a permanent and effective standing navy finally emerged under the tudor dynasty \( 14851603 \) given that the presence or absence of sea power has always constituted an inescapable condition for the survival of the various states in the archipelago , it seems strange that so many of them neglected naval matters sea power , however , cannot be improvised in every age and every circumstance , rodger reminds us , the successful navies have been those which rested on long years of steady investment in the infrastructure essential to keep running the complex and delicate machinery of a seagoing fleet the cost of doing that deterred most monarchs and their ministers warships were the most complex and advanced of all artifacts each galleon of queen elizabeth i was larger than a country house , carried more heavy artillery than a fortress , took over a year to build and absorbed about 1 percent of her total budget also , beyond the mass of technical , industrial and professional skills required to build and equip the ships , every navy requires a sophisticated system of management to mold them into an effective fighting force even elizabeth lacked this until the 1570 s , when john hawkins began to reform her navy so that a fleet of stateoftheart warships always stood ready to defend the kingdom and to attack its enemies rodger , a fellow at britain s national maritime museum , organizes the first volume of his naval history of britain around four linked themes \( 1 \) policy , strategy and operations , from the campaigns of the rulers of northumbria and dalriada \( spanning southwest scotland and northern ireland \) in the seventh century down to the naval side of the english civil war a thousand years later \( 2 \) finance , administration and logistics \( 3 \) ship and weapon design and \( 4 \) the social history of both officers and men in addition , he provides a glossary of naval terms , an annotated bibliography , 59 plates and a detailed chronology the result is a masterpiece the last complete history of the royal navy , in seven volumes , appeared exactly a century ago rodger s work , the first of four volumes planned , sets an entirely new standard it is written in vivid , elegant prose that gracefully incorporates material from sources in anglosaxon , danish , french , irish , latin and spanish , as well as english the majority of the data come from the copious archives of the royal navy , and he has found there jewels seldom seen take , for example , some of the material used to demonstrate the emergence of a sophisticated system of management in the elizabethan navy to begin with , during the 1590 s the lord admiral of england , charles howard of effingham , reinforced his control of the fleet by placing his relatives in many key positions his brotherinlaw lord henry seymour , his cousin lord thomas howard , his nephew lord sheffield and his soninlaw sir richard leveson all received command of capital ships and soon became thoroughly familiar with them the lord admiral himself set a fine example he went aboard every ship that goeth out with me and in every place where any may creep looking for leaks , and he cared specially for the poor toiling and continual laboring mariner , himself daily making inquiry how they did , and calling to them by name to know in what case they stood , and what they did lack seymour once excused himself to a correspondent during the armada campaign of 1588 for dictating a letter because i have strained my hand with hauling of a rope , while another elizabethan captain of exalted social status , the earl of cumberland , when weighing anchor in a hurry , took his place at the capstan with his men such actions did not come naturally to noblemen rather they reflected deliberate policy by officers who appreciated the value of such behavior in creating a united and willing ship s company they also demonstrate that naval service had become respectable for men of high rank not all of the queen s sea dogs came from the landed classes a few \( most notably francis drake \) grew up in poverty , while others were the sons of shipowners and small merchants in provincial ports yet a surprising number rose to the rank of knight or esquire as a result of their service in the course of elizabeth s reign these captains , from whichever background , became a professional officer corps
mutual fund portfolios are as different as the investors who create them some are positioned to reflect the market outlook three years from now others take a closer view some use contrarian strategies , and some work hard to reduce the portfolio s risk levels some play market momentum still others bet on unusual opportunities or historical patterns such differences in the hypothetical retirement portfolios created by five professional money managers for the new york times go a long way to explain the range in their returns for the first quarter this year all the managers came in winners , gaining 723 percent to 11 percent but none outpaced the market proxy , the vanguard index 500 fund , or even the average of all stock funds , because they held small or emerging markets stocks along with the large united states stocks that dominated the list of leaders in the first three months of the year holding a diversified portfolio for the long term as market favorites come and go can be hard to live with day to day longterm investing is my mantra and my faith , but i will admit that , about now , 'longterm' seems interminable , said harold r evensky , a financial adviser in coral gables , fla \( rather than publishing this retirement portfolio horse race once a year , as readers and managers were told last quarter , the times has decided to continue presenting it each quarter \) looking long term , mr evensky had carefully created a diverse portfolio that was held back by its big stake in small overseas companies and emergingmarket stocks as well as by its holdings in domestic small stocks the portfolio placed third among the five , returning 894 percent in the quarter he was also hurt by an 11 percent stake in barr rosenberg market neutral , which started in middecember and was flat for the quarter i ca n't say we 're happy , mr evensky said , although he noted that the return was not out of line with the performance of similar investment portfolios run by barr rosenberg my job is to plan for a lifetime , and my concerns include risk as well as returns , he said the portfolio is welldiversified and run by worldclass managers , so damn the torpedoes and full steam ahead ! his only change is to replace the yacktman fund with wilshire large cap growth , an index fund don yacktman is too often in cash and his investment style is tending too much toward value , mr evensky said in first place for the quarter was jack a brill , a san diego money manager who steers a socially responsible course mr brill s portfolio rose 11 percent , mostly because of its bias toward largecap stocks , he said he plans no changes my portfolio contains a good mix of growth styles and defensive funds for the high market volatility i expect this year , he said sheldon jacobs , who edits the noload fund investor in irvington , ny , retains the overall lead among the five managers , with a gain of 1284 percent since the contest began on july 7 , 1993 the five portfolios have risen an average of 1076 percent since then , compared with a 1765 percent return for the vanguard index 500 , which mimics the standard poor s 500stock index the performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by lipper analytical services of summit , nj it excludes sales charges , transaction costs and taxes because most retirement money is held in taxdeferred accounts the five managers can choose any fund open to new investors from the outset , they were asked to pick portfolios that would grow for 20 years while mr jacobs leads long term , he trailed the other four managers for the quarter , with a return of 723 percent in large part , he said , because he had made the portfolio more conservative when the times told him he would be making only annual changes now that he is back to quarterly reporting , he is bolstering his largecap stock allocation and generally taking a more bullish stance to that end , he has dropped heartland value plus and usaa taxexempt intermediate , which together had totaled onequarter of the portfolio , and added a 20 percent chunk of vanguard total stock market , an index fund i 've been gradually trying to switch over to index funds , which i think are superior in the long run because of their lower expenses , mr jacobs said he chose this fund over vanguard s s p 500 fund because total stock market holds small and midcap stocks in addition to bigger ones , more closely mimicking the overall market to me , the whole concept of an index fund is not to make any judgments on the market , he said mr jacobs also added a 10 percent position in marsico focus , one of the quarter s top performers thomas f marsico , formerly of janus capital , was doing a great job with a similar fund there , mr jacobs said now he can take the same strategy and start all over eric m kobren , president of kobren insight group in wellesley , mass , runs a portfolio of allfidelity funds that gained 887 percent in the quarter , taking fourth place among the five money managers mr kobren is selling his 20 percent stakes in the lowpriced stock and midcap stock funds , replacing them with two new fidelity funds smallcap stock \( 20 percent \) and contrafund ii \( 10 percent \) while we would not recommend buying new funds simply because they are new , our research does show that new fidelity stock funds tend to outperform their mature counterparts during their first and second years of operation , mr kobren said though larger fidelity funds are forced to take a more sectororiented approach to investing , these new funds can focus on the type of bottomup stockpicking that has helped other fidelity funds to outperform their competitors in years past he also doubled the position in fidelity international value , to 20 percent , on the theory that most international markets are attractive relative to united states valuations susan dziubinski , editor of morningstar investor in chicago , took second place among the managers , with a gain of 982 percent she is making no changes to her portfolio , which includes a big chunk of international stocks to help counteract a possible slowdown in the united states those holdings fared well largely because of a heavy investment in european companies her portfolio also includes smallcap issues that did well in the quarter her only loser was oppenheimer real asset , which fell 96 percent , in large part because of falling oil prices but she s sticking with it the fund acts as a hedge against inflation and the stock market because it s more like a commodity play , ms dziubinski said chart how the 50 , 000 investments fared quarterly and cumulative performance of hypothetical retirement savings portfolios created and managed for the new york times by five investment advisers each began with 50 , 000 on july 7 , 1993 weightrefers to the percentage of the portfolio s assets invested in each fund figures are preliminary and do not reflect sales charges , if any susan dziubinski has taken over the portfolio originally managed by john rekenthaler \( source lipper analytical services inc \)
raleigh , nc , jan 13 seeking to stem damage from a fusillade of disclosures about patronage and political influence in north carolina s roadbuilding program , gov james b hunt jr dismissed his transportation secretary today , acknowledged mistakes and promised change governor hunt and his top transportation appointees have figured in months of punishing news accounts about the department s penchant for building roads and bridges that benefit political insiders , often by overriding the recommendations of state highway engineers but the popular and longserving democratic governor suggested at a news conference today that governors from both parties were responsible for creating a corrupt system over many decades and through many administrations democratic and republican , mine and others a system has evolved that no longer gives citizens and the taxpayers confidence in how priorities are set and decisions are made , he said he also was contrite we made some mistakes , mr hunt acknowledged now i want to fix it mr hunt has weathered lesser ethical storms during his four terms but none that have touched him so closely he personally lobbied the state highway administrator to replace a bridge over a reservoir near his wilson county farm , a decision that contradicted a decision by state engineers and in the most sensational disclosure of the transportation mess , a contractor wrote to mr hunt to express his anger that he was not appointed to the board of transportation despite raising the nearly 25 , 000 he claims he was told was the price for a seat we are very disappointed , the contractor , james a cartrette of columbus county , wrote to the governor last year , and feel that our money should be returned investigations by the state s newspapers and by public policy groups have revealed that appointments to the 26member transportation board most often went to political donors and that many board members used their influence to win approval for lowpriority projects that benefited themselves , their family members and their friends since the newspaper articles began appearing last fall , two members have resigned under pressure , a third pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of conflict of interest , the state auditor has ordered a full review of policymaking , and legislative committees have opened hearings after months of reports about the growing scandal , mr hunt today removed the transportation secretary , garland garrett , and made him a staff lobbyist the governor named norris tolson , who had been the commerce secretary , to the post and asked him to restructure the department in a way that would curtail the power of the state highway administrator , larry goode the rapidfire disclosures about the transportation board , whose members , appointed by the governor , oversee the department , have provided the most embarrassing moments of mr hunt s 13 years in office , his supporters and opponents agree and in a capital where democrats and republicans are waging an intense war for control of state government , the scandal has giftwrapped an issue for the republicans in a legislative election year north carolina republican leaders have been quick to link the conflictofinterest cases here to the investigations of democratic fundraising practices in washington they have pledged to use the ethics issue in their efforts this fall to expand their twoseat majority in the state house and to take control of the state senate , where democrats hold a 10seat advantage mr hunt , 60 , who served his first two terms from 1977 to 1984 and then was elected again in 1992 and 1996 , is one of the south s most enduring politicians considered a national authority on education issues , he spent 104 million in his 1996 campaign , a record for a governor s race in the state , and cruised to victory with 56 percent of the vote because he is known for his political nimbleness , mr hunt has mystified political analysts in the state by waiting nearly four months before taking action to restore public confidence in the department of transportation and its policy board but he suggested today that the board of transportation , which is by far the largest of its kind in the country , should be smaller , and that politicians and their appointees should not be able to promote road projects through backchannel lobbying and discretionary funding last week , the charlotte observer reported that mr hunt s intervention helped persuade the department of transportation to approve the replacement of a bridge over the buckhorn reservoir , an infrequently used crossing about four miles from his farm that was slated for closure the 77 million project was approved despite an opinion from department engineers that it could not be justified on economic grounds six hundred cars crossed the bridge daily , and without it there is a twoandahalfmile detour mr hunt originally defended his support for the project , saying he had spoken to mr goode on behalf of neighbors who would be cut off from their community without the bridge but several days later , he ordered the department to put a hold on the project , and today he said that his involvement had been improper i understand now that was n't the way to do it , he said the reports about the bridge followed the revelations about mr cartrette s letters , which were first reported by the starnews of wilmington in a letter to jim bennett , mr hunt s 1996 campaign finance director , mr cartrette said he had spoken with the governor about an appointment to the board of transportation mr cartrette quoted mr hunt as responding , if you will send the money , i will look out for my friends , and you are my friend mr hunt said that any suggestion of a quid pro quo appointment was totally untrue but research by democracy south , an advocacy group that studies the role of money in north carolina politics , found a strong link between political fund raising and appointments to the board of transportation the 34 board members who have been appointed by mr hunt since 1993 contributed more than 2 million to state and national campaigns , said bob hall , research director of democracy south mr hunt , the largest beneficiary , received a total of 652 , 428 from those donors for his 1992 and 1996 campaigns , mr hall said board members appointed by mr hunt have included the fundraising chairman of his 1996 campaign , a treasurer of the state democratic party and the chairmen or finance chairmen of at least 15 county campaign committees mr garrett , the deposed transportation secretary , also was a hunt fundraiser several board members have been accused of using their positions to influence road projects that benefited their businesses one of them , carroll edwards , resigned in october after it was revealed that the state had paved a dirt road leading to his wood products plant , had widened and resurfaced a second road leading there and had agreed to build a third road , which was to provide a shortcut for trucks traveling to the plant a month later , a second board member , odell williamson , resigned after the news and observer of raleigh reported that he had backed construction of a bridge and roadwidening projects that would enhance the value of properties owned by him and his family another board member , charles grady , pleaded guilty to conflict of interest last year because he used his position on the board to push a land sale to the department of transportation that earned his real estate firm a 45 , 000 commission photo we made some mistakes , gov james b hunt jr said yesterday now i want to fix it \( steve egan for the new york times \)
even when patrick rafter is having a perfect day , hair or otherwise , he sweats like a condemned man rivulets and rivers of the stuff stream from his body as he chases after his serve , screeches to a stop and braces himself for the passing shot that will try to elude his volley or cut through him like a laser it s a dangerous way to make a living , but it s the way rafter learned to play back on the australian anthills , and he has refused to modify it a year ago , his breakneck style brought him the united states open title , but last night , when all his pistons were not firing in the first two sets against hicham arazi , it nearly caused him to become the first defending men s champion in open history to be dethroned in the first round when the ponytailed rafter was not sweating bullets , he was busy dodging them a rapt audience at arthur ashe stadium watched in disbelief , and later in amazement , as the thirdseeded australian played right into and then boldly extracted himself from arazi s bestlaid plans for a major ambush instead , after two sets of mangled volleys and missed returns , rafter , who chose perseverance over panic , regrouped and kept his title defense intact with a 46 , 46 , 63 , 63 , 61 comeback after arazi used a blizzard of passing shots , and ultimately a service winner , to take a twosetstonone lead , rafter snapped to attention and the moroccan just plain snapped by the time arazi had dropped his serve to trail by 31 in the fifth set after ballooning a forehand pass way wide at break point , he was hurling racquets and epithets in all directions the 44thranked arazi , a mosquito of a man who makes a habit of getting under the opponent s and the umpire s skin , had twice reached the french open quarterfinals , but here at the open he has never won a match the comeback was rafter s fourth career reversal of a twosetstonone deficit and improved his record in fiveset entanglements to 102 , but did it leave him with a renewed sense of confidence \? not really , he deadpanned during the day , the women in white celebrated 25 years of equal treatment and equal paydays yielded another innocuous first round of victories for the seeded favorites the sport s oldgirl network mingled with the teenage terrors , and a pair of comeback queens with sentiment on their side , the fivetime champion steffi graf and the open s perennial little girl lost , jennifer capriati , had their 1998 open crusades evolve in distinctly different directions the eighthseeded graf , who missed last year s open while recuperating from knee surgery , marched straight ahead into the second round after a mildly exerting 62 , 36 , 61 dismissal of 20yearold corina morariu the 22yearold capriati , whose ranking of 109 is a reflection of the muddled straits of her game , was given a daunting openinground assignment against thirdseeded jana novotna not surprisingly , capriati foundered in straight sets and lost her fourth match in four meetings with novotna capriati s 64 , 63 defeat marked the fourth consecutive open , as well as the sixth time in her last seven grand slam events , that she has taken a firstround tumble venus williams , who raced unseeded into her first final here in 1997 , is seeded fifth and appropriately ferocious and ambitious this year expecting to retrace her steps from last year s breakthrough , williams instructed reebok to design seven outfits for 1998 , one for every round last night williams wore a navyandgold ensemble with fingernails to match and pranced through her first round test against 68thranked elena wagner , 61 , 60 the encounter was verging on a farce by its final game , with both competitors reduced to a case of giggles after wagner cranked an underhand serve into the net , and followed that with a standardissue overhand serve that also landed in the net and produced the double fault that gave williams a triple match point williams wound up needing six match points to complete the rout , then twirled her racquet atop her index finger like a baton as she showboated her way to the net for the customary handshake those who do n't improve are left behind , said williams , who predicted a brave new power game for the women s circuit in the near future with her at the helm there might be someone who comes bigger than me and taller and who has better form , but i do n't think it s going to happen i'm only 18 i'm just going to get stronger on the men s side , sixthseeded greg rusedski , who served his way into last year s final , came perilously close to taking a firstround fall , as did 12thseeded jonas bjorkman , who required five sets to outlast 17thranked cedric pioline , 62 , 46 , 61 , 67 \( 37 \) , 62 rusedski needed to squirm past two match points held by wayne ferreira before escaping with a 46 , 76 \( 72 \) , 57 , 76 \( 97 \) , 64 victory rusedski who was hobbled by ankle trouble and a muchpublicized divorce from his coach , tony pickard , this summer fired just 19 aces in the 3hour8minute match novotna , at long last a wimbledon champion after a series of tearjerkers there , did not wear a black hat into her match with capriati it just seemed that way the 29yearold novotna wore classic whites and played her classic game , and she was certain she had been miscast as the villain by the full house that jammed the old louis armstrong stadium i mean , what can i do \?

hattiesburg , miss , may 28 thirtytwo years after molotov cocktails lighted up a frosty mississippi night , the authorities here arrested three aging klansmen today and revived charges against them in the 1966 killing of vernon f dahmer sr , one of this state s most revered civil rights leaders one defendant rousted from his home early today was sam h bowers , the founder and former imperial wizard of the white knights of the ku klux klan , an organization that the federal authorities have linked to 10 killings and hundreds of other violent acts in the civil rights era mr bowers , a 73yearold businessman from nearby laurel , miss , served six years in prison after his conviction on federal charges in a separate set of civil rights slayings , the 1964 deaths of michael schwerner , andrew goodman and james chaney in philadelphia , miss but juries deadlocked in each of mr bowers s four trials in the dahmer case , where he faced charges of ordering , but not participating in , the firebombing that killed mr dahmer this time , said the mississippi attorney general , mike moore , is going to be different the dahmer \( pronounced daymer \) case marks the second time in this decade that mississippi prosecutors have used new evidence to resurrect longdormant charges in a highprofile civil rights slaying in 1994 , prosecutors in jackson overcame the burdens of stale evidence and constitutional questions to convict byron de la beckwith in the 1963 assassination of the naacp leader medgar evers as in the dahmer case , allwhite juries had deadlocked in mr beckwith s previous trials , leading to mistrials mr dahmer s family took hope from that prosecution , and pressured state and county officials to reopen the investigation of his death they did so in 1991 , and today mr dahmer s widow , ellie j dahmer , found some satisfaction as she watched on television as mr bowers was led , handcuffed and expressionless , into the forrest county jail at last , they 're bringing him into court again , at last , said mrs dahmer , who says she still sees the flames and hears the screams of her 10yearold daughter in her nightmares it s bringing us one step closer i realize we 've got a long way to go , but mississippians are stepping up and not following the old pattern mr moore also emphasized at a news conference today that a conviction in the dahmer case would signify how mississippi had changed these people have kept hope alive all these years , the attorney general said of the dahmers we 're going to try to keep it alive a little bit longer and bring the imperial wizard of the ku klux klan to justice we think that s going to send a signal to the rest of the country mr bowers and the other men arrested today , deavours nix , 72 , and charles r noble , 55 , all of whom had been previously charged in the case , were led into the county jail this morning , where they were processed in full view of television cameras mr nix , who is suffering from cancer , said radiation treatments had burned his lungs , leading prosecutors to observe that mr dahmer had died from a similar condition while judge richard w mckenzie of circuit court released mr nix on his own recognizance because of his medical condition , he ordered mr bowers and mr noble held on 200 , 000 bond both mr bowers and mr noble are charged with murder and arson , while mr nix is charged with arson alone the judge set mr bowers s trial for aug 17 the last of mr bowers s trials concluded in 1969 now , nearly three decades later , prosecutors say they have new evidence that they believe will force him to spend the rest of his life behind bars they declined today to detail that evidence but vernon f dahmer jr , one of mr dahmer s sons , said today that the most important new evidence came from a confidential informant who approached the dahmers last year the witness , he said , is a former protege of mr bowers , a teenager at the time of the killing , who has said he overheard mr bowers and mr nix discussing the plot to bomb the dahmers' house prosecutors now also have access to three interviews granted by mr bowers to state archives officials in 1983 and 1984 on the condition that they be sealed until after his death despite that agreement , prosecutors subpoenaed the transcripts , and a judge here recently ordered that they be handed over to investigators it is not known whether mr bowers confessed in the interviews to any role in the dahmer case prosecutors also viewed files on mr dahmer from the mississippi state sovereignty commission , a state agency that used spy tactics and intimidation to thwart desegregation efforts the commission s files , which were unsealed in march , make it clear that mr dahmer was under extensive surveillance , but there has been no public disclosure of documents from the files that shed new light on his death i can tell you that we do have new evidence , said mr moore , who has directed the new investigation with lindsay carter , the forrest county district attorney we have new light to shed on evidence , maybe new witnesses
when amos dacy fled his native haiti in a wobbly boat , he had a simple goal to live but though he left behind the political persecution he says could have killed him , his ordeal continues every day , mr dacy sits in a brooklyn apartment , alone and sick i spend many sleepless nights , he said , his eyes staring aimlessly i think that if i had stayed in haiti , i would have been killed now i wonder if it s worse to die alone five years have passed since mr dacy and 200 other haitian refugees with hiv , the virus that causes aids , were confined in a camp at the american naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba under a judge s order , they were finally allowed into the united states but most of them still have not won the political asylum they seek some have sickened and died others are poor and unable to get work and like mr dacy , most are struggling alone they find themselves cut off from fellow haitian immigrants , bereft of the community support that sustains many newcomers far from family and home the stigma of aids runs so deep among many haitians that most of the hivpositive refugees hide their condition , and few fellow haitians have extended open arms to them revealing her plight would be like a death sentence , said a woman in st albans , queens , who , like most of a dozen refugees interviewed , agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity this is something that my family and only close friends know about i ca n't deal with that kind of publicity for a brief moment , back in 1993 , the refugees' struggle had flared into public view as they languished at guantanamo held far longer than their fellow refugees who did not carry the aids virus they became something of a cause celebre , with vocal support from aids groups and celebrities like bruce springsteen and susan sarandon rallying to their side eventually , they were permitted to enter the united states as they awaited a final ruling on their requests for political asylum , and about 150 came to new york city but settling here proved to be just the beginning of their battle as their cases crawl through the immigration bureaucracy , most have been unable to get work permits , and hold menial jobs at best and as attention has turned to other causes , financing has largely dried up for the nonprofit groups that were helping them resettle they are still haunted by their time at guantanamo , confined in what a federal judge called an hiv prison camp some still seem unable or unwilling to believe that they are infected with a deadly virus at the same time , many are growing sicker , and about 20 have died of aids , including three in the last few weeks on top of everything has come the cold reception from their countrymen here for many haitian immigrants in new york , the refugees represent all the worst stereotypes haitians have fought to overcome impoverished , aidscarrying boat people some of the stigma lingers from the early days of the aids epidemic , when haitians in general were mistakenly classified as a highrisk group now , some social workers say , it is almost as if haitians are not allowed to have aids when the organizations aiding the refugees were in danger of losing public financing , pleas to organize against the cutback failed to galvanize the usually vocal community and no one has raised any private money to offset the loss in february , three social service agencies lost the federal grants roughly 200 , 000 a year for each group that they had used to find housing for the refugees , provide health care and counseling , and assist with immigration issues a fourth organization had its grant sharply reduced city officials who dole out the federal money , which is intended to help people with hiv , said only that they had received 400 applications and could only finance about 100 programs this year it was a competitive process , said john gadd , a spokesman for the city s department of health there were a lot of worthy applications most of the refugees still get welfare benefits and housing subsidies but with money for additional services cut off , haitian social workers warned that the refugees could face growing isolation and depression they could also find it harder to get medical treatment , even as new drugs are allowing people with hiv to live longer and stay healthier while the stark images of confinement at guantanamo galvanized outrage and support for the refugees , their silent ordeal here has left them and their social workers wondering whether people still care i do n't think they 're totally forgotten , said gabrielle kersaint , executive director of the haitian women s program , one of the organizations whose financing was eliminated but , she added , the pie is getting smaller , and people are less sympathetic toward refugees and immigrants although the refugees came from every region of haiti , the broad outlines of their stories are similar in october 1991 , after a bloody , militaryled coup that overthrew haiti s elected president , jeanbertrand aristide , soldiers hunted down many aristide supporters about 40 , 000 went into hiding and eventually fled in dangerously overcrowded sailboats , many of which were intercepted at sea by united states coast guard cutters
here is a selective listing by critics of the times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in new york city denotes a highly recommended film or series ratings and running times are in parentheses an index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 7 now playing amistad , starring djimon hounsou , anthony hopkins and matthew mcconaughey directed by steven spielberg \( r , 150 minutes \) irrefutably worthy in its attention to a longoverlooked chapter in american history , this story of a slave mutiny and subsequent trial is still a film whose zestiest character is john quincy adams \( played by mr hopkins \) it has great earnestness , impeccable credentials and mr spielberg s great storytelling power what it lacks is an oskar schindler , a flawed , threedimensional character through whom the atrocity of slavery can be understood the best moments in this long , instructive tale are those that simply bring the slaves' pride , fear and outrage to life mr mcconaughey , the weak link in casting that includes nigel hawthorne as martin van buren , should cease and desist from playing any more smart lawyers \( janet maslin \) the apostle , starring robert duvall , farrah fawcett and miranda richardson directed by mr duvall \( not rated , 110 minutes \) in a gutsy , gripping film that is unmistakably a labor of love , robert duvall gives the performance of his career he plays sonny , a southern preacher of vast charm and volcanic energy , as serious in his faith as he is flawed in nature driven to violence by trouble with his estranged wife , sonny assaults her lover and finds himself on the run in the rural south as he rebuilds his life , mr duvall defines the man s very essence in unhurried , luxuriantly watchful scenes that capture the full flavor of sonny s spiritual world real southern parishioners contribute immeasurably to the churchgoing scenes in a film that never condescends to its subject or setting \( maslin \) as good as it gets , starring jack nicholson , helen hunt and greg kinnear directed by james l brooks \( pg13 , 133 minutes \) nobody does a better job of backing characters into happiness than mr brooks does , especially when those characters are so highstrung that happiness is almost out of the question echoing the quirky appeal of his broadcast news in a more conventional sitcom atmosphere , this zingerfilled comedy a trois features high spirits , strong acting and tart writing mr nicholson , whose other recent performances have been virtually phoned in , is back in fine form playing an obsessivecompulsive misanthrope his appalling , awfully funny wisecracks account for much of the film s spiky humor , especially after he winds up with the companions he deserves a gentle gay painter \( mr kinnear \) and a lovely , longsuffering waitress \( ms hunt \) who is his own personal alice kramden complications ensue \( maslin \) the boxer , starring daniel daylewis and emily watson directed by jim sheridan \( r , 107 minutes \) this tender , wrenching belfast drama takes a far more reflective view of northern ireland s troubles than the director s more fiery in the name of the father did but it has no less passion or grit with prison and fighting as strong central metaphors , it casts mr daylewis in the title role of a loner who has served a 14year jail term and now wants the impossible a peaceful , quiet life the magical star of breaking the waves plays his estranged exsweetheart , now another prisoner s wife and also the daughter of an ira leader you have to get rid of him or you 're going to find him in a pool of blood , he tells his daughter when the boxer returns home and rekindles the romance galvanized by such tensions , mr sheridan tells a story of bravery , love and renewal with the stirring conviction that such things are possible even in perpetually embattled places \( maslin \) deconstructing harry , starring woody allen and kirstie alley directed by mr allen \( r , 96 minutes \) private life caught up with woody allen several years ago , and now , with rancorous brilliance , he returns the favor this savage , liberating comedy is one of his funniest films , and it also has a detached wisdom that transcends autobiographical trivia love , lies and the saving grace of creative imagination are at center stage here , as mr allen weaves a dizzying plot around real events and a writer s selfserving , wickedly fictionalized versions jump cuts , frank profanity and an unapologetic taste for vice give the film an invigorating honesty , and mr allen is brazen in making the most of it to those who would take offense at the nastiness of this , the film offers a ruefully mature answer tough \( maslin \) fallen , starring denzel washington and john goodman directed by gregory hoblit \( r , 120 minutes \) as a police detective who helped capture an extrascary serial killer , mr washington falls into a highconcept nightmare stylish but seriously farfetched , with a literate noir screenplay by nicholas kazan , the film brings back the killer s spirit postexecution , makes him a demon and gives him a taste for the rolling stones the film s gimmick , that the evil can pass from person to person , and that any stranger singing time is on my side with a smirk must be stalking the detective , is clever at first but not easily sustained still , mr washington brings warmth and credibility to this film from the director of primal fear , which has much the same brooding intensity since this is another of mr washington s platonic roles , embeth davidtz has the film s only notable female role , playing a theology professor who knows all about angels \( maslin \)
more than 50 , 000 fans crowded into shea stadium yesterday not only to take advantage of discount tickets and a festive kids opening day , but also to check out the surprising firstplace mets such a crowd , such a haughty beginning to the 1998 season should have assured a glorious day for the mets , win or lose it did not in port st lucie , the mets' florida home away from home each spring , another encounter with the police blotter was unfolding vincente rosario , jose brea , rudy de la cruz and natividad tavarez , four minor leaguers , none more than 20 years in age , sat in jail cells , charged with sexual battery of a 17yearold woman according to authorities , the woman , whose identity is being withheld , had gone to the florida coast town for spring break she reported that on tuesday she was cornered in a room rented by rosario and forced to have sexual intercourse with the four players before being allowed to leave the arrests remain many miles short of decisions about guilt still , the introspection buffeting the highest quarters of the mets' organization is as real as the tears authorities report being shed by the alleged victim no one at the cubsmets game here yesterday seemed more devastated by the accusations than fred wilpon , the coowner of the mets there are things that are more important than what this does for the team , wilpon said quietly in his private box at shea stadium but sexual battery is rape and it s one of the more despicable crimes in the world i do n't know whether these kids are guilty or not but we have a responsibility , now , first and foremost , to seek justice wilpon paused if they are guilty , i assure you from the depths of my soul that this organization will do nothing to ask for any special dispensation because they are athletes , he said if they are guilty , they should bear the burden of that guilt and my heart goes out to the young woman and her family , if they are guilty , too until that verdict comes , the four players are on their own rosario , a product of george washington high school in the washington heights section of manhattan , was held in lieu of 40 , 000 bail the other three players , all from the dominican republic , all on their first visit to the united states , were held on 20 , 000 bail each the team will neither provide these funds nor lend legal support all the club has agreed to is to assure the four suspects understand the legal process the mets have far too much experience in this area in 1992 , port st lucie officials took an entire spring training to investigate and ultimately dismiss accusations of sexual assault against dwight gooden , vince coleman and darryl boston last year , a minor league coach and manager in the mets' organization were fired after a player died in a car accident after he had alcohol on a team bus this spring , trouble found one of the mets' clubhouse leaders when bernard gilkey was charged with driving under the influence in port st lucie wilpon does n't know if the mets are an example of a culture in which athletes share disproportionately in aggressive , antisocial behavior what wilpon does know is he wo n't let the mets use the growing belief that athletes are out of control as an excuse this organization , he said , knows it has a responsibility to these young people to do the most we can to train them , to educate them as to what it s going to be when they are professional athletes which is why the club s employee assistance director , dr allan lans , once a fixture in the mets' clubhouse , now spends the majority of his time touring minor league sites and has flown to port st lucie to reinforce the mets' expectations with the youngsters still participating in the extended spring training program financial and legal consultants and linguists are also employed there is even a nutritionist assigned to show foreignborn prospects how to survive supermarket shopping yet an incident tuesday now necessitates not only a wait for a verdict on the four players , but an organization s efforts as well the mets' net still has holes eliminating them may require an effort equaling that of a pennant chase
limerick , ireland , sept 4 president reagan s advisers were fond of saying that people never remember the words of a president , only the pictures if that is true , president clinton this week offered a kaleidoscope of images played out on his face and in his gestures , from the pained confession of his profound regret about the lewinsky matter to his compassion for the victims of the omagh bombing he was alternately engaged and distracted , buoyant and mournful at times his eyes were locked in the thousandyard stare of the soldier who has seen too much combat his interactions with hillary rodham clinton lurched from apparent affection to icy distance but the overwhelming impression was of a man exhausted and in distress who was able , when necessary , to put aside his private pain and reclaim the brave face of the practiced performer the week has taken a dizzying trajectory for the president , from the end of a restless 10day vacation with his family on martha s vineyard to a therapeutic round of golf scheduled for saturday afternoon on the ancient links at ballybunion in southwest ireland but in between , what a ride presidents , aging and ashen a somber president stepped off air force one into a cold drizzle in moscow on tuesday morning after a 10hour overnight flight from washington he had the red , puffy eyes of the overnight traveler as he walked hand in hand with mrs clinton down the steps of the plane he met that morning at the kremlin with boris n yeltsin , but there was none of the bill and boris jocularity of past meetings the aging , ailing russian leader moved with the awkward gestures of an invalid mr clinton appeared ashen , almost funereal mr clinton was little better that afternoon in a speech in a moscow university auditorium , a familiar kind of setting for him and one he usually plays to advantage but his delivery was uncharacteristically flat , perhaps compounded by an impassive audience that did not once interrupt his remarks with applause aides explained that mr clinton was tired besides , one said , russia s political paralysis does not lend itself to laughter no vodka this time that night , mr yeltsin was the host at a state dinner in the kremlin , but this was not the customary vodkadrenched , hourslong russian affair neither mr clinton nor mr yeltsin was in the mood for hilarity although he appeared attentive , mr clinton s mind was on wall street , which the day before had suffered a 512point nose dive gene sperling , the chief white house economic adviser , whispered in the president s ear that the market was bouncing back mr clinton grinned and gave him the thumb sup sign in search of a smile the american side had signaled to the russians that the president had had a long day and asked that the dinner be abbreviated barely an hour after the party sat down to eat , the dinner broke up , an hour ahead of schedule at times , the president s demeanor matched his words on others , they were strangely out of synch twice on this trip mr clinton took questions from reporters the first occasion was in a joint news conference in the kremlin with mr yeltsin mr clinton knew he would face questions about his relationship with monica s lewinsky and the fallout from his bitter admission of aug 17 as mr yeltsin spoke , mr clinton scanned the faces of reporters , looking for a sympathetic smile and trying to gauge the level of aggressiveness two of the three questions the president took were about the lewinsky issue he said he had made a mistake and asked for forgiveness but he did not look as if he expected to get it cameras caught him at one point cradling his chin in his palms , looking like a weary businessman whose flight home had just been canceled for first time sorry' mr clinton fielded questions about the lewinsky matter again this morning , at a photo opportunity with bertie ahern , the irish prime minister reporters clamored for a response to a damaging statement on thursday from senator joseph i lieberman , democrat of connecticut , a longtime ally of the president s mr clinton said he deserved all the criticism he got and said for the first time that he was sorry about the affair but his manner appeared anything but penitent he was oddly relaxed , almost jovial as he again admitted error and called his behavior indefensible if one watched the statement on television with the sound off , one might have guessed that mr clinton was discussing mark mcgwire s chase for the homerun record the best day of the trip for mr clinton was wednesday , as he took a victory lap around northern ireland , encouraging work on the peace agreement he had helped broker and comforting the families of the victims of the bomb attack in omagh this was the bill clinton of the 1992 campaign , with perfect emotional pitch in his remarks and a soothing arm for the bereaved as he walked down market street in omagh , scene of the deadly blast , he was caught wiping away a tear in a picture that dominated the front pages of several irish newspapers date with ballybunion the president s spirits were raised by the closeness throughout the day of tony blair , britain s charismatic prime minister , a younger version of mr clinton , without the baggage of scandal mr clinton wandered back into the press compartment of air force one tonight on his way to limerick and his date with ballybunion on saturday he was somber but at ease , said the reporters who saw him he said he had had a wonderful time in ireland , but ducked substantive questions about policy or scandal he grew animated in discussing his golf date he said he has been gathering tips from professionals on how to play the course and had been looking forward for weeks to the challenges of the windwhipped links on an outcropping above the sea i'm going to be glad to get through it , mr clinton said but this trip , and the two weeks before it , have taken their toll i'm tired , said the president before returning to his cabin photos in the last week , president clinton reflected a palette of contrasting moods darker , more pensive , while listening to reporters' questions with president boris n yeltsin in the kremlin and again while waiting to speak in belfast , northern ireland but lighter , indeed , lighthearted at times in moscow , a cheerful president held up an i love mgimo tshirt \( the acronym stands for moscow state institute for international relations \) and in belfast , with prime minister tony blair of britain at his side , he offered a campaignstyle salute after speaking \( photographs by reuters \( top \) and associated press \( bottom \) \)
if there is one runner whom others fear in the final hills of sunday s new york city marathon , it is abel anton of spain he runs more like the miler that he once was than the marathoner that he is he stalks patiently , sitting on an opponent s shoulder , waiting to unleash his ferocious kick and then he goes with cold detachment a man who once slaughtered pigs for a living cannot afford to be sentimental about his work he has entered five marathons and won four , including the 1997 world championship in athens he is a former european champion at 10 , 000 meters and a bronze medalist at 5 , 000 meters three times he has competed on the track in the olympics few , if any , can match his finishing kick in the marathon sometimes he infuriates his opponents because they do the work and he leaves them behind once they are spent but they also know that they are in trouble if the race enters the final miles and he is near the lead if i am with the other athletes in the final two kilometers , it will be difficult for them to leave me , anton , 36 , said yesterday german silva of mexico has won twice in new york he does not want to run 262 miles to end up in a sprint with anton that is a blueprint for defeat if he is with the group in the last miles , we will do something to kill his kick , silva said we will not let him start with that kick at the 1997 world championship , running the course of the original olympic marathon , anton hung on the shoulder of his countryman martin fiz as if attached by a magnet it was almost a mocking gesture he knew fiz did not have the same finishing gear so fiz could only anticipate the inevitable , trapped in anton s web just before the race turned into the marble stadium used a century earlier for the 1896 summer olympics , anton jumped fiz , darting inexorably into the lead in the final 400 meters a mercedes passing a volkswagen fiz was incensed he had done all the work too bad , anton said it was the world championship , he said the most important thing was to win but anton bristles when someone suggests that he is not willing to work at the front he is just as prepared to be the piano carrier as the piano player , he said last april , at the london marathon , he and antonio pinto of portugal worked to catch abdelkhader el mouaziz of morocco , reeling him in after the moroccan broke away mouaziz held a 15second lead heading into the final mile , but anton chased him down to win with a personal best of 2 hours 7 minutes 57 seconds he slowed to wave to the crowd and missed the course record by two seconds i am always able to go and work at the front , anton said he has become a hero in his home town of soria , spain , 125 miles north of madrid fermin cacho , the 1992 olympic champion at 1 , 500 meters , is also from soria both have streets named after them when anton returned from athens with the world marathon title , 200 people were waiting at his home to greet him , he said he could only have imagined this moment , the son of a gardener in a humble family of nine children , who began running at age 14 in jeans and street shoes in a local park now he was a world champion we started with a lot of expectations to be the best , said his longtime coach , enrique pascual as a 14yearold , he could hardly support himself as a runner , so anton worked in a slaughterhouse , where he stayed until he was 21 or 22 and while sausages may not be high on the menu of most carboloading marathoners , anton still eats them regularly , although he said , they are a higher quality now than the place i worked at 25 , he qualified for the 5 , 000 meters at the 1988 summer olympics in seoul , south korea by 1994 , anton was the european champion at 10 , 000 meters but that event is dominated by african runners such as haile gebrselassie of ethiopia and paul tergat of kenya so anton switched to the marathon in 1996 , winning the berlin marathon in his first attempt at a race of 262 miles his early , continued success brought controversy last year , when another spanish marathoner , pablo sierra , accused anton and fiz of using the drug epo , a synthetic hormone that increases oxygencarrying capacity they denied it , and sierra was suspended for six months by the spanish track and field federation for making unsubstantiated accusations anton and fiz have never failed a drug test , although none exist to detect epo in a urine sample at the london marathon this year , pinto said he was suspicious of anton s training methods , which incensed anton yesterday he attributed spanish marathoning success to a strong crosscountry background and to training grants provided by the national track federation he has called for blood testing to replace urine testing in the sport , as long as the tests are conducted uniformly around the world i am always available for drug testing , anton said the new york city marathon course seems designed for a racer of anton s calm demeanor he suggested that he would run a tactical race , cautiously moving through the first 20 miles , keeping the leaders in sight , waiting to hit the accelerator in the rolling hills of central park i am here to win the race , he said photo abel anton of spain , german silva of mexico and vanderlei de lima of brazil , right , with the trophy that goes to the winner of sunday s marathon \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
washington , may 14 the house overwhelmingly approved a bill today to punish foreign countries that persecute people for their religious beliefs the lopsided vote , 375 to 41 , masked many lawmakers' ambivalence toward a popular bill that aims to champion religious liberties worldwide , but which critics say will imperil religious minorities , create a hierarchy of human rights violations and hurt united states foreign policy this was an awfully awkward vote , and i know i 'll hear from the folks back home , said representative mark sanford of south carolina , one of 14 republicans who opposed the bill but the devil was in the details under the bill approved today , countries that permit or endorse a pattern of violent attacks or other persecution against religious believers would automatically face a cutoff of united states aid , other than food and medical supplies , restrictions on exports and american opposition to loans by international financial institutions , including the international monetary fund among the countries criticized today in the debate were china , pakistan , indonesia and sudan this bill is unlikely to be adopted by the senate , which is expected to pass a measure giving the president more flexibility in dealing with countries accused of religious persecution house and senate conferees would seek a compromise between the two versions but if the compromise ends up close to the house bill , president clinton would probably veto it and despite the huge margin today , it is unclear whether twothirds votes could be achieved in the house and the senate to override a veto last month , mr clinton asked a group of 60 evangelical christian leaders at the white house to withdraw their support for the house bill none of this seemed to matter on the house floor today , where republican leaders whisked the bill through the legislative motions with only a handful of token amendments today we stand before the world to show we cannot condone and will not tolerate countries that persecute people on the basis of religious faith , said representative dick armey of texas , the house majority leader the vote marks a major victory for the christian coalition , which had lobbied heavily for the bill , and the house republican leadership , which is catering to a conservative base that has complained that speaker newt gingrich and mr armey had failed to deliver on its legislative promises in debate today on the house floor , no one disagreed that the united states should do more to promote religious liberties around the world the question was , how \? supporters of the bill said a shocking stream of incidents , from the killing of christians in pakistan and the sudan to the torture of tibetan buddhist monks with serrated knives and thumb screws , was evidence that tougher measures are needed the time has come not just to talk about religious persecution , but to do something about it , said representative christopher h smith , a new jersey republican yet it took representative frank r wolf , a virginia republican , and other sponsors of the legislation more than a year and several compromises to bring the bill to the floor that delay underscored the conflicts many republicans faced in choosing between the popular idea of protecting religious freedom and practical goals of promoting free trade , restricting immigration and limiting the size of government the bill , for example , creates a new office within the state department to track religious persecution , and makes it easier for victims of religious persecution to qualify as refugees in the united states both sides marshaled formidable coalitions of religious and humanrights groups groups supporting the bill included the b'nai b'rith , the salvation army and the southern baptist convention opponents included the national council of churches , human rights watch , the us chamber of commerce and the heritage foundation critics say the bill would undercut administration foreign policy by requiring the president to unsheath a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel in dealing with countries that condone attacks against religious believers this bill shackles the united states and says automatic sanctions are the answer , said representative lee hamilton , an indiana democrat mr hamilton said the bill s onesizefitsall approach and its definition of persecution would require washington to impose strict sanctions against allies including saudi arabia , germany , greece and israel but the bill s supporters said the president could waive sanctions in the interest of national security or the promotion of religious rights the purpose of this bill is not to impose sanctions , said representative benjamin a gilman , a new york republican who heads the house international relations committee the main purpose is to encourage countries to stop persecuting but administration officials said they feared the labeling of a country as a religious persecutor will hobble other foreign policy objectives , from arms control to trade negotiations critics also say that publicly censuring countries for abuses will be counterproductive billy graham s son , ned , a christian missionary in china , has voiced fears that the bill would draw reprisals against christians , mr hamilton said finally , opponents of the bill said its emphasis on religious persecution , while laudable in principle , would create a new hierarchy of human rights violations this would treat governmentsanctioned persecution , like rape and torture , differently if it s committed for religious beliefs than for political beliefs or ethnic cleansing , said representative nancy l johnson , a connecticut republican that s just not right mr smith called this argument bogus , and said using that rationale would have derailed the jacksonvanik amendment , the 1973 measure that linked ussoviet trade with the ability of jews to emigrate freely from russia and the other former soviet republics
such a provincial country , this america of ours poor alfred stieglitz had to struggle for nearly a decade to convince an american museum that images made with cameras were worthy of hanging on their walls and entering their collections finally , in 1910 , he persuaded the albright knox gallery in buffalo to mount an exhibition , even to buy a few photographs that were offered at such bargainbasement prices that the photographers were offended yet one museum in britain had begun collecting photographs \( though not as works of art \) by 1853 , buying pictures that were art three years later and , in 1858 , permitting the photographic society of london to put on an exhibition within the museum this pioneer and paragon was the victoria and albert museum , known as the south kensington museum until the queen renamed it in 1899 other british museums also looked kindly on photography in these early years , though none was as hospitable to the medium as the v a continental europe , too , lagged behind britain , generally refusing to recognize photography as an artistic medium with its own history until the 1890 s even then , america still turned up its country bumpkin nose at all that mechanical stuff the v a has now sent some of its varied store of treasures our way through may 3 , the sterling and francine clark art institute in williamstown , mass , has a lovely show of 75 photographs , many never seen in this country the museum and the photograph collecting photography at the victoria and albert museum 18531900 , organized by mark haworthbooth , curator of photographs at the v a the photographs in williamstown are a treat 19thcentury work at top form and in top condition one of roger fenton s marvelously awkward dinosaur skeletons vies for attention with a timeless , uncannily calm view of mountains in india by samuel bourne but the real highlights are 10 images by julia margaret cameron and 10 by gustave le gray in nearperfect condition condition is n't everything \( it really helps to have a good image before you start worrying about how scratched or abraded it is \) , but a faded image is like a drizzly day you know the sun is there but it barely shines through these prints are dazzling in grace with love , a picture of a woman holding a sleeping child , cameron infused such tender devotion into an image of motherhood that the virgin and child come to mind cameron poured her feelings into her photographs , and her feelings were often religious an untitled picture of another woman and child , with a baby asleep and the woman leaning somberly over him , may refer to the tradition of the virgin with the sleeping child as a prefiguration of christ s death in the five wise virgins , a preraphaelite group of timorous women in flowing draperies is boldly , massively crowded into the frame as if about to break through the confines of foolish expectations cameron s portrait of sir henry taylor is composed with the staunch authority of a holbein but steeped in romantic melancholy a strong directional light turns his white beard into a play of silver threads and sets the far side of his face aglow against the dark surround cameron , who began photographing at the age of 48 and is without a doubt the greatest english portrait photographer of the last century , was much criticized in her day for her outoffocus and poorly printed photographs yet the first director of the v a instantly recognized her achievement he bought 80 prints from her in 1865 , when she had been photographing for barely 18 months later that year she gave the museum another 34 , and the director soon put her work on exhibit , then toured it around the country he even lent her two rooms in the museum as a portrait studio , probably an improper commercial use of public museum space the v a s camerons have been kept in optimal museum conditions almost from the moment they were made the same is true for le gray s views of great stretches of sea with fragile ships beating their lonely way beneath exuberant clouds the le grays were the gift of a british collector who bought photographs before most esthetes ventured into this territory cameron , incidentally , is also being celebrated in boston julia margaret cameron victorian photographer , at the museum of fine arts through june 7 , is an unusually large show of 85 images , many in exceptional condition , drawn chiefly from the michael wilson collection in london anne havinga , assistant curator at the museum and curator of this show , provides clues to cameron s way of working by placing side by side variants of specific compositions or several images of the same model , sometimes playing different mythical or symbolic figures the catalogue for the clark institute show , by mark haworthbooth and anne mccauley , is full of useful information about the relationship of the museum to the photograph in the last century it points out that when the v a made its first acquisitions , photographs of works of art and monuments were considered worth collecting , but art photographs were another matter altogether
washington , dec 10 following are excerpts from testimony of the chief investigative counsel for the republicans , david p schippers , before the house judiciary committee , as recorded by the federal news service , a private transcription service on oct 7 , the house of representatives passed resolution 581 calling for an inquiry to determine whether the house should exercise its constitutional duty to impeach president william jefferson clinton thereafter , this committee heard testimony from several experts and other witnesses , including the independent counsel himself , kenneth starr since that time , my staff and i , as requested , have conducted ongoing investigations and inquiries we have received and reviewed additional information and evidence from the independent counsel and have developed additional information from diverse other sources unfortunately , because of the extremely strict time limits placed upon us , a number of very promising leads had to be abandoned we just ran out of time in addition , other allegations of possible serious wrongdoing cannot be presented publicly at this time by virtue of circumstances totally beyond our control for example , we uncovered more incidents involving probable direct and deliberate obstructions of justice , witness tampering , perjury and abuse of power we were , however , informed , both by the department of justice and by the office of the independent counsel , that to bring forth publicly that evidence at this time would seriously compromise pending criminal investigations most of those investigations , i understand , are nearing completion we have accordingly bowed to their suggestion when i appeared in this committee room a little over two months ago , it was merely to analyze the referral and to report to you today , after our investigation , i come to a point that , frankly , i prayed i would never reach it is my sorrowful duty now to accuse president william jefferson clinton of obstruction of justice , false and deliberately misleading statements under oath , witness tampering , abuse of power and false statements to and obstruction of the congress of the united states in the course of this very impeachment inquiry these are what mr lowell referred to as the insignificant offenses of president clinton whether these charges are high crimes and misdemeanors and whether the president should be impeached or not is not for me to say or even to give an opinion that s your decision i'm merely going to set forth the evidence and the testimony so that you can judge as i stated earlier , this is not about sex or private conduct it is about multiple obstructions of justice , perjury , false and misleading statements , witness tampering , abuses of power , all committed or orchestrated by the president of the united states a few words of caution , if i may the evidence and testimony must be viewed as a whole it cannot be compartmentalized please do not be cajoled into considering each event in isolation , and then treating it separately that is a tactic employed by defense lawyers in every conspiracy trial that i have ever seen remember , events and words that may seem innocent , or even exculpatory in a vacuum , may well take on a sinister or even criminal connotation when observed in the context of the whole plot for example , everyone agrees monica lewinsky testified no one ever told me to lie no one ever promised me a job when considered alone , as it has been consistently , this would seem exculpatory in the context of the other evidence we see this is again technically parsing words to give a misleading inference of course no one said , monica , go in there and lie they did n't have to monica knew what was expected of her similarly , nobody promised her a job but once she signed that false affidavit she got one , did n't she \? likewise , please do n't permit the obfuscations and legalistic pyrotechnics of the president s defenders to distract you from the real issue here a friend of mine flew bombers over europe in the second world war yes , i am old enough to have friends who flew bombers in the second world war he once told me that the planes would carry packages of leadbased tin foil strips , and when the planes flew into the perimeter of the enemy s radar coverage the crews would release that tin foil it was intended to confuse or distract the radar operators from the real target now the treatment monica lewinsky received from the independent counsel , the motives of some of the witnesses , and those who helped finance paula jones s case that s tin foil the real issues are whether the president of the united states testified falsely under oath , whether he engaged in a continuing plot to obstruct justice , to hide evidence , to tamper with witnesses and to abuse the power of his office in furtherance of that plot the ultimate issue is whether the president s course of conduct is such as to affect adversely the office of the presidency by bringing scandal and disrespect upon it , and also upon the administration of justice , and whether he has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president , and subversive to the rule of law and to constitutional government
moscow , june 12 after working five weeks as an illegal laborer on a moscow construction site , ivan , a ukrainian crane operator , was heading home to kiev last october with his hardearned wages carefully hidden where the moscow police could not find them but he had left 85 worth of russian rubles , set aside for the journey , in his pocket easy pickings for the policemen who stopped him at the railroad station and hauled him off for some rough questioning , saying he would be charged as drunk and disorderly ivan who would not give his last name insists that he was neither drunk nor disorderly but knowing the power of the authorities against illegal workers like himself , he agreed to sign a paper saying he had had one beer with that , he was thrown back out on the street , with the 85 left behind as a gift to moscow s notoriously corrupt police there is nothing we can do , we have no rights whatsoever , said ivan , 55 , who is now back in moscow on another illegal job , living a tenuous existence in a dilapidated wooden camper with a halfdozen other illegal workers from ukraine , all here in desperate search of work by some estimates , there are as many as a million foreign workers in and around moscow many from ukraine , moldova and other parts of the former soviet union who come here offering their labor at virtually any price some are paid as little as 100 a month , some three times as much some get paid virtually nothing once the cost of housing and food have been deducted just as in the old days of the soviet union , moscow is a magnet for the rest of country , and beyond in those days , people came to shop for goods that were hard to find anywhere else now they come to work and to soak up some of the riches that have poured into the russian capital , home to about 10 million people seven years after the collapse of soviet communism , the official unemployment rate in this city is a remarkable seventenths of 1 percent the unofficial rate is probably higher , labor experts say , but then so is the number of blackmarket jobs , many in sidewalk kiosks or wholesale markets , but also in the privatesector service economy but the greatest number of illegal migrants work in moscow s bustling building trades , constructing the myriad office and apartment complexes that now dot the city s skyline , catering to the new middle class s craze for evroremonts , the word coined to describe apartments remodeled to west european standards compared with the bleakness of outlying regions , where salaries can be less than 100 a month , moscow has the air of a fairytale metropolis , an emerald city rising in the midst of a depressed postindustrial landscape its exuberant , often vulgar prosperity is symbolized by its highrises decked with fanciful towers and domes , its sparkling shop windows and many furniture and appliance stores catering to the brisk evroremont market that contrast is most vivid at the city s train stations , where local employers come to meet particular trains particularly from ukraine , belarus and moldova scanning the platforms for young men with telltale rough hands and carrying cloth bags filled with work clothes and even provisions not all the foreign workers in moscow come from the former soviet union according to the city s migration service , which has legally registered fewer than 50 , 000 workers , the largest group in this category is turks , employed by large turkish construction companies in large projects including refurbishing the home of the russian parliament but as aleksandr vavrov , chief of the service s international relations bureau , concedes , the vast majority of foreign workers in moscow are illegal , and thus uncounted with only 10 inspectors , he said , the city is only just beginning to track down violators the first companies sanctioned for hiring unregistered workers , however , were not the big construction companies , many of them closely linked to city hall , but mcdonald s and procter gamble the migrants , for the most part , are taking jobs at wages muscovites would refuse it s like in switzerland , said a young belarussian who sleeps at night in the apartments where he works days sanding and painting it s work local people do n't want to do but what may be slave wages in boom town moscow can be a princely sum back where the illegal workers come from ivan , for instance , brings home money to help support his daughter , who is a teacher , and his son , a doctor , whose salaries in ukraine average 60 a month i have seen a whole village come from moldova , with women and children , said a young man who has worked as a recruiter for a moscow construction company and spoke on condition that he not be identified it is the opportunity that brings them here , because they have none at home they come knowing there is a risk in how they will be treated , but they come anyway they end up in a situation of virtual slaves , said konstantin krylov , secretary of the federation of independent trade unions there is no one who can defend them the employer can pay what he wants , make them work as much they can not all migrants make it all the way into moscow , where the police routinely check people s documents , searching the streets for foreigners who can include russians without moscow residence permits russian courts have found moscow s permit system , a holdover from soviet times , to be unconstitutional but that has not stopped the city s mayor , yuri m luzhkov , from enforcing it anyway , deploying the police on missions that often amount to nothing more than officially sanctioned shakedowns , with fines averaging about 8 for those who do not want to risk an encounter with the police , there is also work to be had on the city s outskirts , among muscovites' dachas , or country houses arriving in bands of three or four , the workers knock on doors , offering to repair porches or roofs or plant trees in return for room and board and , if they are lucky , maybe 200 a month we work in the summer , and then go home in the winter , like bears going into hibernation , said nikolai , who together with three friends had found a job in a village of dachas southeast of moscow the alternative , he said , is to stay at home in mordvinia , a region in central russia , and live off his wife s earnings from the local lightbulb factory , which in recent months have amounted to bags of flour and sugar in many ways , these construction workers resemble illegal immigrants the world over , whether chinese women working in sweatshops in lower manhattan or mexican farm workers in california but the difference is that , for 70 years of soviet rule , russia was a country that elevated workers' rights to the level of a state religion now , for many workers in the private sector , legal and illegal , it is a country where all power has shifted back to the employers , many of whom are more ruthless than those in prebolshevik russia if you are getting paid under the table , you are getting ripped off , said irene stevenson , field representative in russia for the american center for international labor solidarity the employers are avoiding an entire range of taxes , which in turn leaves an entire range of people unprotected in the case of migrant workers , it is a complete violation of rights , because they have nowhere to appeal photo illegal workers from russia , countries once part of the soviet union and beyond flock to moscow , where jobs , many off the books , are plentiful men just off a train from the ukraine crowded a railroad platform \( james hill for the new york times \)
congress , which has largely stopped building public housing for the poor , now threatens to turn over the available stock to lessneedy families bills passed by the house and senate would redirect federally subsidized units to nonpoor , even middleclass families some retargeting is justified , but the senate bill goes too far and the house version is worse representative rick lazio of new york and senator connie mack of florida , the sponsors , are negotiating a compromise but it is up to senator alfonse d'amato , chairman of the committee that oversees housing , to stand up for the many poor new yorkers who need help the bill s main objective is to attract working families to communities that have become socially and economically unstable because they are dominated by families in which neither parent has a job three important federal programs would be affected , none for the better the first is traditional public housing , which provides shelter for about one million families in subsidized units owned by local public housing authorities diluting concentrations of unemployed families in order to create stability makes sense but that can be done without turning away poor families because the vast majority of them include at least one working parent yet the senate bill would arbitrarily reduce by 20 percent , and the house by about 30 percent , the number of newly available publichousing units reserved for the poor the cuts make even less sense for the program under which about 15 million families use vouchers to rent private units of their choice tenants who use vouchers spread themselves throughout the rental market and are not dangerously concentrated in any single building yet the senate bill would reduce the number of vouchers for the poor by about 30 percent , the house by almost 60 percent under the third big federal housing program , about 15 million families live in project based rental units set aside in specific buildings here there are destabilizing concentrations of the nonworking poor , yet the house bill badly overreacts by eliminating any requirement that these units be made available to poor families families making as much as 35 , 000 , nearly three times the poverty line , would qualify for this housing both bills would needlessly shrink the available subsidized housing stock for the very poor , but the house version is unacceptably harsh mr d'amato is perfectly positioned to insist that the conference bill take no step worse than the senate s
the stock market may be gyrating madly , but the value of the yankees as a televised product is soaring the yankees won 114 games this season and their television ratings are splendid so it s not shocking that channel 5 heavily outbid channel 11 to carry 50 yankee games in both 1999 and 2000 the yankees should do for channel 5 what the nfl did for the fox network , said michael wach , the general manager of foxowned channel 5 , referring to the stunning 16 billion deal fox made in 1993 for the national football conference package we will make money with the games channel 5 will pay between 350 , 000 and 400 , 000 a game or 175 million to 20 million per season channel 11 bid somewhat less than 300 , 000 per game george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , gets none of the channel 5 money it flows to the msg network through its 12year , 486 million deal that allows it to control the team s local cable and broadcast rights the channel 5 deal acknowledges how highly msg values yankee rights at 350 , 000 per game , channel 5 s payment will nearly equal what msg is paying the yankees msg s rights payment to the yankees in 1999 will be 5425 million , or 361 , 666 per game in 2000 , the rate rises to 368 , 333 per game in earlier deals with channel 11 , msg had never done so well from 1991 to 1993 , msg paid the station 5 million to carry 50 games a season msg paid 25 million in 1994 and 1995 , and shared advertising revenues with channel 11 channel 11 s final yankees deal to carry 40 games in 1997 and 50 games this past season for which it paid between 200 , 000 and 250 , 000 per game was marginally profitable , said paul bissonette , channel 11 s general manager about 10 days ago , bissonette sensed that channel 11 was out of the running after a 48year run msg said they had an offer far beyond what we offered and there was no further discussion , he said they were in a preemptive situation where they did n't expect us to come back and top the bid channel 5 s strategy was obviously borrowed from the fox playbook like the network before it bought the nfc package , channel 5 is struggling , and it needs a reliable ratings producer and image enhancer like yankee games when we carry games in prime time , the games will be an excellent leadin to the news , wach said it s a whole new audience stream that was n't watching us in image alone , it s a whole different level for us yankee games this season averaged a 67 nielsen rating on channel 11 , the best in 10 years for the fox baseball games seen saturday afternoons on channel 5 , the rating averaged a 72 that s a big audience to promote to , wach said and make no mistake this was a fox deal yesterday s announcement was organized by fox sports and faxed on fox sports stationery no deal this big can occur without an ok from the lead fox , rupert murdoch , or dispensation to occasionally preempt fox network primetime shows channel 5 will show about eight weeknight primetime games , compared with 29 this season on channel 11 we 'll preempt the primetime nights that have the least negative effect on the network , wach said most of channel 5 s yankee games will be seen on weekends and late nights from the west coast , to avoid preempting fox programming channel 11 carried the yankees on thursday and friday nights , two of the evenings that the wb network was not supplying entertainment programming but the wb recently added thursdays , and channel 11 would have had trouble finding 50 yankee slots if it had made a new deal with msg msg comes out a big winner , getting more money and being able to show more games in prime time than it had , which lets it sell advertising at higher rates msg s yankee games averaged a 376 rating , up 34 percent from 1997 as for announcers , wach only said that he wants to find a role for the retired phil rizzuto hopefully , channel 5 will not bring bobby murcer and tommy john back murcer showed little improvement over the years , making too many mistakes and being inattentive to details the occasional insight from john was often counterbalanced by too much yakking channel 5 s arrival as a baseball telecaster can only please the mets , whose deal with channel 9 has expired a bidding war between channel 9 and channel 5 could break out mark bingham , a mets' senior vice president , would not say if the yankeeless channel 11 has come calling he said we 're thrilled that another player is jumping into the marketplace people are waking up to the value of marketing with baseball and aligning themselves with baseball bissonette described any interest by channel 11 in a mets' package as premature but he added , we would never rule anything out airwaves a technical problem caused nbc to keep a fullscreen graphic on screen which had nothing to do with what was happening as the yankee rookie shane spencer swatted his home run wednesday too bad the division series is spring training for nbc , which shows no games during the season except the allstar game every other year mike wallace s 60 minutes profile this sunday of ila borders , the only woman pitching in professional baseball , for the duluth diamonds of the northern league , is both illuminating and sad
nothing else matters nothing else , it seems , is permitted to matter only the nineinning tallies and intervening dramas of a handful of baseball games face it , either you 're into baseball these days or you 're totally out of it over the last few weeks , and especially over the weekend when the reality of the world series finally manifested itself on the field of yankee stadium , disparate strands of new york have been transformed into that idiosyncratic and muchstudied taxonomic group known as the fan suddenly the most important thing in the world seems to be whether a team that has already won a preposterous 23 championships in 75 years will insist on one more as the yankees prepare for game 3 tonight against the padres in san diego , with new york ahead two games to none and the scent of sweep in the air , people who all year long have paid incidental attention to batters swatting balls and pitchers throwing smoke have become caught up in mass homage to a team that is nothing less than a victory machine it is something that baseball does , especially in new york , where a sense of entitlement to baseball sovereignty is almost primal , and especially in this magical year enlivened by the enthralling pursuit of a ghost s home run record and the voracious accumulation of victories by a yankee team striving to be engilded as the greatest of all people in the area have been absorbed into this deliberate , elegant , endlessly complex pastime almost against their will , unable to resist the ceaseless murmurings about the series and the mighty yankees that is how it unfolded for marla rodriguez , who up until now has unapologetically loathed baseball she is 32 and works in sports media relations at rutgers university football is her abiding passion , entranced as she is by its savage aggression and that people are always hitting each other i normally hate baseball , she said it s very boring nothing ever happens it s too slow whenever someone turned a baseball game on the television , she became angry but every day in the last few weeks , wherever she went , the banter was about the yankees and the series almost hypnotically , she has become a fullthroated yankee rooter now she turns the baseball games on when she speaks about the team , she refers to it as we i do n't know what it is , she said , perplexed herself it s exciting now it s close to home i'm starting to relate , wow , what it s like playing for the world series until a few weeks ago , i did n't know who david wells was now i know he s a big guy and he throws a mean fastball the voice of baseball seems to speak even louder this time around than two years ago , when the yankees returned after a ludicrously long lapse to reclaim the world championship and when baseball was still in such disfavor from the players strike of 199495 the temperate days have been spectacular baseball weather and , in part , the consuming and comforting divertissement of baseball has been seen as something of a mercy gift so many people are by now fully spent from hearing salacious tales of misbehavior in washington and hyperventilating about the capricious stock market they would rather dwell on who is batting 401 than their own 401 jacqueline marshall , 30 , a special education teacher from queens , who openly admitted to her sunshine fan status \( she watches when the going gets good \) , spoke of this exorcism from daily entanglements not only is she tired of learning of plane crashes and the washington soap opera , but there have been frailties closer to home this summer , a former student of hers was charged with assaulting a man on long island it feels good to watch baseball , she said it s good news for a change for some people , side dramas have resonated , like darryl strawberry s somber confrontation with cancer when i heard he had cancer , i could relate , because my wife had cancer of the lymph nodes , though she s in remission now , said jim williams , 24 , an auto mechanic in poughkeepsie , ny , who is not usually into baseball that s when i started watching the way his teammates reacted really brought me in by now , it seems , people have grown somewhat more accustomed to players who perpetually put on new uniforms in pursuit of gross national productlike salaries it is hard not to adore a team of so much harmony and so little swagger , with frolicsome players named boomer and el duque and what else are you going to watch \? this has been a good baseball season and this yankee team has been very good , said the author david halberstam , who has written about baseball and it s an appealing team it s fun watching this team and there s nothing else out there you do n't have very good football teams you do n't have a basketball season in place there s a vacuum it s bad enough that the stock market is going down without your football teams going down baseball and the world series have this consciousnessaltering effect in a way that other sports do not the super bowl is big , but it is a solitary game , not the elastic , emotional unfolding that the world series is , and it is not local there is no home team baseball s older , said roger angell , the new yorker editor who often writes about the sport it has an echo , a ring to it it s a series it s not one game
washington , feb 19 margaret a williams , the former chief of staff to hillary rodham clinton , says she tries not to read the news from washington these days every time ms williams , who is trying to live unnoticed in paris , learns of another white house friend going before another grand jury , it reminds her of what binds her and dozens of other clinton associates to this administration huge legal bills and it is not only highlevel aides like ms williams from presidential counselors to secretaries , from press officers to stewards , employees in the first five years of the clinton white house have been overwhelmed with often huge legal bills as they deal with the varied inquiries into the clintons' personal and business affairs as a result , they have set up legal defense funds , borrowed money from parents and the white house credit union , and depleted personal savings accounts as they try to pay for lawyers to represent them president clinton s allies announced on wednesday the creation of a legal defense fund to help the first family pay off legal bills that are now approaching 32 million while the announcement served to highlight the crushing legal bills associated with the long investigations into the clintons , the fund will do nothing to help dozens of lowerlevel white house employees who have had to testify before juries and congressional committees looking into the clintons' personal and business dealings since 1993 for ms williams , who came into the government from a moderately paying post with the children s defense fund in 1993 , that has meant 350 , 000 in legal fees and she left washington before the inquiry into mr clinton s relationship with a former intern , monica s lewinsky , drew a whole new cast of white house officials to a grand jury you 're talking to a person who had maybe , in her life , 10 , 000 worth of debt , at any given time , ms williams said quietly over the telephone the other evening , recounting the ordeal of her years here it scared me i did n't know what i could do about it i love , i love , i love being an advocate , ms williams continued but being an advocate in the government service certainly has many more hazards than one would have ever thought i think that s really sad , mostly i'm kind of like past angry because , you know , all of us will kind of get through this but it certainly is not an experience that beckons anyone who is looking to come in and sign up for government ms williams was one of a halfdozen current and former officials who described in interviews this poignant legacy of the administration the clinton associates who have been saddled with the sudden and crushing debt of having to testify about the president or his wife while it has been going on , almost ceaselessly , with grand juries and congressional investigations over the years , it has never been quite as public as it has been since television cameras staked out the grand jury convened by the independent counsel , kenneth w starr , to hear evidence of mr clinton s relationship with ms lewinsky watch the parade into the grand jury every time a white house aide walks into that room , a lawyer is racking up fees , said george stephanopoulos , the former senior adviser to mr clinton who testified last month in the lewinsky inquiry , and was the only one of those subpoenaed in the lewinsky case who was prepared to discuss the topic on the record a single trip to the grand jury can cost you 10 , 000 the mounting legal bills have long stirred a debate in mr clinton s circles about how much of the blame for this belongs with the clintons , who seem to draw investigations the way trailer parks draw tornadoes , and how much should be laid at the feet of an aggressive independent counsel and a republicancontrolled congress in truth , white house aides have been called before grand juries regularly in the 20 years since the independent counsel law was enacted but never at the pace that has been set under mr clinton a white house spokesman , joseph lockhart , declined to provide a count of aides who have been called over the course of the administration but about 15 current and former white house aides have been called before this grand jury perhaps another 20 were called before earlier grand juries and congressional inquiries several white house aides maintained that this has been particularly damaging because mr clinton s white house tended to be younger and less financially secure you have to remember that we 're all young people who came into public service with basically no assets and left with exorbitant legal bills that none of us can afford to pay , said a former senior white house official while mr clinton was forming a legal defense fund , less well known current and former white house aides found their own ways to deal with the cost one aide , with an annual salary of 32 , 000 , borrowed 400 to pay a lawyer neel lattimore , a former press secretary to mrs clinton , said he turned to his parents for help
john sahag , his green leather pants slung low around his waist , was snipping bits of a client s hair with studied care he finished the cut , lit a camel and explained why he started his own line of shampoos , conditioners and styling goop it s not about selling things , said mr sahag , whose salon is at 49th street and madison avenue we are obsessed with beauty , and people who dig that will buy our products these days , it s not enough to have a highconcept salon complete with waifs serving cappuccino like mr sahag , a number of upscale hairdressers in manhattan are also selling their own haircare products john frieda began doing it in 1991 and frederic fekkai in 1993 kim lepine , stephen knoll , brad johns and bumble and bumble also have their own lines mr sahag s came out last month , and another stylist , john barrett , plans to introduce his name brand soon there is nothing new about stylists selling their own shampoo vidal sassoon , after all , started his highly successful haircare line in 1973 but until recently relatively few have followed mr sassoon s lead now , with chefs selling cookbooks and makeup artists selling cosmetics , many hairdressers are betting that the time is right this is definitely a trend , said amy astley , the beauty director of vogue magazine the magazine , she said , has a huge story on the subject in its may issue mr sahag and other stylists say they were driven to develop their own products because of a lack of good alternatives on the market as the tale commonly goes , the hairdresser who has been mixing his or her own balms and unguents for years is being urged by clients to sell them it is such a normal step , ms lepine said you are always talking about products to clients privately , many hairdressers will grudgingly admit that if you believe this is the only reason behind the trend , you probably also believe supermodels who say they do n't diet in fact , haircare products can be a big moneymaker for stylists sales for mr frieda s line were about 70 million last year , said his financial officer , kate sears you will make more money selling things , said michael gordon , the owner of bumble and bumble , on 56th street between lexington and third avenues cutting hair just is n't as profitable and having shampoo with your name and logo on it is also a form of advertising if you are a salon , you are in a woman s date book every few weeks , said melissa bedolis , the editor of salon news magazine , a trade publication if you are in her shower , she sees you every day still , for some stylists , becoming a brand name brings personal satisfaction your name is on the product , mr fekkai said it is extremely flattering to see people who want to buy a piece of frederic fekkai cynics say it is marketing more than anything else that differentiates one haircare line from another stylists , and some who write about them , disagree most bread has the same ingredients , said linda wells , editor in chief of allure magazine but there is a difference between wonder bread and what you buy at ecce panis , an upper east side bread shop whether the products are really different or not , the haircare market has become rather crowded lately , ms bedolis said the key to success , she said , is to define a niche this is in part a matter of price some stylists pitch their products as special yet affordable the items in mr frieda s line go for under 10 others , like mr barrett , whose products will sell for about 25 each , are aiming for a strictly upscale market hairdressers also define their lines with signature products mr johns , who is a colorist , emphasizes products that work for hair that has been colored , while mr frieda has become known for frizzease , a siliconebased thick styling liquid for those with coarse locks there is also great variety in the way the products are packaged mr sahag s line comes in minimalist pots and bottles in muted earth colors we did n't go out and create this myth about it being made in a temple in tibet , he said i created a line that worked his container of midlevel spray finish reads hair floats into place with a flawless memory unaware that anything is there by contrast , mr barrett s products are packaged in green tubes with caps made out of wood , and descriptions that trumpet their natural ingredients bee hold , reads one tube beeswax and arnica style dressing mr barrett explained that arnica was a native american herb a critical question for stylists in the haircare product business is how big their lines should get one way to go is to sell to as many people as possible the other approach is to pitch the products to a limited market , to maintain what is known in the business as an exclusive aura it was very important for me not to go mass market , mr fekkai said i wanted to establish this as upscale mr frieda s line , by contrast , is mass market his items can be found in all types of stores , from drugstores to supermarkets mr knoll also sells in drug stores but in a more limited fashion at the other end of the spectrum are ms lepine and mr johns their products are available only at their salons and through 800 numbers they have set up , though that may change we are trying to decide between selling to the profession or retail , ms lepine said we could go as far as the home shopping network the distinction between professional and retail is important bumble and bumble and mr sahag sell their products directly through salons around the country this traditionally has been the way to keep a product line high end , although in recent years salon products have been winding up in drugstores through a gray market on the other hand , mr barrett , whose salon is situated at the top of bergdorf goodman , on fifth avenue and 58th street , and mr fekkai , who has a distribution deal with chanel , do not sell in salons their wares can be found in exclusive department stores like neiman marcus given how competitive the business is , none of the stylists interviewed would discuss specific plans but mr sahag , for one , has high hopes i have invested everything that i have made in this process , he said i have spent over 1 million photo is it all marketing \? says one editor there is a difference between wonder bread and what you buy at ecce panis \( naum kazhdan the new

at last , a medicinal victory the mets broke through last night , just when it seemed a teamwide slump and a sea of apathy in shea stadium would consume all that was good about april even with the 91 explosion against the hapless expansion arizona diamondbacks , the mets still boast only one player with as many as three home runs , rich becker the atlanta braves , the team the mets are fading behind in the national league east , had two players in double figures , seven with at least four atlanta s michael tucker has five in the last five games when todd pratt , called up from the minor leagues , hit a threerun homer in the eighth inning last night , it was the mets' first home run in 67 innings it was the team s fifth in 17 games those numbers would be more than enough to cause a rumble in the bronx not so in queens right now we 're going to hold on until we can get guys healthy , or make a deal from outside that improves us , mets general manager steve phillips said before getting the relief he needed most the mets' second victory in their last nine games but again , the biggest issue is that even when people realize there might be a fit , timing is the issue technically , the mets still have time but as yogi berra once said , it gets late early around here the mets have to hope that it is n't already too late when the punch they need arrives , either from the transaction wire or off the disabled list before beating up on the club with the fewest victories in the league , the mets knew their faithful were squirming , knew that their public image was one of settling for less while sitting dead in the water todd hundley , edgardo alfonzo and bernard gilkey remained sidelined with injuries butch huskey , brian mcrae and carlos baerga all contributed last night , but none could buy a hot streak and john olerud could not do it alone luis lopez , craig paquette and becker were not providing answers consistently , yet the mets' public approach to pending offensive meltdown seems to be to mimic a team that has it all like , say , the yankees that leaves mets fans all but pleading for a gary sheffield , a tony phillips , a reggie sanders , even mets minor leaguers such as preston wilson and jay payton steve phillips insists that he is not ignoring the rumbles , or standing pat purposely we are calling and doing things to try to make acquisitions , he said yesterday as the rain and the doubts fell on shea before the victory but this is a tough time of year for people to want to part with numbers , or take on money so while the downsizing marlins might still want to jettison a sheffield , they might not want some of the veteran mets pitchers because of the contracts they carry the expos also might not want prospects in return for a mark grudzielanek or a carlos perez nor might the white sox for a robin ventura conversely , the mets are n't eager to assume a sixyear commitment to someone as mercurial as sheffield or an albert belle or the still available , unsigned tony phillips , who would have to play himself into shape as for the reds' reggie sanders or other fallen stars , the mets have many struggling batters and need no more projects , steve phillips said good reasons , perhaps still , this is a town that demands not only winners , but also instant gratification so phillips , the general manager who was being patted on the back by fans 10 days ago , is being pilloried for not shaking the team up today , if not yesterday look , this is new york , so it s not to where you could say , 'try to understand what happened here our plan did n't put us in this position , injuries and things that were somewhat beyond our control did , ' he said yes , we are calling to see if we can make a deal , but of all the times of the year to bring in instant offensive help , it s difficult even understanding that , it is new york s nature , it s birthright , to demand that the mets overachieve , that the mets make like the yankees , a team that can make a cecil fielder , a tim raines appear at any time of the year especially when great pitching is being wasted when great expectations about competing with the mighty braves are being exposed the discerning new york public , fickle but not stupid , is not buying all the rationales being put forth even with last night s outburst , the club has reached double digits in hits in only 3 of its last 13 games until huskey chipped in with three runs batted in and pratt another three , no mets hitter , other than the utilityman jim tatum , had driven in more than two runs in a game since april 21 as it is , the mets still have just 13 homers , one fewer than the major league leader , vinny castilla that means hopes and prayers against teams more adept than the diamondbacks it mean long days for steve phillips , who has to hope that the waiting game , if that is what it is to be , wo n't prove fatal it may be may , but berra s words often prove true , especially in a city that demands moves toward improvement , if not perfection , from its professional teams
washington , aug 3 after 10 weeks of sporadic and sometimes caustic debate , a majority of the house defied the republican leadership tonight and voted for a bipartisan bill that would overhaul the way the nation s political campaigns are financed the relatively strong 237to186 showing for the measure , sponsored by representatives christopher shays , republican of connecticut , and martin t meehan , democrat of massachusetts , makes it likely that the bill will be the one to prevail later this week against several competing proposals still to be considered fiftyone republicans broke with their party leadership to support the bill , while only 11 democrats bucked their party to vote against it as members of the house , you get an opportunity very few times in your career to make a historic vote , mr meehan said this was a historic vote uncertain of the outcome , even as the vote began , house members , including speaker newt gingrich , stood in the house chamber staring up at the large electronic board that shows each vote as it is cast the speaker , who by custom usually does not vote , this time voted no as support for the legislation surged past a majority , cheers and applause broke out on the democratic side of the chamber the shaysmeehan legislation would effectively ban the unlimited , unregulated donations to the political parties , or soft money , that led to the abuses in the 1996 presidential campaign the bill would also curb issue advocacy commercials by outside groups in the 60 days before an election the bill , however , is thought to have little chance in the senate to get to tonight s vote , the bill s sponsors had to surmount months of challenges as the republican leadership first tried to block the legislation from the floor and then tried to subject it to scores of amendments designed to fracture the bill s coalition recapitulating weeks of debate , the house one more time clashed over whether the bill s limit on political fundraising would restore integrity to a political process drowning in special interest money or whether it would limit free speech and alter the balance of power between the political parties trying to prevent any lastminute democratic defections , the two senior democratic leaders of the house took part in the closing debate to make impassioned pleas for the legislation there is a national crisis of confidence in our system of campaign financing , said representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the minority leader it is a crisis of confidence that cuts across party lines and should disturb all of us as democrats , as republicans , as americans several republicans argued that their party which has had a traditional fundraising advantage would be hurt because the measure does not prevent organized labor , which generally backs democrats , from devoting union dues to political campaigns to my republican colleagues , let me just simply say this is not reform , said representative tom delay of texas , the majority whip this is not good government this is political disarmament it does nothing to protect union members from forced union dues while putting shackles on our traditional supporters mr delay accused some republicans of voting for the measure simply because they thought the senate would be sure to kill it the bipartisan coalition backing the shaysmeehan measure countered by turning to a conservative member of the rebellious republican class of 1994 to make their closing argument vote yes on this bill , implored that member , representative zach wamp of tennessee the truth is this bill is as fair to republicans as democrats despite the vote , the shaysmeehan bill faces a few more hurdles to win final house passage under a byzantine voting process in which 11 different overhaul proposals have been pitted against one other the measure only moves to a final vote if none of the nine plans still standing obtain a larger majority voting is expected to continue later this week because of the strong showing for the shaysmeehan legislation , representative tom campbell , republican of california , said he would withdraw his own proposal but representative asa hutchinson , republican of arkansas , said he would still be fighting to pass another bipartisan plan that he drew up with other house freshman the measure contains a less stringent ban on soft money on that measure , mr shays said , the only other bill we need to be concerned about is the freshman bill i hope it gets a respectable vote but i hope it does n't get 237 even if the shaysmeehan bill passes the house , its chances are considered remote in the senate , where senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , has said he does not want to consider it in the closing weeks of the session leading into the midterm elections earlier this year a companion bill sponsored by senators john mccain , republican of arizona , and russell d feingold , democrat of wisconsin , died when it won majority support but not the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster mr meehan argued that the house action would put new pressure on the senate , particularly on senators up for reelection this year across the last decade , numerous efforts to refine the campaign finance laws have died the democraticcontrolled congress passed legislation in 1992 only to see it vetoed by president george bush president clinton came into office in 1993 pledging to overhaul the system , but legislation collapsed in 1994 when senate republicans started a filibuster the proponents of campaign overhaul had hoped that the congressional hearings on mr clinton s unrestrained pursuit of campaign funds in 1996 would give them new momentum but the republican leadership made clear that they were more interested in investigating mr clinton than in changing the law yet improbably and against all odds , the effort by mr shays and mr meehan has only snowballed earlier this year , mr gingrich tried to dispense quickly with the campaign finance issue under rules that never allowed the bipartisan bill to the floor that sparked an incipient rebellion and almost cost republicans control of the house floor in response , the republican leadership decided to switch tactics and try to kill the campaign finance bill through openness , allowing months of debate on 11 proposals and numerous amendment efforts mr shays and mr meehan had to accept some amendments they would have preferred to avoid , like one banning political contributions from noncitizens who are legal residents of the country but time after time , holding a solid majority of the house behind them , they fought off other amendments that they said would have killed their bill by driving away large numbers of supporters down to the last hours today , the supporters of their bill were making telephone calls and holding meetings to keep in their fold wavering black , hispanic and antiabortion democrats , who were concerned about opposition from antiabortion groups and by immigrants rights groups that had turned against the bill because of the amendment blocking donations from legal residents who are not citizens in the end , few democrats bolted from their party photo members of the coalition for campaign overhaul met yesterday in the office of representative christopher shays of connecticut , in

the cardinal tells a hasidic tale no one , as it turned out , made any heard the one about the priest and the rabbi \? jokes possibly because there were so many priests and rabbis around , nibbling on kosher hors d'oeuvres on tuesday night , ambassador shmuel sisso , the consul general of israel in new york , and dozens of jewish leaders invited john cardinal o'connor , the archbishop of new york , and dozens of roman catholic officials to ambassador sisso s upper east side town house for a reception to commemorate the fifth anniversary of an agreement that established formal diplomatic relations between israel and the vatican ambassador sisso , who had paperwhite flowers flown in from the jordan valley as a gift to the cardinal , did not venture into theological debate but cardinal o'connor , seeking to make a point about deceptive appearances in international relations , tried his hand at the hasidic folk tale the one he related went something like this in olden days , a woman who believed rabbis could perform miracles asked a rabbi to help find her lost husband the rabbi got up on a chair and said he could see her husband about 120 kilometers away she asked , if you can really see that far , why did you have to get up on a chair \? because , the rabbi said , i wanted to appear normal playing guest for a change bismark irving has spent the last 10 new year s eves in a tuxedo , working to make sure that thousands of other people had a good time tonight he plans to have one for himself his black tie will be in a box he will join about a dozen people at an upper east side dinner he will fret over none of the details why does n't he sound happy about it \? well , i wo n't have all that magic upstairs around me , you know \? said mr irving , 44 , who since 1987 had served as the maitre d'hotel at rainbow and stars , atop rockefeller center the cabaret is part of the rainbow room restaurant complex , which is under new management and was closed dec 19 it will now be used mostly for private parties , which means mr irving is between jobs funny enough , today i was shopping at saks and i thought as i was looking around , 'hey , i do n't have to wear a tuxedo this year , ' mr irving said yesterday it will be nice , but it will feel strange it will also be strange to think about that place up there without all of us on a new year s when he started there , mr irving no one at the rainbow room ever called him that he was known as bismark was the kind of starryeyed new yorker for whom the room seemed to have been created he grew up in hutchinson , kan , and before he moved to the city , he and friends would drive here from kansas just to catch a broadway show since new year s eve 1988 , he presided \( in the manner of rick at rick s cafe americain \) at the lavish 450aperson celebrations , which recently featured a conga line threading its way through the elegant tables i 'd always be there until about 3 in the morning made for a very long day , he said i'm looking forward to being a guest , i guess i do n't know how it will feel talking of pigs and bad blood elke sommer , the german actress renowned lately for her runins with the hungarian actress zsa zsa gabor , has won the latest round in a court battle with ms gabor s husband , prince frederick von anhalt a bavarian court rejected an appeal from the german prince , who had been ordered by a lower court to stop telling people that ms sommer had once said , all german men are pigs but since ms sommer could not prove that she had not made the statement , the court did not order the prince to make a full retraction there has been bad blood between the two actresses , ms sommer said , ever since she once remarked that ms gabor had a big rear end randy kennedy photo cardinal o'connor
in new york city s second death penalty trial since the state reinstated capital punishment three years ago , a brooklyn man was convicted of firstdegree murder yesterday by a jury that will now decide whether to sentence him to death for killing another man while robbing him of his jewelry the jury in state supreme court in brooklyn found that jermaine page , a 24yearold exconvict , fired the shots that killed marvin mcintosh , 28 , in a 1996 street robbery near mr page s home in east new york the jury rejected the defense argument that the fatal bullets had been fired by a teenager whom the prosecution described as a second gunman on the threeperson robbery team the teenager faces trial on a charge of seconddegree murder , which is not punishable by death if the jury decides to sentence mr page to be executed by lethal injection , rather than to life in prison without the possibility of parole , when it convenes oct 27 for the penalty phase of the trial , mr page will join the only other convicted murderer to receive a death sentence under the 1995 law that restored capital punishment in new york state in june , the other man , darrel k harris , was sentenced to death in the same brooklyn courthouse , after a jury in the state s first trial under the law convicted him of firstdegree murder for killing three people in a robbery at an illegal social club in yet another trial under the statute , a jury in buffalo began hearing testimony yesterday on whether to impose a death sentence on jonathan parker , whom the panel last week convicted of firstdegree murder for shooting a police officer to death last year as the verdict was announced in mr page s monthlong trial , the defendant , a man with closely cropped hair and a slight goatee , bent his head downward and shook it from side to side as he stood at the defense table in its 12 hours of deliberations during three days , the jury rejected an alternative charge of seconddegree murder , which is punishable by a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison that charge simply accused mr page of being part of a team of robbers who killed mr mcintosh , an employee of a private mail service who lived on staten island , without specifying who fired the fatal shots he is a very sad young man , one of mr page s lawyers , steven j chaikin , said of his client after speaking with him after the verdict mr chaikin declined to comment on the jury s action , although he and mr page s other lawyer , gary s villanueva , are expected to ask justice l priscilla hall next week to set aside the jury verdict as not warranted by the evidence mr chaikin also declined to say what the defense would argue , should the judge sustain the verdict , to persuade the jury that mitigating factors dictated that mr page should be sentenced to life in prison rather than execution under the law , mitigating factors include circumstances like the defendant s having been mentally or emotionally disturbed or under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the murder none of the testimony at the trial so far has indicated any such condition , but that does not preclude the introduction of evidence during the penalty phase one of the prosecutors , joseph alexis , an assistant district attorney , said after the verdict , there is no joy or happiness that anybody can derive from this one young man has already lost his life and another young man is going to begin the penalty phase with his life on the line , in an absolutely senseless but brutal murder , mr alexis said but the jury weighed the evidence very seriously and came back with a verdict that they thought was just and that i think is just mr mcintosh s grandmother , martha reese , who had reared the victim from age 2 , said she was pleased with the firstdegree murder conviction and believed that mr page should be sentenced to death my son is gone , she said he could have robbed him but he did n't have to take his life but a sister of the victim , jezebel mcintosh , said of the sentence , the creator runs the show and the creator will make that decision mr page s relatives would not talk to reporters as they left the courtroom his wife , onika , wept in the hallway justice hall reminded the 12 jurors that they could not discuss their decision publicly because the trial was not over , given the jury s role in sentencing the person it convicts of firstdegree murder prosecutors said mr mcintosh was slain on the night of may 22 , 1996 , while standing in front of a girlfriend s home in east new york they said he was wearing a gold chain and a large gold pendant shaped like a bulldog s head , with rubies for eyes prosecutors said that mr page and two others approached him to steal the jewelry which had cost mr mcintosh 1 , 000 and that when he began struggling , mr page and the teenager , darryl gilmore , then 15 , shot him mr gilmore has pleaded not guilty to seconddegree murder mr alexis told the jurors that mr page was n't satisfied with having earlier won money from mr mcintosh in a dice game but also wanted to put that pendant around his neck and call it his own aside from maintaining that mr gilmore had fired the fatal shots , mr chaikin and mr villanueva argued that the encounter was a dispute over the dice game but not a robbery both sides presented witnesses to back their versions both mr page and mr mcintosh had criminal records mr page had been released on parole just six weeks before the killing , after having serving two and a half years in prison for attempted assault stemming from a shooting another prosecutor , barry m schreiber , told the jury that the killing was an execution , perhaps hinting at why district attorney charles j hynes of brooklyn had decided to seek the death penalty for mr page mr hynes himself has given no reason for making this a capital case , beyond saying he had reviewed the aggravating and mitigating factors although mr hynes is an avowed opponent of capital punishment , he has also said that so long as it is on the books , he is dutybound to seek it in appropriate cases he has sought it in five cases , more than any prosecutor in the state photo jermaine page was convicted in the slaying of marvin mcintosh

lacresha murray is a 14yearold prisoner at the giddings state home and school in giddings , tex , about 60 miles east of austin , the state capital she is serving a term of 25 years after being found guilty in 1996 of criminally negligent homicide and injury to a child in the death of a 2 1 2yearold girl named jayla belton the case was a local sensation excited prosecutors and other lawenforcement officials stumbled over one another in their rush to portray lacresha , just 11 years old , as a juvenile monster , a homicidal maniac who attacked jayla and inflicted a savage beating , eventually breaking four of her ribs and rupturing her liver the medical examiner said the injuries were like those that might result if a person went through the windshield in a highspeed car accident prosecutors referred to lacresha in private as la creature lacresha was convicted twice \( the first verdict was overturned \) , but a close look at the case shows that she was the victim of a colossal miscarriage of justice she remains trapped in a texassized nightmare , a naive child with learning difficulties who was tricked into signing a confession she could barely read and surely did n't understand prosecutors ignored evidence that jayla had long been the victim of child abuse there was no legitimate evidence against lacresha none no witnesses , no forensic evidence not so much as a drop of blood or a speck of body fluid of any kind twenty or more police officers scoured the premises where she supposedly killed the child they found nothing jayla had been dropped off on the morning of may 24 , 1996 , at a small , onefamily house in austin where lacresha lived with three siblings and their grandparents , r l and shirley murray ms murray provided day care for jayla and a number of other children but jayla s mother , judy belton , and her boyfriend , derrick shaw , had been told not to bring the child on may 24 because ms murray would be away mr shaw dropped the baby off anyway according to the murrays and a number of people who visited the house that day , jayla was clearly ill she was listless , refused to eat , perspired profusely and was vomiting in the early evening , the murrays said , lacresha noticed that the baby was shaking real bad in fact , the child had gone into convulsions r l murray and lacresha rushed the child to a hospital , but frantic efforts to save her failed enter the austin police the medical examiner is reported to have told investigators that no one could survive more than 15 minutes with a ruptured liver the investigators , still without a suspect , took that to mean there was a good chance that the last person seen with the child was the killer lacresha had carried jayla into the hospital the cops zeroed in on her lacresha was kept away from her family for four days and finally was subjected to a lengthy police interrogation , without the benefit of a lawyer an officer ran through what was surely to her an incomprehensible reading of her rights , after which he said you 've heard them before , on tv shows probably , huh \? lacresha insisted she had done nothing harmful to jayla why would i want to hurt a child \? she asked the cops told her that a doctor , with over 20 years of experience , had said the baby died at precisely the time that lacresha said she noticed the baby was shaking i did n't do nothing , lacresha replied i promise to god the interrogation was a travesty unable to shake her protestations of innocence , the police finally resorted to asking if it were at least possible that lacresha had dropped the baby , or even kicked her she was told , we 're going to stay here until you tell us the truth isolated and without a lawyer s help , lacresha eventually said that the suggestions made by the interrogators were possible , even probable she developed a fantastic scenario that could in no way account for the injuries jayla suffered but it was enough for the police a confession was typed up lacresha was asked , can you read pretty good \? no , she said , but i try hard as she read over her confession , lacresha asked the officers , what s that word \? homeaseed \? when she was told that the word was homicide , she asked , what s that \? no one answered
when john steinbreder of easton made an appointment to see richard kent of westport in 1993 , the two men found they had a lot in common first of all , there was the sports connection mr steinbreder , formerly a writer for fortune and sports illustrated magazines , has written three sports books mr kent is a sports buff who has done a considerable amount of freelance sports writing , particularly about the big east basketball conference secondly , each had gone through divorce mr kent also had considerable experience in the realm of divorce since , for the last 10 years , he has been the chairman of the matrimonial department for the law firm cohen wolf as it developed , both a bond and a friendship were formed while mr kent represented mr steinbreder in a custody case involving mr steinbreder s daughter we hit it off from the start , said mr kent , 47 , the father of two daughters , who has remarried sports was a common bond , but there was more to it than that mr steinbreder , 41 , recalled that he and mr kent had another common ground they agreed during long conversations that there were inherent prejudices that the legal system had developed against fathers in cases involving custody , child support and visitation mr kent , for example , told mr steinbreder he had represented many fathers who had lost financially and emotionally taxing custody cases solely because they were men for a long time , there s been this perception that mothers automatically make better parents than fathers do , mr kent said the men agreed that that perception was erroneous , particularly in an era when both parents often hold down fulltime jobs and many fathers work at home we wondered whether any books had been written about custody from the father s perspective , and , surprisingly , after a lot of digging and research , we found that none had , although a lot had been written from the mother s side , mr steinbreder said mr steinbreder and mr kent , who said they had reached satisfactory custody arrangements with their former wives , put together a book proposal the result was fighting for your children a father s guide to custody published in february by the taylor publishing company of dallas in the introduction , mr steinbreder sets the tone when he writes one of our aims in this book is to help men understand the legal process as it relates to custody battles to that they can enjoy greater success when they find themselves fighting for their kids it is by no means a screed against women or a manual on how spiteful fathers can wrest custody away from former spouses and perfectly capable mothers rather , we see it as a guide designed to assist men with custody issues that are unique to their gender and to help them deal with a system that is often tilted against fathers one of the reasons , mr steinbreder and mr kent agree , is that for many years courts have tended to follow the tender years doctrine that doctrine , the authors say , is based on the presumption that it is better for young children of divorced parents to be raised by their mothers though that doctrine has tended to have fallen out of favor , mr steinbreder and mr kent believe that some judges and lawyers primarily older ones still adhere to it but a newer , younger breed of judges are now more inclined to invoke what is known as the best interest doctrine , which holds that it is better to grant custody to the parent who can better meet the children s needs not only have judges become more enlightened about custody , but so , too , have a lot of women , said mr kent but by and large , he said , fathers still have to confront stereotypes held by many that a child s place is with its mother as a result , the authors say , in the vast majority of custody cases mothers still get sole custody it s gotten a lot better for fathers , mr kent said twenty years ago , mothers got sole custody about 10 times more frequently than fathers but that s not the case anymore still , in many instances , the authors write , the courts treat fathers more like bankers than parents , making them accountable for financial relief , but then relegating them to secondclass status when it comes to raising the kids a younger generation of judges , social workers and lawyers , the two authors say , understand that the makebelieve world of ozzie and harriet is a thing of the past and that the tasks of making money , taking care of a house and bringing up baby today are more evenly distributed between mother and father and that both sexes are up to the job above all , the book which recounts experiences some fathers have undergone during custody fights is meant to be a guide for men among other things , the book advises fathers on what to expect from a lawyer \( you should expect an attorney s undivided attention during office meetings , save for an emergency \) , how to prepare for a custody hearing , and the options of sole or joint custody or joint custody with expanded visitation rights there is also a list of do s and do n'ts leading up to and during the custody hearing be circumspect and civil in dealings with your former wife , spend more time with your children leading up to and during the custody proceedings , but , mr kent advises , do n't go overboard and suddenly become a disney dad and , in instances where a father does n't know how to cook , it is advised that he learn \( it s important if you want to gain custody of your kids that the court knows you can prepare a wholesome meal and do n't have to rely entirely on fast food \) the authors also offer advice on how fathers should deal with their children during the custody proceedings , whether husbands should move out before a divorce becomes final , whether children should be told about the custody proceedings and the options to resolving a custody fight in court divorce is terribly tough on kids , mr steinbreder said , and , regardless of what happens in a custody battle , kids need the love of both parents mr kent estimates that of the 1 , 000 divorce cases he has been involved in , about half his clients have been women does he think that a book intended to assist men in custody cases can hurt him with prospective female clients \? absolutely , but i do n't feel justifiably , he said in doing this book i'm not being a zealot it s just that a lot s been written for the other side and nothing from the father s perspective and , besides , i think that some women can benefit from reading the book for instance , a woman dating a man who s been through a divorce and custody battle will be able to understand just what he s gone through emotionally mr kent and mr steinbreder defend the terms battle and fight which appear in their book in referring to custody cases some people did n't think we should have used those terms so often , mr steinbreder said , but the truth of the matter is that when two parents who love their children and are convinced they can provide a better home for them , they 're going to fight and battle over those children there s no better way to describe it

mr thibaut maintains that through his courses , they can and do learn the new language effortlessly , just as french children do in their own environment none of the mothers reported hearing as much as an ooh la la , but they seem convinced that not only are the lessons working but they are also providing the basics for more effective foreign language study later in life i 've read that introducing a second language very early improves their cognitive ability as they are growing up , sharon gainsburg said mrs gainsburg , who describes herself as currently a stayathome mom , was with her 9monthold son , seth she added that her husband , daniel , an anesthesiologist , did n't take these lessons very seriously initially he laughed but last week he came to class and now he sees it as a more serious approach to learning she continued the ultimate goal is for seth to develop an interest in language that will enrich him culturally hopefully , that will make travel more enjoyable for him wendy havdala , a stockbroker now staying at home with her 8monthold son , ryan , said her husband , gerard , a stock trader , was born in france and lived in egypt this is a natural for us , she said he speaks french i think they start teaching languages far too late in public schools asked if ryan was saying anything in french yet , she explained that he was not even saying much in english at this point dada is about it ruth wood , a nanny who was at the class with a 19monthold boy from rye , had a little more to report in between keeping her eye on her playful charge and humming along with the songs , she said , he does n't say anything here in class , but he does seem to understand when i speak french to him at home if you ask him where le bouche is , he points to his mouth and if you ask him about la vache , he does say 'moo' photos at french for tots in scarsdale , francois thibaut conducts a class and raises parachute with both hands , top , with parents and nannies \( photographs by chris maynard for the new york times \)
naples , fla , nov 12 the mets' altered contingent left for home today with one expected trade made \( bobby bonilla \) and one expected trade not made \( todd hundley \) their yankee counterparts left having conducted no business , but confident that the upstart arizona diamondbacks had not blown them out of the uncharted bernie williams waters brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , actually left the ritzcarlton hotel after the general manager meetings ended without knowing for sure if the diamondbacks had really offered williams 100 million for seven years , as a television report had proclaimed but , he said , he did not care it does n't matter if i believe it or not , he said when he was asked if he believed the report we 'll do what we 're comfortable with and not be governed by what any other club might do we 'll compete for this player in the area we 're comfortable with shortly after cashman left to drive north to tampa and a meeting with his boss , george steinbrenner , the man who supposedly had made the eyepopping offer to williams said he had made no offer at all we can start and end it with we did not make an offer to bernie williams or scott boras , jerry colangelo , the diamondbacks' managing partner , said in a telephone interview , including the center fielder s agent in his characteristically direct response none no offer the mets have received offers of another kind for hundley , but they have not liked any of them enough to trade their erstwhile catcher , and the teams that have made the offers have not liked what the mets have requested we came here and i would have said the absolute chances of him being traded at this meeting are very , very good , said frank cashen , the mets' interim general manager as each day passes , they become somewhat slimmer that we do it the next step would be the winter meetings cashen said about six teams have expressed serious interest in hundley , including the baltimore orioles and the los angeles dodgers the dodgers have offered second baseman eric young the mets have asked for darren dreifort , a starting pitcher the talks with the orioles have centered on relief pitching a member of the orioles' organization said the mets asked for two relievers , armando benitez and arthur rhodes , plus a third player the orioles would be willing to trade one of them , especially after reaching agreement today with a freeagent reliever , mike timlin , on a fouryear , 16 million contract if they had to settle for one , the orioles believe , the mets would prefer rhodes , a hardthrowing lefthander cashen , without discussing other players , said the teams were not close on a deal hundley has 117 million guaranteed for the next two years cashen said some clubs have inquired about hundley only to learn they were on his list of 12 teams he could not be traded to cashen did not identify them , but anaheim , toronto and milwaukee fit that category the yankees have not been mentioned as a team interested in hundley , but they are not on his nono list , and the general manager of another club suggested how hundley could get his wish and be traded to the other team in town it could happen , he said , if the yankees became desperate to acquire center fielder jim edmonds to replace williams , and the angels asked for jorge posada that would open a spot for hundley cashman said he spoke with boras today , but he divulged nothing of their conversation , including whether they talked money colangelo spent much of the day wednesday with williams in phoenix and had dinner with him we talked about everything but money , colangelo said i wanted to find out what bernie is about , what are his motivations he wants to see what s out there he has n't eliminated any options he has great respect for what the yankees have accomplished and his part in that i do n't rule out the strong possibility that he winds up back where he is he did n't say he s gone or he s going anywhere else colangelo said no offer would be made until he heard from boras about williams s plans and his desire to play for the diamondbacks inside pitch the mets agreed with pitcher masato yoshii on a twoyear contract for salaries of 2 million and 3 million yoshii , 33 , who earned 1 , 075 , 000 last season , could have become a free agent if the mets had not signed him by sunday the mets also continued to pursue b j surhoff , the freeagent outfielder san francisco resigned ellis burks to a twoyear , 10 million contract jose mesa left the giants as a free agent and joined seattle for a twoyear contract that guarantees him 645 million
so what if many local school superintendents no longer view the top job at a regional board of cooperative educational services as the ultimate way to cap a career \? for the newly designated superintendent of the southern westchester board of cooperative educational services , stacy holmes , it does not get much better this is the fifth state i 've been in , said mr holmes , who has been an assistant superintendent for instructional support and technology for the last two and a half years at the board none have structures like boces it offers local school districts a resource that is very special the 38 boards in the state are regional associations offering school districts in their areas educational and other services that can be provided more efficiently through a central agency these services include special education programs , teacher training , payroll and administrative assistance and curriculum and testing materials the superintendent is not only responsible for meeting the needs of member districts but is also the liaison between the state education department and the local districts a role that has become especially critical because of new standards and mandates imposed by the state board of regents mr holmes , who takes over his new position on jan 1 when the departing superintendent , dr vincent beni , becomes superintendent of the irvington school district , is undaunted by the challenge there s a lot that the commissioner and state education department wo n't know about southern westchester unless the boces superintendent advocates for southern westchester , mr holmes said i'm nothing if not an advocate that is not surprising , perhaps , because mr holmes , a native of el paso , tex , is a nonpracticing lawyer , former teacher , principal and district superintendent for him , the board of cooperative educational services has a definite role to play in the new educational landscape i had spent a lot of time doing multidistrict collaborations elsewhere , he said what i see here is an evolution of boces services it has less to do with our analyzing the educational waterfront than with getting to know our clients the local school districts better mr holmes , for example , views the regents' standards as an opportunity to make boces more useful for local districts the reality is that there are a number of students who will be sitting for the regents this year , and they will have to pass to get a diploma , said mr holmes , who will receive a salary of 128 , 625 , the maximum allowed by the state legislature we 'll be seeing why some of the students do n't pass the test , or if a student has difficulty with the regents' english , how we can help we 're focusing on what we 're offering , so that we really are the districts' partners the state education department has made it clear that it is not going to staff heavily in albany they 're depending on the boces superintendent in the field to do the field work and to carry out the mandates to the local districts that function will happen anyway we 're looking at how do we want it to happen \? fortunately , we have a wonderful relationship with our clients , and a lot of the credit goes to dr beni
with the city s largest police union weakened by failures at the bargaining table and its proximity to a lingering corruption scandal , the union s president , louis matarazzo , has decided not to seek a second term and will step down when his term expires in june , union officials said yesterday mr matarazzo , a former patrolman in queens , presented a gentle public persona for the historically combative patrolmen s benevolent association , even as he fought and lost a series of bitter court battles and political fights with mayor rudolph w giuliani in announcing his decision to union delegates earlier this week , mr matarazzo , 59 , said he wanted to spend more time with his family and did not want to begin a second fouryear term , which he would not be able to complete because of the police department s mandatory retirement age of 63 , according to joseph mancini , a union spokesman but mr matarazzo , who was picketed at union headquarters in manhattan by his own members last year after losing an arbitration battle with the city and after presenting officers with a fiveyear contract that offered no raises in its first two years , faced serious challenges from within the union s top ranks labor experts said his decision to step down was another sign that the 29 , 000member pba , which once wielded immense power in city labor negotiations and state politics , has seen its influence erode and faces a shaky future it s clear that the pba has had a lot of problems and that matarazzo has taken the course of least resistance here , said greg tarpinian , executive director of the labor research association , a new york union consultancy now it will probably be a freeforall in the union mr matarazzo , a 35year veteran of the force , was the anointed successor to phil caruso , the pba s fiery longtime president but those ties to mr caruso , and to three lawyers associated with mr caruso and the union hierarchy for decades , ultimately undermined mr matarazzo s support among the rank and file the lawyers , richard hartman , james lysaght and peter kramer , were convicted in january of racketeering for conducting a kickback scheme involving millions of dollars in funds from the defunct transit police union none of the crimes involved the pba , and mr matarazzo has never been accused of any criminal wrongdoing but mr matarazzo was a union delegate for 30 years and union treasurer during the time when the union allowed mr hartman to reap 2 million a year in insurance commissions and paid the long island law firm of lysaght , lysaght and kramer millions in legal and consulting fees , so many union members criticized him for ignoring warning signs that the lawyers were corrupt lou s a decent human being , said ed hayes , a lawyer who represents a group of union insurgents , but the fact of the matter is that his loyalty was misguided and the officers on the streets suffered as a result he was the treasurer and he associated with some people who were looting the unions , so he lost the confidence of a lot of union members mr matarazzo s supporters said it is unfair to tar him with the misdeeds of others , and blamed his downfall on the mayor mr mancini said mr matarazzo would not comment on his decision to step down although the pba never formally endorsed mr giuliani in 1993 or 1997 , he received extensive campaign help from the union during his successful 1993 race , and police officers expected benefits from that support in the form of substantial raises when mr giuliani offered small pay hikes instead , at a time when police officers helped bring about a record drop in crime , relations between the mayor and the officers quickly soured mr matarazzo organized protests at every precinct station house , where officers ridiculed the mayor the union also tried to sidestep mr giuliani by using its political muscle in albany to push a bill allowing a state arbitration panel to resolve its contract disputes with the city the bill was passed in january 1996 , and the union received enough support to override gov george e pataki s veto , but mr giuliani sued and the state court of appeals declared the law unconstitutional the mayor ultimately won an arbitration battle , and today a police officer with five years' experience is paid 44 , 900 a year more than 10 , 000 less than his suburban counterpart mr giuliani later agreed to a contract with firefighters that included some concessions by their union , but ultimately gave firefighters bonuses that allowed them to earn 1 , 500 more than police officers , a fact that infuriated many officers lou was in the wrong place at the wrong time , said a pba official who spoke on the condition of anonymity union officials declined to speculate about mr matarazzo s possible successor , but three leaders are considered likely candidates james savage , first vice president james higgins , citywide recording secretary , and edward mahoney , a trustee from the manhattan north precinct john loud , a manhattan north delegate who has been leading a small band of insurgents seeking to overthrow the union leadership , has also indicated interest in the office police commissioner howard safir declined to characterize mr matarazzo s tenure as pba president , but said he wished him well lou matarazzo has always been an honorable person who has dealt with me in good faith , he said photo louis matarazzo , president of the 29 , 000member patrolmen s benevolent association \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
the fire department , frustrated in its investigation of a drunken brawl among its members at a midtown restaurant last week , fired one firefighter and suspended two others without pay yesterday because , investigators say , they were involved in or witnessed the fight and are telling less than they know senior fire officials also disputed accounts of the brawl from some law enforcement officials , who said that it lasted for hours and involved 50 to 100 firefighters instead , the fire officials said , more than a dozen witnesses reported that the fight began at about 10 20 pm and that perhaps four to six bloodied men exchanged punches for 20 minutes before the police arrived the fire officials also said that no witnesses reported seeing firefighters expose themselves , and that only one witness , a bartender , told investigators she had seen firefighters urinating in the bushes that surround the bryant park grill s outdoor cafe , where many firefighters gathered the evening of june 3 after attending a ceremony at city hall to honor acts of bravery even so , the fire officials said that accounts from as many as 18 civilian witnesses they interviewed , and transcripts from hundreds of police interviews , painted a scene of the uniformed firefighters drinking heavily , disrupting the cafe s patrons and refusing pleas to quiet down or leave we know these three firefighters were there , and that at least two of them were involved in the fight , said a senior fire official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and the two that we interviewed have not been completely forthcoming about what happened , which is unacceptable though officials believe he was only a witness , james bruno , 26 , a rookie firefighter who had been on the force only a few months at engine 34 in midtown manhattan , was fired because investigators concluded that he was withholding the names of those he knew to be involved for him not to have seen anything and not to know anything is just not believable , the senior official said , adding that the department has more latitude to dismiss probationary firefighters for misconduct suspended indefinitely without pay were francis morrisey , 26 , who has been on the force for a year and a half at engine 319 in middle village , queens , and jonpaul augier , 24 , who has been a firefighter for the same amount of time at engine 89 in the throgs neck section of the bronx mr morrisey told investigators that he had been punched unprovoked by another firefighter as he sat at a table at the cafe and that he had not fought back but investigators are doubtful of his account fire investigators have been unable to interview mr augier because the manhattan district attorney s office , for reasons that remained unclear last night , instructed them not to but fire officials said he was suspended because the accounts of civilians and cooperating firefighters placed him at the center of the fights , perhaps as the main instigator as i said last week when we had this unfortunate incident , i'm making every effort to get to the bottom of it , said fire commissioner thomas von essen , who took the action against the firefighters yesterday evening attempts to reach the three firefighters by telephone at home last night were not successful dan lynch , the manhattan trustee for the firefighters' union , criticized the actions taken against the firefighters we believe the fire department s actions are to put pressure on people to come forward with information about this incident , said mr lynch , who added that , if necessary , the union will fight in court to win back the firefighters' jobs the firefighters' behavior was the most flagrant breach of conduct by members of the city s uniformed services since 1995 , when dozens of new york city police officers went on a drunken rampage at several hotels in washington , groping women , spraying fire extinguishers and running around halfnude fire officials who interviewed five cooperating firefighters yesterday and expect to talk to another 10 to 12 on monday described it as one of the most embarrassing episodes in decades for the fire department but because no civilians have said they were hurt or have filed criminal complaints , and because the owners of the restaurant have not formally alleged that property was damaged , the case has been difficult for the police to investigate no firefighters have come forward to pressed charges against each other , and none are expected to fire and police investigators have narrowed down the firefighters they believe were present by using credit card receipts and the accounts of patrons and restaurant employees in an unusual twist , fire officials said they were certain that mr bruno was at the restaurant as early as 7 pm that night because he assisted paramedics at the scene as they treated a male patron who fainted for reasons that appear to be unrelated to the firefighters' rowdiness the officials also said they believed that law enforcement officials gave too much credence to the account of donna simms , the general manager of the restaurant , who told them that firefighters had fistfights over several hours , were exposing themselves and had turned over furniture fire investigators said that ms simms left about 9 pm , shortly before the restaurant was closed two hours early because of the noise and disruption a man who identified himself as the manager of the bryant park grill but would not give his name said last night that ms simms was not working and could not be reached until monday calls to the manhattan district attorney s office , which is investigating the case , were not returned last night
baltimore it was another sleepy monday morning after eight performances in six days , and hinton battle had arrived at penn station in new york in a state of yawn it s so early , he said as commuters scrambled by i should still be in bed for all his weariness , mr battle , 41 , a star dancer , singer and actor who plays the wily lawyer billy flynn in the broadway production of chicago , would rather be nowhere else why else would the threetime tony award winner rise early on his only day off to board a metroliner for seven hours of choreography and instructing at the baltimore school for the arts \? truth be known , he has been doing this sort of thing for most of the last 10 years and not just from new york for several years when he was working in los angeles , he still made sure he reached baltimore , if not for eight consecutive mondays , which is the plan this year , then for a week here and there whatever his workload , he has always tendered enough time to evaluate the school s senior dance class , choose a dozen or so of the most talented performers , then cast them in a piece he creates for the school s annual fundraising event in march and public spring fever concerts in may at first , mr battle said early in the twoandahalfhour ride , i did it for selfish reasons , to see if i could do choreography i was not so much into the kids as much as it was an opportunity for me but once i got there and saw these kids and saw how badly they really wanted it and how much they loved dancing , i thought , 'wow' then it was always about them the school for the arts , a public high school in downtown baltimore , opened in 1980 as an alternative for local students gifted in performance art , visual art , music and dance they must audition to gain entrance from a firstyear student population of 68 , it grew quickly to 300 , with as many as 1 , 100 applicants now auditioning each year to join the next ninthgrade class graduates have attended many of the country s leading colleges and conservatories in the arts others have made records , performed on broadway and danced with major companies like alvin ailey american dance theater , american ballet theater and companies from a dozen cities part of the attraction for students is the chance to work with outside professionals who are invited to the school each year in 1988 , sylvester campbell , a gifted classical ballet dancer who became the first head of the school s dance department , was looking for someone to help choreograph a short dance number for the spring concerts by then mr battle was a major star , a student of george balanchine and bob fosse , with tony awards for outstanding featured actor in sophisticated ladies in 1981 and the tap dance kid in 1984 his third award came seven years later for his acting and singing in miss saigon mr campbell and mr battle were old friends , having trained together years before at the joneshayward school of ballet in washington , where mr battle grew up thrilled to be invited and paid even though he volunteered to work free , mr battle became a major force over the next decade , choreographing numbers of his own creation , based on what he perceived as the strengths of the students some years he had them dance to classical music , some years jazz , hiphop or a combination for him , it was the challenge of interpretation and design , a scarier process , he declared , than singing , dancing or acting on stage performing , it s not all me , he said you create something from nothing , it s all you there s no getting around it it also became a way of giving back and providing an opportunity he never had growing up exposure to a working professional familiar with the sting of rejection and the glory of triumph as a result , his work at the school has evolved into more than just an expanded dance class , as he demonstrated again in his first appearance this year armed with soundtracks from four films soul food , the full monty , face off and amistad and a new release by the singer erykah badu , he put the class through the kind of nervous audition the more talented performers will encounter countless times introducing one movement at a time to a song from face off and building to a routine about one minute long , he watched carefully as the students followed his motions and interpreted the music even those in the far corners of the room strained to catch every nuance it s threatening in a way , said laura halm , a 16yearold junior who hopes to attend juilliard in new york if you do n't dance your best , he knows you can do better you need that push i'm in such awe that he s here , and the biggest honor is to get something changed that means he s actually paying attention to you norma pera , who succeeded mr campbell as the department head six years ago , said that mr battle s contribution was not just his technique but also his experience as a working performer he can speak to them 'i 've been there , ' she said in that way , he does n't cut them any slack as the afternoon wore on , mr battle divided the class into smaller and smaller groups , allowing each to perform the routine twice after the second , he separated the students , sending those who would perform in his creation to one side of the room , those who probably would not to the other i hate this part , he muttered time and again through the weaning process by the end , he had cut 12 girls , leaving 3 boys and 9 girls as his work group for this year the alsorans huddled together , looking forlorn though none were crying they 'll cry later , ms pera said but he 'll change his mind a thousand times he still might use them mr battle took a deep breath and walked over to them i did n't choose you because they have technique that s a little stronger than yours so work on your technique and do n't worry i have n't decided on anything yet i may end up using everybody from the looks of most people in the room

sergei babayan sergei babayan , an armenian pianist who came to the united states in 1989 , was a forceful presence at last year s van cliburn international piano competition , even though he was neither a competitor nor a judge mr babayan , who is an artist in residence at the cleveland institute of music and also runs his own teaching academy , had four students in the contest , and one heard his name evoked reverently with unusual regularity his disciples' playing suggested that he demanded much of them technically and that he encouraged them to explore some unusual repertory byways one work that several of them played was an electrifying sonata by carl vine , a 44yearold australian that work , a twomovement essay in complex , propulsive rhythms and insistently expansive chordal clusters , is the centerpiece of a new recording by mr babayan \( pro piano ppr224517 \) besides doing the service of putting the vine sonata on disk , the recording goes a long way toward explaining the fuss about mr babayan the repertory of varied 20thcentury works puts a spotlight both on his extraordinary technique and on his ability to play densely harmonized works with an illuminating transparency mr babayan s arching accounts of premiere communion de la vierge and le baiser de l'enfant jesus from messiaen s vingt regards sur l'enfant jesus are pictures of carefully judged meditative intensity those movements surround a bracing , sharpedged performance of the noel movement from the same work two respighi rarities the first of the three preludes on gregorian melodies and a gentle notturno offer a sweettoned , impressionistic interlude before selections from gyorgy ligeti s early musica ricercata , a group of miniatures in which a lisztian approach to the keyboard is refracted through a modern harmonic lens particularly striking among the ligeti works is no 7 , marked quieto \( poco rubato \) cantabile molto legato , in which a gentle melody floats over a muted repeating bass figure played so rapidly that it begins to sound almost like a synthesizer recording to produce that effect with the left hand while the right produces a singing , freespirited melody requires a daunting measure of control fazil say s mozart after years of listening to critics' complaining that so many young musicians' recordings are brilliantly polished but interpretively indistinguishable , record companies are taking some risks , signing players with strong personalities and individualistic approaches to the repertory but they seem unable to resist turning these adventurous gestures into promotional circuses , with campaigns that focus on eccentricity rather than acuity when warner signed fazil say , a 28yearold turkish pianist whose live performances have alienated some and won over others , it put him on a pop label , atlantic , rather than on one of its classical lines \( teldec , erato or nonesuch \) his debut disk , an allmozart program , is adorned with a sticker in which he is described , in a review quotation , as a wild man at the keyboard in some repertory his recent rhapsody in blue with the new york philharmonic , for example that description is not far off the mark but it does n't apply to the performances on his mozart disk \( atlantic 219702 \) that s not to say that mr say s performances are quirkfree he is selective about repeats , for one thing he plays none of them in the c major sonata \( k 330 \) in the first movement of the a major sonata \( k 331 \) , he plays them in some variations and skips them in others , and in the final variation he plays the first two repeats but skips the third listeners with an ear for architecture may find this jarringly asymmetrical , but mr say may have been less concerned with the symmetry than with the idea that the closing chords of that final variation can make a repeat seem anticlimactic at times , his readings draw so fully on the dynamic and coloristic resources of the modern piano that a listener is tempted to regard his readings not simply as romantic interpretations , but as acts of rebellion against the period instrument movement he is particularly fiery in the ah , vous diraije , maman variations , but in the sonatas , too , he passes up few opportunities for dramatic contrast often , he does this to fine effect the andante cantabile of the sonata in b flat \( k 333 \) has an almost operatic quality , not only because mr say makes the melodic line sing , but also because he suggests orchestral coloration and balances in the accompanimental figures photos
on what 905 workers in cityowned hospitals thought was their last day on the job , mayor rudolph w giuliani announced yesterday that he would delay widespread layoffs for 30 days and try to avoid them altogether by seeking to place the workers in other city jobs the move , which helps defuse tensions with the largest union of municipal workers , also includes provisions for severance or early retirement for workers who fail to find other jobs stanley hill , executive director of district council 37 , which represents 120 , 000 city workers , hailed the agreement and praised mr giuliani , a longtime ally whom he had harshly criticized during the last two weeks , both for the layoffs and for the city s use of workfare workers in municipal jobs last week , mr hill had said he would not bury the hatchet until mr giuliani rescinded the 905 layoffs we 've worked out a beautiful agreement and i'm willing to move forward here , mr hill said the main goal of a union is to make sure we avoid layoffs nonetheless , the agreement still leaves open the possibility that workers will be laid off , if the city cannot find enough positions for them or if enough workers do not voluntarily accept early retirement one giuliani aide said the city and the union would work together to push the state legislature to enact a new early retirement bill that they hope will encourage hundreds of municipal hospital workers to retire , thus opening up positions for many of the 905 workers who received pink slips the mayor and mr hill described the agreement as a winwin accord , which was reached after mr hill and deputy mayor randy levine bargained well past midnight for mr giuliani , the agreement has several important advantages it enables him to continue to pursue his longtime goal of reducing what he insists are overstaffed and underused public hospitals it goes far to patch up his relationship with mr hill , a powerful ally who began snarling at him and mobilizing labor unions against him as soon as the layoffs were announced in attacking the layoffs , mr hill also took aim at the city s vast workfare program , in which welfare recipients work for their benefits at one point in the dispute , mr hill equated the workfare program with slavery if you 're not prepared to give these people meaningful jobs , he said in an interview two weeks ago , you 're not really helping as part of the agreement , mr hill said , the union would suspend a lawsuit it had brought against the city , charging it with violating state law by using people on workfare to displace union workers in the hospitals for mr hill , the agreement not only avoids layoffs of his members but also gives him something he has sought for months the health and hospitals corporation , which administers municipal hospitals , will work with mr hill to examine whether there are staff shortages in certain hospital departments , and if there are , some of the workers destined for layoffs might be given jobs in those departments we both made concessions , mr giuliani said everyone gained something from this , as is classic in negotiations word of the agreement reached many of the affected workers as they gathered for a rally at harlem hospital to protest the layoffs in a 1 pm announcement that provoked a thunderous roar of surprise and delight , union leaders told the workers their jobs were safe , for at least 30 days , and that the city would then try to place them in other jobs we have an agreement , james butler , the president of local 420 , the union representing public hospital workers , told the rally the city of new york has agreed to a 30day coolingoff period , and we are going to work around the clock to prove to city hall that it needs us it was the unexpected climax of what had been planned as a wellplanned demonstration , with gospel music , hospital beds on the sidewalk , readings from scripture and boisterous participation by the crowd several union leaders praised mr hill for pressuring the mayor to reach a deal but with many details still to be worked out , one labor expert said mr hill could end up being embarrassed if layoffs still take place doris cross , who has spent eight years sterilizing supplies at north bronx central hospital , said that when she received her layoff notice last month , it s like your insides are being torn apart she said she feared she would have to go on welfare to support her two sons , but she said yesterday s agreement was a big relief at least there is some hope for a lot of us now , she said i have faith none of us want public assistance we all want to work although the layoffs would only have affected a small number of the 35 , 000 people who work for the city s hospital agency , union leaders had asserted that patient care would have suffered but city officials countered that the system faced a large deficit and that managed care had reduced the number of patients in the city hospitals the agreement does not affect about 900 workfare employees who suddenly lost their jobs in city hospitals after mr hill filed his lawsuit charging that the city was violating state law by using workfare participants to replace hospital workers mr giuliani removed them all from city hospitals , saying it was a tactical effort to prove that no one is being displaced city officials said they would not lose their welfare benefits and would be reassigned to other city agencies city hall officials boasted that the agreement was little different from what they said they had originally offered before announcing the layoffs mr giuliani said the city had offered a severance and redeployment package early on but mr hill insisted that the package announced yesterday was considerably better for the union , because it contained a richer early retirement package as well as a commitment from the city to study whether some of the 905 workers could be moved into hospital departments that are understaffed mr hill acknowledged that he rejected the city s initial severance offer he explained that when he accepted severance packages previously for municipal hospital workers , those packages reduced the work force so much in some departments that the employees who remained were heavily overworked mr hill angrily insisted that the city had not made good on its commitment to restore workers where public hospitals had shortages city hall officials and mr hall acknowledged that they had little idea how many jobs could be found for the displaced workers but mr hill said he knew of one city agency that had more than 100 job openings under the agreement , the city , rather than the health and hospitals corporation , will pay the salaries of the 905 workers during their 30day job search joseph j lhota , the city s budget director , estimated that those salaries would cost 3 million last night it was clear that city officials and mr hill did not quite see eye to eye on some aspects of the accord mr giuliani said a vast majority of the 905 would not be redeployed to city hospital positions , while mr hill held out hope that many would one senior giuliani aide said those who received layoff notices would be redeployed into hospital jobs only where there were existing posted vacancies but mr hill said the city had committed itself to redeploying some of the 905 to hospital departments that union officials could demonstrate were understaffed photos stanley hill and mayor rudolph w giuliani announcing that layoffs of hospital workers would be delayed , and

philip hoffman hit ball after ball into the bright green artificial turf at family golf centers' golden bear golf center in farmingdale recently about an hour , and 100 balls , later he entered the clubhouse his daughter katy , 9 , and son greg , 11 , ran to him they had just finished a round of miniature golf on the other side of the building time had run out on what he described as his moment of peace mr hoffman , a police captain in flushing , finetunes his swing here every other week it affords that capability to bring my children here and let them play miniature golf while i spend a few minutes of solace on the driving range , he said precisely on par with the thinking of family golf centers as golf thrives nationwide , the melvillebased company has become the drivingrange industry leader , albeit only with a 4 percent market share , based on two strategies positioning its driving ranges as family centers and gobbling up competitors in an industry composed largely of momandpop operations just this year it scooped up the eightunit metrogolf inc , which owned a range in rocky point , and eagle quest golf centers , its next largest competitor , with 18 sites in july , it acquired the 14site golden bear golf centers all told , family golf now uses the golden bear brand at 21 sites they bought everybody who could be a competitor , said mark silverman , vice president of the golf range and recreation association of america in new canaan , conn now family golf is applying its formula to other fragmented entertainment industries , such as ice skating last year , the company made its first nongolf acquisition , buying the sports plus entertainment complex , which includes an ice hockey rink and movie theater , in lake grove family golf plans to open four more around the country over the next two years today , the company operates 105 golf and other recreational facilities , and has 11 under construction it has driving ranges in farmingdale , commack and rocky point an ice skating rink , iceworks , in syosset , and the ponds golf center and sports plus in lake grove family golf has been growing ever since dominic chang , 48 , chairman and chief executive , founded the company in 1992 in fiscal 1997 , sales , fueled by acquisitions , soared 132 percent to 648 million and net income jumped 102 percent to 105 million in july , family golf raised 97 million to pay for more acquisitions and new construction by issuing an additional 46 million shares of common stock , at 2425 per share it has returned to the market several times since its 54 million initial public offering , at 5 per share , in 1994 on wednesday , the stock closed at 1775 a share he s the big cheese on the island , and if you 're going to compete you have to compete against him , said david wolkoff , owner of the heartland golf park , an independent golf center in edgewood for family golf , timing has been everything in the early '90 s , mr chang of dix hills , an avid golfer and former banker , had noticed the increasing popularity of golf among people who did not belong to country clubs he sensed it would continue the statistics bear out his hunch after holding steady in the first half of the decade , the number of golfers rose 7 percent to 265 million last year , according to the national golf foundation of jupiter , fla and , thanks to tiger woods fever , there was a 50 percent jump in the number of beginners , including teenagers on long island , home to more than 400 , 000 golfers , golf is booming , said the publisher of long island golfer magazine , john j glozek jr there are 37 driving ranges , either independent or affiliated with golf courses , according to the long island convention and visitors bureau mr chang invested about 27 million in personal funds and loans to open his first driving range on route 110 in farmingdale in march 1992 several american banks rejected his loan requests , so he secured funds from a bank in his native taiwan the 80tee range reeked of trial and error , mr chang admitted recently for example , the range s original natural grass entangled golf balls and was replaced by artificial turf in 1992 , the company signed a licensing arrangement with golden bear golf centers , whose chairman is the legendary golfer jack nicklaus , to use its name at the farmingdale site and some future ones no question , it lent us a lot of credibility , mr chang said by the end of 1994 , family golf had built three more centers , all using the golden bear name playing to families , the company designs its facilities to be kidfriendly , incorporating snack bars , video games , golf lessons and miniature golf while serious golfers compose about 60 percent of a range s revenues , mr chang said more beginners , women and families are hitting the tees today , just as he had expected andy morgenstern of massapequa brought his two children to golden bear in farmingdale three times a week last summer having outgrown miniature golf , jennifer , 12 , and michael , 13 , joined their dad on the driving range on one recent visit , mr morgenstern cradled his arms on michael s and instructed him how to hold the club it s a good thing to be together , mr morgenstern said
by all rights , the brooklyn philharmonic should be marking its 45th season with the festive programming , commissioned works and starry soloists that orchestras typically roll out for anniversaries ending in zero or five but instead of planning the philharmonic s birthday gala , its board has spent the last six months trying to whittle away a 300 , 000 deficit and rebuild its administrative staff members and musicians are hoping that the performances of mahler s titanic resurrection symphony , scheduled to close the season in midmay , will be a celebration of the orchestra s own rebirth this is not the first time we 've been in a financial tight spot , said craig g matthews , the executive vice president and chief finan cial officer of keyspan energy , who was elected the orchestra s board president as part of its reorganization but this is one of the most serious challenges we 've faced gregg gustafson , the orchestra s newly appointed executive director , says the philharmonic , which draws much of its audience from manhattan , also faces a minor identity crisis one thing i'm looking at is how to make the orchestra more integral to the borough of brooklyn , he said it has brooklyn in its title , but it is n't really brooklyn s philharmonic , and i think it should be these problems come at a time when the orchestra is sounding better than it ever has , something that both critics and musicians have been virtually unanimous in ascribing to the work of robert spano , the philharmonic s music director since 1996 mr spano , at 37 , is increasingly in demand as a guest conductor with major american orchestras and opera companies , and last summer he became the director of the conducting program at the tanglewood music center , the boston symphony s summer home but he has bonded quickly with the orchestra and now makes his home in a modest apartment in brooklyn heights so although his contract with the orchestra ends this season , he has given the musicians and management reason to believe he will renew \( mr spano and the orchestra refuse to disclose his salary \) my interest is n't in leaving , but rather in building , mr spano said i came here because the things that interested me are the things the orchestra was intent on doing that has n't changed even before mr spano took over the orchestra , the brooklyn philharmonic s innovative approach to programming had helped it attain a national profile among his predecessors , lukas foss was famous for his mara thon concerts and his meet the moderns series , and dennis russell davies began offering thematic programs for example , dvorak and musical nationalism and the influence of eastern music on western classicism in weekend festivals exactly how famous these programs have made the orchestra became clear to the players and the board only recently lou bruno , a bassist with the orchestra since 1978 , said that at a mellon foundation conference last spring , attended by musicians , board members and management representatives from many orchestras , brooklyn came up quite often as an example of an orchestra that , although teetering financially , really does have a vision mr spano continued the festival approach through last season , but when the orchestra hit a financial and administrative wall in the spring , he reconfigured his plans for the current season his concerts are still thematic , but instead of minifestivals , he has returned to a more conventional format five programs performed mostly on friday and saturday evenings \( an exception is this week s presentation of powder her face , an opera by the 27yearold british composer thomas ades , as part of the brooklyn academy of music s next wave festival , on tuesday , thursday and saturday \) we simply could n't afford the interplays this year , mr spano said , referring to the chamber music concerts and other orchestra events in recent seasons they 're not gone by design , but by necessity but we also have to rethink them in some cases , people came to the interplay and skipped the orchestral concert it may be that the weekend marathon experience is for too few people a financial crisis and a reduced staff the orchestra s financial and administrative problems have deep roots , yet they appear to have descended quickly upon an unsuspecting board early in 1997 , joseph horowitz , then the orchestra s executive director , and the architect of its festival approach , asked to be allowed to focus more on programming and educational activities george nashak , a board member , took on the administrative responsibilities as executive director and reduced the staff a year ago , mr horowitz left , and in april mr nashak also resigned , leaving a staff of two , an orchestra manager and a fundraising director mr horowitz said that during his time with the orchestra the accumulated deficit was never more than 120 , 000 when the board met last may , however , the brooklyn academy of music presented it with a bill for 320 , 000 for a variety of support services , including marketing and publicity , and stage crew and box office costs associated with the orchestra s concerts in bam s 2 , 110seat opera house these costs had accumulated as an interestfree loan , but when bam faced its own financial crunch last year , its director , harvey lichtenstein , asked the orchestra to pay up
not every lawyer in the new york lawyers basketball league challenges every call the referees make , or do n't make for instance , last week , when the team from graubard , mollen miller clobbered cooper cooper 7760 in the league s division a championship , there was plenty of physical play and plenty of penalizing whistles , but the bellowing was mainly at teammates , and nobody got thrown out of the game for contempt of ref it was a big game , said brian ross , a corporate lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions at graubard mollen , explaining the downright orderly game and there were families in the stands , not to mention league officials it may well go the same tonight , when graubard mollen , a 50member midtown firm , faces smillie films , champs of a sister league , the new york corporate basketball league but arguing calls is more often than not the name of the game among players in the 145team lawyers' league with five levels of play for male lawyers as well as divisions for wall street firms , women and law students , the 28yearold league boasts more players than almost any other recreational league in the nation a new jersey league , modeled after new york s , has 39 teams that many sweaty , hypedup lawyers can have a major effect on referees , to say the least i throw players out for unsportsmanlike conduct that continues after i give a warning , or for a fistfight between two players , said bernard bowen , a credit agricole banker who will referee tonight s game i do n't expect anybody to be thrown out both teams will be on good behavior mr bowen , who has been officiating lawyers' games for 19 years and who supervises the 60odd referees who keep games moving \( no , none of them are judges \) , is a keen observer of lawyerly behavior on the court when they come out of law school , you have to think of them as guys who will just run up and down the court with reckless abandon , said mr bowen then , they get settled , they slow down , and they look to debate every call and dispute everything that you do back in the 70 s , long before he became new york s governor , george e pataki was a 6foot5 selfdescribed ball hog for the wall street firm dewey ballantine , helping it to two league championships he used to cry a little bit , mr bowen recalled he used to complain that s not true ! mr pataki said , laughing , when told of mr bowen s comment but did he remember how good i was \? mary jo white , the fivefoottall united states attorney in manhattan , recalls picking her share of fights with referees when she still had time to play point guard in the late 70 s lawyers are , by the nature of what they are charged to do , advocates for a particular position , she explained and they are , by nature , intensely driven and competitive so they can be pretty insufferable \( the women s championship , cohen funk versus chadbourne parke , will be decided on thursday \) nobody expected this much interest in basketball among lawyers in 1970 , when peter green , a recent graduate of new york university s law school , started the league , inspired by a small network of lawyers' softball teams it just grew exponentially , said mr green , who eventually became an administrative law judge , a position he left to run the league full time now , the winter budget alone is about 300 , 000 , generated from the 1 , 500 perseason team fee we 're filled up ! he said companyrelated sports teams started in america in the late 1800 s as part of a corporate philosophy to encourage employee loyalty and discourage unionism but until the 70 s , they were mainly bluecollar bowling and baseball teams they were n't for whitecollar executives , and they certainly were n't for brooks brotherslapeled lawyers , said peter levine , the director of american studies at michigan state university and the coauthor of idols of the game , with robert lipsyte , a columnist for the new york times eligibility rules are open enough to make socalled ringers utterly legal under a client clause but there is one immutable requirement in most divisions a fouryear college education which mr green explains as a way to keep the league appropriate for professionals mr levine , aghast , asked , what , do they play with their cell phones tucked in their shorts \? what is appropriate for lawyers is often cutthroat competition , said melvin yee , a paralegal who plays for howe addington , a firm that specializes in real estate law a lot of the lawyers foul you , they try to grab you to stop you , he said and they complain about a lot if the refs do n't call fouls , they scream but , he added , mostly the teams argue against each other it is not uncommon for these lawyers to find themselves on opposing sides off the courts , too you 'll walk in the room , and you 'll see the guy , and you 'll both just smile , said harold levine , 40 , a ballplaying partner at battle fowler who negotiates multimilliondollar deals as a matter of course if he fouled me a lot , maybe i 'll have to take a few more dollars out of him on the deal debating calls and fierce competition seem obvious in a league full of lawyers so what about lawsuits \?

hempstead , ny , nov 4 it was 20 years ago , when he was tutoring collegians , when bill parcells last coached against a quarterback as daring as doug flutie is these days with the buffalo bills and , while playing at oklahoma state , the jets' rookie free safety kevin williams faced quarterbacks who tried to move like flutie but none as good or as smart yes , that flutie the one who last appeared at the meadowlands 10 years ago is coming back as he leads the resurgent bills against the jets on sunday it is a battle of teams tied for first place , and with winning streaks flutie is returning to the stadium where he is unbeaten he won there playing for boston college over rutgers , for the new jersey generals of the united states football league and for the patriots over all , he is 90 at the meadowlands more to the point , he is 40 this year as a bills starter yet , it was also nine years between national football league appearances for the 5foot10inch 36yearold in nfl history , that is the longest hiatus for any player except one frank \( tiger \) walton , the father of the former jets' coach , joe walton , had a 10year absence between 1934 and 1944 flutie has been in canada , capturing the league s playeroftheyear award six times i still have my speed and quickness , flutie said today about the difference between his nfl career then and now we 're a little more aggressive in our playcalling this year , coach wade phillips decided that if he had to , he would alter his offense to accommodate the way flutie plays the kinds of things for which most quarterbacks would be fired of course , phillips never expected flutie to start that honor went to rob johnson , acquired from jacksonville and given a fiveyear , 25 million deal flutie \? two years at 375 , 000 a year then johnson got hurt , flutie played in parts of two games , started the last three , and on tuesday phillips named flutie his starter for now , back in the nfl , flutie seems to have merged the enthusiasm of his youth the scrambling , the sidearm flings , the jumpshot passes with some patience he still does many of the things he did while leading boston college and winning the 1984 heisman trophy and now he has been blessed with a running game so , parcells is not surprised at flutie s success he s actually done very well wherever he s been , said the coach he s quite unique a very creative type of player parcells said the jets are absolutely preparing differently he puts a lot of pressure on defenses , parcells said he s very elusive he s got a very good running game to go with him 134 yards a game that helps and he s a very good part of that game himself indeed he is flutie is leading a team that ranks seventh in the league in rushing he has generated 72 rushing yards , more than 6 yards a carry on 11 carries as a starter in those three games , he has completed 663 percent of his passes , with five touchdowns and one interception the bills have won their last five games , and flutie had a hand in all of them after coming in for johnson jerome henderson , who started at free safety for the jets the last two weeks , and who will share the position with williams on sunday , knows what that means for opposing defenders sometimes you err on the side of caution with a guy like flutie , henderson said you 're always put in a dilemma when do i come up \? you have to make sound decisions he 'll make a big play when you 're coming up to make a tackle a lot of times he s running and he s still looking to pass for strong safety victor green , flutie is probably the most difficult guy we 'll face this year phillips spoke as if he had no choice but to appoint flutie his starter in last sunday s victory over the dolphins , the bills were trailing by 10 points in the final period he scores in a minute 53 seconds , phillips said three times faster than we 've been running he s a good field general he knows how much time he s got on the clock thus , phillips said flutie s playing great for one thing , and rob has n't played in four weeks i do n't know how you can change extra points leon johnson , the important thirddown and specialteams player who had produced both the jets' longest run and reception this season , is listed at 5050 to play because of a sprained knee however , that seems to be optimistic i have to decide about what to do on the thirddown stuff , bill parcells said parcells s next coaching victory will tie him with weeb ewbank for career victories \( including playoffs \) of 134 right now , something is missing it s gone , parcells said of the eroded skills that led him to cut punter brian hansen in favor of john kidd
washington , jan 29 four years after top tobacco company officials denied before a congressional committee that cigarettes were addictive , a new crop of executives appeared today before the same panel as supplicants , pledging to release secret company documents , combat teenage smoking and acknowledge tobacco risks in an effort to gain protection from lawsuits the testimony by the chief executives of the nation s five largest tobacco companies before the house commerce committee came as congress began formal debate over the proposed 3685 billion settlement reached in june between the industry and some 40 state attorneys general the officials sought in both the tone and substance of their remarks to rally support for the embattled accord and distance themselves from their predecessors , who had declared in a 1994 congressional appearance that they never marketed tobacco to children and even questioned links between smoking and diseases like lung cancer geoffrey bible , chairman of the philip morris companies , the nation s largest cigarette producer , testified that , in hindsight , he deeply regretted the years of festering conflict that had existed between the tobacco industry and antismoking advocates he said the proposed settlement offered a chance to change that relationship although no one can change the past , i have tried to draw lessons from it , and that is why i believe our priorities and focus should be on the future , mr bible said but mr bible and other top company executives came under sharp attack by lawmakers who questioned their motives and their sincerity representative henry a waxman , democrat of california , released documents showing that philip morris marketing officials had been following the smoking habits of children as young as 12 years and others rejected as a publicrelations ploy mr bible s pledge to publicly release millions of pages of secret industry documents under the june proposal , tobacco producers agreed , among other things , to pay 3685 billion to settle lawsuits filed by states and smokers , restrict cigarette advertising and pay fines if youth smoking rates failed to drop the companies also said they would not oppose some government regulation of tobacco in return , the proposal , which must be approved by congress , would give tobacco producers unprecedented protections against most lawsuits and would bar punitive damages mr bible and most of the other company officials who testified today acknowledged that nicotine was addictive and , in dramatic contrast to the testimony of tobacco officials four years ago , the executives testifying today said that smoking either caused lung cancer or was a risk factor in the disease they also acknowledged that nicotine is addictive , as the term is commonly understood but they insisted that none of their current marketing efforts were aimed at underage smokers for the tobacco industry , today s hearing came at a delicate time though the industry has marshaled an army of lobbyists to press for the june proposal , lawmakers are split over whether comprehensive tobacco legislation will be passed this year and over what form it should take president clinton is counting on about 60 billion from a proposed tobacco settlement as revenue in his new federal budget , to be submitted to congress on monday but a recent internal memorandum prepared by a public relations company that represents the industry found diminished support and mounting opposition to the june accord the memorandum , which was prepared by the bozell sawyer miller group and released at today s hearing by representative edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , recommended a highpowered public relations offensive to rally support for the settlement proposal the document also proposed an exit if the legislation stalled the strategy s message would be that politicians played politics and made a mess out of a legitimate offer an official with bozell sawyer said the proposal had been referred to companies involved in the june deal , but that no action had yet been taken for the tobacco industry executives testifying today , however , the immediate concern was stiff criticism from some longtime industry allies like representative thomas j bliley jr , republican of virginia , who is chairman of the commerce committee mr bliley expressed outrage over recently released industry documents , such as those from the rj reynolds tobacco company , which show that in the 1970 s the company marketed cigarettes to children as young as 14 four years ago , i was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt , mr bliley said today , the burden is on you steven f goldstone , chief executive of rjr nabisco holdings corporation , the parent company of rj reynolds , did not attempt to defend the company , describing any past efforts to sell cigarettes to children as immoral , unethical and illegal documents released at today s hearing by representative waxman indicate that philip morris marketing executives were also studying the habits of underage smokers
the fossil of a baby dinosaur has come to light in which details of soft anatomy never seen before in any dinosaur are preserved scientists expect the fossil , which was found in italy , to yield important information about the anatomy of dinosaurs in general only very rarely are the fragmentary remains of soft tissue found in dinosaur fossils , and it is all the more remarkable that in this specimen , major portions of the animal s intestines , colon , liver , muscles , windpipe and other parts are discernible the find is reported in today s issue of the journal nature , which devoted its cover to a color photograph of the fossil dr michael j benton , a paleontologist at the university of bristol , england , who is familiar with the fossil , said in an interview that the position of the dinosaur s liver might be particularly important the lungs are not preserved , dr benton said , but the position of the liver may help define where the lungs were in this animal the primitive respiratory system of presentday crocodiles differs significantly from that of birds , which have a much more efficient system this italian fossil might give an indication of whether the dinosaur s breathing system was closer to that of crocodiles or birds , a question that bears on the controversy over the kinship of dinosaurs many biologists regard birds as the descendants of dinosaurs , but others believe birds and dinosaurs evolved separately from some distant common ancestor this animal s gut was shorter than might have been expected , so it probably was able to process food very efficiently , dr benton said the fossil was discovered and excavated a decade ago but only recently was it examined by qualified paleontologists who recognized its great importance it is believed to be the only dinosaur ever found in italy the two paleontologists who separated the fossil from rock , examined it in detail and wrote its formal scientific description for today s article in nature , are cristiano dal sasso of the museo civico di storia in milan and marco signore of the universita degli studi di napoli in naples this little dinosaur was found about a decade ago by an amateur named giovanni todesco , mr signore said in an interview he thought it was a bird , and only years later , after he had seen the movie 'jurassic park , ' did he take it to a museum for a professional examination news of the discovery of the dinosaur was briefly reported in 1993 , but it was not realized at the time that this fossil is absolutely unique the nineinchlong fossil , which is now housed at the archeological administration in salerno , was found about 30 miles northeast of naples in the pietraroia limestone formation in benevento province this formation has been known since the 18th century for its unusually wellpreserved fossil fishes about 113 million years ago , during the midcretaceous period , the area was covered with shallow lagoons that were often deficient in oxygen , mr signore said , and the fine limestone deposited in these lagoons frequently led to exceptional preservation of fossilized soft tissue of fishes the little dinosaur s jaws are lined with sharp teeth , and it belongs to the dinosaur group called theropods \( beast feet \) , which also include tyrannosaurus rex and many other meat eaters the italian scientists named the new dinosaur scipionyx samniticus in honor of scipione breislak , the geologist who wrote the first scientific description of the limestone formation in which the fossil was found , and also to celebrate the ancient roman general scipio africanus \( samnium is the ancient name of the region that includes benevento province \) mr dal sasso and mr signore concluded that scipionyx had hatched from an egg only a short time before dying all its teeth were original and none had yet been replaced the scientists found a mixture of features in scipionyx that made the creature somewhat difficult to classify it has some of the features of the dromeosaurs small and mediumsize dinosaurs with daggerlike claws a group that included the ferocious velociraptors depicted in jurassic park but scipionyx , they found , also bears some resemblances to the dinosaurs known as troodonts flesheating dinosaurs that some scientists say may have been unusually intelligent a remarkable feature of the scipionyx fossil , dr benton said , is that the part believed to be its fossilized liver is faintly tinted a dark purple , a coloring that may have survived from life the animal s fossilized gut is also amazing , dr benton said you can clearly see its surface texture , which is lumpy and shiny , almost as you would see it after dissecting a modern animal dinosaur fossils generally consist purely of mineralized bone , dr benton said , but occasionally the texture of skin patterns is preserved \( the american museum of natural history in new york displays a mummified hadrosaur fossil in which such patterns are visible \) small , bony scutes the equivalent of chain mail armor , dr benton called them are also sometimes found within fossilized skin only in two or three cases , one in a dinosaur found in china and another in spain , have remnants of fossilized internal organs been found , he said , so scipionyx is really something special photo a fullsize taxidermists' model of the dinosaur fossil found in italy \( nature

in an effort to extend schooling into the summer but shift it to a more bucolic setting , schools chancellor rudy crew said yesterday that he would like to send as many as 10 , 000 new york city publicschool children to sleepaway camps in the catskills and elsewhere each year , beginning this summer the cost of the fourweek camping program , which the chancellor s aides estimated to be 15 million to 20 million annually , would be paid by the board of education , as well as with contributions solicited from corporations and philanthropic organizations the range of students selected for the program would be broad , school officials said , including those children whose families could not otherwise afford summer camp tuition , others identified as needing extra help in reading and still others who would be sent to camp as a reward for such accomplishments as stellar attendance dr crew is to present his summercamp proposal to the board today , and if it is accepted , he expects to begin a pilot program in july with 1 , 000 children in grades four through eight under dr crew s plans , which the board is expected to endorse , the program is to grow to 10 , 000 by 2002 elements of the chancellor s plan were first reported in the daily news on saturday as the chancellor has conceived it , the board would pair 30 to 50 elementary or middle schools with a private or nonprofit summer camp each camp would agree to accept at least 20 students from its partner school , and , with the board s assistance , to create a threehour academic program during the camp day part of that time , the chancellor s aides said , might be devoted to analyzing the species in a particular pond another part might be spent discussing a book over a campfire in all cases , the work that the children do during the summer would build , in some way , on their schoolwork during the year , though none of the summer work would be for credit to supervise the program , every camp would be required to hire at least one licensed teacher dr crew said that the program had grown in part out of his own experience as a child who fled poughkeepsie , ny , for a sleepover camp in tenants harbor , me , for five summers i learned how to ride horses there , said dr crew , an avid outdoorsman who maintains a home in the woods outside tacoma , wash i learned how to garden at camp i learned how to fish everything i know about the outdoors is connected to this experience for me i just want kids to have that , he added i want them to know that through camping , they can have fun and learn the board president , william c thompson jr , said he supported the chancellor s proposal , but added that the board had yet to discuss how much financing it would be willing to provide that amount , he said , would hinge on how much could be raised privately , as well as from the state dr crew s effort is not the first attempt by the school system to send publicschool children away for the summer in the late 1980 s , the board tried a similar pilot program , involving several hundred children placed at various camps , but abandoned it two years later when there was no longer money to sustain it but dr crew insisted that such a program , especially one that matched schools and camps , could work over the long term and citywide and his aides cited many instances in which individual schools are already working with settlement houses and other nonprofit groups in district 12 in the south bronx , for example , hundreds of students have been sent away in recent years to boy scout and other camps that worked closely with schools to coordinate pupils' summer activities with their work during the year it ties in the real world with the classroom , said mary rivera , the district superintendent you study science in a textbook , it s one thing you study it out in the forest , that s something very different for the region s summer camps , especially those nonprofit camps that have been buffeted by escalating operating costs and declining government aid in recent years , the chancellor s program could represent the difference between staying afloat and shutting down eva lewandowski , whose foundation operates camp ohnehtah , a camp for innercity girls in windham , ny , said she would have room for 100 additional campers and could easily build some educational time into the camp schedule we work with an 18hour day , 7 days a week for each child , she said in that amount of time , you can make a tremendous impact on kids
in a novel transaction , a majority of the 94 apartment owners in a twobuilding , 114unit cooperative in greenwich village have individually sold their apartments to yeshiva university , which will turn them into housing for students at its nearby benjamin n cardozo school of law industry experts said the transaction was unusual because it involved a large number of shareholders selling their units at the same time to the same buyer in a building that was not in financial hardship the transactions took effect last month , when the university acquired , for 116 million , 93 of the mostly studio and onebedroom units at 15 east 11th street , at fifth avenue , from their owners the majority of those units , averaging 350 to 550 square feet , had been rented out by shareholders the complex two turnofthecentury structures , once hotels , linked by a common lobby and basement needs repairs the purchase price included the building s mortgage and payments to unit owners dr sheldon e socol , vice president for business affairs at yeshiva , said the university plans to improve the complex and make the units available to students at the law school over the next two years he said half of the units should be ready by september the work is to include waterproofing and shoring up the interior of one of the buildings , where the concrete between the floors and ceilings is deteriorating the estimated cost is 2 million getting the majority of shareholders on the same page to coordinate a sale to one seller is unusual , said steven a kirschenbaum , a partner at hartman craven , a manhattan law firm that specializes in coop and condo matters mr kirschenbaum said that typically so large a number of units was sold to one buyer in distress situations an example is when the seller is a lender who foreclosed on the units and wants to reduce its losses , he noted although 15 east 11th street does not have financial difficulties , it does have its share of warts , which real estate experts said might have prompted coop owners to sell among the problems is the interior structural work that needed to be done and the building s high percentage of renters lenders usually insist that at least 51 percent of the apartments in a building be occupied by their owners before they will provide mortgages to prospective buyers at 15 east 11th street , twothirds of the units had been sublet by renters structuring the deal took about seven months and was made possible because both parties were convinced that they were getting a fair deal that met their requirements , said vincent a carrega he and norman k livingston , both senior managing directors at grubb ellis new york , the brokerage concern , worked on the transaction for the coop for shareholders , that meant meeting certain conditions set by the university among them was that at least 80 percent of the 114 units had to be sold at the same time and of that number , 75 percent had to be vacant by the closing twenty shareholders at the building decided not to sell their apartments for its part , the university paid shareholders what dr socol called a fair market price for their units and was willing to accept a partially occupied building in need of renovation the average sale price for the studios was 96 , 000 , while for the onebedroom apartments , it was 168 , 000 , mr livingston of grubb ellis said michael a goldenberg , director of sales at the downtown office of the halstead property company , a residential brokerage concern , who is familiar with the building , said of the prices , the sellers received , at the very least , fair market value and may have exceeded it , taking into account all the characteristics of the deal the law school , established 25 years ago , serves 950 students in a single building at 55 fifth avenue , between 12th and 13th streets it is the only one of the university s four campuses , in manhattan and the bronx , where student housing was not available dr socol said the university investigated 50 deals in the last four years , including buying a residential building and knocking it down or building on top of it but none offered a practical solution , he said , and with little vacant land in greenwich village , the opportunity for new construction was limited he said the 15 east 11th street transaction fulfills two of the school s goals to provide student housing and to enhance the school s recruitment efforts dr socol said he would also explore changing the form of ownership at the building so that yeshiva , which is tax exempt , could save on real estate taxes one possibility , he said , is turning it into a condominium david e martin , a former member of the coop board at 15 east 11th street , said the coop last year began pursuing several other solutions to its problems , including selling the entire building and seeking financing to do the structural repair work but the transaction with yeshiva was seen as the best path to follow , he said prime among the reasons is that it offered coop owners the choice to sell their apartments , said mr martin , who sold the two apartments he owned at the complex to yeshiva other factors were the price and the fact that the university would invest in and enhance the value of the coop , he said , adding , it is an absolute home run for shareholders
erotic innocence the culture of child molesting by james r kincaid illustrated 352 pp durham , nc duke university press 2495 recently , the british board of film classification granted an 18orover certificate to adrian lyne s film lolita , effectively clearing it of suspicion of being likely to inflame the desires of pedophiles having consulted child psychiatrists and the police , the president of the board proclaimed himself satisfied that the film cannot be seen as corrupting , or encouraging of pedophilia well , that s a relief in the united states , on the other hand , distributors shunned the film for more than a year , before the samuel goldwyn company finally agreed to release it next month there must be reason for this fear perhaps lolita is encouraging of pedophilia after all \? in james r kincaid s scheme of things , as expounded in erotic innocence , the reason is to be found in the story we wish to tell ourselves about lolita rather than the film itself it makes little difference one way or the other whether lolita is safe for viewing or unsafe what we desire is a narrative of our desire in this case , on the subject of the corruption of children , with which we titillate , outrage and console ourselves by turns once gratified , we move on to the next story , probably more outrageous , more titillating kincaid argues that this pseudoconcern has led us to a construction of innocence , which we force onto our children the purer we make them , the greater the danger they appear to be in , and the greater our thrill in enacting what kincaid calls the myths of protection the fear that sex might corrupt them is sexually exciting for us we denounce it all loudly but never have done with it , he writes indignation comes to seem almost like pleasure this thesis leads kincaid into some interesting territory which remains visible , despite his irritatingly larky , garrulous style but also provokes him into remarkable overstatement the central tenet of erotic innocence is that the subject of the child s sexuality and erotic appeal , along with our evasion of what we have done by bestowing those gifts , now structures our culture this can only be true if , by culture , you understand oprah , sally jessy , roseanne , macaulay culkin and michael jackson , and if you watch as many movies and as much television as kincaid , a professor of english at the university of southern california , apparently does erotic innocence deals not only with child abuse but also with satanic ritual , alien abduction , the phenomenon of child movie stars \( from shirley temple on \) , recovered memory syndrome and , finally , the backlash and counterbacklash so brimming with stories is kincaid , so insistent is he in his belief that we value children very little , that he never quite forces his argument toward the questions why \? why this story and not that one \? why is a pedophile as likely now to be greeted on release from prison by a lynch mob as by a therapist \? my prime complaint about erotic innocence is that kincaid barely hesitates to consider the wider cultural implications of this change instead he throws us another story , cracks another joke , makes another questionable assertion \( when we picture our own childhood we locate a figure all but irresistible \) and then , without pausing to ask if he might be wrong , or be relying on one generalization too many , constructs another theory we fix our eyes on sexual abuse , a comparatively minor problem , because it pleases us to talk about it emotional abuse is so widespread that we hardly bother to study it apart from norway and sweden , no society in the world has taken any steps to recognize formally the rights of children perhaps we feel they have none perhaps it seldom occurs to wonder perhaps we 're waiting for a definition of rights and how that definition might be put into practice in , say , rio de janeiro among the best sections of erotic innocence is an analysis of the woody allen affair , in which the director , once he had admitted to sleeping with his wife s adopted daughter , soonyee previn \( an adult \) , suddenly found himself accused of molesting his own adopted daughter , dylan in this drama , we pay to see the child , and we run things backward , set the film in reverse , so that the 21yearold ms previn somehow gets younger and younger , folds into the body of the 7yearold dylan as kincaid points out , the scandal now seems to have evaporated allen s new movies have been no less successful than those predating the affair , and nobody much minded anymore he had done his job which was to titillate us and prepare us for the next installment for example , the spectacle of roseanne inciting victims to kill their fathers , and declaring that there are only two answers to the question were you sexually abused as a child \? yes and i do n't know there is much in erotic innocence that is provoking , annoying , amusing , by degrees , but none of it convinces me that our culture is one that seems to understand itself and formulate its fables of being in reference to child molesting such fables have been formulated and related since at least the time of moses there is a medieval scottish ballad about a creature called the silkie of skule ferry , half seal , half man , who steals children living near the sea \( presumably not for the purpose of teaching them to swim \) there are doubtless a thousand variations on the theme of the maiden being sacrificed to the firebreathing dragon if these are our fables of being , then perhaps they describe our being fairly accurately , in which case we 're stuck with it this suggestion is hardly likely to gain an audience with cultural materialists who believe that everything , our being included , is a construction that can be altered if only we 'd change the stories we tell one another to achieve this , kincaid suggests that we abandon the gothic and reimagine our romantic roots romantic in the wordsworthian sense , he means though nothing can bring back the hour of splendour in the grass , of glory in the flower we will grieve not , rather find strength in what remains behind in other words , stop looking in the mirror for the child within , and grow up it s a noble idea , but it wo n't catch on with those who , when they hear the word culture , reach for their oprah as kincaid says of one of our most popular gothic fables , more people know the details of the menendez brothers' trials than are confident about who won the napoleonic wars
hackensack , nj , sept 30 a teenager from ridgewood , nj , has been charged with breaking into the home of a college student whose last name and address were on a list he had for 12 young women , the police said today the list was on two index cards found along with two knives in a belted pouch that the 17yearold suspect was carrying when the police arrested him about 3 30 am sunday , minutes after he grappled with the woman s father and then fled in a car , ridgewood s police chief , louis j mader , said today chief mader said the teenager entered the house on valley view avenue , in one of ridgewood s wealthier neighborhoods , early sunday through an open window or door near the kitchen the family s barking dogs awakened the young woman s father , who tried to detain the youth while calling the police , chief mader said the teenager managed to flee , but officers responding to the call caught him minutes later after stopping his car a few blocks from the home , the chief said the teenager , whose name was withheld because of his age , was charged with burglary he was suspended from ridgewood high school on monday and then ordered by a new jersey family court judge on tuesday to undergo psychiatric evaluation , chief mader said the list the teenager was carrying bore the last names and addresses of 12 women and directions to their residences , chief mader said all the women are students at ridgewood high school or recent graduates , the chief said investigators had not determined why the youth kept the list or why he tried to break into one of the homes early sunday , chief mader said after his arrest , the teenager called his parents , who in turn called a lawyer , the chief said the teenager declined to give a statement , the chief said ridgewood detectives have questioned the 12 young women or their parents none knew the suspect well , the chief said , and none had reported menacing phones calls or other harassment the teenager s lawyer , robert d zatorski , of saddle brook , nj , declined to comment on the case today , citing the confidentiality of proceedings in new jersey family court
washington , oct 7 house and senate republicans agreed today on a vast overhaul of the bankruptcy system , making it more difficult for consumers to walk away from their debts and handing the banking and creditcard industries a major victory the agreement was reached without the consent of congressional democrats or the white house , and administration officials said they would recommend that president clinton veto the bill because of its treatment of lowincome consumers under the republican agreement , only consumers with relatively low incomes could declare bankruptcy under the rules that wipe out many debts but the agreement would give bankruptcy judges some discretion in determining whether debtors could file under chapter 7 , which wipes out many debts , or under chapter 13 , which requires the repayment of most debts debtors who earn more than the median income 17 , 900 for single people and 51 , 000 for a family of four would be moved into chapter 13 also sent into chapter 13 would be debtors who could repay 25 percent of their unsecured debts , like credit cards , or 5 , 000 over five years the negotiated bill weakens a requirement approved by the senate that credit card companies disclose on each monthly bill how much consumers will owe and for how long if they make only the minimum payment it also drops a senate provision that sets a 100 , 000 limit on the value of homes that could be kept by those declaring bankruptcy this means that people could still move to certain states , like florida and texas , buy expensive homes , declare bankruptcy and keep the entire worth of their homes but the compromise bill requires these people to live in the adopted state for at least two years before they can claim the homestead exemption with the perception that lowincome americans primarily women and minorities , who are among mr clinton s most reliable political allies would be hurt most by the bill , hillary rodham clinton has argued against the house version , toward which the compromise tilts mrs clinton s concern is that creditcard companies will have a stronger claim than women and children on debtors usually exhusbands who file for bankruptcy but who owe child support and alimony republicans say alimony and child support will be the priorities in any bankruptcy liquidation under this agreement , but democrats say the language is far from that clear the industry supported the bill passed by the house , which was guided by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and that thousands of americans were abusing the system the senate bill started from the premise that easily available credit was also responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the creditcard industry needed to be held accountable along with consumers the house and senate approved vastly different bills , and negotiators have been scrambling to iron out the differences before congress recesses this weekend the republican agreement was sent to the house for a vote , which could come as early as thursday republicans said today that they were happy with the compromise and that it was fair , but democrats were furious , none more so than senator richard j durbin of illinois mr durbin had joined republicans in seeking an overhaul of the bankruptcy system , and his name gave the process bipartisan credibility but he said he was shut out of the final negotiations the senate bill , which had passed 97 to 1 , has been devastated in a closeddoor republican conference , mr durbin said republican conferees stripped out every significant consumer protection in the senate bill , he said the president will not sign this bill in its present form today s agreement represents a huge success for banks , creditcard companies and retailers the lending industry spent more than 40 million to lobby for the changes , which could help it recoup an estimated 4 billion a year bankruptcy filings reached a record 142 million over the 12 months ending on june 30 , continuing a threeyear trend that has persisted despite the robust economy more than one million of these bankruptcies were filed under chapter 7 , which erases all debt except taxes , mortgages , student loans , child support , alimony and , in some cases , loans on a car needed to get to work senator charles e grassley , the iowa republican who led the negotiations for the senate , said the compromise protected honest consumers from those who abused the bankruptcy rules consumers across the country who work hard and pay their own way should not be forced to subsidize the abusive spending practices of those who exploit the federal bankruptcy code for personal gain or convenience , mr grassley said william p binzel , a lobbyist for mastercard international , said complaints of a bill that let the industry off the hook were unfounded if a lender makes credit available to someone who ca n't afford to repay it , the lender loses the principal and interest , mr binzel said the bill addresses the fundamental flaw in the law that allows a debtor who can repay a portion of his debts to use the system to walk away from those debts
madison avenue s credo these days seems to be if it moves , put an ad on it eager to stand out in the competitive and saturated visual marketplace that is new york city , advertisers are embracing moving objects with increasing fervor billboards grew wheels to weave in and out of traffic bus ads grew from modest side panels to swallow the whole vehicle and now , some advertisers are casting a longing eye on the sea of yellow taxi hoods it s fresh and different , said jeanmarc zarka , whose company has used the traveling billboard mr zarka , president of vertigo , a manhattanbased manufacturer of women s sportswear , supplements his print ads with a giant sign mounted on a truck that cruises the streets of new york city we 've gotten a great response from it , he said a few of the quirky ads have taken advantage of technological advances , while others have simply popped up on virgin surfaces but all are intended to get attention in perhaps the ultimate pedestrian city , catching new yorkers as they travel to work , race between meetings and amble during their lunch hour at the more complicated end of the spectrum are commuter buses wrapped from bumper to bumper \( windows included \) in a special vinyl with millions of pinholes that enable passengers to see out to people on the street , the buses look like floating murals , reminiscent of ken kesey s merry pranksters , except that they are pitching toyotas and apple computers another vehiclecumadvertisement , a twist on the moving billboard , is a small truck outfitted with three large window displays , each with seven scrolling panels advertising in motion , a manhattan company that has 15 trucks on the road , has driven in hightraffic areas for cbs , seagrams and ringling brothers , displaying each panel for 7 to 10 seconds then there is a hightech version of the oldfashioned magic lantern an atlantabased company , technique mirage , prowls the streets of manhattan with a 12 , 000watt light affixed to the back of a pickup truck as the truck moves through traffic , a color transparency is placed in front of the light and the image , from 60 feet to 200 feet tall , is beamed on the sides of buildings from dusk to midnight brilliant image outdoor is selling advertising space on coffee carts and vital vision advertising is mounting small ads on the back of messengers' bicycles , for a minibillboard effect at eye level now the city council is considering a proposal to allow advertising decals on the hoods of taxis \( advertising is already permitted on taxi roofs \) the proposal s fate is uncertain , not least because of the reaction of the head of the taxi and limousine commission , diane mcgrathmckechnie , who said it opens the door to all sorts of nonsense the taxi hood proposal did not come up for a vote in the city council s last session but the proposal s sponsor , councilman noach dear , has decided to reintroduce it in the current session it s an opportunity for the city to gain revenue , and it can be done with taste , mr dear said yesterday \( the city would charge 50 per cab for a permit \) the metropolitan transporation authority does not allow city buses to be completely covered in advertising e virgil conway , the chairman , decided against the vinyl wrapping so that the city bus system could be distinguished from other bus lines he also rejected it for security reasons , said an agency spokesman , tom kelly lillian h shapiro , president of ipm media international in stamford , conn , which sells the vinylwrapped ads on buses , agreed that the wrap could be a security risk on public buses because you absolutely ca n't see inside safety concerns are not the only potential roadblocks to ads on wheels it seems that there is actually a new york city department of transportation rule that prohibits anyone from operating a vehicle for the sole purpose of commercial advertising the companies that operate the moving billboards say they have stayed within the law by using their tall , slim vehicles to transport goods as well one company , montage moving sound and billboard , operates a vehicle whose width the billboard is a mere foot and a half the owner , elan nissim , insists that a narrow door at the back leads to storage space but maria smith , a transportation department spokeswoman , said the mobile ads were illegal the law is very clear , and anything done to circumvent the law is wrong and worthy of a summons , she said none of this seems to deter the billboard companies , which say they do not get tickets the cost of mobile advertising varies widely , from 200 a month for an ad on the back of a messenger s bicycle to 10 , 000 a month to cover an entire bus everyone is looking for something different and for something to stand out , said jodi yegelwel , a senior vice president and marketing director for tdi , a manhattan company that sells , posts and maintains ads for transportation authorities around the country indeed , the whole arena of alternative advertising sometimes called ambient media has mushroomed in the last decade those tiny stickers on apples and bananas are being used to promote forthcoming movies supermarkets are installing video monitors in the aisles to push particular brands automatic teller machines are flashing ads there are even ads appearing above urinals in the bathrooms of manhattan bars when it comes to mobile advertising , many new yorkers seem to be of two minds about the infusion \( some might say intrusion \) bruce sterman , coowner of manhattan chili company on west 43d street off times square , where much of the mobile advertising circulates , likes the hodgepodge of imagery but not all of it , and not when he s behind the wheel i find the moving billboards annoying because they tie up traffic , mr sterman said it s bad enough to be stuck in traffic but then you 're subjected to a dull piece of graphic art that belongs on the side of a building although there were never so many ads that bobbed and weaved , in some ways it used to be worse in the late 1800 s , riverside drive and central park , which were popular carriage routes , were bordered with giant signs after world war i , however , the city banned billboards in residential and scenic areas people were saying at the turn of the century and in the 1920 s that the saturation point had already been reached in advertising , said kathleen hulser , an adjunct professor in the department of metropolitan studies at new york university who has lectured widely on advertising people would write satiric poems in the atlantic monthly about how the united states capitol would have an ad for quaker oats but that was before the mountain could come to mohammed advertising experts say clients are pleased that the mobile advertisements not only stand out but can target specific geographic areas if you want to reach financial people , you go downtown , said michele dorso , director of outofhome media for zenith media , a manhattan firm that buys advertising space and time for other companies but sometimes the intended audience is much , much smaller douglas j frantin , president of street blimps in queens , which owns 48 roving billboards , was hired by virgin records in october to have the rolling stones followed around new york city , although , he said , the stones do n't really need any promotion because they sell out everywhere \( with offices in los angeles and chicago , street blimps was also hired to follow the group during the rest of its national tour \) wherever the group went in new york the airport , their hotel , the concert site street blimps would have a stones billboard greet them they 'd come out , they 'd smile , they liked it , mr frantin said would n't you like to see yourself on the side of a billboard \? photos three examples of mobile advertising a vinylwrapped commuter bus , top a coffee cart with a message ,

sheryl crow is , she said , conducting an experiment it s a simple one , she explained recently at the soho grand hotel , where she has been staying sporadically while her new loft in noho is renovated i'm staying home for the next two months , she said i'm going to see how that feels for ms crow , who had been touring continuously for five years before she dropped out of the lineup of the lilith fair this summer , a pause in her touring is a radical change , and not the only one she has made she has also switched from the west coast to the east , leaving behind the los angeles studio scene that had nurtured her career her music is steeped in countrytinged california rock , from bonnie raitt to fleetwood mac , with some rolling stones guitar licks for ballast since she arrived in los angeles from her native missouri in 1986 , she had worked her way up through the west coast music business singing backup with michael jackson and don henley , writing songs that were recorded by eric clapton and celine dion and , eventually , in weekly latenight sessions at her producer s studio , completing her first album , tuesday night music club adjusted now to new york city , she walks over to hear bands at clubs like acme underground , fez and irving plaza and has become what she called a subwayholic a song hidden at the end of her new album , the globe sessions \( am \) , is a rumination from a rider on the e train i love thinking i'm getting somewhere even if i'm not , ms crow said for me , it s really quiet and peaceful somehow in the hubbub of it i can hear my own voice ms crow , who is 36 , had been in motion since the release in 1993 of tuesday night music club she worked her way from clubs to openingact slots to headliner while the album sold 72 million copies worldwide and brought ms crow her first three grammy awards , including record of the year \( for its hit single all i wanna do \) and best new artist between stretches of touring , she made the followup album , sheryl crow , which has sold 48 million copies since its release in 1996 it won grammys for best female rock vocal and best rock album with her newly released third album , the globe sessions , ms crow is staying in new york , where she has sung before television cameras saturday night live , late show with david letterman and an edition of storytellers taped for the cable music channel vh1 her next fullscale tour is scheduled to begin in february there is a part of me that wants to have a home that is an inspiring atmosphere , as inspiring to me as being on the road is , ms crow said and i 've put that off because i have n't wanted to make the time to do it or did n't really want to deal with doing it it s just easier to be on a tour bus with my friends most of the globe sessions was made at globe studios in the meatpacking district of the west village i loved working there , she said my studio was across the street from hogs and heifers and the hog pit , where i could get mashed potatoes and fried chicken any night i wanted and then you have transvestite hookers everywhere , and hell s angels , and it just was a cool , cool vibe if you ever got really hung up in the frustration of trying to get something accomplished in the studio , you could walk out and just be amongst some bizarre energy it clears your head and gives you some perspective when you walk out in such a strange , frenetic , unpredictable atmosphere the album did n't come out the way ms crow had expected i went into the studio with a bunch of songs ready to go , and i did n't actually wind up putting any of them on the record , she said i think once the door gets closed and the phone is turned off , weird things tend to surface the new songs that emerged were written in the first person not the observer s perspective ms crow has often used and nearly all of them pondered romances that went wrong i'm a person that has been hung up on writing literary songs , ms crow said they 're songs that are narrative , that are maybe cerebral , maybe not , but songs that are inspired by writers maybe more than songwriters this album was n't any of that , and i was kind of embarrassed about it but i think it is a pretty clear album as far as my life goes it s not exactly autobiography , ms crow insisted none of the songs are specific to one person , she said but i did realize in making this record that i 've had a pretty distinct role in most of the demises of most of my relationships part of it has been my love affair with my road life , my love affair with my nonresponsible life relationships are hard enough when you 're present , but it s really difficult when you 're not present the songs suggest that ms crow can draw on a reservoir of melancholy that s a nice emotion to be able to tap into when you 're writing songs , she said but when i'm really miserable , i ca n't accomplish anything part of being miserable for me is that i'm convinced everything i do is terrible so then you start ripping it apart before you even finish it my manager s always trying to get me to let myself off the hook and sometimes you miss out on the joy of the great experiences i never celebrate great reviews , i never celebrate grammys bcause i always feel like i ca n't put too much weight on them while ms crow is at home in new york , she s not taking any vacation instead , she has a job as a producer for one of her idols stevie nicks called and said , 'will you do my album \? , ' ms crow said so the two months i was going to take off are now booked meanwhile , ms crow is already missing her tour routine for about the last four months , around 8 o'clock every night , i start to sense this kind of nervous energy , this kind of angst , that i have to be out , she said that touring life style feels right to me , almost as if it s a genetic memory it goes along with my puritan work ethic , and it feels like home to me i do n't tour so that i can make more albums i make albums so i can tour a few days after the interview , ms crow was rehearsing for saturday night live with a newly assembled band , she romped through two songs from the globe sessions my favorite mistake and bob dylan s mississippi , an unreleased song he offered ms crow just as she was looking for a finishing touch on the globe sessions fiddles sawed , guitars twanged and ms crow whooped as she reached the last verses she came offstage with a smile and a glint of determination in her blue eyes every time i get up there , she said , i think i 've just got to get back on the road photo

buena vista , va , aug 4 for now , all the two families are swapping are baby pictures families on both sides of the case of two 3yearold girls apparently switched shortly after birth in a virginia hospital in 1995 said today that they wanted only what was best for the toddlers , and wanted to decide the children s futures themselves , not in a courtroom but what that will mean for the two blond little girls whether they will remain with the families that they have come to know as their own or begin again with their biological relatives is still too soon to tell , family members on both sides said paula johnson of ruckersville who while trying to get a little extra money in child support from an absent father , learned through blood tests in july that her little girl , callie , was not her biological daughter said she just wanted both girls to be safe and happy , and live a normal childhood the two families rearing the other little girl , rebecca chittum whose parents were killed in a fourth of july automobile accident say they also hope that custody will not become a struggle between lawyers ms johnson , 30 , her face red and streaked with tears as she spoke this afternoon at a crowded news conference in charlottesville , said that no decision had been made by either side on whether the two girls will stay with the families that have raised them , but that she hoped issues of custody and visitation , issues that are seldom settled outside court , could be handled by the two families however it may be , ms johnson said , as long as the children are taken care of sadness seems to circle around this story here in the deep green of the shenandoah valley , a story that has drawn reporters from as far as england and that sadness goes far beyond the possible mixup of the babies' identities when asked what she thought of the photograph of the girl who could be her daughter , ms johnson said she was struck by the fact that she was a beautiful child , and that she looked like me meanwhile , she said , none of her love for callie has evaporated with the knowledge that she did not come from her body this child is absolutely wonderful , said ms johnson , who has other children my two oldest boys , they want to know how callie is going to understand any of this they want to know how i'm going to tell her if the babies were indeed switched at birth , on june 30 , 1995 , that would mean it was callie , not rebecca , who was legally orphaned by the crash that killed tamara whitney rogers , 19 , and kevin chittum , 25 they were engaged to be married mary watts , mr chittum s aunt and rebecca s greataunt , wept when she saw pictures of ms johnson holding callie i cried , ms watts said , because her little child looked just like kevin the automobile crash happened just one day after ms johnson learned through tests at the university of virginia hospital that not only was the man she believed to be callie s father , carlton conley , not the one , but also that she was not her birth mother since the accident , which also killed mr chittum s 13yearold sister , bridget chittum , and 11yearold niece , sheena miskovsky , as well as two neighborhood children , rebecca has been cared for by the chittum and rogers families they worked out a joint custody agreement to rear the little girl and a 1yearold sibling , lindsey much of that responsibility had fallen on rosa chittum , rebecca s grandmother on monday , rosa chittum told reporters that the whole thing had been just awful family members caring for rebecca have so far refused to agree to a dna test that would prove whether rebecca really is ms johnson s child the family s lawyer , pete robey , said , they want to know , but they do n't want to know mr robey said that no matter what test results might show , the two families wanted to continue sharing custody of rebecca the best solution , both sides say , is that the two little girls wind up with two sets of people who love them , but both sides have hired lawyers even though they say they do not want to use them such cases , legal experts say , are usually settled in protracted court battles that are often disastrous for the children involved here in buena vista , a small town overshadowed by wooded peaks and gently nudged by a slowmoving river , people applaud the two families that stepped in to care for rebecca after her parents died , and wonder how such a mistake if it was a mistake could have happened in a hospital nursery ms watts , rebecca s great aunt , said i 'd tell everybody , 'you 'd better have your baby tested before you leave the hospital , to make sure it s yours' i'm angry the hospital made a mistake officials at the university of virginia hospital , however , have said they do not know how such a mistake could have been made , and are assisting with a criminal investigation meanwhile , the two girls will stay with the families that now care for them as visitation and custody is worked out , family members said the case , as sad as it is , seems to have answered one question ms watts said she was once told by ms rogers , rebecca s mother , that the baby did n't really look like her she said that she did n't really look like anybody , ms watts said photo callie marie johnson was given to the wrong mother after her birth \( associated press \)
atlanta , aug 19 one after another today , the seven groups vying to buy the new cleveland browns presented their case before national football league owners game faces on , members of each group emerged more hopeful than ever that theirs would be the lucky one chosen to pay a record price for a sports franchise , a sum expected to exceed 500 million thus went a kind of double jeopardy round of the unprecedented sweepstakes to bring a browns franchise back to cleveland after a threeseason hiatus caused when art modell took the former browns to baltimore in 1996 they saved the best for last and i think they were rewarded , said a beaming howard milstein , the new york real estate developer , whose group features two former browns , paul warfield and calvin hill , as well as several elite clevelandarea business executives lawrence dolan , whose brother , charles , the chairman of cablevision systems , is bankrolling a family bid , said , that was a tense little situation , and i did n't fall down dolan was also representing two star limited investors don shula , the former miami dolphins coach , and bill cosby another group was represented by thomas murdough , chairman of the step 2 company , a clevelandarea manufacturer of products for children we told them , 'give us the ball we 're ready to go , ' he said and carmen policy , former president of the san francisco 49ers and now chief executive of a group headed by alfred lerner , a billionaire creditcard executive , said having been on the other side , i 'd fall madly in love with the lernerpolicy group each of the seven groups got up to 30 minutes in an airport hotel conference room here to tell the 30 nfl owners why its bid was more qualified than the others because of deep pockets , business acumen and cleveland civic involvement besides the principal spokesman or main financier for each group , several stars spoke they included shula , hill , warfield and jim brown , the hall of fame cleveland running back brown is supporting a bid by bart wolstein , a cleveland real estate developer i said i'm interested in winning championships , making sure the bid is inclusive and the fans get a hardhitting football team , brown said the nearly daylong process did not entail heavy questioning from the owners two groups left without being asked a question richard jacobs , who paid 46 million to buy the indians in 1986 , ticked off his reasons for wanting to own the browns in 15 minutes it was lunchtime , he said i heard stomachs growling all seven groups will now head to the next level each will submit a final bid to goldman , sachs company , the league s financial adviser after those offers are made , eric grubman , a managing director at goldman , sachs , will attempt to orchestrate still higher bids , a process that is expected to force some groups to rethink making a mammoth offer on sept 8 in chicago , at least two bidders who have signed definitive agreements to buy the browns will go before the 30 owners if all seven groups survive the auction process , all could be presented at this meeting , but that is considered unlikely the group that receives 23 of 30 votes will win the prize the most expensive team ever , which will play in a new 270 million lakefront stadium and receive 70 million a year in television money it could be a very long meeting , paul tagliabue , the nfl commissioner , said it could go to sept 9 , sept 10 , sept 11 none of the seven , who could be joined by still other bidders , sounded as if they intended to exit any time soon murdough , for example , is lining up extra investors as the number goes higher , he said , we want to be prepared to make an aggressive bid some spokesmen indicated there is a price at which owning the browns is ridiculous , but none would specify it alan spitzer , a limited partner in wolstein s group , said we 've looked at the cash flow and we have to decide what works for us and how little return is acceptable hopefully , it s not below zero lerner said do you think i can get all the way up to just a little return \? league rules that were passed last year prohibit members from owning teams in competing markets dual ownership of major sports franchises is permitted , but only when they are in the same , or neutral , market milstein has already said he will sell his nearly halfshare in the islanders if he buys the browns jeremy jacobs , the owner of the boston bruins , said he would not sell the hockey team as a condition of owning the browns i love the bruins , he said cablevision owns the knicks and the rangers , but lawrence dolan insisted that the way he and his brother have structured their group , they would not have to sell the two new york franchises this is a personal , private matter , dolan said , adding that his enormously wealthy brother is not the general partner of their browns venture i am would such a structure be an obvious evasion of the rules \? it s not transparent to the national football league , he said tagliabue would not rule out jeremy jacobs or the dolans as prospective owners we 're continuing to discuss our crossownership rules , he said , and the structures that would comply photo jeremy jacobs , left , and commissioner paul tagliabue after jacobs s group outlined its bid for the browns \( john kuntz for the new york times \)
like cashiered spies groping for a mission , veteran literary spy masters are coming out of the cold war into a new world order that is hard on current sales and indifferent to their oldfashioned trenchcoat espionage fiction some wellknown authors have recently parted with their publishing houses in search of a fresh approach to increase sales , a strategy as elusive as kgb moles others , like john le carre , have found intrigue in new settings in march his new book , which promises the thrills of a spy novel in a sinister world of international finance , will be published the book begins , of course , with the execution of a lawyer in hornrimmed glasses most dramatic , perhaps , is the literary turn taken by frederick forsyth , the author of the day of the jackal and the odessa file , who has changed publishing houses as his sales have declined , acquired a new literary agent and publicly renounced the thriller genre to try my hand at something else something else is a slim volume , a sequel to gaston leroux s 1910 novel , the phantom of the opera , that grew out of discussions with the composer lord lloyd webber , who may stage it as a musical mr forsyth s publisher of more than 25 years , bantam , chose not to buy the manuscript , the phantom of manhattan , which places the disfigured character in a coney island factory cleaning fish but the author found another taker the market is colder than a siberian winter for espionage tales , many publishing executives and agents say , blaming the end of the cold war and shifts in readers' tastes today they prefer the tom clancy style of technological thrillers featuring exotic military weapons and an executivestyle cia hero to the lonely agent who survives deception , betrayals and multiplying body counts in the twilight world of espionage when someone like freddie does n't want to write them anymore , then there must be something going on in the world that makes it difficult for a master , said mr forsyth s new agent , ed victor , who said that the authors' moves probably reflect that spy fiction has peaked , and people usually look for people to blame , which means you can fire your publisher , fire your agent since the berlin wall crumbled in 1989 and the soviet union collapsed in 1991 , writers who established themselves by exploring the duplicitous world of spycraft have had much more difficulty climbing the heights of the new york times bestseller list , occupying those rarefied levels for fewer weeks if at all for example , len deighton followed the life of bernard samson , a starcrossed british agent , in three trilogies , two of which were best sellers in the 1980 s and 1990 but the last set , published through 1996 , failed to make the ranks mr forsyth achieved enduring success with the day of the jackal and the odessa file , which lingered on the list for 48 weeks but his last best seller , icon , a postcommunist thriller set in a disintegrating russia , slipped off the list after two weeks paperback sales for the day of the jackal exceeded 35 million copies while sales for icon were a million less , a publishing executive with knowledge of the sales history said for his sequel to the phantom of the opera , mr forsyth has signed with an untraditional publisher , michael viner , the president of new millennium entertainment in beverly hills mr viner is better known for publishing tellall nonfiction like faye resnick s book about nicole brown simpson in the last two months , writers like robert ludlum and ken follett have left their publishing houses for new ones , moves that often reflect polite differences about advances or sales expectations that publishers do not consider promising enough to justify the generous contracts of flush days how the genre waxes and wanes but the public explanation from mr ludlum , mr follett and mr le carre is a desire for fresh approaches , a yearning that has seized some wellknown writers like an oldfashioned global conspiracy mr ludlum , who achieved his biggest successes in the 1970 s with tales of complex global plots , left his publisher of more than two decades , bantam , for st martin s press , which offered him an eightfigure contract and a new strategy his sales at bantam had settled to a plateau of about 450 , 000 copies for recent titles like the matarese countdown , whose plot revolved around a cia rookie battling a planetthreatening dynasty of killers it s certainly harder to get an audience hot about the cold war , because it s just not there anymore , said jack romanos , the president of simon schuster , which is publishing mr le carre s new book through its scribner imprint it s been difficult to take it to a different area people have tried to make it work in south america , the middle east and china , but it never had the same cachet as when it was the good old americans against the communists historically , spy fiction has flourished and waned with the inspiration of war or its threat the first spy novel in western literature is credited to james fenimore cooper , who in 1821 wrote the spy a tale of the neutral ground , a novel based on a revolutionary war spy , said thomas b allen , coauthor of a reference guide , spy book

giddiness helps at the judith anderson theater , especially a capacity for giddiness over henrik ibsen although never present as a character , the great norwegian playwright is nonetheless omnipresent in the summer in gossensass this play , by maria irene fornes , is the concluding attraction of the 20thanniversary season of women s project and productions , which is dedicated to producing plays by women presented without intermission and running through sunday at the theater , on theater row , this highspirited though sometimes cloyingly stylized meditation was inspired by and is about hedda gabler it is simultaneously a homage to ibsen and his feminism , a celebration of the two actresses responsible for the first production of hedda gabler , in london in 1891 , and an evocation of an era when news traveled slowly and more than the warholian allotment of 15 minutes was available to receive , consider , debate and become enthusiastic about innovative art and ideas in addition , the summer in gossensass , directed by the playwright , is something of a comic valentine to the antediluvian avantgarde , a consideration of the evolution of acting styles and a trip back through time to a period when ideas about the psychological underpinnings of characters and those who play them constituted a thrilling novelty the title refers to the place where one summer ibsen encountered the young woman who became the model for the driven hedda , stifled by her marriage and bourgeois life and the focal figures of ms fornes s play are two actresses , elizabeth robins \( molly powell \) , an american whose portrayal of hedda earned her renown , and her friend marion lea \( clea rivera \) throughout the play , set in london , these woman remain in a state of almost breathless rapture as they discuss bohemianism in norway , news of ibsen s play , hedda s motivations and reviews from munich likening hedda to a monster , with no parallel in real life elizabeth s astute brother , vernon \( daniel blinkoff \) , a medical student who sees a parallel between scientific diagnosis and the analysis of character in the creation of art , begs to differ at last a copy of hedda gabler arrives , in norwegian , along with news that the english rights have been acquired for a production based on a poor translation that has , in addition , been cut to accommodate the inadequate talents of its star , none other than lillie langtry before the curtain goes up on the first english production , marion will have come up with a few discarded pages of the translation , and the two women will make the acquaintance of the spindly david \( joseph goodrich \) , a fellow ibsen enthusiast hopeful of a role in the play and embodying a few amusingly enacted ideas of his own about the playwright the cast , including valda setterfield as lady bell , an older woman who shares an interest in ibsen without the sometimes monotonous mania of the younger women , is engaging audiences for the summer in gossensass , which overcomes its slow and instructive beginning to generate some amusement as it displays the virtues of its homage and history , will enjoy the play most if they are already giddy about ibsen the summer in gossensass written and directed by maria irene fornes sets by donald eastman costumes by gabriel berry lighting by philip widmer production manager , ken allaire production stage manager , bryan scott clark presented by the women s project and productions , julia miles , artistic director patricia taylor , managing director at the judith anderson theater , 422 west 42d street , clinton with molly powell \( elizabeth robins \) , clea rivera \( marion lea \) , valda setterfield \( lady bell \) , daniel blinkoff \( vernon robins \) and joseph goodrich \( david \) photo from left , molly powell , clea rivera and valda setterfield in the summer in gossensass , maria irene fornes s play about ibsen \( martha holmes the summer of gossensass \)
it was veterans day , and as harold leventhal ducked into carnegie hall through the back and followed a yellowish strip on an indian red floor , you got the feeling he had been here before harold ! boomed a voice from what s officially known as the ticket office office , how are you \? you 're looking great today s your day , harold you 're a veteran , a veteran promoter as mr leventhal was quick to remind him , he actually is an army veteran , with a memorable stint in the signal corps in india in world war ii but if anyone in american music qualifies as a veteran promoter , it is harold leventhal , who began as a song plugger for irving berlin , survived the blacklist with the folk singing weavers , put on bob dylan s first concert hall date , and has been bringing artists to places like carnegie hall for nearly half a century he is pretty much down to one event a year , two thanksgiving weekend concerts that began with the weavers around 1960 , then featured pete seeger and for years now have featured arlo guthrie , with mr seeger as a guest this year at carnegie the concerts on the friday and saturday after thanksgiving keep adding new generations this year they include mr seeger s grandson , tao rodriguez , and mr guthrie s children , abe and sarah but pushing 80 , mr leventhal remains a living history of 20thcentury music from the bigband era through the folk revival , when he managed or promoted concerts for such artists as the weavers , mr seeger , theodore bikel , judy collins and joan baez and handled the business affairs of woody guthrie as he began to show the effects of huntington s disease , the degenerative illness that killed him in 1967 he now spends much of his time managing the woody guthrie archives with mr guthrie s daughter , nora harold s a remarkable person , totally honest with a great sense of humor , said mr seeger , who pays tribute to mr leventhal in the program notes for the thanksgiving concert he did something extraordinary for the weavers he stuck his neck out and had faith in us when others would n't you might say he had faith in america , too mr leventhal never much went beyond the artists and ethos of the folk era , but he does n't feel he missed much either i got some calls from rock groups , he said without much interest prodded for examples he cites , a trio i ca n't recall the name stills was one of them it was crosby , stills and nash but i wanted to stay where i was comfortable and stay with people i thought were making a good contribution i never felt comfortable in the rock world the behavior the whole scene it was n't my style mr leventhal s style mixes liberal politics , the bronx of the depression years and the laidback sensibilities of the folk era wearing a gray sweater vest and sky blue turtleneck over his santa claus physique , he has the look of a frizzy jewish buddha and he can drop remarkable names as casually as mel brooks s 2 , 000yearold man mr leventhal was born in ellenville , ny , in 1919 , the youngest of five children of immigrant parents , his mother from the ukraine , his father from lithuania his father died of the flu eight weeks after mr leventhal was born the next year the family moved to the lower east side , his mother working as a janitor in the building where they lived , and then to the bronx in 1933 without a record player in the house , music was not a big part of his youth , except for an occasional trip to the yiddish theaters on second avenue but his older brother , herbert , got a job with irving berlin , and mr leventhal followed him there , soon working as a song plugger , taking berlin s songs to big bands like harry james s or singers like dinah shore , then staying out schmoozing until 2 in the morning at lindy s and other nightspots a favorite memory is pairing frank sinatra with benny goodman as a onenight fill in somehow he found a way to transplant those skills to india when he served there as a corporal in the signal corps the most charismatic man i ever met was nehru , he allowed in talking about world war ii a photo of the two hangs in his office handsome debonair gracious in his manner a very impressive man it turns out india s first prime minister also gave him a letter of introduction to take to gandhi the first day i met him was a thursday he does n't talk on thursday , mr leventhal recalled i wrote him a note , and he wrote on it i should come back the next day , which i did the first thing he wanted to know was how paul robeson was i did n't know much except to say that as far as i knew he was ok we had several talks he wanted to know about truman , who had just become president he was very inquisitive about that it was all a unique experience for an army corporal after the war he gravitated back to the music business and one night in 1949 found himself in greenwich village listening to the weavers , who were unknown at the time folk music was the most distant commercial backwater , but he liked the members , their politics and their music and soon became their manager it was the most important liaison of his career
gov george pataki s call to end parole for felons convicted of violent offenses may resonate with voters concerned about crime but he is doing little more than playing to general frustrations and fears if mr pataki is serious about eliminating parole in new york , then he has to begin the hard work of producing a comprehensive plan that will reform the state s criminal sentencing system , of which parole is only a part new york operates under a traditional parole system in which offenders are sentenced by judges to a range of time in prison , such as 5 to 15 years , rather than a specific term after a prisoner has served the low end of that sentence range , he is eligible for parole the vast majority of offenders are released after serving twothirds of their maximum sentences after release , offenders are subject to parole supervision for the balance of their sentences in theory parole rewards rehabilitation , while also giving the state some control over offenders as they reenter society but the reality is much bleaker release decisions by the parole board often seem arbitrary , leading to differing outcomes for people convicted of the same crime questions about racial disparity in parole decisions have often been raised critics also charge that parole breeds public anger and cynicism when offenders are released before their sentences end many states have met these criticisms head on by replacing parole with determinate sentencing plans in which all offenders are given specific prison terms , allowing only small reductions for good behavior instead of setting very long maximum sentences that almost no one serves out , determinate sentencing sets shorter terms that convicts actually serve moving to determinate sentencing requires adjusting sentences for most if not all crimes many states , in revamping their sentencing plans , have also created alternatives to incarceration for lesser crimes mr pataki s proposal would do none of this it would simply make offenders serve out the maximum sentences under the old parole system he would in effect be doubling or tripling current sentences for violent crimes this plan would cause an expansion of the prison population , which has more than doubled in the past 15 years , and add enormous new costs there is little evidence that public safety would be served by lengthening sentences across the board if mr pataki is serious about creating a more rational system that eliminates parole , he would have to be open to reducing sentences for some crimes a rigorous debate about parole and sentencing reform would be welcome in new york state , especially if it caused policy makers to repeal the rockefeller drug laws that impose senselessly long mandatory sentences for many smalltime , nonviolent drug offenders so far , mr pataki s comments have not touched on these real issues
brentwood , ny , aug 19 lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross came under attack tonight by her three rivals for the democratic nomination for governor , who used a debate here to question her loyalty to democratic values , her political experience and her competence in a debate that had been largely marked by comity and unity of purpose the candidates spent the bulk of the evening assailing gov george e pataki the three other democrats made the same choice when offered a chance to select one candidate to question they turned on ms mccaughey ross , the former republican who is now seeking the democratic nomination to run against the man who brought her into politics i wonder , in all earnestness , said one of the candidates , charles j hynes , the brooklyn district attorney , what is it about your experience as lieutenant governor that prepares you to be the chief executive of a state with a 72 billion budget another candidate , james l larocca , the former state transportation commissioner , asked why ms mccaughey ross , who is also the liberal party candidate for governor , would not agree to support the winner of the democratic primary if it was not her and the other gubernatorial candidate , peter f vallone , the new york city council speaker , asked if ms mccaughey ross was aware that he had introduced city legislation mandating the use of trigger locks on handguns , similar to a bill ms mccaughey ross has called for statewide the exchange came in a race that has until now been remarkably placid indeed , until the questions about ms mccaughey ross were posed at the debate at suffolk county community college here , the discussion had been free of wrangling until then , each candidate had taken turns , in their second debate , serving up a variety of criticisms of mr pataki s effectiveness as governor and his political ethics the attacks on ms mccaughey ross seemed to reflect continuing uncertainty among the various camps over the shape of the race and how best to position their candidate from the start , she has been assumed to be a frontrunner , if only because she is the only woman in the race and because her husband , wilbur ross , an industrialist , was said by her campaign to be prepared to finance a heavy television advertising campaign on her behalf \( with the election less than a month away , it remains unclear whether he will actually do so \) mr vallone s aides distributed a statement attacking ms mccaughey ross s record even before the debate began ms mccaughey ross appeared unfazed by the attacks , seeming to welcome the jostling when mr larocca accused the lieutenant governor of using government funds to print a report on the state economy that has become a staple of her campaign appearances , she brushed aside his remark as a distortion \( a notice on the report says it was not published at taxpayers' expense \) and when mr larocca pushed her about why she would not promise to support the democratic candidate if she lost the nomination , ms mccaughey ross dismissed the line of inquiry as irrelevant when working families watch this on television , she responded , they are less concerned with insider party politics than the fundamental issues facing the people of new york as a group , the democrats differed on one major issue the death penalty only mr hynes opposes it mr vallone strongly endorsed capital punishment , referring to convicted killers who murder prison guards there are people who will kill again , mr vallone said i have no problem whatsoever in sending them back to their maker ms mccaughey ross said she was more concerned about domestic violence but she said she has come to accept the death penalty a society has a right to express its moral outrage , she said but mr hynes promised that his top priority , if elected , would be to revoke the law that was a centerpiece of mr pataki s 1994 campaign the death penalty is a phony , mr hynes said it s a phony issue it s not punishment at all to stick a needle in someone s arm after 15 years of appeals he said he favored real life without parole , the kind of punishment the federal government gives to john gotti , who spends 23 hours a day in a jail cell mr larocca sought to distinguish himself from his opponents by urging them to sign a pledge promising not to take money from interests doing business with the state we cannot make the case against george pataki , who runs his campaign on this selfinterested big money , if we ourselves are part of this process , he said i am the only candidate who is not part of this system none took mr larocca up on his offer and on an issue of particular concern here , the state takeover of the long island lighting company , ms mccaughey ross , mr vallone and mr hynes denounced the deal and said it should have been put up for a public referendum mr larocca , the only long island resident in the race , said the issue should be abandoned i think it s for long island to put this issue behind us , mr larocca said most long islanders are happy to be getting rid of the company they did n't like , happy to get the rebates they 're going to get it s time for politicians to find the next issue to make their bones on for all that , though , the candidates were nearly in unison as they attacked mr pataki on a variety of fronts , ranging from his administration of the state government to his fundraising practices to his recent display of national ambition governor we have problems , mr vallone said you 're out of state you 're out of touch you have to come back and address those problems the candidates assailed mr pataki for pushing for increases in tuition for the state university of new york pataki s huge tuition increase at suny , combined with the deep cuts in their operating budget , has deprived students of an education , mr hynes said the four candidates also criticized mr pataki for allowing the state debt to increase during his first four years in office mr larocca said he would push legislation that would mandate that 25 percent of any surplus go toward paying down the state s debt george pataki came to new york and said he was a fiscal conservative , mr larocca said he is sinking new york into debt at a rate that would make nelson rockefeller and abraham beame blush we are on our way to a debt situation exactly like 1975 , when we were at the brink of bankruptcy in new york photo facing off in a debate last night at suffolk community college were the four candidates for the democratic nomination for

ibm warned yesterday that its earnings for the first quarter would be dragged down by the rising dollar , a sales decline in asia and several onetime factors , even as it reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 1997 that were slightly above expectations in the fourth quarter , the international business machines corporation earned 21 billion , up 34 percent from 2 billion a year earlier on a pershare basis , the earnings were up 93 percent , to 211 a share from 193 , largely because 7 billion in stock buybacks in 1997 reduced the number of shares outstanding nonetheless , the rising dollar had already undercut the company s fortunes over all , the company s revenue increased by 3 percent in the fourth quarter , to 237 billion but if the dollar had stayed at a constant exchange rate , increasing sales overseas would have increased revenue by 8 percent the company also had to write off 50 million to 75 million from losses in asia , mainly related to the failure of yamaichi securities in japan the results were released after the market closed earlier , the company s shares rose 3375 , to 108375 , but they gave up some of those gains in afterhours trading speaking to analysts , lawrence r ricciardi , ibm s acting chief financial officer , said the company s earnings for the first quarter of 1998 would be 10 to 15 cents a share below the 116 it earned in the first quarter of 1997 that represents a potential decline of as much as 17 percent , or close to 200 million , from the 12 billion ibm earned in the first quarter of 1997 this reflects further appreciation of the dollar , a slowdown of sales in many asian countries , and continued pressure to cut prices furthermore , ibm will take onetime writeoffs related to its 200 million acquisition of software artistry , a maker of helpdesk software , and will have unusual expenses related to its sponsorship of the winter olympics in nagano , japan no one of these factors is extraordinary or unusual , but taken together , we have had an extraordinary concatenation of events , mr ricciardi said in an interview yesterday ibm , like many big companies , has tried to hedge its risk from a rising dollar , but mr ricciardi said that it had not prepared for changes of the magnitude that have been seen in asia with devaluations in currency anywhere from 12 percent to 66 percent , country by country , since the end of june to today , you are facing a market in which the purchasing power of local companies has been significantly reduced , he said the declines are somewhat offset by lower costs from ibm s manufacturing plants in singapore and thailand , he said in the fourth quarter , overall sales in the company s asiapacific region were flat as gains in australia and china were offset by declines elsewhere the fastestgrowing region was north america , which posted a 9 percent revenue increase mr ricciardi was upbeat about the company s prospects for the rest of this year , beyond the first quarter i am not prepared to hang any black crepe with respect to asia , mr ricciardi said i am starting to feel that asia may be turning back analysts were surprised at mr ricciardi s optimism our economists are more concerned about the serious ramifications of the far east , steven milunovich , an analyst with merrill lynch company , said none of the other potential expenses in the first quarter particularly troubled analysts , despite the high cost of advertising and providing technology related to the olympics the olympics are an important way for ibm to show their customers what they can do , mr milunovich said they had some problems last time in atlanta , so it s good that they are not backing off over all , ibm s hardware sales declined 1 percent in the fourth quarter , hurt by declines in the very largest mainframe computers sold to businesses and in personal computers sold to consumers the company s services business , the source of much of its recent growth , slowed slightly , with revenue increasing by 18 percent in the quarter , the first time in recent years that the growth has been less than 20 percent we expect to grow faster than the overall services business and do it profitably , mr ricciardi said , but we do n't expect to grow at prior years' rates software sales increased by 1 percent , with strong sales of its data base , lotus notes and tivoli computer management products over all , the company s gross profit margin its sales minus the cost of the goods sold was 401 percent , down slightly from a year earlier expenses increased by only 1 percent , to 65 billion , helped by lower costs overseas in constant currency , expenses rose by 5 percent for the full year , ibm earned 59 billion , up from 54 billion in 1996 , in which the company took about 500 million in special charges its 1997 revenue was 785 billion , an increase of 3 percent table international business machines corp \( ibm , n \) qtr to dec 31 1997 1996 ch rev 23

el nino visited ventura , calif , one evening recently , turning the legendary pacific surf the color of cappuccino the ventura river had washed over and claimed highway 101 rain and gravity had their way with chunks of the coastal range a wild air had enveloped surfers' point , known for its waisthigh swells , transforming the beach into a chaotic tangle of driftwood beneath which displaced rattlesnakes lurked the next morning , over homemade pineapple muffins in the company cafeteria of patagonia , the outdoor gear and clothing empire two blocks from the coast , the question everyone was asking was , where is yvon \? soon , a compact man in a wool sweater and muddy organiccotton jeans emerged , clearly invigorated from having spent the night on the office floor in a sleeping bag raided from the emergency stash in the company s disaster box \( only at patagonia \) you have to be a dirt bag , camping out , chouinard explained cheerfully , evoking his mythic days as an itinerant mountain climber and blacksmith en route to becoming a millionaire ecobaron now i'm a rich dirt bag , i guess crisis agrees with yvon chouinard even now , as he nears 60 , past the storm years of his strength when he tested his youthful powers on numerous first ascents and revolutionized the world of climbing gear , it is difficult to separate chouinard the myth from chouinard the man the mythic chouinard is the one pictured young and barechested in front of his anvil on the tags of his clothes , embodied in dusty pitons since enshrined behind glass his spirit resides in the ramshackle , corrugatedtin shed where the company started , which still stands in wobbly , heroic splendor , the dirtbag equivalent of lincoln s birthplace he is the shamanistic figure whose reallife adventures have spawned a hundred catalogues and umpteen fleece pullovers promising to wick nervous sweat away from your skin famously restless and elusive , like the wild searun brown trout and steelhead he cherishes , chouinard the man is curiously warm and without bravado he is a survivor , highly adept at solving difficult problems he s a man who has made it a point to drink from every stream he has ever fished , no matter how germridden , having decided early on that i 'd be outside the rest of my life , so i had to adapt i 've gotten sick a lot , but each time i got stronger and less sick he measures his words carefully to reach the stories hidden beneath the surface of being buried under an avalanche in southwestern china that killed a close friend , of being stranded in antarctica in 100 mileanhour winds , of scaling granite canyon walls in the russian arctic with the butt of a fly rod in the back of his pants requires persistence and long , steady casts though he still spiritually oversees the company he founded beside the surf in the early 70 s , chouinard spends at least half the year in the earth s most remote reaches , ostensibly dreaming up new ideas , surfing in the maldives in the indian ocean or bonefishing off christmas island in the south pacific a maverick entrepreneur who donates 1 percent of the company s gross annual sales to grassroots environmental causes , chouinard travels with fellow gallivanters who can afford exorbitant plane tickets , friends like the nbc anchor tom brokaw and the writer thomas mcguane i look forward to these bursts of male bonding we get to eat dinner in our long underwear , mcguane said a veteran risktaker , chouinard plays the endorphin to their adrenaline yvon s idea of comfort is spending the night halfway up a mountain sharing half a submarine sandwich while wrapped in a nylon shroud when a cold front comes in , brokaw said we call ourselves the doboys , he added we go do things two doboys chouinard and mcguane recently returned from tierra del fuego , or tdf , as it is known among jetsetting anglers during that trip chouinard reached what he called an apogee on a windless , rainy day on the rio grande using mostly dry flies , they had caught around 20 deluxe searun brown trout , which , as always , they returned to the river mcguane caught a 25 pounder we figured out that we have had 100 years of fly fishing between us , and this was singularly the greatest day of our lives , chouinard said , demonstrating with a blacksmith s precision the graceful , eggshaped arc made by a doublehanded rod thinking about it , the whole rhythm and smoothness of the effort that makes you forget about time , brings chouinard perilously close to a zen calm it runs counter to his rather infamous reputation as a ranting , cantankerous pessimist , a particularly annoying trait in someone with a posthemingway fantasy life style this gloom , friends say , is the frustration of a man accustomed to fixing things who cannot fix the ultimate equipment failure the earth but on this day , his attitude is tempered by the thought of the rio grande itself , the only thing i can think of that s getting better , he said perhaps he is mellowing or perhaps it was the trout
when police officers took manuel villa to st john s hospital in queens on nov 10 , 1994 , his face was so bruised that doctors thought he had been in a car wreck mr villa , a mechanic with no criminal record , said he had been pummeled by dozens of blows from two detectives questioning him about his brother s role in a shooting a police department prosecutor who interviewed participants and examined medical records contended that the assault was so brutal that the detectives should be dismissed and face criminal charges but when the case finally came before a departmental tribunal two months ago , the detectives reached a plea agreement , admitting only to using excessive force specifically , striking mr villa four times they were docked 20 vacation days the police prosecutor , sgt gil q alvarez , has sued the department over what he called a coverup of the case , contending that the detectives got off easy because commanders ordered him to conceal evidence against them his evidence , he says in the suit , would have shown both that the beating of mr villa was far more severe than the detectives admitted , and that the detectives lied during the department s investigation of the case , which could result in dismissal from the force sergeant alvarez s claim of a police coverup became public earlier this month after he filed a federal suit charging that he had been demoted and harassed because he objected to the department s handling of the villa case but the details of what happened to mr villa , and the penalty imposed on the detectives involved , are only now coming to light the federal bureau of investigation and the justice department s civil rights division are investigating sergeant alvarez s allegations , which are the latest in a series of complaints that the police department does not aggressively investigate or punish officers who use excessive force in addition , prosecutors in the queens district attorney s office say they are now considering criminal charges against lawrence schwartz and dwayne shepherd , the detectives who beat mr villa sergeant alvarez contends in his lawsuit that his commanders ordered him not to refer the case to the district attorney , whose office first learned about the allegations from an account two weeks ago in the new york times detective schwartz s lawyer , richard dienst , said the incident received a thorough hearing and that the penalty , which was approved by police commissioner howard safir , was appropriate there was absolute and full disclosure in this case as to the wrongdoing , the injuries and the mitigating circumstances that justify the penalty handed down , mr dienst said there was no coverup there was no hiding of any evidence that i know of the police officers who took mr villa to the hospital after he was beaten told doctors he had slipped and hit his head on a desk but once the officers left the room , mr villa told a nurse that he had been pummeled by two officers and two detectives , who handcuffed him , pinned him to the floor of the 106th precinct detective squad room and took turns punching him in the face , hitting him with more than 50 blows the first cop just kept pounding , punching my eye one after the other , boom , boom , boom , at least 20 times , like a boxer hitting a speed bag , mr villa , now 23 , said in an interview last week then they rolled me over and the other one took his turns on the other side , about a dozen shots , slower , because he was n't in very good shape sergeant alvarez charges in his federal civil rights suit

galveston , tex after graduating from o'connell high school here last may , billy russell planned to go to a community college and play football this fall instead , he is sitting at home with a diploma that is little more than a piece of paper in a nice red folder billy , 17 , who was a special education student , said in a recent interview that he had been recruited to play football at o'connell , a roman catholic school , with the promise of tutoring and financial assistance the coach said if there would be less kids , it would be better for me and i can learn , billy said in an interview recently but the help never came , he said , and he failed most of his classes still , he and six other students who were athletes were allowed to graduate even though they lacked the necessary credits it was only when billy s mother , catherine russell , asked for her son s transcript last summer that she and her son learned that billy should never have graduated by that time , the school had released its principal , thomas ducote , and the football coach , sam zimmerle , and the diocese said it had taken steps to insure that such a situation did not happen again the texas association of private and parochial schools has penalized o'connell high school for several violations , including breaking recruiting rules , and billy and his parents have retained a lawyer this school cheated him for a year , said charles j argento , the family lawyer as far as i'm concerned , they have to get him the tutors , and i think they need to pay for it they 're using these kids when football is done , they drop them but others connected to the school say its problems go beyond an overemphasis on sports high school football in texas is out of hand , said alan slay , a retired telephone employee who taught computer science at the school last year that is the top layer of the story but move down a notch o'connell is a catholic school not really equipped to handle a variety of students in the past 10 years , the enrollment at o'connell high school , grades 9 through 12 , has dropped to 133 students from about 300 , and parents have been concerned that the diocese might close its doors teachers said academic standards had declined and there was another problem the school s bookkeeper , cheryl zimmerle , the wife of the football coach , committed suicide after the school s financial records were subpoenaed in connection with a fraud last year was the crowning of the bad times , we had so many tragedies , said pat teltschik , who has taught at the school for 25 years it was the only year that mr ducote and billy would be at o'connell mr ducote , who had been a principal at a roman catholic school in boca raton , fla , said he had taken the job at o'connell to be closer to relatives he is now unemployed billy said he had been recruited by mr zimmerle while working out at a local college after returning from rialto , calif , in the summer of 1997 billy , who played on the school s offensive and defensive lines , said he had been drawn to the school because of the promised academic help i told them i was n't no ab student , billy said mrs russell said that when she asked whether her son would be able to keep up at the school , she was assured by mr zimmerle that billy would be tutored mrs russell said the coach said he would take care of billy s annual tuition of 4 , 250 mr zimmerle , who is teaching and coaching football at needville \( tex \) high school , declined to comment mr ducote said in a recent interview that by the end of billy s first month in school , september 1997 , teachers said of him he ca n't read he ca n't write he ca n't spell he ca n't do anything last october , mrs zimmerle committed suicide after the school s financial records were sought in connection with a 13 million theft at mrs zimmerle s previous place of employment an audit after her death found about 300 , 000 in school money unaccounted for , diocese officials said district attorney michael gaurino said he had traced the missing 300 , 000 to mrs zimmerle he said his office had been unable to substantiate any evidence to charge anyone else in january , after football season had ended , mrs russell was called into the principal s office and told billy was failing , she said mr ducote said he told her , we 're not meeting your child s need , and i think he needs to leave he said mrs russell became angry and threatened to sue the school if her son did not graduate we could n't afford a suit , mr ducote said so teachers continued to work with billy as they had been patrick danesi , a teacher and a football coach at o'connell last year , was promoted to principal this year mr danesi said teachers modified work to help billy understand , read test questions to him and gave him longer to complete work melissa musick , a counselor , said she had tried to get billy into special education at a nearby public high school \( o'connell has none \) , but that could not be arranged because he did not live in galveston but in nearby texas city in may , with graduation at hand , mr ducote said he had been confronted with what to do about 12 students who did not qualify to graduate out of a senior class of 48 in four cases , he said , students with failing grades , including two athletes , were given blank diplomas three other students , including one athlete , made arrangements to make up work to complete their credits in four other cases , three of them involving athletes , mr ducote said , he had gone against school policy and averaged first and second semester scores and allowed the students to graduate although they had failed the second semester the 12th student , billy , was given a diploma i tried to make the best decision possible with the information i had at hand , mr ducote said he said of the athletes , these children had been used and just cast aside mr danesi disputes mr ducote , saying that all 12 students were given signed diplomas when none were eligible to graduate o'connell officials have appealed the sanctions by the association of private and parochial schools , which put the school on a oneyear probation and barred its teams from going to district playoffs this year it s unfair to the kids , mr danesi said if you looked at all the schools in galveston and houston , you would find a lot of cases like it we 've been brought to light , and we 're doing something about it photo billy russell , holding his diploma , with his father , dorse , and mother , catherine he

troy , ny , sept 2 with remarkable unanimity , the democratic candidates for governor attacked gov george e pataki on the state budget , job growth , education and campaign finance in a debate here tonight , treating one another more like chums than like adversaries in a hint of the shifting fortunes of the campaign , none of the other candidates overtly attacked lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross or asked her any questions , as they did in previous debates when she was clearly considered the frontrunner in forums held last month , they demanded that she explain positions she had taken just a few years ago as a republican , often leaving her struggling for a response what went unmentioned in tonight s hourlong event , however , was the recent talk of the campaign the apparent disarray in ms mccaughey ross s camp she spent much of the day denying reports that her campaign manager , michael nussbaum , had been ousted , and refusing to answer questions about whether she intended to launch a longawaited television advertising campaign i'm going to be making a statement about my campaign finances tomorrow , she told a crush of reporters after the debate at hudson valley community college tonight s was the sort of exchange candidates claim to want a polite , serious discussion of issues the other contenders were peter f vallone , the new york city council speaker charles j hynes , brooklyn district attorney , and james larocca , a businessman and former state transportation commissioner but the debate failed to inject any fire into a race that so far has not received much voter attention the event , sponsored by the league of women voters and public television , will be broadcast statewide thursday night on public television the most enthusiastic attacks on the governor came about his handling of state spending and borrowing , which have increased sharply , with all four democrats claiming that they would be more fiscally responsible than mr pataki , an avowed conservative they also charged that the governor had done little for the anemic upstate economy we are looking at the possibility of significant budget cuts as early as next spring , mr larocca said today in new york , there is no economic development plan there is n't even a plan to make a plan mr vallone , whose standing in some polls has risen at ms mccaughey ross s expense , referred to the fact that the state had begun this fiscal year with a 24 billion surplus but now projects large deficits in two years when you take that surplus and turn it into an admitted 55 billion deficit in a few years , he said , that is the height of irresponsibility he repeated his call for a state law giving preference to new york businesses in government contracting , similar to a measure mr pataki vetoed this year that idea has been called into question by some economists , and none of the other democrats have advocated it the only real note of disagreement came in the area of campaign finance reform mr vallone , mr hynes and mr larocca advocated measures like strict contribution limits , public financing of campaigns and a ban on soft money , the unlimited contributions to parties , ostensibly for organizational needs but mr larocca took mr vallone to task for taking contributions from people who do business new york city , saying that the practice should be banned but ms mccaughey ross , whose own campaign treasury is provided almost entirely by her husband , the investment banker wilbur l ross jr , would only say that she favored banning contributions by anyone with a business interest before the state she refused to say whether she supported tighter contribution limits , a ban on soft money , public financing of campaigns , or any other measure all four candidates lauded the higher high school graduation standards adopted recently by the board of regents but they agreed that the schools were not ready to meet those standards , and advocated an expansion of school programs for the youngest children , and afterschool programs for older students the candidates agreed that patients should have the right to sue their health insurers , something now denied by state law and all said that many drug offenders should be sent to rehabilitation programs , not prison the only attack on the lieutenant governor came from mr larocca , in discussing health care he said that patients would be better off if the conservative right wing had n't trashed the national health care program proposed by president clinton that was a reference to ms mccaughey ross , who first gained fame critiquing the clinton plan but mr larocca did not mention the lieutenant governor by name even as ms mccaughey ross was trying to focus on the debate , she and her aides were besieged with questions about the status of her campaign several people close to the campaign said mr nussbaum , a top adviser to the campaign , had not spoken to ms mccaughey ross or spent time at her campaign headquarters since last week kevin davitt , a spokesman for ms mccaughey ross , said that mr nussbaum had left only for a few days to take his son to school in boston , and that he was still giving us tremendous advice but others close to the campaign said that mr nussbaum s absence was provoked by the disagreement between ms mccaughey ross and her husband over financing for the campaign they point out that mr nussbaum is closer to mr ross than he is to ms mccaughey ross mr nussbaum is an executive at news communications , a company owned by mr ross , and is not paid for his work on the campaign , mr davitt said mr ross has provided more than 3 million to his wife s campaign , but hardly any of it has been spent people close to the campaign said that ms mccaughey ross had been trying to persuade her husband in recent days to spend the money on advertising , but that he was reluctant with the sept 15 primary less than two weeks away , ms mccaughey ross has begun talking privately about spending her personal savings on advertising , they said photos from left , james larocca , charles j hynes and peter f vallone chatted last night before a debate , while lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross made notes each hopes to be the democratic candidate for governor \( photographs by the associated press \)
as awareness of the year 2000 problem has spread , a wide gulf has opened between computer consultants , who say many companies are dangerously vulnerable , and wall street analysts , most of whom have been telling investors there is little to worry about now , thanks to new guidelines from the securities and exchange commission , this debate is about to get something that has been in short supply public information about how most companies are doing in assessing and reducing their risks the new data will appear in reports filed with the sec in the coming weeks summing up corporate earnings for the quarter that ended wednesday in response to previous prodding from the agency , a majority of the 10 , 000 or so publicly traded companies that file quarterly and annual earnings reports started mentioning year 2000 concerns in filings earlier this year the new reports , though , will be the first for most of them since the agency , alarmed at how vague and limited most disclosures had been , issued more specific year 2000 guidelines two months ago the sec guidelines have been viewed positively in congress , which on thursday sent president clinton a bill allowing companies to exchange information on their year 2000 readiness or put such information on the world wide web without fear that the information could be used against them in a lawsuit if it turned out to be wrong the protection does not cover knowingly false or reckless statements the year 2000 problem , also known as the millennium bug , stems from the longstanding practice of using just two numbers in computer code to stand for the year , as in 98 for 1998 computers , software and electronic devices may read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000 and crash or create inaccurate data the sec wants companies to discuss specifically how much they expect to spend to cope with this problem , assess how far along they are in identifying and dealing with their problems and describe what , if any , contingency plans they are making it is also requiring reasonable worstcase scenarios the agency also recommended that all companies consider a variety of disclosures that might not be required , like the percentage of their informationtechnology budget being used on year 2000 projects , whether other informationtechnology investments were being delayed and what outside resources were being used to verify that repairs were successful because the lack of information regarding your preparations for the year 2000 could seriously undermine the confidence investors place in your company , it is imperative that you provide thorough , meaningful disclosure on this topic , said arthur levitt , the agency s chairman , in a letter to more than 9 , 000 chief executives investors have been given a hint of what the new disclosures may look like from companies that filed reports covering the three months that ended june 30 the sec requested that they voluntarily observe the new guidelines and many made at least a partial stab at it year 2000 consultants say the model to date is probably the phillips petroleum report for the quarter that ended june 30 , which was filed in midaugust the year 2000 disclosure by phillips ran more than 1 , 250 words , over five times the length of that in the previous quarter it noted that although the overall year 2000 project was on schedule , a piece of it the introduction of new software from the oracle corporation that would retire a number of defective programs was running far enough behind schedule that the company had developed contingency plans phillips said it planned to decide by the end of the third quarter whether or not to rely fully on oracle \( the company decided on thursday that the contingency plan would not be needed , according to del clark , director of year 2000 issues for phillips \) phillips also disclosed that it had spent 20 million of its projected 58 million budget and that most of the rest 21 million would go to fix or replace chips in machinery and other embedded systems mallinckrodt , a st louisbased medical equipment and supplies company , was less detailed and more confident in its 10k report for the fiscal year that ended june 30 , which was filed last week based on accomplishments to date , no contingency plans are expected to be needed and therefore none have been developed , mallinckrodt said the same report might make some investors wonder whether mallinckrodt is too complacent , because it disclosed that the company was still assessing what it might have to fix or replace in its research , manufacturing , and facility management operations areas where embedded systems are common the new data should give a snapshot of corporate america s year 2000 readiness and may force some companies to look at the problems more closely i expect investors to begin voting with their feet by march , said jeff jinnett , a new york lawyer it could be a minefield for companies that do n't pay a lot of attention to what they are disclosing some year 2000 consultants doubt , though , that enough reliable information will emerge from the new filings to allow investors to make worthwhile judgments the guidelines are window dressing unless we have random audits in order to determine whether companies are disclosing accurately , said louis marcoccio , year 2000 director at the gartner group in stamford , conn mr marcoccio said gartner s research suggested that nearly 9 out of 10 companies were publicly underestimating their year 2000 problems , either knowingly or inadvertently
moscow , nov 26 the subject of the president s health should be closed the subject does not even exist standing before cameras in the kremlin last march 10 , boris n yeltsin looked hearty enough to make that command stick he dared reporters to match him in swimming , tennis and track a thorough physical five days before , he said , had shown no deviations , even as far as the smallest microelements then he spat over his shoulder three times and rapped a nearby table touch wood , of course ! he added it is dangerous to tempt fate three days later on friday the 13th mr yeltsin , who is 67 , was laid up at home with a chest cold on march 17 he postponed a summit meeting of regional heads of state on march 26 doctors shifted a meeting with german and french leaders from the ural mountains to moscow remarkably , that episode was but the mildest of recent ailments that have made mr yeltsin s health one of the great political issues and mysteries of russian politics before his march illness mr yeltsin spent much of december and january in sanitariums and dachas fighting what aides called a bad cold in july a top aide said he was too worn out , mentally and physically , to serve past 2000 , when his term ends in midoctober he needed support from the president of uzbekistan to make it through a welcoming ceremony there , and seemed to wander during a toast at a state dinner he has not been at the kremlin regularly since then on monday , ill with pneumonia , he held an extraordinary state visit with the president of china in his hospital suite an apparent statement that whatever ails mr yeltsin , he is still the elected head of the government what ails him , if anything , is an open question the kremlin , which long insisted that he is simply susceptible to colds , has lately begun to acknowledge obliquely that mr yeltsin suffers from emotional stress and the wear and tear of age his latest deputy chief of staff , oleg susuyev , has made increasingly blunt statements about mr yeltsin s physical and political stamina , including a recent suggestion that prime minister yevgeny m primakov should simply take over his duties if the situation persists a kremlin spokesman declined to comment this week on whether mr susuyev was speaking for himself or was reflecting some broader consensus in the executive branch yet a person with some of the best information on mr yeltsin s condition , the renowned american heart surgeon michael debakey , insisted in a telephone interview that the boris yeltsin he knows is a healthy and mentally astute leader there s certainly no basic reason to be concerned about any neurologic problem because in previous studies all neurological functions were normal , he said his liver function was normal , his kidney function normal , and his heart function is good i ca n't account for his symptoms except to note that they 're a symptom of the flulike illnesses he s had dr debakey said he was confident that his assessment of mr yeltsin was accurate up to the onset of the president s most recent illness in october i had lunch with him in the latter part of june , he said at that time he was in excellent condition , quite vigorous and in good spirits , and really sort of a delightful host before his 1996 bypass surgery , mr yeltsin had a history of heart trouble he suffered several heart attacks or nearattacks in the early 1990 s and underwent quintuplebypass surgery after his reelection aides said in the mid1990 s that mr yeltsin suffered from high blood pressure , and doctors said this month that his current case of exhaustion was coupled with fluctuations in his blood pressure a possible sign of new heart troubles but dr debakey dismissed that possibility as remote mr yeltsin s blood pressure has not been especially high in recent years , he said , and he has not been on medication to regulate it if russia s president is sidelined for weeks or months by flulike symptoms well , he said , the flu can be an enervating disease , even for a young , strong person that said , outside observers none of them medical experts say they see something more in mr yeltsin of late they describe a waxenfaced man who has difficulty walking , whose movements and speech are slow and labored , and who can have difficulty concentrating on the task at hand during a visit to a novgorod meatpacking plant this autumn , witnesses say , mr yeltsin was driven to a special entrance so that he would not have to climb stairs an employee there noted that mr yeltsin , whose temper is well known , tried to stamp his foot but was unable to do so last month uzbekistan officials skipped the normal review of troops and reception line at a welcoming ceremony for mr yeltsin in tashkent , the uzbek capital , so he could go almost directly to a nearby building even then , uzbekistan s president , islam karimov , had to support mr yeltsin after he stumbled franz smets , the bonn bureau chief of deutsche press agentur , the german news agency , reported on mr yeltsin extensively during a stint in moscow and said in an interview that the president has had difficulty walking for years , and that what other people may be seeing now are the effects of advancing age what strikes him and some other firsthand observers more is the apparent change in mr yeltsin s mental state
bangkok , thailand , friday , jan 9 fears of economic collapse and political turmoil shook indonesia thursday , with the currency and the stock market suffering their worst oneday losses , and with a wave of panic buying that emptied grocery shelves and forced some shops to close early the panic was set off by worries that the international monetary fund might cut off a nearly 40 billion assistance package after the introduction tuesday of an indonesian budget that failed to address many of the nation s urgent needs these worries also aroused fears of political instability and social unrest in indonesia , the world s fourthmostpopulous country the military , which recently said it stood ready to quell any violence , issued a statement pleading for calm fear about indonesia s future was the catalyst for panicky selloffs in other southeast asian markets thursday and again today , helping reinforce a gloomy uncertainty that has prevailed in the region since economic crisis was touched off last summer in a reflection of washington s growing concern , president clinton called president suharto of indonesia thursday night to insist in a 20minute phone conversation that his country put in place commitments to reform its economy , according to white house officials they said mr clinton also told mr suharto he would dispatch a delegation of top administration officials to the region in the next several days , led by lawrence h summers , the deputy treasury secretary page d2 the same message is likely to be reinforced through the monetary fund , which said thursday evening that its two top officials , michel camdessus and stanley fischer , would travel to jakarta next week the imf would like to accelerate the program and strengthen it , mr fischer said on cnn , because a lot of people believe the indonesian government is n't really committed to the program at this point , however , it is unclear what the imf can do many investors are steering clear of indonesia this is n't like south korea , a senior official of an international organization in washington said thursday night there is no emergency package up anyone s sleeve the unraveling in indonesia , with many economists predicting a severe recession this year , has become the severest challenge to mr suharto s 32year rule news reports and people reached by telephone in jakarta thursday said the capital was filled with rumors that the 76yearold president was ill or that the military was planning to seize power , adding to the sense of panic longstanding murmurs that he ought to step down gained in volume the rumors were taken seriously , in part because indonesia has never had a peaceful transition of power since independence in the late 40 s mr suharto , who is due to be endorsed for a seventh fiveyear term in march by a mostly handpicked parliament , came to power in 1965 after quelling an attempted leftist coup as many as half a million people died in the bloodshed that followed a former general , president suharto has maintained close ties with the military he has suppressed dissent and kept firm control of all major decisions he has at the same time based his political legitimacy on a record of economic growth and constantly rising living standards this record has been seriously damaged for the first time by the economic damage to indonesia now the nation s currency , the rupiah , fell steeply thursday , touching a record low of 10 , 550 to the dollar the rupiah has lost roughly half its value since 1998 began and fallen 75 percent since july , when currencies began dropping to lows in several asian nations indonesia s stock market also tumbled thursday , falling at one point by 19 percent but partly rebounding for a 12 percent loss , to the weakest level in four years in early trading today , indonesian stocks rose slightly and the rupiah bounced back to 8 , 000 to the dollar , but trading was volatile and unpredictable the extraordinary drop in the value of the rupiah raised a wide range of fears without a recovery , the weak currency could demolish the economic assumptions that underlie the imf rescue package , undermining hopes that the country s slide can be halted the rupiah s drop has steeply increased the cost of repaying indonesia s huge commercial and government debts more than half of those are due this year it has sharply increased the prices of imports , raising concern that indonesia will not be able to provide citizens with basic commodities including some food items this touched off further fears that prices might rise rapidly , or that food rationing might be imposed for the first time in decades and all of this raised concerns that mr suharto s government was helpless and that instability and violence could erupt the country s unemployment , now at 44 million , is predicted to rise by 2 million this year , presenting the possibility of further unrest the reaction in the streets thursday took the form of a surge of panic buying unlike anything seen in indonesia for decades people are afraid that the rupiah is going to keep falling and falling , and that by next week they wo n't be able to buy anything , an indonesian businessman said people just went on a buying binge , he said everything from rice and noodles and cooking oil , to batteries and shaving cream and detergent , to television sets and music systems a bulksales store in the business district of jakarta called price mart was virtually emptied of goods a huge chain store in east jakarta called macro ran out of most of its wares and closed at 4 pm in response , the armed forces issued a statement calling for calm it is easy to say it , but have faith that the government is trying its best to handle the crisis , said lieut gen yunus yosfiah , head of the military s social and political affairs office but the longterm fears of both economic and political crisis could not be so easily allayed the economic transformation mr suharto has brought to his 200 million compatriots has muted complaints that include widespread corruption , government abuses , curtailment of citizens' rights and a widening gap between rich and poor political opposition has been neutralized outspoken opponents and journalists have been jailed riots have been crushed by force despite increasing pressure for change , mr suharto has been widely expected to choose to stay in office this march but he is old and infirm , and his refusal to designate a successor has created growing unease over the country s future leadership and prospects for stability with control of the economy in question , questions about mr suharto s legitimacy are rising more strongly than ever the thursday tumult was touched off by reported remarks of united states officials , who complained that the new indonesian budget was inadequate and that the imf might cut off aid if urgent steps were not taken to tighten the economy both the imf and foreign analysts and investors had been waiting for the budget announcement to gauge the government s seriousness in tackling its growing problems the budget , which included none of the hopedfor austerity measures , was widely viewed as unrealistically optimistic analysts were disappointed that it did not appear to create the budget surplus the imf has demanded as a key condition for continued aid despite widespread predictions of a recession , it envisions a growth rate of 4 percent this year , and rather than cutting spending , increases it by 24 percent it predicts just 9 percent inflation , a figure that economists say is impossibly low , and it is based on an exchange rate of 4 , 000 rupiah to the dollar , whicha forecast that now seems painfully unrealistic photos

, developed parade fever they would make a video our first thanksgiving with the baby true , he might not remember much of it , but the memory would be there forever , on tape and so , on the morning of nov 27 , mrs caronna focused the camera , narrating drolly as her husband dressed 8monthold alessandro in his brandnew redandwhite ski suit and strapped him into his stroller hurrying from their apartment on the east side of manhattan , they part walked , part ran across central park , so eager were they to find the perfect spot on the parade route minutes later , the caronnas' private celebration of a nationally televised ritual became public tragedy when the sixstorytall cat in the hat balloon , caught in winds that gusted above 40 miles an hour , struck a light pole at 72d street and central park west the pole s horizontal arm broke off , raining debris on the crowd mrs caronna sustained a head wound so severe that she nearly died the neurosurgeon on call at st luke sroosevelt hospital center that day called it one of the worst crush injuries of the skull i have ever seen and added i 've seen people thrown out of automobiles look like this , and none of them have survived when mrs caronna emerged from a coma 24 days later , right before christmas , her family and friends even her doctors felt it was something of a holiday miracle but if she has come an unimaginably long way first at st luke s and now here at the kessler institute for rehabilitation her maddening , often agonizing odyssey of recovery is far from over no one is willing to predict how long it will last or where it will end the miracle is that she can talk , and recognize us , and remember many things , said her husband , who , along with her friends and some of her doctors , spoke publicly for the first time about the accident and its aftermath but we still do n't know whether we 're going to get the real kathy back the real kathy caronna , her husband and friends say , was an effervescent , athletic gogetter who loved to travel and ski and play boisterous games of settemezzo , a neapolitan card game , at the dinner parties she put together but these days , she is gentle , subdued sometimes the gap between what she is capable of doing , and what she wants to do , is so great that she cries in frustration she says she remembers much of her past , including the windy passage of the barney balloon early on thanksgiving day but the rest of the parade is a blank one afternoon late last week , mrs caronna sat in her wheelchair dressed in khakis and a gray sweater her right cheek was still swollen from the accident her closecropped brown hair , growing back from when it was shaved for surgery , will eventually cover a shockingly deep indentation as wide as a tennis ball on the right side of her skull during a visit of several hours , she was alert and responsive with a reporter sometimes she was able to engage in conversation other times she spoke in a laidback , freeflowing monologue at times , her speech is slurred , and mrs caronna uses the word thing a lot when vocabulary escapes her she has some ability to see through her damaged right eye , she says , but it causes double vision , which makes it difficult to read she can walk , but unsteadily since arriving at kessler in early january , she has been undergoing speech therapy physical therapists are teaching her to walk again and she is being trained to do things as ordinary as opening doors she will need extensive therapy once she returns home in the wake of the accident , mrs caronna s family and friends had agreed not to speak with reporters , and her husband s lawyer , john quinlan kelly , had served as a family spokesman they agreed to the recent interviews and to the visit with mrs caronna on the condition that she not be quoted directly about the accident or her recovery the family intends to file suit we anticipate that there will be legal action involving the city , federated department stores , macy s and the parties responsible for the design , inspection and maintenance of the lamppost , said mr kelly , who successfully represented the estate of nicole brown simpson in the wrongfuldeath suit against o j simpson officials in the mayor s office declined comment a macy s spokeswoman , ronnie taffet , said the company had not been notified of a lawsuit and added we were pleased to learn of kathy s release from the hospital and that her recovery is going well we look forward to her continued progress and wish her a speedy recovery a mayoral task force , convened to investigate the accident , has yet to report its findings on thanksgiving morning , the caronnas had arrived at 72d street and central park west by chance , advancing through the crowd toward the curb so the baby could have a better view massimo and kathy kept switching the baby and the video camera , so there would be shots of both parents holding alessandro aloft to witness the pageantry seconds before the cat in the hat balloon arrived , a little after 10 am , massimo took the baby back one second kathy was there with the camera , mr caronna said , and the next second she was down on the sidewalk , blood coming from her head , the camera smashed it was instantaneous three other spectators were injured , less severely , and within the hour the caronnas were in the intensivecare unit on the seventh floor of st luke s
fort belvoir , va , march 10 sgt maj gene c mckinney is an army recruiting poster come to life , a modern horatio alger story and an embodiment of martin luther king jr s dream , his lawyer said today , pleading for acquittal at a courtmartial that illuminated the military s awkward integration of female soldiers in military law , character does count , and character alone may be enough to cause reasonable doubt , said the defense lawyer , charles w gittins , in a closing argument that recounted the sergeant major s rise from the peanut fields of his childhood to the army s top enlisted post character does count , agreed the lead prosecutor , lieut col michael s child but sgt maj mckinney apparently had two , the one he revealed in public and the one he showed in secret to women he was trying to seduce , the prosecutor said in its closing statement today , the government cast doubt on sergeant major mckinney s character , calling his defense against one accusation a carefully constructed lie a critical document , a signin sheet at an auto repair shop where the sergeant major said he was at the time a pregnant soldier has said he was elsewhere having intercourse with her , was manufactured , the prosecution said , citing forensic evidence he knows he s guilty , that s why he doctored the document , said colonel child , arguing that sergeant major mckinney was motivated by a desire to protect his reputation , his career and his marriage that s as clear a proof as any that he lies the sergeant major s six accusers , on the other hand , risked humiliation by coming forward with accounts that had uncanny elements in common , colonel child said those similarities , from women who did not know each other and were stationed at different posts around the world , included sergeant major mckinney s use of his son s death as a seduction tool and his habit of leaving messages under identical assumed names with closing arguments complete , after five weeks of testimony and 119 witnesses , the case goes to an eightmember jury , which will decide sergeant major mckinney s guilt or innocence on charges of sexual misconduct and obstruction of justice if he is convicted , the same jury will decide his punishment , which could include more than 55 years in prison , dishonorable discharge and loss of benefits the jury is composed of four officers and four enlisted soldiers two members are women the spine of both closing arguments was a review of the six accuser s accounts , with the defense believing one version of events and the prosecution another to the government , maj michelle gunzelman s account of sexual assault was believable because it was followed by a distraught telephone call to a friend to the defense , it was suspect because major gunzelman had a history of misinterpreting the behavior of men to the government , sgt rita jeczala s account of a sexual advance had to be true because she was able to describe the layout of the apartment where the sergeant major was staying to the defense , it was fiction because in one account she says he grabbed her by the shoulder and in another by the hips sergeant major brenda hoster , the first accuser , was dismissed by sergeant major mckinney not molested , as she said because she was incompetent as his public relations aide , the defense argued but the government contended that had she been dismissed , sergeant major mckinney would have told others on the staff and sergeant major hoster would have stopped socializing with his family sgt christina roy , the only woman to say she and the sergeant major had had sexual intercourse , must be telling the truth , the government said some 30 telephone calls to her from sergeant major mckinney , who was then the army s highest ranking soldier , could not be considered business as usual quite the contrary , the defense said , because intercourse with a woman seven months pregnant in the configuration described was physiologically impossible and so it went with similarly conflicting interpretations of the testimony of petty officer johnna vinson of the navy the government said sergeant major mckinney propositioned her during a golf tournament the defense said there was no proposition but rather a rebuke when the petty officer rubbed against him seductively at a luncheon none of the women were perfect witnesses all had inconsistencies in their accounts all waited to come forward with official complaints some testified only under grants of immunity for all , others were called to question their integrity the accusers stepped forward one by one , beginning with sergeant major hoster their accusations were made in the context of an unfolding sex scandals in the army , focused on drill sergeants abusing young female recruits at the aberdeen proving ground in maryland by her own account , sergeant major hoster originally planned to retire quietly , which she did she only went public , she said , because of outrage that sergeant major mckinney was appointed to a blueribbon panel investigating sexual harassment other accusers followed , some saying they wanted to stand in solidarity with sergeant major hoster the army , meanwhile , was feeling the pressure of adverse public opinion their investigation of the allegations against sergeant major mckinney was aggressive and several women who did not willingly step forward were found by investigators mr gittins , the civilian member of sergeant major mckinney s fourman defense team , says the government spent more than 1 million on the case , including 10 fulltime agents making wasteful trips , including one to germany to take a photo during last summer s pretrial hearing , mr gittins threatened to put the army on trial he raised the specter of charging that the case was based on racism against the first black sergeant major of the army worse for the armed forces , he raised the specter of asserting selective prosecution he assembled a list of highranking officers who had committed similar sexual offenses and were allowed to retire quietly only a ruling by the military judge , col ferdinand clervi , kept the list under seal and the testimony out of the trial but in a less explosive way , mr gittins did put the army on trial today , hurling a long list of accusations of government misconduct at the prosecutors , including using misleading photographs , trying to influence testimony and withholding documents from the defense it was a risky strategy , legal observers agreed , since the jurors have all dedicated their lives to government service in a furious rebuttal , colonel child said the defense had suggested nothing less than a government conspiracy but in the end , mr gittins waved a banner of reasonable doubt at the military jury and reminded them of the heft of history here was a man whose long and illustrious career had touched soldiers in passionate and inspirational ways , the lawyer said here was a man whose life hangs in the balance theirs was a very weighty task , he told the jurors , a decision they would carry forever you must be very sure , mr gittins said , before you consign this fine soldier to history as a villain i command to your hands the career of this soldier , sergeant major mckinney photo sgt maj gene c mckinney after his court

cracking down on the nasdaq stock market s old cheatin' ways has generated more than 1 billion in penalties from the wellknown market maker merrill lynch to charles schwab company s marketmaking subsidiary , mayer schweitzer yesterday , the collection plate went around again , with a million dollars or so more dropped into it national association of securities dealers regulation , the nasd s regulatory arm , censured and fined the troster singer corporation , one of the nation s oldest and largest marketmaking firms , for fraud in connection with a series of 28 intentional tradereporting violations in 1994 in settling with the nasd , the firm neither admitted nor denied the regulator s findings , but it agreed to pay 950 , 000 six troster singer employees were sanctioned and fined a total of 100 , 000 the improprieties in the case involved one of the biggest problems that confronted investors in nasdaq stocks in the early to mid1990 s the intentional late reporting of trades nasd rules require that every transaction , and the price at which it changes hands , be made public within 90 seconds of execution so that all investors have equal access to information trade reports are the letters and prices that run across tv screens and electronic ticker tapes at brokerage firms knowing what other investors are paying for a stock is what makes a market fair and transparent even though nasd rules require the timely reporting of trades , late reports by marketmaker firms were endemic to the nasdaq market they were such a scourge that the securities and exchange commission cited them in its socalled 21 \( a \) report of two years ago the report , the result of 18 months of investigation into questionable nasdaq marketmaker practices , concluded that the nasd had failed to police its market effectively it said , for example , that in a 10month period in 1994 , 36 percent of nasdaq trades were marked late , compared with ninetenths of 1 percent of new york stock exchange trades according to the nasd , between april 1994 and october 1994 , troster singer traders deliberately withheld information on 28 transactions in nasdaq stocks the trades were large and most involved household names 100 , 000 shares of intel , 30 , 000 shares of oracle , 20 , 700 shares of bed bath beyond , and others troster s customers were large institutions and other marketmaking firms on oct 20 , 1994 , for example , the nasd said troster singer bought 100 , 000 shares of intel at 6025 from an institutional customer instead of reporting the transaction immediately , the firm s head trader directed an assistant to hold off while the trade remained unreported , the firm sold 101 , 400 shares of intel to other dealers at an average price of 604375 , almost 19 cents a share more than it paid for its intel trade after it had sold the shares at the higher price , troster reported the original 100 , 000share trade the case against troster involved one of the larger fines imposed by nasd regulators and the largest imposed for intentional late trade reporting the nasd did not specify how much troster singer benefited financially from the latetrade reporting but keeping investors in the dark about such dealings does give market makers an unfair advantage for example , if a stock in which a market maker held a large position was moving down , it might behoove the firm to delay the reporting of a trade that might drive the price down further better to put off the report until the firm had covered its position and gotten out of harm s way painting the tape , the practice is called barry goldsmith , executive vice president for enforcement at the national association of securities dealers regulation , said having timely reporting of trades is extremely important to insure the transparency of securities trades and also enables investors to better assess the quality of their brokers' executions furthermore , the nasd says troster was aware that trade reports were delayed , yet the conduct continued howard schiffman , lawyer for troster singer , declined to comment on the case troster singer has been an nasd member since 1948 it was acquired by spear , leeds kellogg , a new york stock exchange specialist firm and trading concern , in 1988 during the months in which the late trade reports occurred , the firm traded more than 4 , 000 nasdaq stocks fined and sanctioned in the case were lowell j millar , troster singer s head trader michael j ling , a trader who supervised other market makers john j quigley , assistant to the head trader lisa bozzi albanese and charles esposito , institutional salespeople , and steven c cline , an assistant salesman none of the employees had a disciplinary history , and they neither admitted nor denied the regulator s findings they are still employed by the firm
iselin , nj , nov 22 on a crisp november sunday , oak tree road here was the picture of a thriving south asian immigrant enclave the windows of gold jewelers sparkled with 22karat necklaces shoppers went in and out of the markets , arms loaded with sacks of vegetables and spices from home but today , just under the sunny surface was a palpable sense of anxiety by indicting 31 people worldwide last week , in an international smuggling operation that brought thousands of illegal immigrant workers from the indian subcontinent , federal law enforcement officials struck at a ring that brought in a constant supply of cheap , often illegal , labor the supply from that ring , merchants in iselin say , helps drive this thriving ethnic enclave today , just days after an unpleasant secret in their community had been exposed , business owners up and down oak tree road expressed fear about the prospect of immigration raids and increased scrutiny by federal authorities several merchants said they were aware of businesses along the strip that relied on illegal immigrant help none of the merchants along oak tree road would allow their names to be used but they said they worried that the arrests in connection with the smuggling ring which federal agents say was headed by a man based in the bahamas named nitin shettie , also known as nick diaz would lead its members to report on other smugglers and the business owners who rely on them to bring in workers you can call it jealousy , said a shopkeeper , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , or you can call it competition the owner of one restaurant here said today that the new jersey men who were indicted last week were known smugglers , but that their organization was only one of many that shopkeepers could turn to if they needed extra workers four months ago , the merchants pointed out , two of iselin s most prominent shop owners were arrested on charges of immigrant smuggling and money laundering the ring uncovered last week came to the attention of immigration authorities several months ago when one of the deals went awry , according to a lawyer representing two of the smuggled immigrants the lawyer , suresh dalal of woodbridge , nj , said that five illegal immigrants were arrested by immigration authorities in miami on their way from the bahamas to new jersey their smugglers bailed them out at 5 , 000 apiece , and , once the immigrants were in new jersey , tacked the penalty onto their 20 , 000 smuggling fee mr dalal said the financial dispute that followed ultimately led one of the illegal immigrants to tip off the federal authorities mr dalal , who represents two men from the western indian state of gujarat , said his clients had been flown to the bahamas , where they boarded a ship to miami with more than 20 others from the subcontinent they were taken to a house in jersey city , where they stayed for a day or two until a friend or an employer paid the smuggling fees most of them , he said , found work at indian shops in new jersey federal officials involved in the investigation said they were approached a year ago by an immigrant in dallas who detailed the smuggling operation several investigations then appeared to coalesce , immigration agents in dallas said on friday , officials with the united states attorney s offices in texas and new jersey unsealed indictments in what federal authorities described as the largest immigrant smuggling ring ever uncovered in the united states of those indicted , 10 are still at large , according to the united states attorney s office neither the smuggling patterns nor its routes are new at least since the 1980 s , illegal immigrants from india , bangladesh and pakistan have flown first to europe , which is usually easier than going directly to the united states from there , they have traveled to latin america or the caribbean , and either walked across the mexican border or sailed near miami , sometimes swimming to shore for years , they have put themselves in the hands of smugglers who , for a hefty fee , acted as their travel agents and they have been easily absorbed in the thriving enclave economy what made this smuggling operation stand out , immigration officials said , was the vast number of employers who had tapped into it in search of workers mr bergeron said most other smuggling rings are connected to only a few employers in new jersey s indian community , it was the scope of the ring that came as a surprise in three years , federal officials said , it smuggled into the united states as many as 12 , 000 illegal immigrants , mostly from india , but also from pakistan , afghanistan and syria i 've seen nothing like this , nothing of this magnitude , said rohit vyas , the news director of tv asia , a cable station catering to the area s south asians i think the community better start looking at itself a little more closely photo last week s indictments in an immigrant smuggling case have worried many south asian merchants along oak tree road in iselin , nj they expressed fears about the prospect of more scrutiny by the authorities \( dith pran the new york times \)

ossining , ny steven romer stole more money from clients 7 million than any lawyer in the nation he has already spent seven years in sing sing state prison paying for the crime he and his family feel that it is time for him to get out and , increasingly , they are getting politicians and parole experts to agree mr romer likes to compare his seven years behind bars to the two years that michael r milken served in a lowsecurity work camp , after making billions from security fraud and the rev jim bakker served but five years for bilking his supporters out of 158 million mr romer and his family repeat these facts and more like them to anyone willing to listen they took out an advertisement in the albany times union to plead his case of unfair treatment mr romer , his wife , rita , his brother , dr ted romer , and his two sons have mounted an untiring letterwriting campaign on his behalf but unlike scores of his fellow inmates who are also claiming that they are wrongly imprisoned , mr romer has managed to get elected officials and sentencing experts to agree with him so far , four elected officials , including assemblymen richard n gottfried of manhattan and martin a luster of ithaca , have written to state officials to urge a review of mr romer s case but the people who lost their life savings are as angry with mr romer as they were when he was sent to the sing sing correctional facility in 1992 they say that until mr romer gives up his unbending protestations of innocence and convinces the authorities that he has no stolen money left , the romer family s tenacious campaign to drum up public sympathy for inmate 92a0519 will cut no mustard with them i do n't see why anyone would have any sympathy for him he did n't have any for his victims , said gabrielle votano , a manhattan art gallery staff member ms votano was 17 when her father died she lost her mother at 13 and mr romer , a family friend and family lawyer , spoke at the funeral in 1987 later that same day , he persuaded her to place her 750 , 000 inheritance in his hands he said , 'well honey , do n't worry , your dad and i were good friends , and all i want to do is take care of you , and i would n't dream of having you pay for my services , ' ms votano recalled in an interview he took all her money on new year s eve 1990 , mr romer disappeared nearly two months later , he turned himself in to the manhattan district attorney s office , claiming he had escaped from a kidnapping by general motors shortly after he vanished from his office on west 35th street in manhattan , ms votano and the other defrauded clients received a letter from him saying that he was dying from a brain tumor but that he had a 23 million life insurance policy to pay them back for their money , which , he wrote , he had used to feed some hungry and povertystricken people if you make a fuss , or contact the authorities , the insurance company will use it as an excuse to claim fraud and avoid paying the face of the policy , the letter said in all , mr romer was convicted on multiple counts of theft , fraud and forgery and sentenced to 7 1 2 years to 22 1 2 years in prison the state supreme court jury found that in addition to ms votano s money , mr romer had stolen 41 million from joseph marion \( the proceeds of the sale of a business entrusted to mr romer \) , 12 million from judith ripps , also a lawyer , and 1 million from ira saferstein , an investor this was not just someone who got in over his head , said roslynn r mauskopf , who prosecuted mr romer in state court and who is now the state inspector general this was a man who calculated what he wanted to do and systematically over a period of time stole more money than any lawyer in the history of the country in order to feed his grand scheme and in the process , he devastated the lives of people who had trusted him ms mauskopf said the investigation disclosed that mr romer had deposited the stolen money in various business ventures that he owned , including a gold mine and an electric car company , but prosecutors were not able to trace the money after that this led them to believe that mr romer had laundered the money and still had it hidden somewhere in a settlement with chemical bank , where the original accounts were held , ms votano got back about a quarter of what she had lost , she said his other victims could not be located for this article at the trial , mr romer acted in his own defense and clung to his assertion that his clients' money had been stolen through sophisticated computer manipulation by x corporation , which he later said was general motors he has never recanted that story i never stole a dime , he said in a recent interview in the sing sing visitors' room i was kidnapped , my head was split i was set up i was framed mr romer invites skeptics to feel the groove behind his right ear , where , he said , his kidnappers struck him but none of his kidnapping and x corporation conspiracy defense was allowed to be entered at his trial
washington , oct 25 state representative david phelps , who is running for congress in southern illinois , was not surprised when television stations began broadcasting an advertisement criticizing his record earlier this month a democrat , mr phelps was prepared for things to get nasty in his race against brent winters , the republican candidate , for an open seat in the 19th congressional district but it was not mr winters who sponsored the attack advertisement , which pictures mr phelps and criticizes his votes on property and income taxes in the state legislature it was the republican national committee , which has taken advantage of election rules that allow the national parties to spend unrestricted funds on advertisements about issues , as long as the advertisements do not urge the election or defeat of specific candidates the democrats used the tactic effectively in the 1996 presidential campaign , and some prominent republicans have urged the justice department to seek an independent counsel investigation of whether president clinton scripted the plan to evade spending limits on his reelection campaign but at the same time the republicans , flush with what is known as soft money , which can be used on issue advertisements , are expanding the practice and spending far more than their opponents republican house leaders , in fact , have designed the most ambitious party advertising plan in any nonpresidential election year the plan , operation breakout , calls for spending 20 million by election day , with 7 million already spent in 60 congressional districts in 30 states to subsidize their advertising campaign , republican house leaders have resorted to pressure tactics , assigning incumbents fundraising quotas and using house leaders to lean on their colleagues for contributions mr phelps , one of the targets of the republicans , questioned how an advertisement targeting his record in the state legislature qualified as a national republican issue advertisement i do n't see what this has to do with the national republican party , mr phelps said in an interview when they use the candidate s name and talk about my record as a state representative , that has nothing to do with the issues i 'll be voting on in congress the chairman of the national republican congressional committee , representative john linder , said issue advertising is necessary and legal , especially in light of the millions spent by the aflcio on advertisements attacking republican house candidates two years ago we watched the unions and the sierra club spend millions on issue ads , mr linder , a republican from georgia , said in an interview we have every right as a political party to tell america what we believe and that has been affirmed by the supreme court five times mr linder also said that part of getting the party s message out is providing information about the records of democratic opponents like mr phelps in addition to the 20 million to be spent on house candidates , the national republican senatorial committee is spending at least 6 million on issue advertisements in states with closely contested senate races , including north carolina , south carolina , nevada , kentucky and wisconsin to maximize the use of the unrestricted donations raised by political parties from corporations , individuals and interest groups , republican party committees in washington have transferred millions of dollars to state party organizations to pay for issue advertising the democrats have their own campaign the democratic congressional campaign committee and the democratic senatorial campaign committee plan to spend at least 6 million each on issue advertisements and have transferred millions in soft money to state democratic parties mr linder is following the lead of the democratic party s 1996 presidential campaign , in which president clinton and the democratic national committee pushed issue advertising to the limit following the example of ideological groups unable to afford the multimilliondollar advertising program proposed by dick morris , a consultant to the president , leaders of the reelection campaign instead approved a plan in which issue advertisements were paid for by the national committee with a heavy portion of soft money that plan took advantage of a 1995 advisory opinion from the federal election commission that said political parties could sponsor the same kind of issue advertisements that ideological interest groups had been running the commission also said that the parties could use unrestricted donations from individuals , corporations and labor unions to pay for the advertisements with a blend of the restricted money , known as hard money the president helped script the democratic party s 44 million blitz of issue advertisements , which featured him prominently lawyers for the clintongore campaign and the democratic national committee said the advertisements were legal and that they did not explicitly seek votes for the clintongore ticket but the 1996 democratic advertising plan has attracted renewed scrutiny
on the face of it , the idea seemed preposterous who would pay hundreds of dollars a month to subscribe to an internet chat room \? over the years , online chat has earned a reputation as the seamy underbelly of cyberspace a magnet for misfits who live out their roleplaying fantasies under the cloak of internet anonymity but none of that bothered oliver l velez when he set up an internetbased subscription service for small stock market investors the way he saw it , chat , which allows participants to exchange typed messages in real time , was the right medium for feeding timely buy and sell instructions to socalled swing traders , who try to capitalize on momentbymoment fluctuations in stock prices last june , mr velez and his partner , greg capra , both experienced traders and newsletter editors , started the pristine real time trading room \( www pristine com \) , at a subscription price of 525 a month so far , the service has attracted more than 400 subscribers in 32 countries what chat has allowed us to do is to put slightly better than 400 people directly in our trading room , giving them direct access to just about our every thought and idea on trading opportunities that present themselves on the spot , mr velez said but pristine is just one take on what seems to be a flurry of interest in chat as a business tool even huge companies like merrill lynch company and ibm are experimenting with chat as a way to interact more intimately with customers over the internet on the day after the stock market plunge of last october , for example , merrill lynch , which is now regularly host to chat seminars , trotted out its brokerage chief , john steffens , to calm ruffled investors in a chat session attended by more than 500 people ibm used chat sessions with top company executives last fall to help promote the introduction of its internet commerceready line of as 400e midrange computers more than 2 , 000 customers took part in the sessions , which were repeated three times to cover time zones in europe and asia the software maker symantec this month added chat to its world wide web site to offer live help to customers with technical problems , and the software retailer egghead s online store lets customers chat with a sales egg while they are shopping , or with other customers in a virtual lounge mail boxes etc , the chain of business service centers , is installing chat as a training and advice forum for its 3 , 000 franchisees , and dupont is looking at chat as an aid for its corporate customers as a business tool , chat holds out the promise of reducing a company s dependence on the telephone as a means of conducting customer service , sales and support , as well as the costly call centers and tollfree lines that go with it symantec , a software company with about 500 million in annual sales , employs about 500 people to handle thousands of phone calls a week at its customer service center in eugene , ore the company , which provides free phone support for its software for 90 days , has been encouraging customers to solve their own problems by going to its web site and using a selfhelp data base now , they can also get live help by clicking a button on the web page chat should reduce costs from the telephone , but at this point it s hard to say how much specifically , said michael gelardi , a manager in the service marketing department a recent study by jupiter communications , a new yorkbased consulting and marketresearch firm , suggests servicing customers with chat could cost as little as 25 cents a transaction , compared with 125 for each phone transaction but keeping customers happy may be just as important chase manhattan bank is looking at chat as a way to assist retail customers who run into difficulty while using its web site rather than have that customer walk away unsatisfied , we want to provide a safety valve where somebody from chase can help that customer right away , said william graham , chase s manager of internet services others see chat as a promising new tool for training and education marshall industries , a distributor of electronic components , chips and test equipment , began internet seminars in 1995 to educate customers and its sales force about the company s new products robert edelman , a marshall vice president , said he saw seminars on the internet as a substitute for the costly road shows the company had been doing the internet seminars follow the typical business presentation format a slide show with voiceover narration but delivered live over the web at the end of the presentation , chat is used to handle a questionandanswer session with the audience the seminars turned out to be so effective that mr edelman has since spun off a company called the education news and entertainment network , which last year produced more than 100 such seminars for companies like advanced micro devices , texas instruments and others for the software industry , the emergence of chat as a business tool is not expected to have a major impact , at least in the short term forrester research estimates revenues for the sector were less than 10 million last year but chat startups like ichat , eshare and epub , which make chat software for web sites like yahoo and geo cities , see business chat as a much bigger opportunity the majority of the companies that we are talking to see the need to interact with customers on the web , said dean cruse , director of marketing at ichat another company , business evolution inc , based in princeton , nj , predicts that business customers will want a stronger and more capable kind of chat software than that which is used for socializing the company , which specializes in business software for collaborative work , has created a software program called interactservice , which is designed to provide oneclick access to a live customer service representative you are not running a chat room , you are running a customer service center on the web and you have to project the kind of professional image you project in the real world , said business evolution s chief executive , p v kannan the company s customers include symantec , chase manhattan and dupont the cost of installing a chat service on a web site is quite modest symantec , for example , paid 30 , 000 for the basic software from business evolution and now has 50 customer service representatives using it pristine got its online trading room up and running for just 15 , 000 and pays about 1 , 000 a month to ichat to be host of the service on its server so far , however , few of the early experiments with chat as a customer service medium seem to have found the right formula for example , on several recent visits to egghead s online store , not one sales egg responded to numerous requests for assistance \( several other shoppers periodically drifted through the virtual lounge area , but none of them seemed very talkative , either \) nevertheless , amy bruckman , an assistant professor at georgia tech and a former researcher at the massachusetts institute of technology s media lab , predicts that chat will eventually become almost as popular for business as it is for users of online services i do n't think it will ever be as widely used as email , she said but i think it already is and will continue to be used in serious business contexts drawing \( scott menchin \)
watching the premiums soar on his 100 , 000 life insurance policy as he advanced through his 70 s , leonard oxenberg wondered why he was still making the payments he no longer needed the coverage his son was grown , and his wife had a good job and there were many other ways that mr oxenberg , a retired advertising executive in brookline , mass , would have liked to be spending the 5 , 000 , soon to be 6 , 000 , that he was paying in annual premiums but he felt stuck if he just walked away from his term life policy , he would get nothing as happens to many of the six million americans who drop insurance each year and after paying premiums for 15 years , that would be hard to take then mr oxenberg found a solution he could sell his unwanted life insurance to one of the investment companies that , for years , had been buying policies from people with aids and other terminal diseases searching for fresh markets as new treatments continued to extend the lives of aids patients the companies have started offering to buy life insurance of all kinds not only term , but also wholelife and other types with cash value from relatively healthy older people like mr oxenberg and so in an era when nothing is so alien as delayed gratification , life insurance the ultimate form of delayed gratification is being given a new twist now , it pays before death and it is not just helping with expenses in a policyholder s waning days life insurance coverage can be turned into a vacation in europe , a new round of investments , gifts for the children now rather than later , or just some extra spending money the tradeoff is giving up the big payoff at the end for one s beneficiaries and though some policyholders may be wary of creating an investment for strangers that pays off only when they die and the sooner the death , the greater the return the business has grown and there have been no scandals involving untimely deaths as they have gone mainstream , the halfdozen companies doing the buying say business is booming one company , viaticus inc , a unit of the cna financial corporation , one of the biggest commercial insurers , says it expects to buy up to 300 million of policies this year , up from 75 million last year eighty percent of the deals , officials say , will be with relatively healthy people another company , viaticare financial services , founded five years ago in minneapolis by four entrepreneurs , says it expects to buy 100 million in policies , up from 18 million last year and , it says , 70 percent of the deals will be with the relatively healthy this was an industry in the hundreds of millions of dollars , said stephen l keller , the president of yet another of the investment companies , kelco inc , of lexington , ky now it s heading into the billions executives of these companies see the new deals as a shot in the arm for the struggling life insurance business if people know they can change their minds and still get a good chunk of money back when they no longer want their coverage , the reasoning goes , they may be less reluctant to buy a policy in the first place and some of those who have cashed in their policies have already begun to buy other things from life insurance companies , like longterm health care policies , annuities and mutual funds but the life insurance industry , famously cautious , is not so sure the big companies , and little ones , too , distrust anything that alters the hoary process of delivering death benefits to heirs for one thing , they worry that something could go terribly wrong with the largely unregulated johnnycomelately investment companies , giving insurers yet another black eye even as some companies are still paying hundreds of millions of dollars to settle claims that agents repeatedly misled customers with promises of unattainable returns whether this idea is so great remains to be seen , said mel feinberg , a vice president at the new york life insurance company this whole new industry may not be around in 20 years moreover , some actuaries say the new approach could wind up costing the insurance companies money the insurers set premiums on the expectation that a certain number of policies will be abandoned and that no death benefits will have to be paid if the investment companies begin intervening widely , buying up and maintaining the premiums on many policies , the insurance companies will end up paying out more , said tom foley , an actuary who heads the life and health division of the north dakota department of insurance their likely response , he said , would be to raise premiums and that , in turn , could accelerate the long , downward slide in sales for the investment companies , profits depend on the ability to handicap death they buy policies for something less than the face value of the insurance and take over paying the premiums their profit is the difference between what they pay out and the death benefit , which goes to them when the insured person dies they shoot for profits of 12 percent to 14 percent , basing the purchase price on life expectancy and the premiums due the sooner a person is likely to die and the lower the premiums , the more the seller is likely to be paid for the policy anyone who lives beyond his estimated time of death begins to cut into the profits of the buyer
washington , sept 13 states have enacted a wide range of new laws to define patients' rights and regulate health maintenance organizations this year , even though similar legislation has become bogged down in congress such proposals have generated bitter conflict in washington but have attracted broad bipartisan support in many state capitals indeed , republican state legislators have supported many regulatory initiatives opposed by republicans in congress at the state level , patient protection is often seen as a form of constituent service rather than as an occasion for ideological warfare comprehensive patientprotection laws were adopted in 10 states this year and in 17 states last year , according to the national conference of state legislatures the 10 states are alaska , hawaii , indiana , kentucky , nebraska , new mexico , pennsylvania , south carolina , tennessee and wisconsin the laws vary but typically guarantee patients access to medical specialists , require coverage of emergency services , establish procedures for patients to appeal the denial of care and ban clauses restricting doctors' ability to discuss treatment options with patients we all recognize that health care is not a partisan issue , said patricia h vance , a republican member of the pennsylvania house of representatives , who was coauthor of a comprehensive new law regulating hmo s we all have constituents who 've had problems , real or imagined , and we know that the old feeforservice health care system was out of control , looking too much at bottomline profits rather than people s problems the other author of the pennsylvania law , state senator timothy f murphy , a republican from the suburbs of pittsburgh , said skeptics were convinced that legislation was needed after a series of public hearings around the state we heard horror story after horror story , mr murphy said they became too moving to ignore for example , we heard from disabled veterans in wheelchairs who described the difficulties they had getting access to medical specialists in tennessee , the chief sponsor of the new law , steve k mcdaniel , is the republican leader in the state house of representatives the main cosponsor , state senator jo ann graves , is a democrat we wanted to make this a bipartisan issue , said mr mcdaniel , who owns a family restaurant in western tennessee mrs graves said that s how we were able to forge consensus we put the patient first martha m gentry , a lobbyist for the tennessee association of hmo s , said we had a healthy debate in tennessee we reached some good compromises , which had many benefits for consumers that puts us a step ahead of what s going on in washington in congress , the house passed a comprehensive patientprotection bill on july 24 , but the outlook in the senate is highly uncertain supporters of the measure say the chances of passage have been sharply reduced by the scandal that has engulfed bill clinton s presidency , preoccupying white house officials and diminishing mr clinton s political leverage while many states have passed laws to regulate hmo s in the last six months , no state has adopted all the requirements advocated by mr clinton and democratic leaders of congress mr clinton strongly favors legislation that would make it easier for patients to sue hmo s for the denial of benefits or medical malpractice such legislation was introduced in 29 states this year , but none of the bills have become law in most of those states , insurers argued that expanding liability for health plans would lead to an increase in costs , prompting employers to reduce or eliminate coverage for millions of americans \( new mexico does allow patients to sue hmo s for violation of rights protected by its new law \) the chief sponsor of the hmo bill passed this year in south carolina , state senator glenn f mcconnell , described himself as a goldwater republican , who would not normally favor government regulation and he said we were lightyears ahead of washington on this issue for the life of me , i do n't understand how congress can get hung up in partisan gridlock on legislation that would provide more information and more freedom of choice to consumers in the marketplace the south carolina law , like the bills pending in congress or passed by other states , requires hmo s to provide consumers with easily understood information describing benefits and costs , including copayments and deductibles , so people can compare health plans under the south carolina law , if a company provides health insurance to employees , it must offer them the option , for an extra charge , to use doctors outside the hmo network , without getting a referral or prior authorization in new york , gov george e pataki said , laws enacted in the last few years provided the most comprehensive patient protections in america under a bill signed by mr pataki last month , new yorkers may appeal to an independent panel of medical experts if an hmo or an insurance company denies coverage on the ground that a service is not medically necessary the law also makes it easier for patients with lifethreatening illnesses to obtain coverage for experimental treatments and clinical trials
six years after vowing not to run for office again , senator alfonse m d'amato accepted the unanimous nomination of state republican party leaders for a fourth term yesterday , then launched into a rousing speech salted with traditionally democratic themes and appeals to crossover voters on the concluding day of the party s twoday convention in manhattan , mr d'amato s hightest performance seemed intended to energize party workers who had grown bored with the crisply orchestrated event and to remind his supporters about the dangers of complacency , particularly when the top of their ticket , gov george e pataki , is well ahead in opinion polls still , mr d'amato seemed supremely confident , strutting into the convention hall like a triumphant homecoming king to the brassy strains of the theme to rocky then , as party operatives led raucous chants of six more years and al gets it done , mr d'amato recounted a list of accomplishments that he said made him the most effective senator in congress from getting mass transit funds for new york city to helping women with breast cancer to closing a polluting incinerator in nassau county it seemed clear from his speech and those nominating him that effectiveness would be a core theme for his campaign day in and day out , people are saying 'you know what \? we may not agree with al d'amato on lots of issues even my mother does n't but you want to know something \? he is a fighter , he cares for the people , he makes a difference , ' said mr d'amato , who discarded his prepared text to speak extemporaneously for much of the speech also yesterday , the delegates unanimously nominated bruce a blakeman , the presiding officer of the nassau county legislature , for state comptroller on thursday , the convention nominated mr pataki for a second term as governor mary o donohue , a state supreme court justice , for lieutenant governor and dennis c vacco for a second term as attorney general unlike the democrats , who are facing primaries for every statewide seat except comptroller , the republicans will have none though the hall at the sheraton new york hotel and towers was filled with party officials from across the state , mr d'amato s remarks in many ways seemed intended for an audience outside the building the centrist , suburban swing voters who could determine the outcome of a close race his 30minute speech was notably devoid of any attacks on the democratic party or the three democrats seeking to run against him geraldine a ferraro , mark green and charles e schumer though he made passing reference to traditional republican issues like crime and taxes , he talked more emotionally about fighting for the environment , against insurance companies and on behalf of women there was no mention of abortion , which mr d'amato would ban , and no attacks on the new york state united teachers , the powerful teachers' union , which he had made a target months before i do n't care whether it s democrats or republicans that i have to work on , and with , he said party politics should not stop us from doing the business of the people but mr d'amato s wouldbe democratic rivals derided the republican s bipartisanship and centrist talk as hollow opportunism mr schumer , a congressman from brooklyn and queens , accused mr d'amato of aligning himself with rightwing extremists in congress to cut medicare and education funding and block gun control ms ferraro , the former congresswoman and vicepresidential candidate , described him as squarely in the pocket of the special interests and mr green , the new york city public advocate , said , we need a senator who thinks that economic security is more than an overflowing campaign war chest mr d'amato has raised more than 17 million for his campaign mr d'amato called the attacks on his ethics nonsense al d'amato helps his friends oh , shocking , he said with mock horror to the delegates that must be something that is antiamerican well let me tell you something if a friend comes and if an industry that is vital to new york and to this nation needs help , you better believe it i'm going to stand up having said near the end of the grueling 1992 campaign that he would not run again , mr d'amato was asked today if this was his last race i'm never going to say that again , he replied , laughing photo chanting six more years , delegates at the state republican convention greeted senator alfonse m d'amato yesterday in manhattan \( keith meyers the new york times \)

london the controversy over leaks from the grand jury investigating president clinton s sex life is probably dismissed by the public as maneuvering by lawyers washington is a world of leaks , after all why are these any different \? but they are different the proceedings of grand juries are secret for good reasons reasons that affect all americans , not just presidents grand juries are a dragnet they can hear all kinds of testimony , with only the loosest rules of relevance witnesses may be biased , misinformed , malicious they may attack people who are never indicted moreover , the grand jury is an exception to our adversary system of justice it is entirely onesided the prosecutor controls the process , issuing whatever subpoenas he wishes , asking the questions , compelling answers witnesses called before a federal grand jury cannot even have their lawyers with them because the process is so sweeping and so onesided , it can be misused by unscrupulous prosecutors to destroy reputations destroy lives the method is prosecutorial leaks it is the more dangerous because a prosecutor who leaks may distort what was said to the grand jury that is why ethical guidelines , made specific in the federal rules of criminal procedure , forbid lawyers who handle grand jury proceedings to talk about them the rules are not just technicalities they are a fundamental protection for all of us how does all this apply to kenneth starr \? is his office leaking to the press \? does the sun rise in the east \? i have no inside information on the subject , but none is needed over the last month i have made a note of descriptions used by the press for the sources of damning statements about president clinton they are such as individuals familiar with mr starr s inquiry , an attorney close to the investigation and lawyers familiar with the testimony of a grand jury witness the leaks have become increasingly brazen if we are going to have them , we should publish the grand jury minutes to see how accurate or tendentious the leaks are kenneth starr was indignant last week when his office was charged with leaking , though he said he would investigate i do not believe that mr starr has violated the secrecy of the grand jury himself , or ordered any of his assistants to do so but i think he is naive , to put it politely , if he can read those stories without recognizing that they came from his staff who else had access to grand jury testimony \? who else would leak versions of it damaging to the president \? the reporters who get information from the independent counsel s office are not to be criticized that is their job and this is an irresistible story , driven by the frantic competition of the new 24hour journalism but the serious newspapers and magazines and broadcast networks have an editorial responsibility they owe it to their audience to indicate the probable bias of their sources more than that , we need greater understanding of what is at risk when a prosecutor abuses his great power especially an independent counsel , who should have the highest standards archibald cox and his watergate staff did not leak grand jury testimony or wire a linda tripp there is an irony in president clinton s being the victim of grand jury leaks that violate the rules on issues of civil liberties he has been a tonedeaf president he has allowed shameful infringements of constitutional rights , including the virtual destruction of federal habeas corpus but whatever mr clinton s mistakes , we have to worry about overzealous prosecutors ready to break the law in pursuit of their target justice louis brandeis put it memorably 70 years ago , dissenting when the supreme court allowed the use of wiretaps by federal agents in a government of laws , existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously our government is the potent , the omnipresent teacher for good or for ill , it teaches the whole people by its example crime is contagious if the government becomes a lawbreaker , it breeds contempt for law it invites every man to become a law unto himself it invites anarchy to declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means would bring terrible retribution against that pernicious doctrine this court should resolutely set its face and so should we
to the editor i agree with brent staples \( editorial observer , sept 20 \) that it is important to recognize gains for black americans and special successes at outstanding private colleges and universities that does not mean that southern public education is fair or has met its obligation none of the southern states have fulfilled their plans made two decades ago to provide equal access for high school graduates of both races , and the federal requirements were suspended during the reagan years pointing out the work yet to be done by the public institutions , as the southern education foundation has done in its report , takes nothing away from the accomplishments of these private campuses policy makers and analysts should not be distracted from considering the proof that the report presents about the remaining racial gaps in southern public colleges gary orfield cambridge , mass , sept 20 , 1998 the writer is a professor of education at harvard university
a father wrings his hands over the onagain , offagain relationship that his daughter , who is white , is having with a black man i would be more accepting of interracial relationships if there was evidence of society s acceptance of it , he said recently , noting that he had never considered himself prejudiced in another instance , a black man said racism in northern , majoritywhite cities operated in a way that was underground , clandestine and covert , reflecting a kind of discrimination he said was robbing generations of racial minorities in america of hope and a future a white man matteroffactly noted , if it were n't for the black population in the usa , the crime would drop by 75 percent none of the statements has gone unanswered these remarks , and thousands more on race relations in america , have drawn their own comments and those comments have drawn yet more against a backdrop of words , mountains of words sometimes insensitive , sometimes seemingly shouted , at times insulting , but almost always honest and frank americans are increasingly plunging into the foamy churn of debating about race but these discussions are buzzing not so much in town hall meetings , as encouraged by president clinton in his initiative on race , as in one of the few open forums where a person s skin color need not be revealed cyberspace with the increasing popularity of internet bulletin boards and chat rooms , where typed messages can be posted for millions to see and respond to , no one has to know a person s name , age , sex , sexual orientation or race wrapped in what many mistakenly think is an almost impenetrable anonymity , growing numbers of people say they feel free on the internet to truly express themselves about an issue they would otherwise be reluctant to take up facetoface with someone of another race on the job , at social events , even on the telephone several of the people who appeared on line with opinions relating to race did not respond to electronic messages from a reporter in connection with this article , and others declined to allow their names to be used the internet was once populated almost exclusively by computer geeks but online conversations are becoming richer and more diverse , said sherry turkle , a sociology of science professor at the massachusetts institute of technology that phenomenon , she said , reflects the growth in recent years of a much more diverse population plugging into the online universe of the internet you can state your opinions about anything without getting into a serious argument , jenis bean , a 16yearold white girl from douglassville , pa , said of talking about racial matters on the internet but , she added , there are frustrations there are times when i wished that i could magically go through the computer and tell someone just how ignorant they really are , but you ca n't , she said in an interview she would conduct only by electronic mail you just have to listen and type something back , and hope you can change the person s mind historically , race has never been the subject of a simple conversation since the days when enslaved africans were a common sight in america , discussions between the races have been fraught with intellectual and emotional apprehension and reservation and though not everyone thinks that the faceless nature of the internet makes it the best place for these conversations , many agree that such a dialogue is essential if the nation s racial problems are ever to be solved alex kotlowitz , an author who is white and whose work has been widely acclaimed as a sensitive exploration of race in america , said , i do think people feel very threatened talking about race with friends or acquaintances of a different race , for fear of somehow having it interfere with their relationships , for fear of being misunderstood in mr kotlowitz s new book , the other side of the river a story of two towns , a death and america s dilemma \( doubleday \) , he writes about two michigan towns , one mostly white and the other mostly black , that are geographically close but racially lightyears apart , largely because of the shadow of fears and resentments mr kotlowitz said that people might feel more comfortable talking to strangers about race on line , people they do n't have some kind of connection with indeed , on the internet , a medium often criticized for its tendencies toward the frivolous and the profane , conversations about race between people who are little more than words on a screen can be remarkably personal it is the illusion of anonymity on the internet that often gives people a sense of freedom of expression , said dr turkle , author of life on the screen identity in the age of the internet \( simon schuster , 1995 \) people feel in some way that what they say on line is not held against them , she said , that they are not held responsible for the implications of exchanging their feelings they have about race discussions about race can erupt unexpectedly almost anywhere on the internet on a site where popular soap operas are discussed , a debate on race rose out of a seemingly innocuous observation that soap operas are using more black characters

bringing the death toll to five searchers continued looking for one man still in the tunnels despite the dimming chances of survival , officials expressed hope today that the remaining worker might be found alive there is air in those tunnels , said ken cox , division chief of the sedgwick county fire department so breathing would not be a problem the search was temporarily halted this afternoon when a rescue worker slipped and was buried to his chest in grain , before being pulled to safety by other crew members the bodies found today have not been identified and officials did not disclose the precise causes of death on monday , two victims were killed instantly jose prajedes ortiz , 24 , and jose luis duarte , 41 other workers , howard goin , noel najera , victor castaneda and raymundo diazvela , were missing after the explosion eleven others were injured , and two of them remained in critical condition today the debruce grain elevator , one of the biggest , freestanding storage plants in the nation , has been cited at least twice in the last 19 months by federal warehouse inspectors for excessive graindust , which can be flammable federal officials said that in both cases , the company had said that it would clean up the dust the debruce elevator , which towers over the prairie about five miles south of wichita , bears little resemblance to the small , quaint wooden grain elevators found in so many farm towns of the midwest instead , it is a series of concrete silos 120 feet tall , with tunnels that are 800 feet long over all , the plant can hold about 21 million bushels of grain the debruce company buys grain from farmers and smaller elevator owners , then ships it to mills grain is moved into and out of the elevator by conveyor belts that run the length of the facility , which stands along a freight railway the explosions knocked vast sections away from the huge silos , leaving holes bigger than cars the men inside thetunnels that were 7 feet by 8 feet were working on the maintenance crew at the time of the explosion , a series of jolts that shook homes 10 miles away explosions in grain elevators are caused by the mix of grain dust and oxygen in closed quarters the spark that ignites a fire can come from an electrical short , or the cutting of some metal rather than a single blast , the first explosion sets off a ripple of others there have been 10 graindust explosions in kansas in the last 10 years , but no deaths lowlevel jobs at grain elevators typically pay 5 or 6 an hour while these jobs are tough , they provide a toehold for many immigrant families struggling to find work that does not require special skills or education some people from mexico have been doing fieldwork in california and other states for generations in more recent years , small midwestern towns like dodge city and garden city in kansas have become centers for thriving communities of immigrants from mexico and southeast asia , who took jobs in the meatpacking houses and others that many other american workers rejected the grain elevator here , which also employed many american workers , drew on a labor force that is more diverse and urban than that of most grain storage operations the wichita region has a population of about 500 , 000 people working inside the tunnels can be dirty and even disgusting , say people who work in them filled with strong odors and scuttling mice paul debruce , the chief executive of the company , based in kansas city , mo , said in a news conference on tuesday that he had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the storage site , much of it for equipment to minimize grain dust mr debruce bought the grain elevator in 1996 for 115 million today , more than 100 searchers , including local fire crews and representatives from the federal emergency management administration , were combing through the wreckage of the elevator some of the friends and families of the victims gathered at the oatville elementary school , about a mile from the grain elevator , where the red cross and other volunteers were offering food , toys and support the family and friends of mr ortiz , who died in the explosion , said he was a hard worker who loved life he was always happy , always wanting to go dancing , to hold his baby and be with his friends , said his widow , claudia ortiz mr ortiz moved to kansas from mexico about five years ago known for his trademark black cowboy hat , mr ortiz often sat outside talking with friends , as he held his sixmonthold baby , saul , on his lap mr debruce said work was proceeding as usual on monday before the blast he said mr goin was greasing bearings in the tunnel , while the other three men were cleaning up spilled grain mr debruce said he had known mr goin since 1971 mr goin had recently retired , but came back to help at the grain elevator during the harvest officials said they had detected no signs of life since thudding noises about 2 am tuesday the division fire chief , mr cox , said the spilled grain was dangerous , because it could swallow a searcher like quicksand but he said none of the workers , including firefighters from oklahoma city , had asked to be taken off their assignment he also said the families of the dead and missing had been told about the work of the rescue crews they 're saying prayers for the rescuers , too , he said

forming perhaps the deepest alliance yet between a big internet content provider and a longdistance company , the netscape communications corporation and qwest communications international inc plan to announce a farreaching strategic alliance today the deal will link netscape , a company whose browser software for navigating the world wide web made it synonymous with the internet , to qwest , a wellfinanced startup that is building one of the most advanced fiber optic communications networks the intent of the venture , to be known as netscape contact , is to enable consumers to manage voice mail , email and fax communications through a single site on the web under intense competitive pressure from the microsoft corporation , which distributes its web browsing software free , netscape recently moved away from selling consumer software it has instead focused on building its netcenter web site into an aggregation of information and communications services that generates revenue through advertising and direct sales the qwest deal will allow netscape to broaden its web offerings while also helping to insulate netcenter from internet traffic jams for qwest , securing an alliance with netscape could prove a marketing coup along with ixc communications inc , the williams companies and level 3 communications inc , qwest is among a new breed of longdistance carriers that are building national networks based on internet technology rather than on traditional phone technology this is a great distribution channel said joseph p nacchio , qwest s chief executive the netcenter customers are more educated , more computercentric and higher spenders mr nacchio said he expected the venture to generate between 150 million and 175 million in revenue over the next 18 months qwest will pay netscape for the right to share the branding on netscape contact in return , netscape will pay qwest for access to its network in the end , netscape expects to make about 25 million net over three years on the deal netscape now mainly employs the sprint corporation and the mci communications corporation to provide netcenter with highspeed , highcapacity access to the internet those relationships are not endangered by netscape s deal with qwest , mr homer said netscape will use qwest s network for additional capacity , he said over the summer , netscape added a search engine and email to its web site in an effort to compete against socalled internet portal companies like yahoo and excite working with qwest , netscape intends to begin selling longdistance phone service for 9 cents a minute any time of the day and to offer an integrated in box for voice mail , faxes and email on monday , qwest announced that it had agreed to buy a rival internet service provider , the icon cmt corporation , in an allstock transaction valued at 185 million to attract corporate customers to its new superfast internet access as qwest expands into the internet service market , it intends to sell netscape software some of netcenter s main competitors , including yahoo , infoseek , lycos and excite , have already made deals with longdistance phone companies none of those agreements , however , appear as ambitious as netscape s pact with qwest
with dozens of uniformed police officers looking on not to mention those who might have been watching on a video monitor in a precinct house more than 200 new york city residents rallied in washington square park yesterday against the giuliani administration s increasing use of surveillance cameras to fight crime the hourlong protest came a month after the police installed two cameras on light poles along the southern edge of the park to discourage the smallscale drug dealing that had become as common there as dogwalking and handholding under a plan announced a year ago by mayor rudolph w giuliani and police commissioner howard safir , surveillance cameras have already been installed in some housing projects , and the mayor and the commissioner , reporting sharp drops in crime as a result , have pledged that more cameras are coming soon to other public spaces we 're at a point where we now have many more requests for cameras than we have cameras , or than we 're ready yet to do , because we want to make sure we 're doing this in a careful way , the mayor said yesterday the protesters argued that surveillance cameras in public places smacked of a police state they said the cameras would destroy the kind of privacy in public places that new yorkers have come to expect , eroding the quality of life for lawabiding city residents far more than they would help catch and prosecute criminals several speakers warned that the cameras in washington square park had already set a dangerous precedent once you give them the ok to do this , they will take it and run with it , warned tonya d mcclary , director of research at the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc we 've pretty much allowed them a green light to put these cameras in parks , in public schools , in the subway system and in city buses soon , none of us will have a place where we can sit back and be ourselves in the last month , several speakers said , the neighborhood drug peddlers have simply moved out of range of the cameras , to west third street mr safir , contemplating that kind of shift , promised last month that the police would be there when the traffickers go to adjacent areas to some , that heightened concerns about the limits of the new policy are we going to put surveillance cameras on every pole in this city \? asked michael rosano of the new york city gay and lesbian antiviolence project remove the cameras we live in a democracy we do not live under giuliani s police state mr rosano worried aloud that the police might next decide to install cameras along the greenwich village piers , long a cruising area for gay men but he said that even in washington square , the cameras could inhibit many closeted homosexuals from expressing themselves freely , even by merely holding hands , for fear that the tapes would get into the wrong hands norman siegel , executive director of the new york civil liberties union , which organized the rally , said that left unchecked , a citywide network of police cameras raised the specter of government s creating a video database of the free movement of lawful new yorkers he said that at a minimum , the city should require that videotapes made with the surveillance cameras be destroyed after 72 hours if they do not reveal criminal activity deputy inspector michael collins , a police spokesman , said the videotapes from washington square park are held for seven days before being erased , because crimes are often reported a few days after they occur he said the police had already used the cameras in the park successfully at least twice once live , when an officer watching the monitor saw a crime occurring and radioed the police to make an arrest , and once on tape , as evidence against a suspect already under arrest at the rally s end , a few greenwich village residents showed up to support the surveillance cameras among them was diane whelton , who said she and members of several neighborhood groups had been pleading for the cameras for years the rev peter laarman , senior minister of judson memorial church , on washington square south , told her that he had been asked to allow a camera to be installed on the church s spire , overlooking the park but he told mrs whelton , we did n't want to be a party to that level of of the safety of people on the street , she said , interrupting him , who might not know that there s somebody coming up behind them \? photo some of the more than 200 protesters who rallied yesterday in washington square park against the use of police surveillance cameras \( dith pran the new york times \)
elizabeth , nj , march 6 three union county prison guards were convicted today of assaulting and abusing more than a dozen asylumseeking immigrants who had been brought to the county jail on the night of june 18 , 1995 , after the nearby federal detention center was shut down in a disturbance the announcement of the verdicts in the nineweeklong trial unleashed a torrent of emotions in the seventhfloor courtroom here , where more than 100 friends and relatives of the three guards had flooded in some held their breath in astonishment as the verdicts began to be read , some sobbed that quickly gave way to shouting of threats and gesturing toward the prosecution team judge miriam span of union county superior court had warned spectators to control themselves before jurors entered the jury box after 13 hours and 20 minutes of deliberation over three days even before the completion of the lengthy reading of the verdicts on the 27count indictment , she had a force of 30 armed and uniformed court officers clear the room a woman identified as a sister of one of the defendants spat in the direction of the prosecutors as she was being led out the verdicts came in the first of a series of trials of union county prison guards the trials grew out of the violence at the immigrant detention center here , which was run by a private company that investigators said hired poorly trained and abusive guards the disturbance by the detainees there , a protest of their treatment , led to widespread changes in how the federal government operates its detention centers and the asylum program prosecutors painted a picture of the immigrants going from the abysmal conditions of the federal detention center to the even more abusive atmosphere of the union county jail , where the guards beat and kicked them and used pliers to pull the hairs around their genitals many of the former detainees , some of them deported to their native countries , were flown in to testify against the guards convicted on nine counts each of assault , misconduct and conspiracy to obstruct the investigation of what happened at the jail in june 1995 were james rice , 42 , a guard for 16 years , and charles popovic , 35 , who had been a corrections officer here for 11 years also convicted on nine counts of conspiracy to cover up misconduct was michael sica , 35 , a policemen s benevolent association official at the jail who was not working on the day of the assaults on the detainees but who prosecutors said coordinated a coverup effort that included threats aimed at officers who cooperated with investigators judge span immediately revoked bail for the three men and they were taken away to an undisclosed jail outside union county the men face up to 10 years in prison thomas k isenhour , an assistant union county prosecutor who was the lead prosecutor on the case , attributed the jury s verdict to the testimony of seven corrections officers who described the abuse they witnessed and the conversations they secretly recorded of the defendants in which threats were aimed at anyone who cooperated with investigators he attributed the emotional reaction to the verdict to the sense of personal betrayal any time you have one law enforcement agency in a jurisdiction go after another , there is going to be a perception of unfairness , he said , as he and alan silver , another prosecutor , reacted to the verdicts the lawyers for mr rice and mr popovic did not comment on the verdicts , but robert galantucci , the lawyer for mr sica , vowed to appeal , saying , we have to move this out of union county because from the beginning it has been lopsided the disturbance by detainees at the former detention center run by the esmor corrections services corporation led to a sweeping review by the immigration and naturalization service of its policies nationwide on asylum seekers as well as on the way the agency monitored private contractors who ran the centers the center in new jersey remained closed for more than 18 months after the melee when it reopened in 1997 under the management of the corrections corporation of america , the immigration agency announced several new measures these included allowing parole for some asylum seekers as an alternative to lengthy detention , speeding hearings on their claims and better monitoring of medical , legal and other services and management practices at the four privately run detention centers around the country the union county jail was one of a dozen prisons to which detainees caught up in the 1995 disturbance were taken but it was the only one where allegations of abuse and assaults led to criminal charges as well as a civil suit by some of the former detainees from the beginning , lawyers for the plaintiffs in the civil suits said their cases against the county would proceed regardless of the outcome of the criminal trials the fact that civil suits had been filed was repeatedly noted by lawyers for the jail guards as they crossexamined the former detainees and suggested that the detainees were exaggerating the accounts of abuse and their injuries to strengthen the damage suits fourteen former detainees , some traveling back to the united states from their home countries , to which they had been deported by the ins , told stories of being pushed , punched , kicked and knocked to the ground by shouting and abusive guards from the time they arrived at the county prison their injuries ranged from bruises and cuts to bumps and lumps , but no one was so seriously injured as to have to be hospitalized but judge span cautioned the jurors that the inflicting of pain , regardless of how serious the injury , was sufficient to qualify as assault and abuse under the law none of the former detainees were on hand to hear today s verdict in their own accounts , most former detainees spoke more of the fear , shame and humiliation they felt from the experience
atlanta , oct 28 the neighborhood housing project was so violent , it was nicknamed little vietnam drug dealers ruled many residents of the east lake section of atlanta lived in fear during the 1980 s , particularly those in the east lake meadows housing project the deteriorating east lake golf club , where the legendary bobby jones learned to play , was just another casualty of the neighborhood surrounding it was an environment where premature death was part of the landscape about six or seven years ago , the drug dealers started shooting out , and we started shooting in , said carlos banda , a 25year veteran of the atlanta police force , who works in the east lake area a small child was killed even after that , it did n't get that much better that was the situation facing tom cousins , a local real estate developer and philanthropist , in 1993 when he bought the golf club a course in desperate need of restoration , and a community in desperate need of hope amid the brush and dirt of east lake , cousins saw an opportunity to secure a legacy as the man who saved the golfing home of bobby jones and helped to revive a blighted neighborhood in the process from his own charitable foundation , cousins spun off the east lake community foundation , and he used it as the linchpin for a complex marriage involving the golf course , the federal government , city officials and the private sector together they raised 935 million , with the goal of reviving the golf course and the east lake community through new housing , an afterschool academic program , a community center , a golf academy and a caddie scholarship program that has sent some east lake youths on to college while there have been many efforts to attract members of minority groups to golf , this plan was unique in its ambitious attempt to use the sport as a vehicle for urban restoration the undertaking will gain national attention beginning thursday when east lake is host to the tour championship , one of professional golf s most prestigious events it is a somewhat odd partnership golf , a sport with a history of exclusion , being used to revitalize a troubled , predominantly africanamerican neighborhood initially , many corporate leaders were skeptical politicians disagreed on a course of action some within the community resisted , feeling they were given little voice in the effort others were distrustful , having been betrayed in the past by numerous broken promises before , if people asked you where you lived , you better not say east lake , said geraldine lowery , who moved with her two children , meoshia and rodriquez , into one of the new town houses last spring when they first started talking about doing this , i thought it was a joke then when they started building the new places , i said , 'they 're not really going to let us live over here' but i'm happy , very happy i wanted something better for my children , and this is it and this is how i knew things had changed my mother never used to want to have any family gettogethers at my house but one day when we were talking about getting together , my mom said , 'let s do it at your house' that made me happy lowery said that when her children were toddlers , she taught them how to roll off the bed and onto the floor when they heard gunfire , and how to keep their heads low to avoid possible stray bullets coming through the window now , both children attend the golf academy i think what they 've done is absolutely phenomenal , said tiger woods , who will play at east lake this week it says a lot for that community it s just a matter of everyone coming together and you do n't find that very often somebody always has some kind of agenda , instead of everyone pulling together for a dream the initiative began earlier this decade when federal money from the department of housing and urban development was secured in 1993 , cousins s own charitable organization the cf foundation bought the course , and two years later it focused on the east lake area and formed the east lake community foundation together with contributions from the atlanta housing authority and private donations , the money to finance the plan was raised a developer hopes his project is a model what happens to the east lake community over time will be a large part of cousins s legacy now 66 years old , he played at east lake as a child in the 1940 s , and his respect for jones and the course was embedded at a young age a wealthy developer who is well known in atlanta , cousins developed the downtown omni complex and nationsbank plaza he could have simply renovated east lake golf club and still have drawn rave reviews for restoring a part of golf history but he chose not to ignore what was on the other side of east lake s gates people ask me all the time why am i doing this , cousins said it s like they 're waiting for the other shoe to drop we need to do something about situations like this all over the country , or we 're going to lose our future if i had grown up the way a lot of kids had to grow up in east lake , i would have gone bad a lot sooner than most of them did

teheran , iran , sept 11 iran vowed revenge today against the militant taliban movement that controls most of neighboring afghanistan , with the revolutionary guards saying that the taliban should be given what they so richly deserve for killing at least nine iranian diplomats in a statement on iranian television , the elite force added the taliban and the main agents responsible for this horrific crime must know that they shall never be immune to the tumultuous anger of the islamic corps and iran s former president , hashemi rafsanjani , who is still a key official , said today during prayer services at teheran university i offer condolences to the martyrs' families and promise them that we will get revenge for their blood the gathering was punctuated by chants of death to the taliban ! the fierce new round of threats followed an admission by the taliban leader , mullah mohammad omar , on thursday that taliban soldiers had either intentionally or unintentionally killed the diplomats last month during the capture of the northern afghan town of mazarisharif iran s state news agency , irna , said today that its correspondent in mazarisharif , who disappeared along with the 11 diplomats , had also been killed by the taliban , agence francepresse reported today that report could not be confirmed some iranian officials took pains today to emphasize that iran would not be drawn into hasty action but the public declarations compounded an atmosphere of heavy tension already overlaid by an iranian troop buildup along the afghan border iran , a major backer of an opposition alliance fighting the taliban , has reacted with deep apprehension to taliban victories that have left the militant movement in control of most of afghanistan for the last month , the disappearance of the diplomats assigned to the iranian consulate in mazarisharif has been iran s main concern , but iranian officials have displayed increasing alarm at the prospect of a permanent presence by the taliban , purist followers of islam s dominant sunni faith , on the eastern borders of iran , a shiite muslim state today taliban forces were reported to be beginning an assault on another afghan town , bamiyan , that is home to large number of shiites , and foreign diplomats said they were concerned that if more widespread killings were reported there , iran might feel compelled to launch some kind of military intervention to many iranians , what happened to the diplomats in mazarisharif is being seen as final proof that the taliban cannot be trusted mr rafsanjani described the taliban today as part of a very deep conspiracy to occupy iran at its eastern borders but mr rafsanjani also declared that iran would not take rash action his words suggested that , rather than launch any kind of allout attack on a country that has historically been a quagmire for invading forces , iran might well wait to gauge how others respond to what it has labeled a shocking and horrifying atrocity in response to iran s complaint , the united nations security council promised on thursday night to begin an urgent investigation into these crimes the iranian military force of some 70 , 000 troops along the afghan border staged a threatening round of wargames that ended on monday a new round of military exercises could begin as early as sunday , iranian officials have said but iranian officials , including the current president , mohammad khatami , are suggesting a willingness , at least for now , to see how the united nations chooses to assess blame for the diplomats' death in new york today , secretary general kofi annan urged all parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from any action which that might be construed by others as provocative the secretary general s spokesman , fred eckhard , said that mr annan had been talking to iran and pakistan , a diplomatic conduit to the taliban , about organizing a mission to afghanistan that would include united nations technical experts to look at the site where the nine bodies were found the taliban commander , mullah omar , who reported his findings in a letter to the security council , said that the soldiers who killed the diplomats had acted on their own other taliban officials have said that by the time taliban commanders arrived at the iranian consulate on the day of the attack , none of the diplomats were anywhere to be found but iranian officials have presented a very different account in broadcasts on iranian state television , they have claimed that sheik omar himself ordered an attack on the consulate , and that it was carried out by a taliban commander and 15 soldiers the iranians have said that officials who had been on the phone with their counterparts in mazarisharif had heard a hail of gunshots as the attack began taliban officials have not yet said anything about the remaining two iranian diplomats , but iranian officials said today they believed they were still alive and may have escaped from taliban custody map of afghanistan showing location of mazarisharif iran has demanded an inquiry into envoys' deaths at mazarisharif
waterford , conn , april 7 the most ambitious nuclear power recovery effort since the three mile island disaster in 1979 is under way in this southeastern corner of connecticut , and federal regulators are about to hand down a final grade pass or fail the test facing the power company here , northeast utilities , is a new one for the nuclear industry while regulators have forced other utilities to update machinery and operations to meet strict federal standards , the millstone nuclear power station here has an extra requirement the federal nuclear regulatory commission will not allow the reactors to restart until management completely changes its culture and proves that workers feel comfortable when they raise warnings about nuclear safety what led to this crisis was a plant where operations had become so shoddy that managers routinely broke federal rules when workers raised concerns about cooling pipes wrapped in duct tape , faulty gauges , torn filters and the mishandling of fuel rods , they were not only ignored , they were punished two years ago federal regulators ordered a sweeping effort to turn millstone around and , aware that many of the safety problems came from a corporate culture that had stifled whistleblowers , the regulators in october 1996 added the special condition that millstone had to be a workplace where criticism could flourish in a sign that the commission is keeping a careful eye on the turnaround effort , the government in december levied the largest fine ever against a nuclear power plant , 21 million , and warned the operator , northeast utilities , that many of its problems had yet to be solved now the utility is claiming victory last week , it wrote regulators in washington that it had completed its work at one reactor and was ready for a final federal inspection the 750 million recovery venture at millstone , which included reeducation sessions for engineers and managers , is intended to set a new standard for what the commission calls a safetyconscious work environment in a nuclear plant the company , in accord with demands from federal regulators in august 1996 , is also reviewing its operations manuals for the reactors , an elaborate process that involves checking whether each piece of the plant operates as designed the regulatory crackdown has sent shock waves through the nuclear industry every nuclear utility is now under orders to reassess operations manuals , and many plants are going beyond that heeding the warnings issued to northeast utilities , they are paying more attention to workermanagement relations although nuclear power was once viewed as the energy of the future , deregulation of the electric industry has raised questions about whether expensive nuclear power plants , which must comply with extensive government oversight , can compete the recovery that millstone is attempting in an age of tougher regulation is viewed by many in the industry as an important test for all nuclear utilities since three mile island , other recovery efforts have improved equipment and procedures , but they have n't affected the industry the way millstone has , said david a lochbaum , a nuclear safety engineer for the union of concerned scientists , a watchdog group in washington these others were all local , while millstone was industrywide they caused a ripple , but not a tidal wave in connecticut , the process has been painful , both for the company and for many of the 3 , 500 people who work at the plants one engineer who has learned the steep price of change is david lazarony , who has spent much of his professional life teaching people how to operate nuclear reactors but at a company meeting in january , he stood before several hundred colleagues and admitted that there was a lesson he was still struggling to learn delivering a confession with overtones of a 12stepprogram meeting , mr lazarony acknowledged that he had spoken badly of a worker under his supervision even worse , he had disparaged him for criticizing plant operations i expect better of myself , he said to stunned silence i'm embarrassed such sessions are being closely scrutinized by the nuclear regulatory commission , which may decide next month whether northeast can restart unit 3 , its largest reactor the decision will not only determine the financial future of the utility , but will also be a verdict on the regulators' own ability to oversee such an endeavor among northeast utility executives , outside critics and other industry officials , there tend to be three views some say the commission has hit just the right level of enforcement , others say the regulators have not gone far enough , and then there are those like the 41yearold mr lazarony , whom the company had held up as a role model in february , mr lazarony quit and said the company had gone too far in tying the hands of managers , and had overreacted to his own critical remark about an employee he now trains the people who are dismantling the reactor at connecticut yankee , the nuclear plant that had once been the northeast utilities flagship that is the future of this industry , he mused learning how to decommission plants the company new standards and new scrutiny
washington , nov 16 all of the weaponry that the united states was prepared to let loose against iraq on saturday remains in the persian gulf and could be used to strike within hours of receiving notice , senior administration and pentagon officials said today although the pentagon announced on sunday that it would suspend the deployment of dozens of additional warplanes and ground troops , the attack that president clinton called off 15 minutes before it was to begin relied entirely on forces already in the region , the officials said the planned attack , they said , would have involved a first strike of nearly 300 cruise missiles fired from eight warships in the gulf , followed by bombing raids by dozens of f14 and f18 fighters aboard the aircraft carrier dwight d eisenhower , the officials said , speaking on the condition of anonymity gen henry h shelton , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said the proposed strike was still a valid operational plan , and for that reason he declined to discuss the matter further except to say that the united states was prepared to strike almost immediately he saw this time how fast our response came , general shelton said in a telephone interview , referring to president saddam hussein of iraq the next time it could come faster at the pentagon as elsewhere in official washington , there was deep frustration that the united states had once again geared up for a military strike only to see mr hussein reverse course and pledge anew to abide by united nations resolutions and there was almost universal agreement that mr hussein would provoke a confrontation again defense secretary william s cohen warned mr hussein today that this latest confrontation was the last goaround he strongly suggested that the united states would react swiftly and without warning if iraq once again ended cooperation with international arms inspectors i think he has had more than sufficient warning , mr cohen said at a ceremony swearing in the new navy secretary , richard danzig i do n't believe that any additional warning is required the united states still has nearly 200 aircraft in the persian gulf and 23 navy vessels , 14 of them combat warships , as well as more than 20 , 000 soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines a second aircraft carrier , the enterprise , is scheduled to arrive in the gulf in a week , replacing the eisenhower , though for a time both will be there after the last confrontation with iraq in february , the united states sharply reduced its forces in the region but , significantly , doubled the number of tomahawk cruise missiles kept aboard navy cruisers , destroyers and attack submarines plying the gulf those missiles and the carrier s strike fighters allowed the administration to prepare an attack with less buildup than those for previous strikes and the officials said they could rely on those missiles and fighters again of the 139 additional aircraft that mr clinton sent to the region on wednesday , only 23 completed the trip , including four b1 bombers and seven b52 s another 53 planes , including three squadrons of fighter jets , went as far bases in spain , italy and germany before the attack was called off the rest never left the united states , though they remain on standby the nearly 4 , 000 additional army troops who were to have gone will also remain in the united states none of the aircraft being sent to the gulf were involved in the strike that was aborted on saturday morning not even the b52 s they left air bases in louisiana and england on friday night and were flying at the time toward diego garcia , the british island in the indian ocean , where they remain under the pentagon s attack plan , the b52 s and the other planes headed to the region would have taken part in followup strikes that were to have lasted a number of days , the officials said mr cohen said he would recommend recalling the forces extra that had been sent they will be at the ready and can be called back at a moment s notice , he said photo an iraqi soldier patrolled yesterday outside united nations offices in baghdad international weapons inspectors are to return there today \( agence francepresse \)
what is kirkus , and why should anyone care \? it is a book reviewing service that provides one of the first published reviews a book receives as an early warning system , it can be excruciating for authors and damnable for publishers , and it is often cursed by both unless it gives a good review , which many people in publishing feel it often goes out of its way not to do then it is seen as confirming the publisher s quickness of judgment and can be used for a blurb on a book jacket or in an advertisement timing is what gives the reviews of this shadowy service and its chief competitor , publishers weekly , their power in a sort of pact with beelzebub , publishers send them books in galley form about 25 , 000 annually three or four months ahead of publication , allowing them to render their judgments much before anybody else can , in kirkus s case by six to eight weeks kirkus gets an added kick of influence because it has licensing agreements with barnes noble s and amazon s online bookselling services which mean that the searching eyeballs also automatically latch onto kirkus s reviews this is a mixed blessing for writers if you only buy books on the internet , you pull up kirkus it s the first review you get and maybe the only one , one writer said i can put other reviews of my book on the internet myself , but kirkus is first and automatically there good if it s good bad for the writer , if it s bad kirkus and pw , as it is known , each review about 5 , 000 books annually , all anonymously , unlike the signed reviews in newspapers and magazines the question always asked , certainly by those whose books have been trashed , is who the devil is writing these things \? this is particularly true of kirkus , which is generally the more insolent of the two and whose reviews are often described as snide by those in book publishing with all of that , kirkus and pw reviews ooze influence rather than pulsate with it because they do n't normally deal directly with consumers rather they are a service for those who lend or sell books , like libraries and book shops , and those who want people to read about books , like magazines and the smaller newspapers , which use the two to help them decide which books to review they are also rigorously scanned by publishers and editors , by literary agents , hollywood producers , book scouts for movie companies and foreign publishers \( moreover , pw is the trade publication for the book business besides its book forecasts , the magazine is also the chief transmitter of industry news and gossip and is therefore a weekly mustscan for everyone in book publishing kirkus does none of that \) as to who does write all that stuff , the answer is schoolteachers , academics with particular expertise , aspiring authors who are trying to patch together a living , reviewers for other publications and even , on occasion , people who simply write in and want to review and show they can do it or who have answered an ad seeking reviewers people in book publishing are generally vigilant about not being quoted by name about even the most innocuous things , so anything that touches on book critics or criticism brings forth fierce demands for the anonymity they protest in the reviews they tend to go out of their way to be completely off the wall , one prominent publisher said of kirkus reviews , but then added that having just gotten one of their good reviews , the book was instantly sold overseas they do stimulate a certain level of food chain store buying another publisher said that a good kirkus confirms in your mind that you may have something , particularly if the author has no previous track record a bad one can mean oops , the publisher said both agree that pw has similar early warning radar , and both agree that pw s reviews are generally kinder traditionally , kirkus was the more negative of the two services , and it was not uncommon for some authors to ask their publishers not to send them galleys because they feared the slashing judgments and thought kirkus often gave away book endings much of this feeling has now abated despite criticism of the kirkus reviewers , anne larsen , its executive editor , says that all of them are grownups who are deeply steeped in some specialty like finance or science or who simply love and know fiction otherwise , it does n't work , she said it s very tough to do , there s an art to it , and it takes a lot of practice kirkus has a pool of about 75 reviewers , who are paid an average of 40 a review , and a staff of six editors kirkus is privately owned by david lebreton , who lives in boston and used to publish a newsletter in washington it can be bought by subscription only , and the rates range from 355 for publishers and producers and such to 240 for book shops to 125 for some libraries , depending on the size of the library s book budget , plus , in all cases , firstclass postage fees for that money the subscriber receives twice a month a fat magazinesize publication printed on inexpensive paper simply called kirkus reviews each contains about 200 snappy reviews , averaging 320 words , in categories of fiction , nonfiction , poetry , mystery , etc although it declines to be specific , kirkus has about 5 , 000 subscribers publishers weekly is owned by the cahners publishing company it is a traditionally formatted magazine , printed on glossy paper , with about 35 , 000 subscribers each issue includes about 100 forecasts in similar categories , for which it pays its pool of reviewers 40 or 50 a review pw also reviews cookbooks and gardening books , which kirkus does n't , and , according to sybil steinberg , its review chief , it is planning to include in its forecasts the names of the book s agent and the publisher s rights person kirkus was founded 66 years ago by virginia kirkus , an outofwork book editor , who thought up the idea in the middle of the night and presumably popped out of bed and wrote it all down from the start , she was tart a cheap bit of fustian , written by a movie bit actor or slender little story , rather starry eyed , strictly for the rental market were typical of her writing so how prescient has kirkus been \? well , it allowed that the catcher in the rye had a compulsive impact even though it is a sorry little worm s view of the offbeat of adult pressure , of contemporary strictures of sentiment gone with the wind was absorbing reading that could be a best seller on the other hand , kirkus is a bit lazy and impassive about digging up old failures in judgment

on a recent tuesday night , a dozen hivinfected men headed to the back of a cluttered office suite on west 26th street they made their way past a table blanketed with fact sheets on the latest antiaids drugs , past an extensive library that included all the established scientific journals and a computer that was available for internet surfing on treatment and services a list of aidsrelated symptoms was visible on an office desk if there is any place that is au courant on aids treatment , it is the headquarters of the people with aids health group , a nonprofit organization that is financed by the state and federal governments to educate community agencies and to counsel clients on the use of the new drugs that suppress hiv , the virus that causes aids but the men who gather every other tuesday are not there for advice on the new drugs these men , in fact , do not use the medications that have revolutionized aids treatment in a decision that even some advocates for aids patients consider extreme , they have refused to use the antiviral drugs , even though most have such high levels of the virus in their blood that doctors would urge treatment these men are forsaking the treatment for as long as they feel healthy they say their bodies will be better off in the long run mark niedzolkowski , 50 , a tall , gregarious man , organized this support group a year ago it is a way for him and the others to cope with the enormous pressure from doctors , friends and loved ones who have urged them , sometimes hysterically , to begin the tripledrug regimen that has allowed some people to leave their deathbeds it s really hard to maintain your resolve when you 're all by yourself and everyone is saying you 're crazy , mr niedzolkowski said there s nobody to talk to the support group may be on the extreme end of how patients try to beat the odds , but as problems with aids drug cocktails have cropped up , there has been a growing willingness by some to rethink the prevailing approach to hit early , hit hard with the drug therapies the men in the support group call themselves the drugnaive group the regulars range in age from their early 30 s to early 60 s some have lived for years without symptoms all have watched friends die of aids a couple of them marched in washington with the militant aids organization act up in the late 1980 s , to draw attention to the epidemic and to push for quicker federal approval of antiaids drugs the other night , the group was forced to improvise , without mr niedzolkowski there to moderate the discussion he was at home , sick for a man whose count of diseasefighting tcells has fallen to 168 , it is worrisome the average uninfected person has a count of 1 , 000 of these immune system cells even more important as an indicator of disease progression , his virus level has climbed to 177 , 000 the federal government recommends starting treatment when the virus level is above 10 , 000 yet mr niedzolkowski insists that his body is not in a state of emergency he says his illness is an allergic reaction to bactrim , an antibiotic that he recently started taking to prevent aidsrelated pneumonia he still has no intention of using antiviral drugs my resolve has been the same as it always was , to hold off as long as possible , said mr niedzolkowski , who is also the operations director for people with aids my life does n't need to be saved yet i feel there s an awful lot of hype out there about saving people s lives with these drugs many people are dealing with really severe side effects with these drugs , he added we 're trying to push it to the limit in terms of saving these drugs for later debate over when to start treatment the support group in new york appears to be the only one in the country that is exclusively organized around not using the antiviral drugs but its concerns about treatment are increasingly being voiced by others many advocates for aids patients say there is confusion surrounding the decision of when to begin treatment , despite new federal guidelines this is definitely the era of uncertainty with the therapies , said derek link , the top federal policy analyst for the gay men s health crisis , the nation s largest aids service agency there is generally little disagreement that people who show advanced aidsrelated symptoms like unexplained fever or thrush , a fungus infection in the mouth should be treated but a debate is growing over the best time to start treatment for others in earlier stages of infection an article this month in the british medical journal the lancet , for example , suggested that women infected with hiv might need to start the drugs earlier than men dr anthony s fauci , director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , said the federal guidelines were intended to provide flexibility unless patients were at an advanced stage so that patients would sit down with their doctors and make the decision about treatment together dr fauci said the complexities of patients' lives made it unrealistic to offer a standard code
east st louis , ill the casino queen riverboat arrived here five years ago , docking along the grimy riverfront of what was then the epitome of a dying american city raw sewage backed up into the streets piles of trash shared the landscape with vacant and burnedout buildings murders were rampant , yet there was not enough money to buy gas for police cars the city s debt was so high that when a man who was physically abused while in jail sued the city in 1990 and won , he was awarded the deed to the defendant s only asset of value the building that housed city hall i drove into town at night and missed the exit off the highway because there were no lights on downtown , recalled cheryl childress , who after leaving east st louis 30 years earlier returned to her hometown in 1993 to become the casino s human resources director the arrival of the casino changed much of that while many regions have turned to casinos to invigorate languid economies , perhaps no other city in the nation has become so quickly reliant on casino revenue and avoided imminent extinction simply by opening a place where people could gamble legally over the last five years , the casino queen , now second only to the local hospital as the largest employer in east st louis , has brought 1 , 200 jobs to this predominately black city of 42 , 000 people just across the mississippi river from st louis today , nearly 50 percent of the city s operating budget comes from tax revenue generated by the casino with my city , it s the lifeblood , mayor gordon w bush said of the fourstory , sidewheeler gambling boat that cruises in the shadow of the gateway arch in st louis if i take away a month of revenue from the casino , i start missing paydays for city workers we fall on our backs without that money as casino gambling has spread across the country , the verdict on whether it ultimately hurts or helps communities is still out a presidential commission is expected to report next june on the effect that the proliferation of casinos and other forms of gambling has had on the nation the economic advantages of casino gambling are profoundly evident in places like the gulfport region of mississippi , where 62 percent of the 18 , 000 jobs created since 1990 were at casinos , as well as in joliet , ill , where two riverboat casinos pay the third and fourth largest amount of property tax in the city in east st louis , the impact of casino gambling has been dramatic once a strutting bluecollar town of stockyards , meatpacking plants , railroads and afterhours nightclubs , the city began to decline when its industries stumbled in the 1960 s its population 82 , 000 in 1960 dwindled as many white residents moved out so precipitous was the decline that by the time the state approved a license for the casino queen to open in 1993 , few residents fervently opposed bringing legalized gambling to their community even the ministers who do n't like gambling have not been openly negative about it , said mayor bush , a burly 55yearold retired army lieutenant colonel who has announced plans to seek a third term next year east st louis is still one of the poorest cities in the united states , however , and not everyone here is so sanguine about the gambling boat boardedup buildings still line many streets and although half of the casino s jobs have been filled with city residents , the unemployment rate here remains above 10 percent , and could be much higher because many of the chronically unemployed are excluded from the count because they are no longer looking for work the most commonly heard grievance is that the casino has not hired enough local people or used enough local vendors few people , even the leaders of the city s more than 100 churches , have been ardently opposed to the casino itself but the rev walter shackelford jr , pastor of the rush memorial church of the nazarene , a small church just east of the downtown area , said his congregation still sees few benefits from the casino since the casino opened they have put a police substation in our area , mr shackelford said but none of my members or anybody i know of is employed by the casino we are still poverty stricken the direct impact of the casino , as well as its ripple effect , is significant , however the city has used the approximately 9 million it receives in casino tax revenue annually to begin to reverse its long decline broken sewers have been repaired , streets have been paved and more than 1 , 200 derelict buildings have been demolished the city s police force has nearly doubled , and now has 98 officers the number of patrol cars has also about doubled , to 73 officers now have full medical coverage several years ago , police officers had to pay their own medical bills when they were wounded crime has decreased in most of the nation s cities , but the 100 percent increase in police protection here has led to an especially large drop the number of murders , for example , peaked in 1991 at 68 , but so far this year there have been only 14 firefighters now have more than 1 million in new equipment , while their ranks have increased to 60 firefighters from about 45
it is the refrain of accountants , financial planners and taxsavvy lawyers if couples would only treat divorce more like a business proposition than an emotional cataclysm , they might actually profit consider the disposition of the house starting last may , the new federal tax law on capital gains made it reasonable for couples to behave more civilly about dividing the proceeds from the sale of a house of particular interest to divorcing couples , the law includes a provision that if a separation agreement or divorce decree gives one spouse exclusive use of the house , the spouse who moves out can continue to call the family house or apartment home the divorce penalty is gone , said louise t truax , a divorce lawyer with the firm of berkowitz balbirer in westport , conn so the new law reduces the number of games we play , like who owns the house and whether a client should move out here is how the law works if a house has been owned and lived in as the principal residence for an aggregate of two of the previous five years \( or 730 days \) , a couple can exclude from taxation 500 , 000 in gain from its sale if they file jointly single people or couples filing individually can take only a 250 , 000 exemption for some divorcing couples , it may take time to learn the new math you 've got to run the numbers and hope that even in a vitriolic divorce , spouses come to a reasonable conclusion , or that you can beat some sense into their heads , said cicily carson maton , a certified financial planner in chicago ms maton cited a recent case of a client whose home was valued at 800 , 000 , which represented a gain of about 600 , 000 he had signed over his interest in the house to his wife during their divorce not the smartest move for either spouse the wife found a buyer , ms maton said , but since the house was entirely in her name , she now had to pay taxes on 350 , 000 the difference between 250 , 000 \( her exclusion as an individual \) and the 600 , 000 gain had the couple been filing jointly , the tax would have applied only to 100 , 000 , the difference between 500 , 000 and 600 , 000 considering the tax advantages , maintaining joint ownership until after a sale or selling before the divorce was final could have yielded greater proceeds for both spouses to split in different ways , ms maton said anthony j russo , a certified public accountant in manhattan , said just how the money is divided could be a bargaining chip a divorce attorney say the husband s might also advise him not to transfer his share of the house to his wife so that she would not lose the benefit of his exclusion , and then he might bargain for something mr russo noted that many couples have the family home held in one name often the woman s and file individual returns to protect assets now you 're getting divorced in january , and the wife plans to sell the house , he said it might pay to stay married until dec 31 and file a joint return , since she could take the 500 , 000 exclusion even though the man s name is n't on the title , or put the house in both names before the divorce , with the intent to sell it later problems arise , though , for the spouse who , shortly after the sale of the family home , wants to sell his own residence the law allows the exemption on a house sale only once every two years herbert a bregman , a certified public accountant in stamford , conn , whose practice includes matrimonial work , noted that another potential obstacle is the judge since there is no tax on spousal transfers of assets , and since it can be an emotional issue among several immediate , rawemotion issues , a judge looking at the value of the house may overlook a tax that could kick in sometime in the future , he said capital gains is a consideration only if the gain from the house sale exceeds 250 , 000 and if one person intends to sell a house is a slowgaining asset that requires money to keep up , ms maton said still , if the house is modest , in good shape and the mortgage is low , i might advise against selling , especially since a woman might have a hard time getting a mortgage and finding a place that is cheaper and better none of this is for the faint of heart , she said , or the hard of hearing divorce , she added , is like being in a glass box with inchthick walls you see people s mouths moving , but the sounds are muffled still , said melvyn b frumkes , a divorce lawyer in miami and boca raton , fla , even two warring parties should realize that they have a common enemy the commissioner of internal revenue drawing \( nancy carpenter \)

newington , conn , march 10 dozens of state employees returned tentatively to the scene of a nightmare that none wished to relive , arriving for work this morning at the connecticut lottery for the first time since an angry colleague stabbed and shot to death four of the lottery s top managers their return was a scrupulously directed event in which state officials tried to make a painful transition as painless as possible , leaving flowers on every desk and stationing grief counselors throughout the lottery headquarters building although the new leaders of the connecticut lottery corporation knew they could not make the horror disappear , they did what they could to make physical reminders of the crime vanish a new entrance had been built so that workers could avoid the doors that they ran through in terror on friday the killer s desk , chair and cubicle had been taken away to deter flashback memories of matthew beck , the accountant who methodically hunted down the four executives before turning a 9millimeter glock handgun on himself the halfdozen offices stained by violence had been sealed and the hallways outside reconfigured to soften the sadness being felt by those who missed their supervisors , mentors and friends i did n't know what to expect , said rafael calderon , 30 , a lottery manager who witnessed the shooting of otho r brown , the president of the lottery corporation returning today was the most difficult thing i 've ever had to do , but it was good to see my coworkers and share this with them as he put flowers on the site outside the headquarters where mr brown was slain , mr calderon said everyone appreciated the state s attempt to take away reminders but he added , choking back tears and remembering how he had feared on friday that he would be the next victim , you do n't ever forget something like this , ever state officials harbored no illusions that their efforts could erase the memories of that friday morning soft crying could be heard today in the office and at funerals nearby , as hundreds gathered to remember linda a blogoslawski mlynarczyk , the lottery s chief financial officer , and frederick w rubelmann 3d , vice president of operations and administration as the mourning continued , investigators released more information about the killings john connelly , the head of the state police , said that mr beck , who was known to be undergoing treatment for mental health problems , had prescription bottles at home for an antidepressant , luvox \( generically known as fluvoxamine \) , and for two types of sleeping pills , lorazepam and ambien \( the latter is generically known as zolpidem \) three psychiatrists who are expert in those drugs said today that on very rare occasions the side effects of luvox and lorazepam can include outbursts of violence , but they said it was highly unlikely that the medications were a factor in mr beck s actions mr beck s struggles with depression led two democratic lawmakers , state senator george c jepsen and state representative michael p lawlor , to say today that they were including a proposal to deny gun permits to people with severe mental illnesses in a package of bills they are preparing they said at a news conference in the legislative office building that they had been planning to announce their package of gun control legislation today , and that the killings at lottery headquarters would undoubtedly provide a greater sense of urgency about 45 of the roughly 120 lottery workers came in to the office today , and when they walked through the door they were personally greeted by a bandaged alfred w dupuis jr , the head of security , who had been injured in friday s attack nearby in the lobby was a large bouquet that included four red roses , one for each of the slain managers , said nuala forde , a spokeswoman for gov john g rowland , who had sent the flowers inside the lobby , workers milled about , hugging and crying little work was done , but ms forde noted that the lottery had not assumed that anyone would come in all employees have the week off if they wish , she said the state provided buses for most of those workers to leave at 9 am for the two funerals , and also catered a lunch for them afterward benjamin p struski , 48 , a lottery worker , said that most of the day , workers just talked when people noticed a coworker upset or crying , they would hug and try to help and soon , they stopped talking about what they witnessed friday and started reminiscing about their friends who were killed , he said you start to talk about the happy memories , mr struski said as people kept talking and talking , there was a little more laughter it s going to be a healing that s going to take place , he added each day will get better for some workers , the trauma will never disappear state officials are considering transferring to other agencies the employees who cannot enter the building because of the images it brings to mind officials are also thinking about moving the headquarters to a new location once they have time to begin looking in the meantime , the offices of mr brown , ms mlynarczyk \( pronounced minarchik \) , mr rubelmann and michael logan , the fourth executive who was killed , are empty except for a few boxes , and their doors are locked they will never be used again , said

to the editor as a former school board member and officer in the new jersey school board association , i would like to comment on the subject of school regionalization \( chatter , feb 1 \) home rule is a well nurtured and long cherished myth most local decisions are shaped by forces outside the locality regulations from the state department of education , labor laws , environmental regulations , to name a few the average school district budget leaves only about 3 percent to local discretionary option formerly my feeling was that since home rule was indeed a myth , we would be much better off with regionalization we could combine purchasing , administration , provide curriculum benefits , save on busing and so on but i have reconsidered the question recently , the major obstacle , as i see it , is the educational bureaucracy there is no way they are going to let jobs disappear it is most likely that we taxpayers would be saddled with a regional layer of bureaucrats superimposed over what we now have the names of the jobs may change local superintendents might be called district supervisors local principals would be local district administrators but none would lose their jobs can you imagine a 250pupil kthroughsixth grade school without its own administrator \? it is likely that regionalization could wind up costing us more , rather than less walter kent glen rock
charlestown , mass terry titcomb s son al was murdered on nov 22 , 1994 sandy king lost two of her sons to murder , in 1986 and 1991 both women are natives of charlestown , a onesquaremile district on the north edge of boston that has the highest rate of unsolved murders in the metropolitan area both are members of charlestown after murder , a group of mothers who try to make sense of their collective losses it s not something we 're going to get over , or we 're going to get through , ms king said our lives stopped on the days our kids were murdered i do n't think i 've looked forward once in the 12 years since my son was murdered from thursday through saturday , on three consecutive nights , the stories of ms titcomb , ms king and other bereaved charlestown mothers will be projected in video onto the bunker hill monument , charlestown s most conspicuous and famous public structure krzysztof wodiczko , a polishborn conceptual artist , will transform the 221foot egyptianstyle obelisk into a nighttime granite goddess , its massive form first made to seem weightless through animation , and then weighty with the gravity of these mothers' tales there is a possibility of enormous communication when you project contemporary images onto historic monuments , said mr wodiczko , who was recently awarded the hiroshima art prize for his achievement in contemporary art and his contribution to world peace we should be able to call those monuments into question , to ask them what they think about what is happening today , and ask ourselves if we still believe in the ideals of those monuments we should even be able to make those monuments shocked and astonished born in warsaw during the ghetto uprising in 1943 , mr wodiczko graduated from the academy of fine arts in warsaw in 1968 in 1977 he immigrated to canada , and he now lives in new york city and boston since 1994 , he has been on the faculty of the massachusetts institute of technology mr wodiczko is best known for his socially and politically charged public projections in 1985 , he projected the image of the swastika onto the pediment of the south africa house in trafalgar square in london the act drew an official letter of protest from the south african government in the same year , he projected four alternating images of a human eye onto the pediment of the bundeshaus \( capitol \) in bern , switzerland the eye appeared to move , nervously surveying the nearby bern city bank , the canton bank , the national bank of bern and then the swiss gold reserve stored in a vault beneath the pavement of the bundesplatz mr wodiczko has used the soldiers and sailors civil war memorial in boston as a screen for images of boston s homeless people , and the facade of the martin luther church in kassel , germany , as a backdrop for a figure wearing a gas mask and a protective suit with his hands folded in prayer the charlestown projection was born as part of let freedom ring , a series of four temporary art installations set along boston s historic freedom trail this month let freedom ring is the brainchild of jill medvedow , the director of boston s institute of contemporary art and the founder of vita brevis , which promotes contemporary public art in boston along with mr wodiczko , the project features jim hodges , a new york city artist who has hung a series of wind chimes in boston s old north church mildred howard , a san francisco artist who has installed a pair of railroad tracks in the city s old south meeting house , and barbara steinman , an artist from montreal who has decorated the parkman bandstand on the boston common with large cloth banners bearing the images of sites and monuments on the common i wanted to use the history and the landscape of boston as a meditation on the themes of freedom and tyranny , ms medvedow said i thought this would give them room for work that could range from the poetic to the polemic as this was our first project , i also wanted to have a ringer and krzysztof is definitely my ringer for mr wodiczko , the choice of the bunker hill monument was almost academic it was clear that this structure is one that asks for this type of intervention , he said there was no other structure of similar symbolic power , nothing that was carved into the collective memory of the city as much as this one the theme of mr wodiczko s boston projection took a little longer to evolve initially , he planned to focus on the problems of immigrants and homeless people in neighborhoods across the city then he discovered charlestown s high murder rate the district of 15 , 000 people had at least three murders a year from 1975 through 1996 and the rigid code of silence that left 74 percent of those murders unsolved it was not a good thing for the members of this community to be afraid to report on these murders to the police , mr wodiczko said silence and invisibility are the biggest enemies of democracy if people do n't open up , if they do n't provide an unsolicited act of free speech on behalf of the general well being , then democracy cannot be practiced if you have a selfimposed silence , then you cannot exercise your first amendment right and if you cannot speak , none of your other constitutional rights can be exercised the mothers of charlestown after murder were initially skeptical of mr wodiczko and his proposal here was this guy from another country , whom we did n't know , ms king said how could he possibly understand charlestown , our community , our feelings of loss \? but mr wodiczko did his homework he walked the streets of charlestown he visited housing projects at night and spoke with residents he shared elements of his own personal tragedy , including the murder of his mother in the warsaw ghetto one week after he was born most significantly , he invited the charlestown after murder group to view a video that he had projected onto the tower of the 14thcentury city hall in cracow , poland , in 1996 the video featured several women from cracow who had suffered domestic abuse , and who told their stories only their hands were visible one woman held a candle another peeled a potato with the same knife with which her alcoholic husband had threatened her the stories of these cracow residents residents , in mr wodiczko s words , not of the city of culture , but of the city of pain made the tower animate and they deeply impressed the charlestown community it was just amazing to hear these women talk about their experiences , ms titcomb said to see their hands telling the story and i thought , wow , he wants to do something like that here on the bunker hill monument there is a teeming confluence of past and present in mr wodiczko s bunker hill monument projection built in 1825 , the monument commemorates the revolutionary war battle of nearby breed s hill , a battle the colonists lost , but one that changed the course of the war because of the high number of british casualties it was a glorious loss , mr wodiczko said and those who fought it are the heroes of the revolution in the same way , these charlestown mothers have lost their battle their lives are in a sense ruined but because they are organized , because they have the courage to come forward and speak , the meaning of their lives is saved these women are the heroines of the democratic process and democracy is our most difficult project , one that will never be done photos animated krzysztof wodiczko projected abused women s hands on the city hall in crakow , poland in charlestown , mass , his subject will be murdered children \( galerie lelong \) \( pg 40 \) parallels krzysztof wodiczko , whose mother was killed in warsaw \( ed quinn for the new

second college grant , nh newly fallen snow greeted my sons and me when we reached the white mountains on our drive north from the massachusetts seacoast the day after thanksgiving we were on our annual deerhunting trip , bound for this remote , uninhabited 26 , 800acre township in northeastern new hampshire owned by dartmouth college , the grant has a few camps and log cabins scattered along the dead and swift diamond rivers , which may be used by dartmouth alumni , students , faculty , staff , families and friends deer are not numerous in this rugged mountainous country , but my sons steve and jeff , and i are n't too concerned about that we are also in quest of tales of yesteryear , told at night after the day s hunt is done , and we want to see wood smoke rising from a cabin in a clearing , hardwood hillsides and spruce swamps , tracks of deer , moose , bobcats , coyotes , fishers and martens leading up steep ravines , ruffed grouse hurtling aloft from hemlocks and ravens soaring above granite cliffs we rejoiced at the snow not only because it would facilitate tracking and seeing our quarry , but also because it fit in with our feelings of how the grant should look in late november joining up with four friends in errol , nh henry sanders of hancock , nh his brother richard of peterborough , nh david taylor of littleton , nh , and roger adams of mansfield , conn we drove to merrill brook cabin in the grant after checking in at the gate camp , where we learned that only 13 deer had been taken from the grant , down a half dozen or so from the previous year s total on that date merrill brook cabin has gas lights , gas stove and gas refrigerator , a woodburning stove , a shed that is amply stocked with split , dry logs , a twoseater outhouse and a splendid collection of pots and pans in mild weather , a hose that runs to a pool a few hundred yards up the brook provides a gravityfed source of water to the kitchen sink the hose was buried under about four inches of snow , and the water in it had frozen , so we went to the brook with buckets after we stowed our gear and food in the cabin , there were only a few hours of daylight left , so we decided to hunt close by fanning out along the northsouth logging road that runs through the grant along the dead diamond river , we moved east up the steep slopes of halfmoon mountain i encountered the tracks of two deer early on , but they had been made the night before and it was n't until i was 500 feet higher that i found fresh tracks they headed almost straight up the mountain and it was too late to try to catch up to their maker , so i circled back down and got to the cabin ahead of the others , lit the lamps , stoked the wood fire and had the spaghetti sauce for that evening prepared before anyone joined me the others had similar experiences , finding old tracks early on , but seeing no animals all of us went west the following day , across the footbridge over the dead diamond river , just below monahan s bathtub , that leads to stoddard cabin and round and black mountains having thought about it for the past few years , i elected to poke north along the west side of the dead diamond upstream of the bridge , an area that gets minimal hunting pressure because easy access is only from the bridge or from another bridge several miles upstream at hellgate i found fresh tracks of deer moving north and south along the river s edge early on at 9 o'clock i heard two distant shots , but believed , correctly it turned out , that they were too far away to have been fired by one of our group shortly before noon , while standing on the edge of a grassy opening , the river only 100 yards away , i saw my first deer , partially obscured and standing under the widespreading branches of a spruce perfect , i thought i will shoot it , drag it to the river , get a canoe from the gate camp , put in at monahan s bathtub , paddle up to the deer with one of the lads this evening , take it aboard and bring it back down to where we can load it in our vehicle that was not to be observed through my rifle s scope , the deer had no horns , and only bucks were legal game as i watched the doe move away into a clump of alders , a shot rang out from less than a mile away none followed i looked at my watch it was nearly 1 o'clock being optimistic , i chose to think that one of our group had made a clean kill rather than a clean miss three hours and one more doe sighting later , i met my companions and learned that jeff had tried to shoot the head off a ruffed grouse with his deer rifle and had missed better to miss the head than ruin the meat with a body shot , he said two others had seen deer david had a doe walk to within 30 feet steve had spotted two deer in thick cover about 130 yards away his lowpower rifle scope showed him no horns when he switched to binoculars he discovered that one was a little forkhorn buck , but it drifted out of sight as he raised his rifle at the close of the next and final day , jeff s shot at the grouse was the only one the group had fired that night , the wood stove pouring out its seductive warmth beside me and vodka in hand , i said that although i was delighted with the copious draughts of comradeship and north country ambiance i had quaffed , i would have experienced even greater fulfillment if at least one deer was hanging in the dooryard my companions protested that such thoughts should not be allowed to tarnish enjoyment of the quest , and by midnight their merriment had overwhelmed my reservations drawing \(

chicago , aug 8 portraits of assassins are fixed in the american mind the deranged madman , the lonely loser obsessed with his target , the political killer following threats with violence these portraits are the stuff of myth , the secret service has concluded in preventing assassination , a new study of all 83 people who attacked or tried to attack an american political figure or celebrity in the last 50 years agents and psychologists analyzed the lives and actions of lee harvey oswald , john w hinckley jr and lesser players the study was bolstered by interviews with a special corps of collaborators , 23 of the assassins themselves the results , recently made available , challenge several stereotypes fewer than half of the assassins showed symptoms of mental illness many shifted from one target to another , valuing the act more than the victim not one had communicated a direct threat to the target or to lawenforcement authorities the good news , the secret service says , is that assassins are recognizable , not by who they are , but by what they do though assassins fit no physical or psychological profile , most share a pattern of behavior assassination is not a spontaneous event , but a trail of action that can lead to discovery it is far more productive , and ultimately more accurate , the secret service concluded , to examine a chain of thinking that leads a person to see assassination as an acceptable or necessary action , and to attend to behaviors that may precede an attack , than to simply label assassins and assassination as 'irrational' or 'crazy' lessons from the fiveyear research project are changing the way the secret service identifies and investigates people who may pose a threat to the president and other public figures experts outside the secret service say the study is helping efforts to prevent stalking , workplace assaults and other forms of targeted violence the emerging art of protective intelligence was put in the spotlight on july 24 , when two policemen were killed at the capitol in washington the intentions of the accused gunman , russell eugene weston jr , may never be known it is known that in 1996 he was interviewed by the secret service after he made apparently delusional comments about president clinton later , after threatening a neighbor , he was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for paranoid schizophrenia each year , the secret service tries to assess the risk posed by about 2 , 000 people some have made explicit or vague threats against the president or another national leader others expressed romantic interest in a public figure , pressed grievances that seemed unreasonable or tried to volunteer as a protector in most cases , as with mr weston , the secret service finds that the person presents a low risk and the case is closed only about 4 percent are arrested about 13 percent are committed to mental health treatment , many voluntarily , and often because they are a threat to themselves or others near them , not to someone under secret service protection protective intelligence is part science , part oldfashioned investigation and part common sense it is not foolproof in 1975 , for example , secret service agents judged that sara jane moore was no threat , and police officers took a gun away from her , the day before she shot at president gerald r ford in 1992 the secret service started the exceptional case study project , which begins with a 1949 case , when ruth ann steinhagen , a 19yearold fan , shot the star baseball player eddie waitkus in a chicago hotel he survived other cases include the killings of john lennon , robert f kennedy , martin luther king jr and malcolm x , and the attacks by the unabomber americans have long assumed that assassins fit a profile but the secret service found no profile of background or description fitting enough assassins to be helpful in deciding who is dangerous eightysix percent were men seventyseven percent were white the youngest was 16 and the oldest was 73 about half the assassins were single and had never been married , and one in three had children almost half had gone to college several had successful careers only one in five had been arrested as an adult for a violent offense it would be inaccurate to dismiss these attackers and nearattackers as inadequate , unaccomplished losers , the report says none were models of emotional wellbeing , the secret service concluded , but relatively few suffered from serious mental illnesses that caused their attack behaviors fortyfour percent of the assassins had histories of serious depression or despair fiftyfour percent had a history of harassing others fortyone percent had made suicide threats thirtyeight percent of the assassins had been hospitalized at least once for psychiatric reasons , ranging from longterm treatment to brief admissions for suicidal threats an additional 23 percent had been evaluated or treated by a mental health professional , ranging from counseling during adolescence to years of care for mental disability in all , 43 percent had a history of delusions , but only 10 percent claimed to hear voices telling them to attack a stronger pattern emerged in their recent experiences nearly all had suffered a recent trauma , like a marital breakup or job loss what does seem clear is that , for almost all subjects , attacks or nearlethal approaches occurred after a period of downward spiral in their lives , the secret service found the most frequent motive that assassins gave for attacking a public figure was to achieve notoriety or fame only a few wanted political change or acted in a group other assassins wanted to avenge a perceived wrong , to end their pain by being imprisoned or hospitalized or killed , to save the country or the world , to achieve a special relationship with the target , or , rarely , to obey voices ordering them to attack assassins seeking fame usually chose a prominent victim feelings about the target were irrelevant i would have voted for him if i had n't been in jail charged with trying to kill him , one unidentified attacker told the researchers onethird of the assassins considered more than one target oswald , for example , fired a shot at a retired general less than a year before killing president kennedy in 1963 and mr hinckley stalked president carter and the actress jodie foster before shooting president reagan in 1981 the secret service still investigates all people who make a threat , but it no longer assumes that a threat precedes an attack although some threateners may pose a real threat , usually they do not , the secret service said however , most importantly , those who pose threats frequently do not make threats the secret service has written a guide for state and local officials on preventing assassinations and other violence directed at individuals the guide and the research report are now available from the national institute of justice \( 8008513420 or 810 seventh street , nw , washington , dc 20531 \) this work has broken new ground in the way people study targeted violence , said randy borum , a forensic psychologist and assistant professor at duke university medical center the secret service has steered people away from the myths while robbing them of their mystique , the secret service gives america s assassins the only thanks that their government is likely to bestow upon them we are also deeply grateful , the authors write , to the men and women who were subjects of this study and who consented to be interviewed photos the secret service studied the 83 people who attacked or tried to attack american political figures or celebrities in the last 50 years lee harvey oswald , left , and john w hinckley jr were among those studied \( photographs by the associated press \)
st louis , dec 4 finally , he talked about the heisman trophy about ricky williams about his volatile temper michael bishop , kansas state s mercurial quarterback , spoke about everything except the fact that college football s top three teams are unbeaten and that there are only two national title slots or at least that is the case heading into saturday when saturday slips into sunday and brings to a close a memorable season , there is a good chance that is all anyone will talk about the final bowl championship series ranking that will determine which two teams get to go to the fiesta bowl and play for the national title here are the games that may decide the fiesta invitees kansas state , 110 and ranked no 1 by the coaches , versus texas am \( 102 \) in the big 12 championship tennessee , 110 and the news media poll s no 1 team , against mississippi state \( 83 \) in the southeastern conference championship and ucla , 100 and everyone s no 3 , facing miami \( 73 \) in a game postponed because of hurricane georges earlier in the season if all three teams win , the computer rankings including the new york times s and a formula measuring strength of schedule will decide the top two teams we just need to win it s all we can do , said bishop , who was made available by conference call this week for the first time in nearly two months kansas state coach bill snyder , who silenced his quarterback so that his emotional outbursts would not distract the team , echoed that sentiment here today and summed up the state of confusion surrounding college football s newfangled ranking system i have no idea , snyder said , referring to what kansas state needed to do to improve its no 3 bcs ranking i do know we need to win here to have the opportunity for the fiesta bowl to add legitimacy to the title game , the coaches have agreed to award their final no 1 ranking to the winner if kansas state is shut out of the fiesta , the coaches are in the odd predicament of crowning a champion they did not think was worthy during the season the times s final computer ranking will be released after all the bowl games have been completed each team has much to recommend it , as well as drawbacks kansas state s defense allows the second fewest yards in the nation and its offense is ranked ninth in yardage but its schedule is ranked the 62d toughest by the bcs because of earlyseason games against northern illinois , northeast louisiana and indiana state a victory over the aggies would improve that , but probably not enough to move up the wildcats tennessee s statistics , on the other hand , are solid but hardly spectacular the volunteers have the 23dranked defense , the 31stranked offense and a schedule considered the 29th toughest by the ranking system still , the volunteers have had big victories against highprofile teams florida , georgia , arkansas and syracuse ucla is the team that is seen as the least worthy of a title the bruins' highpowered offense , which is 12th in total yards , bails out a defense ranked 91st ucla has needed miracle finishes to beat lowly stanford and oregon state , but has been regarded as having the seventh toughest schedule because it plays in the competitive pacific 10 conference the bruins beat arizona \( 111 \) , and their opponents have the best record \( 6042 \) of the three top teams none of this statistical hairsplitting , however , appears to deter bishop he is 461 as a collegiate starter , and is perhaps two games away from completing his third perfect season twice he led undefeated teams to national junior college championships at blinn college in brenham , tex bishop said he knows texas am would like to spoil our perfect season and national title shot , but , in the sort of statement that makes snyder wince , indicated that that is not going to happen i do n't think we 've played our best game yet , bishop said our confidence is high the starting quarterback for texas am , randy mccown , separated his shoulder against texas and will be replaced by branndon stewart , who began the season as the starter bishop said he was not too concerned that his lack of exposure to the news media has hurt his heisman trophy chances , despite the kind of impressive numbers that have pro scouts moving him up the draft ladder he has run for 13 touchdowns and passed for 21 and 2 , 503 yards the media is not going to make me perform , he said i had more time to concentrate it helped me more than hurt me of his penchant for initiating unnecessary hits at the end of runs and for berating himself and teammates in an animated onfield fashion , bishop shrugged that off , too sometimes i tend to get overexcited , he said i get psyched up too high i play on sheer emotion bishop also said he would be comfortable sharing the dais with the player he says should win the heisman trophy i 'd vote for ricky , he said he did some great things for his team he broke the record , he said of williams s national collegiate athletic association career rushing record i 'll take the opportunity to play for the national championship over the heisman any day , bishop added but will first texas am , and then the computers , give him that chance \? photos tennessee s tee martin kansas state s michael bishop \( photographs by associated press \)

gov george pataki s call to end parole for felons convicted of violent offenses may resonate with voters concerned about crime but he is doing little more than playing to general frustrations and fears if mr pataki is serious about eliminating parole in new york , then he has to begin the hard work of producing a comprehensive plan that will reform the state s criminal sentencing system , of which parole is only a part new york operates under a traditional parole system in which offenders are sentenced by judges to a range of time in prison , such as 5 to 15 years , rather than a specific term after a prisoner has served the low end of that sentence range , he is eligible for parole the vast majority of offenders are released after serving twothirds of their maximum sentences after release , offenders are subject to parole supervision for the balance of their sentences in theory parole rewards rehabilitation , while also giving the state some control over offenders as they reenter society but the reality is much bleaker release decisions by the parole board often seem arbitrary , leading to differing outcomes for people convicted of the same crime questions about racial disparity in parole decisions have often been raised critics also charge that parole breeds public anger and cynicism when offenders are released before their sentences end many states have met these criticisms head on by replacing parole with determinate sentencing plans in which all offenders are given specific prison terms , allowing only small reductions for good behavior instead of setting very long maximum sentences that almost no one serves out , determinate sentencing sets shorter terms that convicts actually serve moving to determinate sentencing requires adjusting sentences for most if not all crimes many states , in revamping their sentencing plans , have also created alternatives to incarceration for lesser crimes mr pataki s proposal would do none of this it would simply make offenders serve out the maximum sentences under the old parole system he would in effect be doubling or tripling current sentences for violent crimes this plan would cause an expansion of the prison population , which has more than doubled in the past 15 years , and add enormous new costs there is little evidence that public safety would be served by lengthening sentences across the board if mr pataki is serious about creating a more rational system that eliminates parole , he would have to be open to reducing sentences for some crimes a rigorous debate about parole and sentencing reform would be welcome in new york state , especially if it caused policy makers to repeal the rockefeller drug laws that impose senselessly long mandatory sentences for many smalltime , nonviolent drug offenders so far , mr pataki s comments have not touched on these real issues
with a tense marathon of diplomatic maneuvers behind them and a fair wind at their backs , the three crew members of the ico global challenge balloon floated over china yesterday , more hopeful than ever of becoming the first balloonists to circle the world nonstop after beginning their trip last friday from marrakesh , morocco , the balloonists were rapidly approaching the halfway mark yesterday many attempts have been made by balloonists to circle the earth , but none so far have come close to surmounting the gigantic obstacles , both diplomatic and technical for a time monday , china denied the big balloon permission to enter chinese airspace north of the 26th parallel forbidden to proceed , unwilling to make a suicidal landing in the towering himalaya mountains and unable to change course or turn back , richard branson and his crew mates , per lindstrand and steve fossett , faced a crisis but after the intercession of prime minister tony blair of britain and the british ambassador to china , anthony galsworthy , the chinese government relented the balloonists were permitted to continue , even though that meant traveling north of the 26th parallel , on condition that they would agree to leave chinese air space as soon as possible this the balloonists cheerfully agreed to do but the balloon s ground control team at uxbridge , england , reported that the delay in crossing china had cost the balloon a day s time and fuel for its hotair burners , which might prove to be critical when and if the balloon nears its goal however , robert rice , the team s chief meteorologist and a veteran adviser to many longdistance balloon teams , said in a telephone interview that wind speeds and direction would probably improve markedly he said he expected the ico global challenge to cross the chinese coast of the yellow sea by nightfall wednesday , and then fly quickly over south korea and japan mr branson , the billionaire chairman of the virgin group of companies in britain , was jubilant he said he hoped that his team would be over the united states on christmas day and would land in britain \( or somewhere in western europe \) by new year s day mr fossett , a wealthy colorado commodities broker and sportsman , has made the roundtheworld attempt four times before , each time flying solo and setting two distance records a former rival of mr branson s team , he agreed to join it this time mr fossett made his last try in august , starting from mendoza , argentina , but a ferocious storm hit his balloon while flying over the coral sea , ripping the big gas bag and hurling mr fossett s capsule into the water he escaped serious injury and was later rescued by a yacht , but the experience left him shaken of course i'm scared , he said before the launch of the ico global challenge , but the odds look good this time map of china shows location of balloon and 8 pm eastern time yesterday with beijing s blessing , balloon was crossing china yesterday

johannesburg americans who need to visit a doctor here notice it right away the price of the appointment is a pleasant surprise , far less than it would be in the united states but the prescription afterward is a shock sometimes double the charge for the doctor s time the national health department says south africans , most of whom live in poverty , pay some of the highest drug prices in the world but its effort to force down prices has set off a pitched battle between the health minister a doctor and zulu princess named nkosazana zuma and the powerful global pharmaceutical industry the stakes are so high that president clinton put the dispute on his agenda last week during a stop in south africa on his sixnation african tour at issue is a new law that gives dr zuma sweeping powers to open the country to cheap imports , encourage the use of generics and sharply curb the markups that pharmacists charge the law is crucial to the mission the new government has assigned her to turn inside out a health care system that has given highquality care to whites while forcing most blacks to wait in crowded public hospitals or turn to traditional healers not only have prescription drugs consumed a huge portion of the public health budget , but half of all drugs in public hospitals are stolen , winding up in the highpriced private sector at the hospitals , meantime , the cupboards are so bare that some provincial doctors said recently that they could no longer give aids patients expensive antibiotics for brain infections none of this , however , is why president clinton cares about what has come to be known as the zuma law rather , american pharmaceutical companies , which control nearly half of the 2 billionayear drug market here through subsidiaries , see it as a threat to their patent rights they say the law which was signed in december and is now tied up in a court battle over its enforcement seems to arm dr zuma with the power to undo international patent protections and give anyone here she chooses the green light to make pirate versions of prescription drugs if the law is allowed to stand , the companies worry that other countries will follow suit and why stop with drugs \? american companies have billions in other intellectual property to protect from movies to music to software and the principles involved are essentially the same if the health minister thought it was in the interest of public health that those 10 , 000 aids cocktails be cheaper , she could just rip off the patents and set up a factory in cape town to make them , said a western diplomat who is fighting the law and if the minister of health says this is ok , then the minister of education will be able to say , 'well , affordable computers are in the interest of public education , but windows is just too darn expensive , so we 're going to buy knockoff copies' the health ministry denies having any such designs , and insists that it is only trying to cut prices the minister has said constantly that we have no intention of abrogating patent rights , said dr ian roberts , a british consultant to dr zuma who drafted the new law we respect the fact that they have an economic value on thursday , commerce secretary william m daley , visiting with mr clinton , discussed the american objections to the law with dr zuma both continue to disagree , a diplomat said , about the meaning of the section of the law that the pharmaceutical companies and the united states government say they cannot live with in this battle , it is hard to spot the good guys or even a neutral player there is no consumer lobby here , no ralph nader or consumer reports magazine , so patients are at the mercy of big business and big government the local press has been lax , dutifully retyping the propaganda from both sides without explaining the issues to nervous readers and there has been more than enough brinkmanship to go around merck company , the new jerseybased drug giant , has dropped a 10 million investment , openly blaming the new law britain s smithklinebeecham said it was rethinking expansion plans since the legislation was introduced last may , bristolmyers squibb , pharmacia upjohn and eli lilly have all closed their south african factories while they did n't openly blame the bill , the closures were partly in response to uncertainty surrounding the legislation , acknowledged mirryena deeb , executive director of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association of south africa in washington , 47 members of congress recently signed a letter asking the united states trade representative to pursue all appropriate action against the law and an industry group , the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america , lumping south africa with argentina and india as global centers of patent piracy , asked the commerce department to put all three on washington s highestlevel list of countries that discriminate against american exports the first step toward imposing sanctions \( south africa got off the list only two years ago , when the government helped stop a durban hamburger outlet from stealing the mcdonald s name \)
the political battles and attendant bitterness over government financing of the arts is enough to make one long for the days of enlightened private patronage the current budget of the national endowment for the arts , 98 million , is the smallest in 20 years , and even that sum barely survived a divided congress there are private foundations , of course , but they can be as cumbersome and politically driven as government arts panels corporate giving usually comes with strings attached and seldom goes to cuttingedge work so where are the moneyed , cultured patrons who think supporting an artist is as beneficial to society as building a new hospital wing \? betty freeman of beverly hills , calif , may be one of the last of them the vivacious ms freeman , 76 , is a modernday medici her artistic interests are wideranging she has collected american painting , befriended artists and authors and is herself a photographer for 35 years , ms freeman s special mission has been contemporary music , and her support of living composers is renowned in newmusic circles she has given money to struggling composers for living expenses , as when she rescued the selftaught eccentric harry partch from a vagabond life in the 1960 s and she has supported the commissioning of works for major institutions , like the 1991 hyperviola concerto by the electronic instrument whiz tod machover , composed for kim kaskashian and the los angeles philharmonic new music group but no panel , no demographic study group and no expert arbiter of taste influences her decisions , and that is how she likes it my choice of composers is purely arbitrary and based solely on my response to their music , ms freeman said recently during a trip to new york these included the visiting british composer harrison birtwistle , whose kinetic , complex works \( several of which she commissioned \) she considers among the towering masterpieces of our time my choices are also not a matter of being right , she added , because i 've sometimes been disappointed in the results on balance , however , she is delighted by the long list of works she has been midwife to , by composers as diverse as the american iconoclast conlon nancarrow and the lushly harmonic , quasiminimalist john adams , who dedicated his opera nixon in china to ms freeman betty is a maverick in that she makes her own decision based on personal esthetics , mr adams said during a recent telephone conversation from his home in san francisco and with her enthusiasm and love for the artists she gets involved with , and the prestige of her giving , she can call real attention to a composer like some grand figure from a french or russian court until the 1990 s , ms freeman supported american composers almost exclusively but in recent years she has been increasingly drawn to europe , especially to the salzburg festival , where gerard mortier , the artistic director for the last six years , has been introducing bracing contemporary programming into what had been a bastion of the past , and facing considerable opposition ms freeman , a staunch financial backer of mr mortier s programming efforts , has received what she calls hate letters from several composers she had previously supported , charging her with abandoning her own country she will not name names it was upsetting , she conceded but i 've gotten over it she also declined to put a dollar amount on her largess that would make this work seem like a business rather than a creative partnership , she explained gifts can be as small as several hundred dollars \( she is financing a series of short piano works from 10 composers at 500 each \) and as large as tens of thousands of dollars \( she gave 23 , 000 to the los angeles philharmonic to commission the composer christopher rouse s cello concerto , written for yoyo ma and first performed in 1994 \) but even a conservative estimate would put the total amount in the high six figures ms freeman s involvement with contemporary music comes not from a sense of duty but from an instinctive response i 've always been interested in the new , and do n't understand why everybody is n't , she said i like contemporary painting , clothing , furniture , architecture so of course i like contemporary music old music is fine but i like complexity , challenge , ambiguity , abstraction her attitude distinguishes her from the typical music patron today , who is more likely to finance a new production of carmen nothing in ms freeman s background prefigured her love of contemporary culture she was born in chicago and reared in brooklyn her father , a chemical engineer , had his own company , the source of ms freeman s wealth her mother was a math teacher neither parent had the slightest interest in the contemporary arts nor did her two brothers , her first husband or her four children in the beginning was music ms freeman , who studied piano as a child , graduated from wellesley college in 1942 with a major in english and a minor in music , and continued studying music when she moved to los angeles in 1950 there she began collecting contemporary painting , and it was through the art world that her unplanned career as a music patron began

military and raised new concerns about the integration of women into the armed forces faced with a growing number of accusers who threatened to destroy his sterling career , sergeant major mckinney fought back strenuously , arguing that highlevel officers charged with similar offenses were allowed to retire quietly without prosecution or penalty he also noted early on in the investigation that all of his accusers are white neither sergeant major mckinney , 47 , nor the women , five of them in attendance for the verdict , were willing to speak tonight , preferring to wait until the jurors have heard more testimony in the penalty phase of the court martial the one guilty verdict carries a potential penalty of five years in prison and a dishonorable discharge , but legal observers here doubted that sergeant major mckinney would receive a sentence that severe the guilty verdict relates to a telephone conversation from sergeant major mckinney to staff sgt christine fetrow on feb 18 , 1997 , when he tried to coach her in her dealings with military investigators unbeknownst to him , she was cooperating with the prosecution and recording the call that tape was played to the jury on it the sergeant major told the young woman that all you have to do is tell them we talked a lot , career development and that kind of stuff , that s all they need to know despite an acquittal on the underlying sexual misconduct charges including indecent assault and solicitation of adultery the jurors apparently concluded that the sergeant major had tampered with the legal system in an inappropriate way by telling sergeant fetrow what to say the jury was composed of four officers and four enlisted men of the eight , two were women , one was black none of the prosecution lawyers spoke after the verdict but army officials released a statement saying it would be inappropriate for the army leadership or the army as an institution to comment on the findings until the sentencing phase is completed we have said all along , the statement said , we were committed to letting the military justice system run its full course and that is exactly what we 're doing the verdict came after five weeks of testimony , 119 witnesses and a threeday deliberation that left the parties on both sides chewing their fingernails , especially earlier today when one juror was so unhappy with the deliberations that he considered withdrawing we had no idea what juror or what he was upset about , mr gittins said but it sure churned up a lot of stomach acid the verdict pointed to the high hurdle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for sexual misconduct charges , which often come down to one individual s word against another , with little evidence beyond the accounts of the witnesses this was a test of the difficulty of proving things beyond a reasonable doubt when large parts of the controversy are a swearing contest , said eugene r fidell , president of the national institute of military justice first , last and always , the burden of proof was on the united states to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and that is not an easy burden the charges against sergeant major mckinney might not have come to light but for a cascading sex scandal in the army the abuse of young female recruits by drill sergeants at the aberdeen training ground in maryland in its wake , the sergeant major was named to a highlevel commission to examine sexual harassment in the service it was that appointment , according to testimony , that prompted sergeant major hoster to come forward with her allegations other women followed , some willingly and some only as a result of an extensive investigation by the army and grants of immunity against prosecution for their own misconduct in all , there were six accusers staff sergeant fetrow , responsible for 10 of the 19 charges sergeant roy , responsible for four major gunzelman , responsible for two and petty officer vinson , sergeant major hoster and sergeant 1st class jeczala , each responsible for one charge their accounts had many things in common , notably the sergeant major s bids for sympathy following the death in 1996 of his 18yearold son in the military equivalent of a grand jury proceeding , an article 32 hearing , the longest in army history , was held last summer over the course of more than two months , all the women testified , along with corroborating and impeaching witnesses the vast majority of that testimony was recapitulated at the court martial here what was new in the military courtroom at fort belvoir was the testimony of sergeant major mckinney himself , a calm and persuasive witness the testimony of his wife , wilhemina , and the introduction of an alibi to account for his whereabouts on the night of oct 30 , 1996 , a night when he was accused of having had sexual intercourse with a pregnant sergeant another new element was the army s most experienced judge , col ferdinand clervi , who presided here with a wry expression , a gentle demeanor and the diplomacy to keep warring lawyers in line in a twist , sergeant major mckinney s alibi proved to be the most damning evidence in the courtmartial it was a signin sheet at a selfservice automobile repair shop on the grounds of fort myer , va , where he lives it showed the sergeant major was there , in bay no 4 , changing the oil in his wife s 1983 volvo , at the very time he was alleged to be having sex with sergeant roy at his home but the prosecution questioned the validity of the sergeant major s entry , the last of 13 after forensic examination at the army s crime laboratory , an expert witness testified that it was the only entry on the form that did not leave an indentation on the sheet of paper below while sergeant major mckinney , 47 , was not charged with obstruction of justice for the suspicious signin sheet , what the jury thought about it , experts said , would be significant in their final decision one professor of military law at catholic university in washington , michael f noone jr , noted that these jurors might be more tolerant of sexual misbehavior , like solicitation to commit adultery , which is not a criminal offense in the civilian world , than they would be with tampering with the legal system and in the end , it was tampering with the legal system that stuck in this jury s craw

saturday night s concert by the new juilliard ensemble , with joel sachs conducting , presented five recent compositions in two categories either the music was slow and based on a minimum of ideas \( essentially one in the case of tigran mansurian s because i do not hope and none in that of otto ketting s arrival \) or else it zipped by , spilling diversity of the fast pieces , julian anderson s khorovod and elena katschernin s clocks seemed to owe something to the great modern master of lightness and complexity , gyorgy ligeti , whereas john zorn s for your eyes only , like other creations of his , looked for its ancestry among the composers of cartoon soundtracks hence , perhaps , the jokey title mr zorn s characteristic rush through everything brought forward this time a tonal cadence for string quartet , the chord that schoenberg used to support a play of orchestral colors in one of his early atonal pieces , and a lot of other graphic , immediate gestures , all played here with exuberance and attack besides speed , the pieces also differed in degrees of russianness two of the composers were educated in the soviet union ms katschernin moved to australia when she was 18 , and evidently took with her some memories of shostakovich mr mansurian left by staying where he was , in armenia of the others , mr ketting , like many of his fellow dutch composers , forms his clean musical plans partly in the image of stravinsky \( the other part coming from rock music and new york minimalism \) stravinsky is also important to mr anderson there are khorovods , or round dances , in the firebird and the rite of spring , and mr anderson s example has stravinskystyle rudimentary tunes , each merging into the next in a brilliant play of rhythmic engineering , controlled textural confusion and color khorovod was the concert s ebullient opener then came mr mansurian s lament , to which catherine gay s plaintive oboe solos brought some life , followed dully by mr ketting s piece after intermission , ms katschernin s music restored humor and oddity by stacking up instrumental motifs on top of persistent ticking from recorded noises the piece might have been more effective , though , if the same trick had not been worked three times \( with ominous suggestions of horrormovie music , fragments of blues and patterings of percussion \) or at least if some of the sections had been more compact photo joel sachs leading the new juilliard ensemble at the juilliard theater \( toby wales \)
if there has been anything more magical than the yankees' season , it has been the magic with which the anaheim angels have mesmerized the yankees for the fifth time in eight games this season , the angels beat the yankees last night , this time , 76 , behind a fourrun flurry in the seventh inning against two members of the yankees' incendiary relief corps , mike stanton and mike buddie troy glaus , a rookie , who was hitting 209 at game time , drove in the final two runs in the seventh with a double against buddie after the pitcher had knocked him down with his first pitch the angels' five games to three edge is unique in this season in which the yankees are threatening to set a major league record for most victories none of the other 17 teams the yankees have played has even a 500 record against them the outcome of this game also gave the yankees their first threegame losing streak since the first three games of the season the angels , who have a threeandahalfgame lead in the american league west , have been responsible for twothirds of each streak maybe a little losing streak helps us to realize we 're human and we still have to work at it , manager joe torre said , then added , i do n't think we 're alarmed , but you do n't like losing we 've become spoiled we get a little angry when we lose we 're not used to it stanton and buddie were not the only reasons the yankees lost they had a little help from their baserunning friends chili davis , for example , hit a fly ball off the leftfield fence for a run batted in with one out in the seventh inning , but only got a single and did n't move past first base the yankees took that 75 deficit into the eighth and scored another run on infield singles by scott brosius and derek jeter , both of which were aided by poor fielding by pep harris , the angels' relief pitcher , and a single to left by paul o'neill but that was when terry collins , the angels' manager , summoned his closer , troy percival percival made it a shortlived rally by striking out bernie williams and retiring tino martinez on a grounder to second base on a 32 pitch but in the ninth , percival created another chance for the yankees by walking the bases loaded quickly , however , he got two strikes on jeter , then snared his bouncer and threw him out he threw jeter two tough pitches , torre said you rarely see jeter get two strikes without swinging the bat and then he made a nice play on the ball back through the middle as he walked , relieved , to the dugout , percival took with him a career record against the yankees of no runs allowed in 17 1 3 innings his team s record was even more impressive no matter what happens in the remaining three games of the fivegame series , two games today , one tomorrow , the angels have already succeeded in making a point to themselves it was important for our guys to find out they can play with them , collins said absolutely , no question about it the angels' ability to beat the yankees is important because the teams could meet in the playoffs , either in the division series or in the league championship series results in the regular season often have no bearing on the outcome of a postseason series , but if the angels had been blown away by the yankees during the season , they might have a postseason problem addressing that issue , collins said when you 're a young team like we are still and i know we have some guy that have four or five years in the big leagues , but agewise they 're fairly young to be able to walk out there and say we can compete with the new york yankees in the year they 're having , yeah , i think it will be important if it gets to that point where we have to play them , certainly it can only help us have more confidence the angels were behind , 41 , after o'neill hit a tworun home run in the third inning but they scored twice against hideki irabu in the sixth on runscoring singles by glaus and matt walbeck with irabu continuing his twomonth streak of inconsistent pitching , the yankees could n't be certain whether they were watching the perils of pauline or the pearls of hideki irabu kept getting himself into trouble , then escaping the danger he had created he executed his most noteworthy escapes in the fourth inning and in the sixth clinging by his fingernails to the sheer cliff he had created for himself , irabu emerged unscathed after loading the bases with one out in the fourth , then survived with a onerun lead after allowing those two runs with one out in the sixth but when irabu walked randy velarde at the start of the seventh inning , the director of the yankees' huge hit of a show , torre , decided his stomach had been subjected to enough abuse for one evening not that torre s move settled his stomach he called for stanton , who all too often has played firebug rather than fireman , and who instantly made throws that he would regret before he had tossed a pitch , stanton threw to first base , that is , he threw somewhere in the vicinity of first base nowhere that martinez could have caught the ball velarde went to second on the error and promptly scored the tying run as darin erstad drilled a double along the rightfield line photo the yankees' mike stanton took the loss last night , giving up three runs on three hits in the seventh inning \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)

tenants vs trump was the classic battle of the 1980 s a group of entrenched tenants in rentregulated apartments overlooking central park vowed not to budge when donald j trump announced his plans to tear down their building in an opening salvo , mr trump labeled them millionaires in mink coats , driving rollsroyces they responded in kind i do n't need donald trump s glitz on the outside of my building , john c moore 3d , head of the tenants' group , said in 1986 by that time , they had already taken the developer to court , charging harassment but now , the battle has come to an end , not with a bang but with discreet coughs , raised eyebrows and whispered compliments the building is still standing and quietly , very quietly , 100 central park south has become trump parc east the condominium to some extent , everyone can claim victory mr trump was stopped from tearing down the building when the courts protected the rights of tenants in 100 central park south so he settled on the condominium idea and he is not complaining these days at least not out loud maybe because he recently sold one of his empty apartments for 19 million to an outsider as for the tenants , a few are preparing to buy their homes , while the rest will remain as renters , just as they wished all along and mr moore , who still lives in the glamorous 15floor 1920 s building at the corner of the avenue of the americas , in a onebedroom apartment with a fireplace and panoramic park views , is now mr trump s gallant defender donald trump has acted like a gentleman for a long time now , mr moore said indignantly , and he does n't deserve to be knocked over the head with this when he heard the compliment , mr trump produced his own he said that \? what a great guy ! what s going on here \? if politics makes strange allies , so does real estate the tenants of 100 central park south at least most of them who would speak publicly appear to have called a truce none of the tenants interviewed , with one exception , will say whether they have signed up to buy their apartments and as leo henriquez , a current tenant leader , made clear , nothing bad is to be said about mr trump , or the deal the tenants made plenty of developers suffered downturns after the 1987 stock market crash brought new york city s real estate market to its knees their crises seem to have created an unthinkable phenomenon the mellow \( er \) landlord and while developers may be prosperous again , they are no longer masters of the megalopolis even mr trump , the biggest selfpromoter since p t barnum , seems a trifle more subdued just a trifle in this more sanctified perhaps sanctimonious sphere , developers no longer specialize in tenant removals instead , they hire public relations professionals it s not good pr to be seen as a thug , said a wellknown city landlord , who insisted on remaining anonymous mr trump , like the tenants , seems to want to forget about the battle of 100 central park south , which gave him a publicrelations black eye once , he had vowed to rip down the building and the one next door he had bought 100 central park south and the barbizon plaza , now trump parc , in the same 1981 deal to build another glittering megacondo it has been a long time since he volunteered \( what do you mean 'threatened \? ' he asks now \) to house some of the city s homeless in his vacant apartments at 100 central park south a plan quashed by mayor edward i koch in 1982 it has been a long time since the tenants charged him with harassment for more than a decade , the feud simmered , as mr trump watched the real estate market , and for a while his own fortunes , plummet but now , the developer , the market and the tenants are all back within the last few months , the tenants have negotiated terms that will either let them buy their apartments for a 33 percent discount or let them keep renting without certain kinds of rent increases for eight years within the last two weeks , the state attorney general accepted the condominium plan by their march 10 deadline , 8 of the 51 tenants had signed up to buy apartments to those who watched the recent negotiation including mr trump s own lawyer , michel evanusa of stroock stroock lavan , who insisted that both sides made a great deal it seems as if the battle of 100 central park south may have ended in a draw not that the developer accepts that finding from a certain reluctance to discuss the negotiations at all who told you about that \? was his initial reaction he switched to a buoyant portrayal of himself as the winner i can understand why the tenants do n't want to talk , he said i can understand why they 'd be upset they fought a 10year battle and lost stuart m saft , the lawyer who represented the tenants' group in their recent negotiations , said his clients had decided not to speak publicly about mr trump because they feel any publicity at all would make him look good

san diego , oct 20 the day before the playoffs began , david cone was asked to pick one yankee who might shine in the postseason scott brosius , cone replied , adding , he s got that glint in his eye and so he does brosius , who hit a home run in game 6 of the american league championship series , slugged two more in game 3 of the world series tonight , including a threerun shot in the eighth inning that gave the yankees a 54 victory over san diego in the first series game here in 14 years the homer also gave the yankees a commanding lead of three games to none in the fourofsevengame series no team has ever come back from that deficit to win the final four games of a world series the yankees' andy pettitte will try to finish the padres off tonight , pitching against san diego s ace , kevin brown , in an effort to nail down the yankees' 24th world series title and second in three seasons a victory would give the yankees 125 in the regular season and postseason , more than any team ever this is the type of thing that you 've dreamt about as a kid , brosius said i 've done this in my backyard a hundred times but this was the first time in the world series , with 64 , 667 fans screaming at him , hoping he would fail , hoping the padres would hang on to to a 32 lead in the eighth inning and give them a chance to even the series in game 4 on wednesday the yankees had been fighting uphill all night , it seemed cone started and had not allowed a hit in the first five innings , but he acknowledged later that he had been laboring cone managed to find a way , somehow between innings tonight , cone would throw his first warmup tosses lightly , stiffly , like a 10yearold trying to throw a snowball while wearing three sweaters and a parka in the winter with the long commercial delays between innings , most pitchers throw 12 to 15 warmups cone rarely threw one or two more warmups beyond the typical allotment of eight his stuff seemed quite ordinary , his first fastballs clocked at 8788 miles an hour , and cone seemed unable to command his fastballs consistently he threw only 53 percent of his pitches for strikes after tony gwynn s first atbat , in which he lined out to left field , he returned to the dugout and told the padres' hitting coach , merv rettenmund , that cone did not have a good fastball , and rettenmund agreed in a scoreless game , cone led off the yankees' sixth with his third hit in eight career atbats in the world series , and the yankees eventually had the bases loaded and one out against sterling hitchcock but bernie williams struck out and tino martinez popped out , ending the inning after having spent a halfinning running the bases , cone allowed a leadoff single to hitchcock turnabout and a walk to quilvio veras , the key to the inning , cone would say later gwynn pulled a single through the right side , and when the inning was over , san diego led , 30 but brosius led off the yankee seventh with a home run , spurring a tworun rally that had the yankees trailing by 32 in the eighth inning , with san diego intent on delivering a lead into the hands of its dominating closer , trevor hoffman with the lefthandedhitting paul o'neill leading off the eighth for the yankees , padres manager bruce bochy elected to start the inning with lefthander randy myers on the mound myers walked o'neill , putting the tying run on base , and bochy then called for hoffman , who converted 53 of 54 save opportunities and had allowed only two home runs during the regular season the qualcomm stadium crowd roared , the loudest that yankees manager joe torre said he had ever heard from a crowd , anywhere , any time but it was apparent immediately that hoffman , who had not thrown in a game in six days , was pitching at less than his best typically , hoffman throws a fastball at 9294 mph his first fastball to bernie williams tonight was clocked at 88 mph , and williams drove a pitch to the base of the wall in right field , where it was caught , a 355foot out when williams returned to the dugout , he mentioned to teammates he was out in front of hoffman s fastball , and word was passed down the line with martinez batting , hoffman began pitching passively , throwing his slider and his changeup , and martinez also drew a walk dave stewart , san diego s pitching coach , went to the mound from the stands , yankee scouts noticed that hoffman was n't throwing his changeup for strikes , as he usually does brosius was the next batter , having already got another late briefing from the hitting coach chris chambliss his changeup is his best pitch , chambliss reminded brosius changeup , fastball brosius could n't remember for sure , but he thought he had faced hoffman in this year s allstar game his arm packed in ice , cone stood in the middle of the visitors' clubhouse in the eighth inning and watched brosius bat on television tonight , like the rest of the world two runners on base , the yankees down a run brosius tried checking his swing unsuccessfully on the first pitch , a ball in the dirt , then took two more offspeed pitches for balls later , hoffman would lament the fact that he had thrown a slider out of the strike zone and fallen behind in the count hoffman threw a fastball , 89 mph , and brosius fouled it off hoffman came back at him with another fastball , 91 mph brosius swung , and on the television screen cone watched , the ball soared directly toward the lens oh , my , cone said he was thinking , is that going to make it the yankees' players leaped off their bench , to follow the ball s flight go , go , some yelled , as san diego center fielder steve finley ran back to the wall , hoffman staring at the numbers on the back of his jersey when the ball carried over the fence , brosius thrust both arms into air halfway between first and second , and some yankees bounced happily and highfived san diego scored a run in the bottom of the eighth , shaving the lead to 54 , and backtoback singles gave them two out and two on in the ninth inning , with the tying run at third , potential winning run at first but mariano rivera blew a high fastball past the swinging andy sheets to end the game on a strikeout , and the yankees burst from their dugout once more , rushing to hug rivera , and brosius , with the glint in his eye one hundred and twentyfour down one to go inside pitch world series ratings reached a twogame low as fans are apparently turned off by the yankees' dominance after the first two games , both won by the yankees , fox had a 125 national rating , the

hattiesburg , miss , may 28 thirtytwo years after molotov cocktails lighted up a frosty mississippi night , the authorities here arrested three aging klansmen today and revived charges against them in the 1966 killing of vernon f dahmer sr , one of this state s most revered civil rights leaders one defendant rousted from his home early today was sam h bowers , the founder and former imperial wizard of the white knights of the ku klux klan , an organization that the federal authorities have linked to 10 killings and hundreds of other violent acts in the civil rights era mr bowers , a 73yearold businessman from nearby laurel , miss , served six years in prison after his conviction on federal charges in a separate set of civil rights slayings , the 1964 deaths of michael schwerner , andrew goodman and james chaney in philadelphia , miss but juries deadlocked in each of mr bowers s four trials in the dahmer case , where he faced charges of ordering , but not participating in , the firebombing that killed mr dahmer this time , said the mississippi attorney general , mike moore , is going to be different the dahmer \( pronounced daymer \) case marks the second time in this decade that mississippi prosecutors have used new evidence to resurrect longdormant charges in a highprofile civil rights slaying in 1994 , prosecutors in jackson overcame the burdens of stale evidence and constitutional questions to convict byron de la beckwith in the 1963 assassination of the naacp leader medgar evers as in the dahmer case , allwhite juries had deadlocked in mr beckwith s previous trials , leading to mistrials mr dahmer s family took hope from that prosecution , and pressured state and county officials to reopen the investigation of his death they did so in 1991 , and today mr dahmer s widow , ellie j dahmer , found some satisfaction as she watched on television as mr bowers was led , handcuffed and expressionless , into the forrest county jail at last , they 're bringing him into court again , at last , said mrs dahmer , who says she still sees the flames and hears the screams of her 10yearold daughter in her nightmares it s bringing us one step closer i realize we 've got a long way to go , but mississippians are stepping up and not following the old pattern mr moore also emphasized at a news conference today that a conviction in the dahmer case would signify how mississippi had changed these people have kept hope alive all these years , the attorney general said of the dahmers we 're going to try to keep it alive a little bit longer and bring the imperial wizard of the ku klux klan to justice we think that s going to send a signal to the rest of the country mr bowers and the other men arrested today , deavours nix , 72 , and charles r noble , 55 , all of whom had been previously charged in the case , were led into the county jail this morning , where they were processed in full view of television cameras mr nix , who is suffering from cancer , said radiation treatments had burned his lungs , leading prosecutors to observe that mr dahmer had died from a similar condition while judge richard w mckenzie of circuit court released mr nix on his own recognizance because of his medical condition , he ordered mr bowers and mr noble held on 200 , 000 bond both mr bowers and mr noble are charged with murder and arson , while mr nix is charged with arson alone the judge set mr bowers s trial for aug 17 the last of mr bowers s trials concluded in 1969 now , nearly three decades later , prosecutors say they have new evidence that they believe will force him to spend the rest of his life behind bars they declined today to detail that evidence but vernon f dahmer jr , one of mr dahmer s sons , said today that the most important new evidence came from a confidential informant who approached the dahmers last year the witness , he said , is a former protege of mr bowers , a teenager at the time of the killing , who has said he overheard mr bowers and mr nix discussing the plot to bomb the dahmers' house prosecutors now also have access to three interviews granted by mr bowers to state archives officials in 1983 and 1984 on the condition that they be sealed until after his death despite that agreement , prosecutors subpoenaed the transcripts , and a judge here recently ordered that they be handed over to investigators it is not known whether mr bowers confessed in the interviews to any role in the dahmer case prosecutors also viewed files on mr dahmer from the mississippi state sovereignty commission , a state agency that used spy tactics and intimidation to thwart desegregation efforts the commission s files , which were unsealed in march , make it clear that mr dahmer was under extensive surveillance , but there has been no public disclosure of documents from the files that shed new light on his death i can tell you that we do have new evidence , said mr moore , who has directed the new investigation with lindsay carter , the forrest county district attorney we have new light to shed on evidence , maybe new witnesses
washington , july 30 prosecutors are seeking genetic testing of a dress belonging to monica s lewinsky that she says contains physical evidence of a sexual encounter with president clinton , lawyers close to the case say ms lewinsky turned the dress over to the office of the whitewater independent counsel , kenneth w starr , on wednesday , lawyers said it had been kept for the past several months in the new york apartment of ms lewinsky s mother , marcia lewis , putting her in jeopardy of an obstructionofjustice charge for concealing evidence that prosecutors had sought in a search of ms lewinsky s watergate apartment this year ms lewinsky and ms lewis were given sweeping grants of immunity from prosecution this week in exchange for providing full accounts of ms lewinsky s relationship with the president they also agreed to turn over evidence , including the dress and answering machine tapes containing messages to ms lewinsky from the president , the lawyers said the messages were innocuous , said a lawyer who had heard them in one , just before christmas last year , the president told ms lewinsky that the brother of his private secretary , betty currie , had died in another , the lawyer said , mr clinton said hey , it s me sorry i missed you ms lewinsky met for several hours with prosecutors at an undisclosed location this afternoon in preparation for her grand jury testimony , which could begin as early as next week the president has maintained a resolute silence on the lewinsky matter since late january , when he vehemently denied having had a sexual relationship with ms lewinsky and said he had not told anyone to lie under oath the president s decision to submit to questioning , which was announced on wednesday , came after numerous requests from mr starr over several months , culminating in a subpoena issued on july 17 many of the president s advisers urged him to resist or ignore the subpoena , but he decided that giving testimony now was the quickest way to conclude the investigation but even though the grand jury will hear mr clinton s testimony two weeks from monday , there is no sign that the president is prepared to speak publicly on the matter much depends on what ms lewinsky tells the grand jury when she testifies and whether other testimony and physical evidence backs her up ms lewinsky s dress is expected to be sent to an fbi forensics laboratory for dna testing to determine whether there is a stain containing mr clinton s semen , as lawyers familiar with the case say that ms lewinsky has asserted mr clinton made no reference to the lewinsky matter on a trip to north carolina today , ignoring shouted questions and not addressing the issue in a speech on the environment or later at a political fundraising dinner michael d mccurry , the white house press secretary said the president was scheduled to make an announcement on the economy on friday in the rose garden and might take questions from reporters , who would almost certainly ask about the revelations of the past several days but mr mccurry said mr clinton had no intention of speaking to the press or the american public in any detail in the next two weeks about his relationship with ms lewinsky or about any of the other questions arising from the monthslong perjury and obstructionofjustice investigation being conducted by mr starr we 've all talked about it , mr mccurry said he clearly has to testify and he has to stay focused on that until we know what the testimony is , none of us is in a position to give advice on what he should say publicly prosecutors first learned of the existence of a dress that might be evidence in the case from tape recordings surreptitiously made by linda r tripp of conversations with ms lewinsky , a lawyer with knowledge of the tapes said today it is not known whether ms lewinsky laundered the dress before sending it to her mother if semen is found on the dress , prosecutors would then probably seek a saliva or blood sample from the president to determine if the dna matched the tests are extremely reliable , said prosecutors and defense lawyers who use dna testing in trials such a stain would retain dna material for many years , unless the dress had been cleaned with detergents , said experts in dna testing dry cleaning alone would not remove it , nor would storage under poor conditions , they said with modern instruments and computers , matching could also be completed in a matter of days , said barry c scheck , a prominent new york defense lawyer and an expert on genetic testing he served as a consultant for the defense in the o j simpson murder case if there is no sperm on the dress , that s the end of the hysteria , mr scheck said if there is , there is no legal basis for the president to resist giving a dna sample , a simple swab from the inside his cheek to keep the results secret until mr clinton s aug 17 testimony to set a perjury trap for the president would be unfair to mr clinton and bad for the nation , mr scheck said mr starr , stung by accusations that his office had disclosed sensitive grand jury material to news organizations , issued a twosentence statement today with ms lewinsky s lawyers denying that members of his staff were the source of news accounts this week about ms lewinsky s proposed testimony it was reported this week that ms lewinsky told members of the independent counsel s office that she had had a sexual relationship with mr clinton it was also disclosed that ms lewinsky was willing to testify that she and mr clinton had agreed that they would deny the relationship to keep it private the procession of witnesses before the grand jury continued today , with seven secret service officers appearing before two separate panels at the federal courthouse mr starr has sought the officers' testimony to determine whether or when mr clinton and ms lewinsky were alone together in the white house on capitol hill , representative henry j hyde , chairman of the house judiciary committee , said the panel was as prepared as we ever will be should there be an impeachment inquiry based on a report from mr starr but in a sign that the committee did not expect a report this month , officials began approving vacations for staff members for august mr hyde said the house was not bound by mr starr s report , and he added that the judiciary committee might decide to obtain evidence itself
in an unusual and pointed rebuke of his own child welfare officials , mayor rudolph w giuliani criticized the city s administration for children s services yesterday for allowing two foster children to return to their natural parents , who were later arrested on charges of raping and sodomizing them mr giuliani reserved his sharpest criticism for a family court judge and officials at a private foster care agency who first approved the return of the two teenage girls but his reprimand of the administration for children s services was striking because the mayor is usually a passionate cheerleader for the agency he created two years ago to protect new york city s most vulnerable children the mayor acknowledged yesterday that he is rarely critical of his new agency , but he said it was crucial to learn from the mistakes highlighted by the disturbing case he said the entire system had failed the two girls , who the police say were repeatedly sexually abused at home by their parents , uncles and a family friend and he accused the judge , nora freeman , the city s lawyers and social workers of buying into what he described as a flawed liberal philosophy that emphasizes keeping troubled families together child welfare officials , who removed the girls from a filthy apartment in brooklyn , said they thought the girls would be safe at home if their parents received counseling , and help from a professional housekeeper known as a homemaker mr giuliani said they were wrong the recommendation by acs to the judge should have been not to return the children at all , mr giuliani said it was a wrong decision by the social service agency to urge the children be returned it was a wrong decision by the judge to return the children and the acs should not have fallen into the trap that a homemaker somehow was going to solve this problem i think everybody bears responsibility here , mr giuliani said i think they were all wrong the girls' parents , daniel robacker and theresa fremgen , and ms fremgen s exboyfriend and two brothers were arraigned on thursday on charges of raping and sodomizing the two sisters and an 8yearold boy , who had once lived in the brooklyn apartment leonora wiener , a spokeswoman for the administration for children s services , declined to comment on mr giuliani s remarks , which he made during a question and answer session with reporters she said child welfare officials were poring over records and interviewing workers , and could not discuss the case until the inquiry was complete she also declined to comment on mr giuliani s sharp attack on the use of counseling and other services to help neglectful or abusive parents keep their children in the past , nicholas scoppetta , the commissioner of the administration for children s services , has also said caseworkers must err on the side of safety , placing children in foster care whenever their lives or health seem to be at risk but mr scoppetta has also vigorously supported the need for more dollars for counseling , drug rehabilitation and other services for troubled families , and this year the city increased spending on such services by 27 percent , the largest increase in recent years noting that about 75 percent of foster children ultimately return to their parents , mr scoppetta has repeatedly emphasized the importance of offering services to keep them safe there such services will play a critical role in the city s multimilliondollar effort to overhaul the child welfare system by offering neighborhoodbased counseling , health care and foster care to abused and neglected children and their families mr giuliani , however , used the sex abuse case to highlight how such efforts can fail in july 1997 , when someone reported the family s filthy brooklyn apartment to the state s child abuse telephone line , child welfare workers decided to keep the household together by offering intensive counseling services when that failed , the two girls and an 8yearold friend of the family , who lived with them , were placed in foster care when the girls returned home three weeks later , child welfare workers offered mental health services and a professional housekeeper to their parents mr giuliani said yesterday that the children never should have gone home as far as i'm concerned , there is a philosophy that has run through the courts and some of the social workers about reunifying families that s unrealistic , mr giuliani said let s stop working out of an ideology of reunifying families at the expense of children , he said the reality is that some families in some situations are so dysfunctional that you 're taking a grave risk with the safety of the children when you return children but in this case , it seems that neither the judge nor officials at the private foster care agency or at the administration for children s services ever knew how dysfunctional the family was and serious questions remain about whether the family was ever properly assessed to determine whether they were even good candidates for athome services child welfare records indicate that ms fremgen , 35 , was abused or neglected when she was a teenager , a serious risk factor in child welfare cases her aunt , helen robacker , said she was raped by a relative when she was 15 caseworkers are required to seek out such information about the parents they monitor , since all too often such experiences increase the risk of abuse to children living in the household but none of the psychological evaluations of ms fremgen , which were conducted by the city in 1994 and by a citycontracted agency in 1997 , mention or assess the severity or impact of that abuse moreover , one of the sisters , a 14yearold , and the 8yearold boy each had more than 18 unexplained absences from school this year , which is often an indicator of trouble at home both missed about 17 days of school as they made the transition into foster care but even after their lives stabilized , the girl missed 33 more school days and the boy missed 19 and it is unclear whether city caseworkers ever investigated those absences they say they had no hint that the children were being raped or sodomized a city caseworker , assigned to see the girls twice a month , never saw signs of sexual abuse , child welfare officials have said the parents were never accused of sexual assault no one , it seems , ever thought the children were in danger the house was filthy , cluttered with garbage and animal feces mr giuliani said this was reason enough to keep the children in foster care court records , however , indicated that ms fremgen was mildly mentally retarded mr robacker , her companion and first cousin , dropped out of school in the fourth grade and had the reading skills of a 7yearold and city officials believed that the pair could function as parents if they had help a psychological evaluation of the couple found they had borderline intellectual functioning with adequate parenting capacity and in 1997 , when a psychologist assessed the family for the last time , the city decided the family needed only a little help to manage the last evaluation of mr robacker describes him as a gentle man with great dedication toward his entire family

from his old friend , chris webber has received the following advice regarding his trade to the sacramento kings , a team he is reportedly not overjoyed about playing for show up , suit up and shut up that is our own paraphrased version , but jimmy king , webber s university of michigan teammate when they were both one of five and life was fab , had the right idea i told him that to fight the trade would make him look like what people already think of him , a troublemaker , king said with all that s gone on off the court , this should be a wakeup call just go play that would likewise have been prudent advice to the rest of the conscientious objectors from the national basketball association who would not serve uncle david stern s country club in athens at the world championships , in the face of a lockout so instead of the likes of webber and company , the united states went to battle yesterday with the antidream team , with players from the european leagues and the basketball bushes , with jimmy king of the quad city thunder we 're not the dream team , king said by telephone before the united states waxed brazil , 8359 , in its firstround opener , but we can still play the american game at the goodwill games in new york last week , a bunch of unheralded college underclassmen gamely stormed back from an early loss to puerto rico to win the gold medal the most heartening aspect of the tournament was its competitive honesty , in contrast to the typical nba dunkandpony shows the michaelmagiclarry original dream team was really the only one worth the hype , the time , or a ticket if there is any justice , the potluck dinner coach rudy tomjanovich whipped up from these nba leftovers will leave a pleasant aftertaste , and people will realize we do n't need the nba to win , or at least contend do n't count on that , though , because the whole world would apparently rather watch scripted celebrity blowouts , including america s leading print journals , which pulled their basketball correspondents when the nba players dropped out usa basketball canceled its nbc and turner television plans , belatedly selling a few united states games to espn2 promoting itself as a basketball hotbed , greece for years lobbied for international competitions like the world games , but they began yesterday with pitiful crowds including one of 500 for the united statesbrazil game in an 18 , 000seat arena after the absence of the american team , expectations are not so good , said vassilis skountis of the greek federation organizers with no stake in the collective bargaining conflict banked on the nba players , and got stiffed patrick ewing , the union president , cited the nba s incestuous relationship with usa basketball , making a strong case but missing the salient point the muchcriticized generation of players soon to inherit michael jordan s league could have made their own public service announcement that it is n't always about the money but , of course , it is how can these players be so oblivious to the notion that how marketable they are is directly related to how likable they are \?

san diego , sept 15 the pressure was on the chicago cubs and sammy sosa tonight the cubs had a chance to take the lead on the mets , who split a doubleheader with the houston astros , and sosa found himself trailing in the home run chase as mark mcgwire hit no 63 but while sosa did not homer for the second straight game , it was his single to lead off the seventh inning that helped spark a fourrun rally off starter kevin brown that helped the cubs gain a 42 victory over san diego and gain a halfgame lead on the mets in the wildcard chase mark grace followed sosa s single with his careerhigh 17th home run to give the cubs a 21 lead my situation is that i got to 62 and i'm happy with that , sosa said refusing to compare himself with mcgwire , he said my situation is different i have to take the chicago cubs to the playoffs sosa s saga continued in front of 37 , 995 fans at qualcomm stadium hitting in the third position tonight instead of his customary no 4 slot , sosa went 1 for 4 to make him 1 for 8 over the last two nights nevertheless , sosa stepped to the plate in the first inning to a thunderous standing ovation it did not seem to matter that sosa trailed again in the home run chase the crowd remained standing as the umpire received specially marked balls from the bat boy for sosa s atbat and the crowd remained standing when sosa tapped weakly back to brown his next time up , in the fourth inning , sosa worked the count to 31 before hitting brown s next pitch up the middle , but second baseman quilvio veras backhanded it , pivoted , and threw out sosa to end the inning on the play , part of the handle of sosa s bat broke off , forcing him to use a new bat his next time up in his last two atbats , sosa struck out swinging in the eighth inning against brian boehringer and struck out looking in the ninth against scott sanders perhaps it was just as well , because something had been clearly amiss for sosa after catching mcgwire at 62 with two home runs on sunday , and then giving that bat to the baseball hall of fame , sosa had barely even made contact since he struck out four times monday i do n't know , but i wish i would have had it last night , sosa said of his old bat before tonight s game when you feel comfortable with a bat , you feel comfortable in yourself added billy williams , chicago s dugout coach i think for sammy , like other players , it s a superstitious kind of thing it made him comfortable for all those home runs , so he did n't want to give it up but if anyone wondered whether he had a meticulous process with which he chose his bats , sosa said i do n't have time for that i just pick one it s nothing special the fact that sosa is so haphazard about choosing his weapon is clearly different from mcgwire , who keeps his bats specially wrapped and does not let anyone else touch them but sosa s teammates are none too surprised at his batchoosing methods sammy has the same style that we all have about our bats , said third baseman gary gaetti he uses my bats , glenallen hill s bats , whatever it does n't matter to him as long as the bat works right fielder tony gwynn of the padres , who has 2 , 915 career hits , feels the same way a bat is a bat , gwynn said all my bats are exactly the same this year , every time i get a hit , my owner requests the bat because i'm going for 3 , 000 hits when this year is over , i'm never giving one again when you get a good bat , you do n't want to give it up photo sammy sosa has not hit a home run since sending the baseball hall of fame the bat he used to strike his 61st and 62d of the season on sunday \( associated press \)
washington , dec 19 following are excerpts from the final day of debate on the articles of impeachment against president clinton , as recorded by the federal news service , a private transcription agency barbara lee democrat of california i rise to strongly oppose these articles of impeachment and this very flawed and undemocratic process this process and this action are the real crimes against the american people and our democracy this march to impeachment is an attempt to undo and overthrow a duly elected president and ignores the will of the people denying a vote on censure creates the appearance of a oneparty autocracy , which we condemn abroad , and which history has proven can lead to authoritarian rule this republican party coup underscores that their only goal is to turn back the clock on an agenda that puts people first , an agenda that will want to cancel policies that value and support basic human rights , such as a woman s right to choose , a good public education instead of vouchers , that insist on a living wage for working men and women , that protects our environment , that supports a patient s bill of rights and that preserves social security the republican process is cynical and it s dangerous it will be recorded that they stood on the wrong side of history we must restore the public trust and establish a congress which communicates respect for the people of the united states , the constitution and democracy lindsey o graham republican of south carolina ladies and gentlemen , this long and difficult process for all of us in the house is almost to conclusion twentyfive years ago , a democraticcontrolled judiciary committee , with a minority of republicans , reported articles of impeachment against richard nixon why \? nixon cheated he cheated the electoral system by concealing efforts of a political breakin , and his people thought the other side deserved to be cheated they thought his enemies deserved to be mistreated ladies and gentlemen , they were wrong today , republicans , with a small handful of democrats , will vote to impeach president clinton why \? because we believe he committed crimes resulting in cheating our legal system we believe he lied under oath numerous times , that he tampered with evidence , that he conspired to present false testimony to a court of law we believe he assaulted our legal system in every way let it be said that any president who cheats our institutions shall be impeached jose e serrano democrat of new york it s a tough time to follow , but i must stay the course and be true to myself the republican right wing in this country does n't like it when we say coup d'etat , so i 'll make it easier for them golpe de estado that s spanish for overthrowing a government from day one , they wanted to get rid of bill clinton from day one they stood on him and tried to make him out to be the no 1 villain in this country they 've been blinded by hate then , and they 're blinded by hate today this place is full of hate , because of what they tried to do to our president my constituents do n't hate bill clinton they love him and they 're praying for him right at this very moment you may have the votes today to impeach him , but you do n't have the american people and let me tell you something , i grew up in the public housing projects of the south bronx i can see a bunch of bullies when i see them the bullies get theirs , and you 're going to get yours , too the people are going to rise up , from california to new york they 're going to rise up from texas to florida everywhere in this country , and they 're going to tell you , do n't do this to him ! and by the way , do n't ask him to quit bill clinton will never quit christopher shays republican of connecticut after judge starr s report to congress in september , and his presentation to the judiciary committee in november , i concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven , and that the proven offenses were not impeachable but the president s continued failure to come to grips with his actions , the sincerity and arguments of members of the judiciary committee from both sides of the aisle , the change of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally opposed impeachment and who now support it , and the strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who wanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position like you , i listened to my constituents those who supported impeachment and those opposed it i revisited the evidence , reexamined the documents , and even looked at documents that i had not seen earlier i spoke to people who were truly experts on these issues , people who i have immense respect for yesterday morning , before i visited with the president , i concluded that my original position was the correct one , for me i believe that the impeachable offenses have not been proven , and that the proven offenses are not impeachable , but they are close , and that s why i understand why members who happen to be primarily democrats concluded that the president should not be impeached , and members on my side of the aisle , primarily republicans who believed he should be impeached with no exception , i truly believe that every member of congress , of this institution , is voting his or her conscience

mountain view , calif , may 22 the netscape communications corporation has done a lot of crowing in the last week it announced it had won a big contract to supply citibank with software for electronic commerce it outlined details of its new strategy to turn itself into a webbased information service in competition with america online and yahoo and , oh yes , the justice department and 20 states filed antitrust suits against its archrival , the microsoft corporation the lawsuits , if successful , could significantly help netscape over the long run , company officials acknowledge despite that , and despite years of complaining that microsoft was competing unfairly , netscape officials greeted the filing of the lawsuits with studied indifference the government lawsuit , is not an asset or liability of the company , james l barksdale , netscape s president and chief executive , said today in his first interview since the suits were filed monday we 're off to many other bigger things right now the stock market reaction was also subdued netscape shares fell 6875 cents on the day the suits were filed part of the reason for caution is that it is not yet clear whether or what the government will win and how long it will take the suit could take months , if not longer , said michael k parekh , an analyst at goldman , sachs but netscape , the onetime internet superstar that has fallen on hard times , needs to move faster than that to right its business , he and others said there is also a complex politics of perception at work netscape officials do not want to be perceived as whiners , mr barksdale said that would play into microsoft s contention that the lawsuits will not help consumers but will merely bail out a handful of competitors that cannot hold their own in the marketplace the justice department s suit seems highly focused on what it says are microsoft s attempts to use its nearmonopoly in computer operating systems to promote its internet explorer web browser at the expense of netscape s navigator as a remedy , justice wants microsoft to either stop bundling its browser with windows or include navigator netscape and the justice department say the suit looks at netscape s plight only as a case study of broader practices by microsoft still , the perception is spreading that netscape needs the government there is an increasing perception in silicon valley that netscape is the computer equivalent of a welfare mother , totally dependent on government intervention , said roger b mcnamee , general partner of integral capital partners , an investment group in menlo park , calif that could make the company complacent when , he said , its destiny is actually in its own hands an even more unfavorable perception , raised in numerous industry publications , is that netscape might not be able to survive on its own calling attention to a government lawsuit that quotes a microsoft executive vowing to cut off the air supply to netscape could scare off big corporate customers , which are generally reluctant to depend on software from a company they fear will not be around for the long haul the justice lawsuit is good for us from a factual standpoint , marc andreessen , the company s cofounder and technology guru , said in an interview at the company s silicon valley headquarters from a perception standpoint , it s as much negative as positive to some extent , netscape sympathizers say , the federal suit s focus on the browser business is too late it is like the police responding to a report of a robbery in progress two years late , after the property is long gone that is because to maintain its market share , netscape began giving its browser away in january , killing what had been a 180 million business in 1996 i do n't have any browser business , said mr barksdale , who tends to talk about the company in the first person it was half my revenues a year ago it s none now the company now has two businesses one , with revenues of about 100 million a quarter , is selling software that allows corporations to manage their web sites and internal operations the other business , with revenues of about 25 million a quarter , is to sell advertising and services on its web site the justice department suit will not restore the lost browser revenues netscape could file a private antitrust suit against microsoft seeking damages but says it has no plans to do that at this point it takes a lot of resources time , money and energy said roberta katz , the company s general counsel still , some of this playing down of the justice department suit is a bit disingenuous netscape did its share of complaining against microsoft and hired its share of highpowered lobbyists and lawyers and while it might not get revenues directly from its browser , the product is still key to its business browser share is a very significant strategic issue , not necessarily a monetary issue , said marc s usem , an analyst with salomon smith barney this is particularly true in netscape s effort to make its home page into a portal , a jumpingoff point to the web , providing everything from news to job listings to financial services netscape s site , called netcenter , is one of the three busiest web sites along with those of america online and yahoo , which are already well established as portals with such traffic , netscape can sell advertising and charge fees to companies that want to provide services on its site but a substantial chunk of netcenter s traffic comes from the fact that 50 percent of the 70 million users of its browser use netcenter as their home page by default so getting its browser bundled with windows could provide a huge boost

comets creators and destroyers by david h levy illustrated 256 pp new york touchstone simon schuster paper , 12 it will be this summer s cinematic disaster du jour hollywood is now launching a barrage of comets and asteroids on movie theater screens across the country if viewers' interests are piqued \( or if their nerves need soothing \) , comets is a handy digest to put these celestial visitors into perspective it would be hard to find a writer better suited to the task david h levy has been the discoverer or codiscoverer of 21 of them , including comet shoemakerlevy 9 , the series of icy chunks that crashed into jupiter so spectacularly four years ago but as a former graduate student in english literature , levy is also able to transform his scientific facts into a charming and accessible story his book is liberally sprinkled with personal accounts , historical anecdotes and literary references from john keats to j d salinger his telescope , a 16inch reflector , is named miranda , for the shakespeare character who spoke of a brave new world comets have been an obsession for levy since childhood , starting with a sixthgrade assignment that s when he learned a comet was a mileswide blackened snowball , a conglomeration of ices mixed with dustlike particles some have short periods , like comet encke , which returns every three and a third years others have a looser tether to the sun , like comet halebopp , which appeared last year and will travel entirely out of the solar system before returning in a few thousand years to glow once again as it is bathed by the sun s radiation levy has lost none of his childhood wonder he describes his vocation as the world s slowest sport , in which scores are measured not in afternoons but in lifetimes he began searching in 1965 and spent more than 900 hours at his telescope before finding his first comet 19 years later so what keeps him and others coming back , to what seems like a wearying endeavor \? for some it is the chance to inscribe their name on a sliver of the universe for me , levy answers , comet hunting is a field of dreams but it helps , he adds , to have the perseverance of an arctic explorer , the heart of a poet and the patience of job when facing the nighttime wind and cold over the centuries , humanity has experienced a lovehate relationship with comets at first , comets were feared as omens of doom it was counted significant that one showed up in 44 bc , the year julius caesar was assassinated the british astronomer edmond halley at last demystified them when , calculating from newton s laws of gravity , he confidently predicted that a comet he had seen in 1682 would reappear in 1758 it did comets , he showed us , are simply planetoids in constant , if eccentric , orbit around the sun more recently , though , comets have been reclaiming their old reputation , ever since evidence emerged that 65 million years ago some form of monstrous meteor slammed into earth off the coast of yucatan with the force of 100 million hydrogen bombs whatever it was , it gouged out a crater 100 miles wide and 25 miles deep , spewing out enough debris to darken the planet for decades and kill the dinosaurs no wonder hollywood is taking note yet there was a silver lining to the devastation it gave mammals the opportunity to rule the world comets and asteroids may be mere specks solar system trash but levy aptly demonstrates that this debris has decidedly affected our lives , starting five billion years ago earth s tilt is probably due to the impact of a large object at its birth , giving us the seasons another collision by a marssized planetesimal tore enough material out of our planet to forge the moon meanwhile , a continual hail of smaller comets provided earth with both water and organic building blocks hubble telescope observations of halebopp showed the comet shedding nine tons of water each second comets were multitudinous eons ago now they lurk either in a disk beyond the orbit of pluto \( which is actually an oversize comet \) or in a halo farther out called the oort cloud jupiter was the housekeeper it acted as a gravitational vacuum cleaner , either sweeping the comets outward or consuming them comet shoemakerlevy was just the latest example , and levy explains how it was discovered almost by accident , during a fitful survey on a badweather night what resulted was a scramble to put together the largest telescope armada ever assembled in the history of astronomy to observe a single event , he writes here was the dress rehearsal for what will \( not may \) happen to earth in the future levy weaves a haunting tale of what would occur if a comet like shoemakerlevy , with its 21 separate pieces , made a direct hit what s most disturbing is reading that comets are rarely found more than a year before they enter our terrestrial neighborhood we 'd have little warning given our current level of technology , there would be nothing we could do to prevent an impact changing the orbit of a 10milewide comet hurtling toward us at a high velocity is , one scientist insists , like trying to move a tank with a popgun , levy notes we have a better chance of keeping tabs on \( and maybe even altering \) the paths of asteroids , a failed planet s rocky remains that continually crisscross the inner solar system comets was obviously not written to be a definitive reference work its level and pace are most appropriate to interested newcomers who want a quick overview on topics ranging from mars rocks to shooting stars shooting stars , by the way , are really pieces of comet dust , each no bigger than a grain of beach sand , left behind in a comet s trail when earth crosses that wake , these particles vaporize in a streak of light levy reports that a spectacular show , as many as 150 , 000 meteors per hour , will take place on nov 17 , 1999 , when earth travels through the litter left by comet tempeltuttle this year those who are lucky enough to witness the spectacle , he writes , will get a glimpse of what the earth was like during its primordial age as cometary debris rains out of the sky , the remnants of destruction and creation of life will light up the sky just as they did at the dawn of life on earth readers will be convinced that comets are far more than illuminated shuttlecocks that occasionally cross the heavens homo sapiens might not have evolved without them
london an athleticlooking dane , with blond hair , blue eyes and an arrest warrant for armed robbery , hires a british arms dealer with a walter mitty complex in latvia , they buy a russian cargo plane and have it flown to bulgaria where it is loaded with 77 cases of weapons , including 300 assault rifles , ammunition , pistols , hand grenades and rocket launchers the lumbering plane then heads east to india when it gets over the village of purulia , near calcutta , the weapons are shoved out , drifting down under parachute rigging purchased in south africa the deal is financed out of hong kong the intended recipient is a violent religious sect however fictional it might sound , this was a reallife arms shipment , one that reveals the circuitous measures terrorists and rebel groups employ to get weapons , and how relatively easy it is for them to do so it also illustrates the almost complete lack of international controls on the smallarms trade in oslo on monday , the united states and 20 other governments opened a meeting to discuss measures to deal with the spread of assault rifles , pistols , grenades and other socalled small arms generally it is not a crime for a weapons dealer to get around the armscontrol laws of his country by having the weapons shipped from another country it s a huge loophole , said geraldine o'callaghan , an analyst at the british american security information council , an independent group that lobbies on smallarms issues it needs to be addressed urgently in the united states , the clinton administration closed this loophole two years ago by giving the state department greater authority to monitor and regulate arms brokers as a result , american arms dealers are now subject to the same laws whether they are shipping weapons directly from the united states or brokering deals abroad the administration is pushing other countries to adopt similar controls britain plans to address this , but only in part , by preventing arms dealers from selling weapons to countries on which the united nations has arms embargoes while weapons falling from the sky is downright bizarre , the other elements of this tale typify a blackmarket smallarms transaction you have deals like this being brokered on all continents of the world every day , said donald manross , an american who is the director of the firearms and explosives division at interpol , the international police group that is still investigating the purulia deal , which occurred in late 1995 it is easier for the blackmarket trade to flourish because even legal transactions are highly secret to protect the commercial interests of businesses , most governments , including the united states , do not disclose information about licenses issued to arms exporters also , the document that governments rely on to control the destination of weapons , the socalled enduser certificate , can be easily forged , and a dealer has no legal responsibility to check on the validity of this certificate before shipping the weapons rebel groups and terrorists use phony enduser certificates in order to disguise where the weapons will wind up britain has tough export controls , but in this sale to the indian religious sect , none of the arms touched british soil and no british documents were involved thus , while the british arms broker , peter von kalksteinbleach , languishes in a calcutta jail on charges of waging war against india his plane was grounded by indian authorities in bombay when the deal went sour he does not appear to have violated any laws in britain where he was based nor is the other british armstrading company , border technology and innovations ltd , which arranged for the weapons to be bought and shipped from bulgaria , accused of any crime mr bleach has pleaded not guilty in india to 12 counts , all of which carry the death sentence the deal began in the summer of 1995 when mr bleach heard from a german commodities trader that a danish businessman wanted to buy weapons like many arms traders , mr bleach , now 47 , has a military background and colorful resume after serving in the british army , he was a prison guard in what was then whiteruled rhodesia he returned to britain as a private investigator and later took up commodities trading , including arms deals his company , aeroserve , has a license from the british defense ministry he s a walter mitty character , and a bit of a lady s man , said christopher hudson , who met mr bleach 15 years ago in the course of their political activities in the tory party mr hudson , who is engaged in a campaign to save mr bleach from hanging , likes to call mr bleach the milk tray man it is a reference to an advertisement popular in britain in the 1970 s , where a dashing man in a black polo shirt jumps out of planes and helicopters and braves sharkinfested waters or other dangers to deliver a lady her cadbury s chocolates for the purulia deal , mr bleach showed up in amsterdam to meet a short man with a big adam s apple , contact lenses and sunken cheeks , who introduced himself as kim davy mr bleach also met with mr davy , and his lawyer , at the business center of the intercontinental hotel in central london
uniondale , ny , march 12 two trades different owners now , a new coach there have been many changes made on long island this season , but none has inspired the islanders general manager mike milbury , who made his season debut as coach tonight , had the islanders looking like a different team but in the end , the look was all that was different despite milbury s radical changes , the islanders lost by 21 to the washington capitals at the nassau coliseum in milbury s second day back on the job , he scrambled the lines and defensive pairs he used a trap he played bryan berard , one of the most talented offensive defensemen in the league , on left wing with zigmund palffy and bryan smolinski we have nothing to lose by trying some different things , said milbury , who speculated after the game that the team may be out of shape so we 're going to keep on trying them for the first nine minutes , milbury s changes were effective the trap was working the new lines and defensive pairs looked good berard scored his first goal since dec 29 on a giveandgo from palffy , and the islanders led by 10 at 7 minutes 19 seconds of the first period but the capitals' peter bondra , who scored both of his team s goals tonight , put one in shorthanded moments later to tie the game , 11 the capitals were no longer tricked by milbury s illusions berard has played wing before , on the united states olympic team in nagano , japan , last month and once as punishment for neglecting his defensive duties while milbury was the coach early last season i do n't plan on staying up there , berard said bondra s second goal , his 41st of the season , came on a drive from the point early in the second period the islanders goalie tommy salo was screened by defenseman scott lachance with tonight s loss , the islanders , who were 0 for 9 on the power play , remained 9 points behind the ottawa senators for the eighth and final playoff spot in the eastern conference how many games do we have left \? berard asked eighteen \? that s a lot of points to make up slap shots rick bowness spoke to reporters thursday for the first time since he was dismissed wednesday bowness , who survived a 10game losing streak earlier this season , said he was surprised by the timing of general manager mike milbury s decision we went 642 the last 12 games and took 5 of 8 points from the flyers , colorado and the sabres , bowness said it s a better team than it was in december bowness said he had no immediate plans i'm going to get away from coaching for bit , he said jj daigneault separated his right shoulder in the second period and did not return robert reichel played in his 500th national hockey league game photo mike milbury , in debut last night as islanders coach , looking over his team in 21 home ice loss to the capitals \( barton silverman the new york times \)
tokyo , july 14 as japan chooses a new prime minister , the procedure somewhat resembles a traditional village market in which hawkers bargain over their wares , in this case their favorite candidates to run the world s second largest economy then again , a marketplace is open and anyone can see what is going on the liberal democratic party has announced that on july 21 it will select its new president who will then become prime minister so the party s factions are bustling about with secret meetings and tense negotiations yet so far , none of the contenders have actually announced their interest in the prime minister s job , because it is considered poor manners for a political aspirant to step forward on his own the betterbred pretend to be pushed the key figures in choosing the country s next leader are the elders of the party factions , which , to make things murkier , were officially abandoned a few years ago and technically no longer exist these kingmakers , like former prime minister noboru takeshita and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone , rarely say much in public but command great influence in the negotiations it s an underground process of sounding people out and building a consensus , explained keizo takemi , a liberal democrat member of parliament it s not clearcut decisionmaking , but it s very effective for the japanese people still , the shadowy nature of the selection process creates a quandary for the liberal democrats party officials like mr takemi believe that the behindthescenes activity is necessary , but they also worry that it may anger voters and voter anger is on people s minds these days , since it is the reason why the prime minister s job is available prime minister ryutaro hashimoto was forced to resign on monday after voters gave the party a drubbing in parliamentary elections the main complaints of the voters were economic mismanagement and the kind of oldstyle politicking that the party now plans to employ to pick mr hashimoto s replacement but party members worry that the appearance of conflict could lead to more problems than ever if we try to make it more open , that will bring about confusion in the markets , mr takemi said to avoid bringing about serious confusion in the currency markets , which could bring about confusion in all the asian markets , we must be very careful to avoid conflicts the new party leader will be chosen by the liberal democratic members of parliament , but the key maneuverings are not by individuals but by the factions or former factions as they are sometimes called all but about 26 of the 366 liberal democrats in parliament belong to one of the five factions since the faction members normally vote as a block , that gives enormous power to the faction leaders mr takeshita is the godfather of the largest faction , with 91 members , mr nakasone heads another with 61 members , and former prime minister kiichi miyazawa reigns over another with 82 members these behindthescenes leaders are often called japan s shadow shoguns , and they wield incomparably more power over the country than former presidents do in the united states but politicians , scholars and political journalists also say that the importance of the factions and faction leaders is waning there s not much to this idea of them as shadow shoguns , said an aide to one of the former prime ministers but it is true that they have long experience in parliament up to 50 years and that that gives them considerable influence there s also some effect from confucianism and its respect for seniority , the aide said but it s changing they have much less authority than they did 10 years ago one reason why the faction leaders seem to have lost influence is that public funds are now given to parties as a whole a result is that the coffers of each faction are far less important in winning influence mr takeshita is perhaps the most influential of the shadow shoguns , constantly holding meetings in his home to help formulate national policy , but even he is more of a backstage manipulator and sage than a secret dictator takeshita does n't have to exert his influence so much , said yoshibumi wakamiya , the political editor of the asahi shimbun , japan s most respected newspaper but his experience and political expertise are highly rated , and so he is often consulted by politicians the factions are not based on ideology or policy , and a politician joins one or the other simply because even now they are mechanisms to allocate cabinet posts and other prizes , as well as some campaign funds likewise , the party elders traditionally negotiated not so much policy as political issues , like who would get which cabinet post still , the elders have played some role in

a pirate looks at fifty by jimmy buffett 458 pp new york random house 2495 are you a parrothead \? if so , you may love this book if not and especially if you do n't even know what a parrothead is a pirate looks at fifty requires some background jimmy buffett is a rock star , and a terrific lyricist his songs include the barroom classics \( wastin' away again in \) margaritaville and cheeseburger in paradise , not to mention my head hurts , my feet stink and i do n't love jesus his books of fiction , tales from margaritaville and where is joe merchant \? , were both best sellers he is known , it says on this new book s jacket , to have some of the most devoted fans in the music industry viz , the parrotheads in a pirate looks at fifty , buffett takes the occasion of his 50th birthday to tell us about himself , and he does so with candor and modesty the person who emerges is not the sort of rock star who trashes hotel rooms and slugs paparazzi , but a charming , decent , wry , kind and contemplative man if it were n't for those millions of parrotheads , however , i would be very surprised if this book could ever have been published among the number of bookish conventions with which a pirate looks at fifty seems to have dispensed are continuity , structure and editing what makes it a book are the configuration \( cover , pages , etc \) , the quantity of verbiage , the celebrity of the author and not much else there is no story as such buffett goes on vacation with his family \( in not one but two private airplanes my citation ii jet was too small \) he reminisces and on his trusty laptop he records whatever crosses his mind , apparently in whatever order it crosses and no matter how trivial he spends three pages shopping for a backpack he discourses at length on his deep commitment to unpacking , even for short stays he shares his observations we find ourselves in the middle of the crowded dining room full of vacationing families he remembers a thing , and then another thing , which reminds him of something else this is a particular surprise coming from a songwriter whose densely rhymed lyrics are models of economy and structural strength in the course of a few paragraphs we jump from javier the costa rican bellhop in 1997 to a teacher of french in mississippi in the 1960 s to a french film producer s chateau in 1974 to the island of st bart s in 1976 occasions linked only by buffet s embarrassment at not speaking foreign languages well my writing style , he tells us , is a rather unrefined stream of consciousness and how although buffett has renounced recreational drugs , as a young man , we read , he had quite an enthusiasm for them , and the narrative vividly portrays the runon selffascination of cocaine and the whydoyouthinktheycallitdope dissociations of marijuana coke seems to make the most banal events take on subeffable deep meanings pot reinforces that sense of nonspecific significance , but then you forget what it was that was so important that you were talking about it in this narrative , everything seems to be of about the same importance we chat while the crew unloads the bags costa rica has a thriving and varied economy , also an overabundance of natural resources the trip from the front desk of the hotel to our room the night before had been an adventure all its own , sorting through a confusing system of floor and room numbers the friend who recommended costa rica works at stuart surfboards in laguna beach the tone stays similarly colorless most of the time , but every so often the superior position of the author peeks through we are all citizens of the world you 'd better come to terms with that concept or get ready to spend your life behind a fastfood counter parrotheads may not mind such advice they may not mind crashing through thickets of cliches my lovely wife , the winds of fate , the rest is history , the hills and valleys of my life journey , in my family and friends i have discovered treasure more valuable than gold a dart flung onto the bestseller list at random , after all , has favorable odds of nailing equally wellwrought english there are many book lovers whose fun such language does not spoil complaining about it makes me feel rather the fussbudget , like the sniffy interior decorator who is the only guest at the party to notice how ugly the curtains are and wo n't shut up about it a pirate looks at fifty is , in fact , a party of a kind , and the birthday boy is a very nice guy he loves his airplanes and his children and his work he credits his success , which is truly immense , to luck he tells some fine anecdotes , the best of them set in the days when the shy exaltarboy from alabama was playing street corners and discovering the kind of work i not only wanted to do , but was best at performing buffett s evocation of the languid , louche key west of the 1970 s draws on the same well of affection as his best songs his reconciliation with his father , as the hardcrusted old man fades into the shapeless fog of alzheimer s , is compassionate and courageous buffett writes that he has been detained by customs , stripsearched and bribed by various law enforcement agencies , shot at by a swat team while i went to lunch , chased by apache helicopters , but he tells us none of those stories i would particularly have liked to hear how the cops bribed him , but that one did n't make the cut in writing a book of reminiscences like this , you always hit the high points and wonderful stories that make for good reading buffet s idea of a high point and wonderful story , then , would be \( for example \) the one about being delayed for more than five hours in the airport at barranquilla , colombia he gets so hungry he is reduced to eating peanutbutter crackers he is rescued from starvation by a bureaucrat named barbarella in a lime green seethrough blouse and a white miniskirt there are flies in the restaurant , and it smells it also serves the worst club sandwich in the world faithful parrotheads may be fascinated by this sort of thing a really , really faithful parrothead may not even mind like a thunderstorm cloud out over the gulf , the bottom fell out of my dreams
bob wartinger , the speedboat driver from seattle known as the fastest man in outboards , once owned more trophies than he knew what to do with but that was before he thought about recycling them we loaded up several stationwagons full of trophies , he said in a recent telephone interview i gave them all away except the national ones we hauled them off to a trophy company the money we got went to an adult softball league that my family supports it was something , seeing those cars filled up now the 53yearold wartinger regularly donates his prizes to children who compete in junior speedboat classes and the habit is very likely to continue with 99 national and world records to his credit , wartinger is about to become the first person in speedboat history to hit the 100record mark several of us in the sport have had a lot of wins , said steve david , president of the american power boat association but none of us have had that number of wins bob is a tremendous engineer who is very analytical , but very outgoing as well he understands the hydrodynamics of boats he s the real thing the 100th record could come as early as today wartinger plans to compete this weekend in a twoday race at silver lake in eatonville , wash the air s cool , and the engines like it , he said it s the best time to set records he will be driving a 10foot hydroplane with a 30horsepower yamato engine on a straightaway , the boat is capable of 70 miles an hour on the competition course , which is a threequartermile oval , the average speed to beat is 55021 mph over four laps a key strategy is to cross the start line at full throttle but if he is more than a few inches over early , a video camera will pick up the error and disqualify him if you cross the start line at 50 miles an hour , your first lap will be slow , wartinger said , and you 've probably blown the record with a master s degree from the university of washington in aeronautics and astronautics , wartinger took a job at boeing in 1969 he is now a senior program manager for advanced systems but in his free time , he has another life practicing yoga and teaching adult courses in ayurveda , an ancient holistic discipline from india his background makes wartinger an enigma in a sport where machismo is as much a part of winning as turning over the engine he is softspoken , dedicated and driven it took four years of testing before wartinger would attempt the run that has brought him the most notoriety the 176556mph outboard speed record set in november 1989 on the colorado river in parker , ariz wartinger s 20foot hydroplane ran with a modified 500horsepower evinrude v8 outboard engine no one has come close to matching its performance since then even wartinger has not tried the toughest records are your old records , because you already did your best , he said so in racing , i do n't find a lot of multiple record setters of the 99 records he has set since 1971 , 22 are still standing wartinger grew up in the pacific northwest , where he remembers pulling a toy boat by a string behind his bicycle the way other children fly kites as a teenager , he built his first boat it was an eightfoot hydroplane that he saw pictured in an issue of popular science magazine i 've always felt it was a lot more fun in smaller boats because it s better competition , he said trying to explain his success , he added the way i deal with it is competency i do n't believe i 'll win every race i 'd like to , so there s a time when you take a calculated risk i decide if i can drive into that certain corner , or whether i have to go outside it s a matter of driving to the limits of your equipment
cupid and diana by christina bartolomeo 222 pp new york scribner 22 the recent slew of books by and about single women in their 30 s animal husbandry , by laura zigman , and bridget jones s diary , by helen fielding , to name just two present female protagonists with simple goals they must snag a man \( since a woman is unworthy without one \) , but because men are duplicitous , they seldom accomplish their goals the emphasis on holy matrimony is hardly original stories of striving , seduction and betrayal are as old as adam and eve man may be fallen , these authors want us to know , but woman is blameless it s old whine in new bottles female readers may identify with parts of christina bartolomeo s first novel , cupid and diana , but this is the story of one woman , not everywoman , and that s all for the good although bartolomeo , 36 , has written another tale of infidelity , the unfaithful here is our narrator , diana campanella a woman all the cheaters in this book are women and none of the men are evil along with her conflicted , twotiming heart , diana in a refreshing turn also has a brain the subtitle on the dust jacket , a novel about finding the right man , the right career and the right outfit , does n't do diana s inner life justice her thoughts are provoking and wry the book , which is set in washington \( although this is not a washington novel \) , has two main emotional triangles the first involves diana , her fiance , philip , a lawyer and wealthy senator s son , and harry , whom she meets at a family party separated from his wife , harry is a charming pro bono advocate for the poor he listens to tom waits , loves chinese food and tumbles into bed with diana repeatedly philip , the underdog , is overcritical and selfabsorbed , but the lure of familiarity and security with him along with harry s reticence about his feelings keeps diana twisting in indecision in another triangle of sorts , diana acts as unwilling intermediary between her younger sister , cynthia , a lingerie catalogue model who s quasiengaged to a soap opera star , and her older sister , francesca , a devout roman catholic mother who s duty bound to her three strapping boys and to her aging , widower father \( the alcoholic mother died young \) not surprisingly , the naked mannequin and the religious housewife do n't get along bartolomeo s diana is a work of tiny details instead of broad strokes owner of a troubled consignment clothing store , she admires buttons , stitching , tailoring and the memories that occupy vintage pieces although she has lots of sex in satisfyingly explicit scenes , she is n't out to confirm her desirability or to hook a man sex , for her , is a means of connection and orgasm not necessarily in that order diana , in short , is a fully realized woman she has a past full of love and sadness that shapes her present and future and her job is not just some plot accouterment she can take or leave diana loves her nearbankrupt consignment store and equates having to return to her bland and benign former government job with death she avoids that defeat although her two romances dissolve , one after the other , she directs the full force of her energy and heart into the business work gave me a deep solid pleasure that depended on no other single human being , she observes when she sees that the store is beginning to thrive , she knew , as samuel butler said , that love is only one of the many passions yes , she momentarily blows it in love , but instead of acting like a sulky teenager , diana , to her benefit and the reader s , pays attention to the years after harry leaves her , she observes there s something you learn once you 're over 30 you learn that surviving is a matter of putting time between you and what hurt you , that time makes you stronger and tougher in spite of yourself the novel ends happily , which is not revealing too much although the conclusion is perhaps a little too pat , i wo n't say if happily means with a man or not it s the delight of this book that one could imagine diana being happy either way
moscow , may 1 the traditional may day holiday might seem to be the sort of occasion that would mobilize russian opinion against nato s decision to take in three of moscow s former satellites but the united states senate s vote to approve nato expansion drew a collective yawn today the big stories on the evening news were a surge in fighting in tajikistan , the kidnapping of president boris n yeltsin s envoy to chechnya and the formation of the new government the senate s vote to approve the admission of poland , hungary and the czech republic was mentioned , but only in passing the kremlin did not bother to comment in short , russians have stubbornly refused to live up to the caricature foisted on them by some western commentators embittered nationalists ready to lash out at the west at the first opportunity none of this means that russians are enthusiastic about nato s move to extend its boundaries to the east for many russians , nato enlargement is part of a broader pattern in which washington has been deaf to moscow s concerns and sought to take advantage of russia during its period of weakness as was the case with missile strikes against iraq , the administration prefers to act first and then figure out to do with the results , said sergei morozov , a correspondent in the united states for the ntv television network the vote has also forced washington to expend political capital that might have been directed at dealing with other americanrussian issues , like arms control but the russian response has been more modulated than many western critics of the move suggest russia s foreign policy elite has been opposed but nato blunted that opposition by negotiating an agreement that gives russia a voice though not a veto in the alliance s decisions , and moscow seems to have reconciled itself to a bigger nato russia s politically influential business executives and bankers , for their part , have not been interested in settling scores over nato they are more interested in raising capital in the west for investment at home and in developing foreign markets for russian oil and gas their biggest worry is not nato s embrace of eastern europe it is the effect of falling oil prices on russian exporters and the unease western investors have over emerging markets , an unease sharpened by the downturn in southeast asia much of the russian public is too consumed with the daily economic grind to care like many americans , russians have turned inward since the end of the cold war russia s biggest challenges are the payment of back wages , tax reform and other social and economic concerns , not foreign policy public opinion surveys have shown that half of those polled are indifferent about nato enlargement those that have a view , however , tend to be negative the temperate russian response minimizes the risk that a populist could rise to power on a tidal wave of antiamerican sentiment the notion that the west will lose russia over nato has always been overdrawn nor does expansion mean that washington will necessarily have to forfeit russian approval of the start2 treaty to reduce nuclear arms the russian military has lined up behind start2 because its strategic arsenal will continue to shrink anyway , and the treaty will limit american arms , too the communists say they will put up a determined fight when the start2 treaty is put to a parliamentare vote , but this probably has more to do with russian politics than with nato expansion having been humiliated by parliament s approval of president yeltsin s new prime minister , sergei kiriyenko , the communists are looking for a way to show they are not a spent political force there is one important caveat russia has drawn the line at nato s inclusion of the baltic states , lithuania , latvia and estonia their membership would stir up a hornet s nest of official and popular criticism but there was little visible anxiety today the first of may is the start of a fourday weekend , and a vast majority of moscovites avoided the communist marches and speechmaking to head for their dachas and the capital s first few days of balmy weather
ocala , fla , march 26 dennis g madonna , a 39yearold general contractor from pennsylvania , walked around horse stalls at the ocala breeders' sales company here this week with a trainer and two veterinarians in tow tired of losing money with four racehorses , he came to an auction of thoroughbreds determined to find a winner , if not of the kentucky derby , at least highstakes races it s more entertainment than it is a business , but it s also a business , mr madonna said minutes after successfully bidding 37 , 000 for an unnamed brown filly and 27 , 000 for star one one , another filly i do n't like to lose the twoday auction that ended on wednesday was one of several held throughout the year in this central florida city that is one of the world s largest horsebreeding areas and the heart of florida s thoroughbred industry although florida is better known for citrus than horses , its 600 farms breeding and training thoroughbreds employ 29 , 000 people , generate 1 billion for the state s annual economy and produce more than 3 , 300 horses a year , which puts florida second to kentucky in the production of registered thoroughbred foals in the nation kentucky produces more than 7 , 000 thoroughbreds a year the auction of selected 2yearolds , thoroughbreds screened for both pedigree and physicality , attracts buyers from all over the world , young and retired , poor and rich , experienced and novices , all in search of the dream they took their places in an amphitheater where each horse was paraded on a crescent stage , bringing bids as high as 500 , 000 on wednesday mike h sherman , who is president of farnsworth farms in ocala and who races his own horses , is one of the most successful breeders we have the dream , mr sherman said the kentucky derby , the breeders' cup , to have a horse like cigar or secretariat to win fame , glory and money this week , 183 million was spent on 288 horses by buyers , some looking for that dream , others for simply getting a competitive horse that would at least earn more than it cost the average sales price was 63 , 000 , but dreams can also come cheap silver charm , winner of the 1997 kentucky derby and preakness stakes , sold here two years ago for 17 , 000 and so far has earned more than 2 million in prize money owners typically take 60 percent of the purse money , with most of the rest going to the jockey and the trainer millions more can be earned in breeding fees after the thoroughbred is retired from racing but the potential of such immense profit is set against enormous risk , with the worst being injury breeders like bob noble , manager of ocala stud farms , one of the oldest farms in the area , says that for every story like silver charm there are others where people just pay bills that was not the case of rick kaster , a home builder in wisconsin who was picking horses here with the aid of a bloodstock consultant hoping to strike gold again mr kaster said he and three partners spent 85 , 000 on the mare that was pregnant with countess diana , the 1 million breeders' cup juvenile fillies champion last november now , mare and brood are worth more than 6 million realistically , they 're still going to be rare , mr kaster said of such champions , but if we work right we 'll have another and then another we 'll find another one the auction also drew buyers like mauro porcelli , 29 , a local firefighter and paramedic who said he realized barely an hour into the bidding that he would have to return next year with more than the 15 , 000 he had planned to spend mr porcelli said he wanted to invest 50 , 000 on both a horse and its firstyear upkeep , looking for a business adventure you have the potential of making a lot of money and it looks like a lot of fun , mr porcelli said i 'd rather spend 50 , 000 on horses than in the stock market mr porcelli said his wife , a bank vice president , thinks i'm an idiot but she supports me although florida breeders acknowledge that kentucky still offers the best blood stock in the industry , mr noble and others say environmental advantages here a limestonerich soil that nurtures strong bones and a warm climate that allows horses to spend more time outside exercising have helped develop an athletic horse that can outrun its pedigree florida , where thoroughbred breeding and training began in the 1930 s , produces about 10 percent of the country s thoroughbred foals , but they win 20 percent of the major races , said the florida thoroughbred breeders' and owners' association kentucky produces about 25 percent and the rest come from about 30 states so buyers here look not just for bloodline , but things like muscularity , personality , even attitude , in a greatly subjective process that relies as much on intuition as expertise a 2yearold , the age when a horse can start racing , also allows buyers to see the horse work out none of the horses have raced competitively before they are sold after all the work , mr kaster said , you still have to get lucky mr madonna , for whom owning racehorses was a sentimental incursion that goes back to the trips to the racetrack with his father , is determined to work at being lucky he pays about 2 , 200 a month in boarding , training and veterinarian fees for each of his four thoroughbreds and is still far from recouping his investment recently , he decided on some changes that he hoped would help reverse his fortunes he switched to a trainer with a solid winning record and started buying betterquality horses at this auction i'm trying to do everything right , he said , but you can still go wrong in addition to having the best trainers , blood stock and advice , buyers say they need a plan mr kaster said his strategy was to know what it took to buy a good horse and then try to find them as young horses when they are still affordable others note that even the best horse can be doomed in the wrong hands if the person does n't have the wherewithal to take it all the way he 'll probably destroy that horse before it gets to a stakes , max hugel , a former central intelligence agency official who owns the rockingham park racetrack in new hampshire , said referring to the uppertier races i can tell you that most owners have a hard time making money in this business , but they love it that is because nothing , owners say , compares to the thrill of victory watching your horse cross the finish line first you have to feel , mr madonna said it s like your kid when i win a race i take videos of it and i watch the race two months after mr kaster , remembering countess diana s victory , said , it s like having a football team and winning the super bowl photos buyers spent 183 million on 288 thoroughbreds at a twoday auction

i had an unusual interview the other day it was with dejair birschner , the 48yearold mayor of una , a town of 32 , 000 inhabitants on the edge of brazil s atlantic rain forest the mayor , along with a team of conservationists , took me on a tour of the rain forest ecopark near una that is supposed to provide jobs so his people wo n't strip the forest bare and destroy one of the world s great ecosystems mayor birschner says he understands that logging is not sustainable anymore he knows the environmentalists have a point but he also knows that his town really is n't prepared for life without logging after our interview , the mayor startled me by saying now , i want to ask you something do we have any future \? it was a powerful question i adlibbed something about the need to move from an agroeconomy to a more knowledgebased economy , by better educating his town s children the mayor listened , thanked me and left i asked our translator to ask him privately what he thought of my answer the translator reported back that the mayor wanted me to know that when he gets to the office every morning he has 200 people waiting for him , asking for jobs and food plus outofwork loggers threatening his life if he ca n't provide them jobs , they will cut the trees and sell them to buy food whether it s good for the rain forest or not mayor birschner represents a whole generation of people around the world today who are trapped in a no man s land , between the computer generation that their kids , if they 're lucky , might get up to speed for and their parents' generation that enjoyed a stable existence from logging and farming i knew what he was saying in his question my villagers ca n't live off the forest anymore , and we 're not equipped to live off computers what are we supposed to do \? hightech entrepreneurs like to compare today s supercompetitive economy to the old story about the lion and the gazelle in the jungle every night the lion goes to sleep knowing that in the morning , when the sun comes up , if it ca n't outrun the slowest gazelle , the lion will go hungry every night the gazelle goes to sleep knowing that when the sun comes up , if it ca n't outrun the fastest lion , it s dead meat but the one thing they both know is that in the morning , they better start running well , not everyone is equipped to run so fast there are a lot of turtles out there trying to avoid becoming roadkill on the information highway they are the villagers in una , the pensioners in russia , the unemployed in china , indonesia , south korea and thailand the turtles represent the real threat to the stability of this whole movement toward hightech , freemarket , global capitalism analysts have been wondering for a while now whether those left behind by globalization will develop an alternative ideology to liberal , freemarket capitalism in the first era of globalization , before world war i , when faced with the brutality of global capitalism , people thought that communism , socialism and central planning were the answer but those ideas are now bankrupt i do n't think there will be an alternative ideology this time around there are none the turtles who ca n't keep up will just eat the rain forest each in his own way , without trying to explain it or justify it that is , if governments do n't develop safety nets for the leftbehinds , to protect them from hitting bottom and to help lift them into the game , they will make their own safety nets in brazil , they will log the rest of the rain forest or they will join the peasant movement in the brazilian countryside called semteto those without roofs who simply steal what they need in indonesia , they will eat the chinese merchants , by ransacking their stores in russia , they will sell weapons to iran or turn to crime this is not what the turtles want there was a big street protest in rio de janeiro two weeks ago against the privatization of the state telephone company , telebras the brazilian newspaper o globo asked one of the demonstrators why he had come , and he said they told me if i came i might get a job the poor guy was n't against the privatization he just wanted a share with all due respect to 1960 s revolutionary ideology , the wretched of the earth want to go to disney world , not to the barricades if they 're given half a chance if not , they will eat their rain forest , whatever it might be

letters of heinrich and thomas mann , 19001949 edited by hans wysling translated by don reneau , with additional translations by richard winston and clara winston foreword by anthony heilbut illustrated 444 pp berkeley university of california press 50 there are several ways for correspondences to capture interest if the epistolarians provide insight into their otherwise hidden lives if they purvey titillating revelations about others \( sometimes called gossip \) if they chronicle in detail a happy or unhappy love affair or marriage if they are literary professionals who put their finest writing into letters though that is a parlous virtue , since we tend to suspect whoring with posterity rather than faithfulness to truth letters of heinrich and thomas mann , 19001949 abounds in none of these still , if the correspondents are brothers and writers one of them major , the other not inconsiderable who sometimes relish , sometimes resent and even boycott each other , the reader s prospects are good and if these brothers live through half a century of political and cultural upheavals , including two world wars , the rise of communism and nazism , and the coming of modernism in the arts , better yet in most respects , heinrich \( 18711950 \) and thomas \( 18751955 \) mann were as different as brothers could be they grew up in lubeck , scions of a respected hanseatic burgher family , though their mother was atypically half brazilian there were three further siblings viktor , who felt slighted , but left us an absorbing family memoir carla , the bohemian actress , a favorite of heinrich , who ended up a young suicide and lula , beloved of thomas , a respectable married bourgeoise and middleaged suicide suicide was big in this family the novelist klaus , thomas s homosexual son , was also to take his life both brothers wrote long and short fiction , essays , criticism , drama and even some poetry in their youth they read each other and exchanged views of their writing heinrich was a prolific , popular , worldly socialsexualsatirical novelist thomas , who became a literary giant , was more psychological , metaphysical , symbolist , more painstaking and highbrow his interest in his elder brother s work was seldom free from slightly patronizing irony , mixed with envy of heinrich s facility heinrich , despite protestations to the contrary , must have yearned for his younger brother s worldclass status , even as he deplored his pomposity , indeed priggishness heinrich was a bohemian and a womanizer , the lover of many an alluring actress the solid citizen thomas married the first girl he fancied , katja pringsheim , from a highly educated jewish family underneath , he was homosexual , which only his posthumously published journals made generally known heinrich first married the actress maria kanova , who , years after their divorce , died of the consequences of five years in a nazi concentration camp his second wife was nelly kroger , a hamburg barmaid 30 years his junior , whom the inlaws never fully accepted heinrich would refer to her as frau kroger , as in this 1939 letter to thomas i can help frau kroger regain her health , if i marry her after 10 years , not all of which were easy , she has come to richly deserve it i had hesitated primarily until my daughter was married now it seems that her marriage was an unhappy one , but that must not be allowed to affect frau kroger curious business , but no more so than that katja and heinrich , to the very end , addressed each other by the formal sie equally strange is a 1905 letter thomas wrote after his first child , erika , was born he would have preferred a boy a son is more poetic , more of a continuation , a new beginning of myself but he found consolation perhaps the daughter will offer me a closer relationship to the 'other' sex , of which i still , though now a husband , actually know nothing one wonders if even two more daughters quite bridged that gap the brothers were farthest apart politically heinrich was a nonmarxist communist , albeit one who enjoyed the good life in italy and france , which he considered his spiritual home thomas , who was shaped by russian and northern literature , was the conservative uppercrust german , but he prided himself on his exotic mother even while trying , unlike heinrich , to curb his unconventional leanings during world war i , though he considered himself above the fray , he was for germany , while heinrich sided with the entente between the wars , heinrich was fiercely antinazi from the outset , left germany early and settled in the south of france by 1933 , thomas also left , but settled in germanspeaking switzerland , and did not make his final denunciation of the despised nazis until 1937 both manns ended up in los angeles , half an hour s drive apart if , as thomas noted , the lights were favorable but in other respects they were less close by then , thomas was an affluent writer , winner of the nobel prize in literature , and an important cultural and political figure the relatively obscure heinrich , known chiefly as the author of the novel on which the movie the blue angel was based , was an unemployed screenwriter living humiliatingly off his brother s charity
ormond beach , fla , july 4 for the last three weeks , george colombis has left the volusia county correctional facility to work 10hour shifts around the perimeter of wildfires today , he and a crew of 20 other inmates raked and shoveled , turning the ground over in the back woods of an expensive housing complex here to make sure a forest that steamed like a boiling pot did not erupt in flames

facility at night and thank god for a good day and that nobody got hurt mr colombis was part of the allfronts attack by more than 5 , 000 firefighters and others to tame the fires that have ravaged northeastern florida for weeks the effort , which has cost more than 100 million , showed results today , with fires contained in some areas but the authorities said at least 87 fires were still burning , primarily in five counties along the northeastern coast gov lawton chiles , reviewing the fire fighting effort in palm coast in flagler county , said , today we 're fighting the fires yesterday we were running from the fires favorable winds , high humidity and even rain combined over the last 24 hours to calm the fires a little , said greg thayer , a spokesman for the florida emergency operations center in tallahassee , although the rain did n't contain anything or put fires out while the forecast called for thunderstorms and light rain , officials said shifts in wind also threatened to spread the fires to populated areas as long as drought conditions remained we 'd be foolish to think everything is fine and we 're making headway , said raymond yeakley , a fire spokesman for volusia county , where 11 fires remained today of the 69 that raged a few days ago any unburned areas have the potential of burning many volusia county evacuees were allowed to return home today in osceola county late today , several small brush fires merged into one fire stretching over 12 miles but did not threaten any homes , county emergency center officials said three fires

tanker planes capable of holding more than 2 , 000 gallons of water dump water and fire retardant on areas flagged by spotter planes the fire retardant , with a red dye so pilots can see where previous drops have fallen , can slow the advance of a fire so that ground crews can get closer to the flames to lay fire lines , fire officials said on the ground , crews of about 20 firefighters each are going deep into the woods to cut trees and open a path or fire lines , breaks where the flames have nothing to burn the job is laborintensive and uses bulldozers and hand tools to circle a blaze and let it burn itself out as the fires threatened populated areas this week , more crews were deployed around structures and beside roads to fend off the blaze here in volusia county , where the fires have consumed more than 120 , 000 acres of pine and wild land and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents , the fourth of july passed with none of the fireworks , concerts

postponed until october even walt disney world canceled its fireworks displays the only thing to celebrate on independence day , many residents said , was that the flames have not killed anyone mr thayer of the emergency operations center in tallahassee said that the winds , blowing from east to west , were aiding the fire fighting effort by bringing ocean moisture into the fire areas if the winds were to shift around and blow from west to east , flagler county would be in trouble , mr thayer said fire today invaded five blocks into one flagler county community , palm coast , about 25 miles north of daytona beach mr thayer said that firefighters were able to set up fire breaks around residences , and only three homes were lost in the largely evacuated city of bunnell , about five

they may not be wonderful role models , but they are wonderful roles consider how many great american plays revolve around spiritcrushing mothers and fathers amanda wingfield , the smothering succubus of the glass menagerie willy loman , the wholesale disappointment of death of a salesman mary and james tyrone , the blighted egoists of long day s journey into night even george and martha , the childless vipers of who s afraid of virginia woolf \? fit the bill , if only metaphorically , killing off the baby they never had the track record is mighty impressive bad parents make good theater even when they are not cloaked in malicious black and wearing handlebar mustaches , bad parents are dramatically satisfying conveyances , the tormentors of that figure of universal sympathy , the innocent child contemporary theater has no shortage of such victims some of the bestreceived dramas in new york of late , works like how i learned to drive , side man and the beauty queen of leenane , carry on the tradition , unleashing toxic parents or their surrogates on children who variously end up chastened , bitterly wounded or homicidally inclined quantity is one indicator of just how popular the theme remains with younger writers the last two weeks , for instance , have seen the openings of four off broadway plays that in various ways peer into the cracks in relations between parents and children unfortunately this quartet , though stylistically diverse from earnest drama \( 'til the rapture comes and hesh \) to surrealistic satire \( vegetable love \) and situation comedy \( over the river and through the woods \) reveals the pitfalls for playwrights stepping onto such familiar terrain none of the plays says anything compellingly new about a subject that should provoke and incite after all , the topic is not only reliable grist for the stage but also one we compulsively dissect every day of our lives true to the tradition , however , the best parts continue to go to the bad guys pamela paytonwright , as the manic , pillpopping mother of edward napier s 'til the rapture comes at the wpa theater , and ned eisenberg , portraying a bigmouth , ne'erdowell father in matthew weiss s hesh at the intar , exude the negative charisma the roles call for their takecharge performances as the squeaky wheels in their houses are subversively effective manipulating spouses and children pleading for forgiveness as they stumble toward the next outrage , they provide fleetingly entertaining moments their motives and failings are transparent in ways that allow us to gloat from a safe distance mr napier s play , set in west virginia in 1974 , is a homage of sorts to the great domestic tragedies of the past the situation , presumptuously , is a carbon of long day s journey here as in o'neill are an addicted mother , a brokenspirited father \( richard poe \) , a pair of damaged sons \( jase blankfort and zach shaffer \) and a family housekeeper \( cynthia darlow \) the drama , directed with a sense of time and place but with little emotional consistency by pamela berlin \( steel magnolias \) , follows the struggle of althea \( ms paytonwright \) to right herself after a siege of seconal abuse that has left her a ravaged shell of a wife and mother the effect on her children has been traumatic ian , the younger son , played by mr blankfort , substitutes love and hope with a kneejerk religious fanaticism , while willy \( mr shaffer \) is on his way to an adolescence of drinking and drugging if the ingredients are obvious , so is the fallout accusations are traded a bit of domestic violence is committed a father walks out disconsolately the problems are recognizable and even made to seem understandable but this is an opaque portrait of an american household that is never really allowed to get under the family s skin , or ours more troublesome still is hesh presented by naked angels , an off broadway company that nurtured early versions of such marvelously nuanced plays as this is our youth , this new , selfimportant family drama by mr weiss is notable only for mr eisenberg s comic turn as the title character in a weird example of art imitating life , mr weiss and his brother , marcus , portray the two sons in hesh , which the playwright has said is modeled on the brothers' relationship with their father oddly enough , they are not particularly convincing hesh is selfindulgent and condescending unintentionally , it seems , it s a revenge play mr weiss practices here the theater of blame , the sort that suggests , ridiculously , that all of one s disappointments can be traced to a careless father hesh is a lomanesque loser , a failure at such basic duties as earning a living or providing moral support what s missing is any sense of why attention must be paid a couple of intriguing introductory scenes lay out the distressing patterns of hesh s life , but the play , directed by frank pugliese , is chiefly concerned with the whining sammy s childish irritation with the older man the playwright charts sammy s descent into drug abuse and listlessness , culminating in a numbing , amphetaminefueled tirade to his dying father on a beach in rockaway the speech leaves the audience pretty much where it walked in although 'til the rapture comes and hesh provide the showier parental roles , the divergent family comedies that opened recently are richer experiences in the absurdist vegetable love at the 29th street rep , maternal love is such a volatile force that , like an overfertilized garden , its power is suffocating tim farrell s imaginative production of tammy ryan s convoluted play , featuring an incisive performance by paula ewin as a toughtalking daughter of the borough of queens , begins in archie bunker territory and ends somewhere beyond the world of rod serling tomatoes grow with wild abundance in the basement of a queens home , nourished by the ashes of a recently deceased patriarch , while babies gestate in the wombs of three grown sisters and their late middleaged mother , without visible means of impregnation unfortunately , the play fails to develop a meaningful narrative it might be an interesting conceit for a oneact comedy , but it is unworkable in two elongated acts joe dipietro , on the other hand , has no interest in confusing , surprising or provoking anyone his over the river and through the woods , the story of a 30ish , unmarried italianamerican man and his four adorable grandparents , is unadulterated corn a lot of italian food is prepared by grandma aida \( joan copeland \) , but the dramatic fare is as spiceless as ketchup the unseen parents of the play s hero , nick cristano \( jim bracchitta \) are retired and living in florida , so whether they were good or bad childraisers seems a moot point still , with fantasy grandparents like aida and frank \( val avery \) and emma and nunzio \( marie lillo and dick latessa \) how could they have been anything but perfect , too \? over the river , which could have transferred to the stage directly from channel 2 or 4 , is every bit as manipulative as hesh there were a lot of sobs and sniffles in the audience of the john houseman theater at a recent matinee , as nick , struggling for independence from the overbearing grandfolks , made the hard choice to move to seattle and leave them behind thanks to terrific work by the entire cast , especially mr avery and mr latessa , these sentimental characters actually carry some weight too bad the nastiest act they can muster is

miami , sept 14 eight men and two women were charged today with spying for the cuban government by trying , sometimes successfully , to infiltrate american military sites and cuban exile organizations officials with the federal bureau of investigation and the united states attorney s office here said national security was never compromised but the officials described a sophisticated operation led by three men they believe to be members of the cuban security forces the suspects sought to report on the operation of american military installations , political and humanitarian activity by groups opposed to president fidel castro of cuba and on american government and law enforcement , the officials said a criminal complaint charging the 10 said the group , operating since 1994 , targeted boca chica naval air station in key west , macdill air force base in tampa and the united states southern command , which oversees operations for the caribbean and latin america and recently moved its headquarters to miami from panama one defendant , antonio guerrero , was a civilian employee in the public works department of the key west naval station whose real job , the complaint said , was to report to cuba on any unusual exercises , maneuvers and other activity related to combat readiness another defendant , rene gonzalez , posed as an fbi drug informer to to give misinformation , said thomas e scott , the united states attorney in miami and two other defendants tried to get information and employment at the southern command , which mr scott called a priority objective of the network the arrests marked the first offensive by federal lawenforcement authorities against espionage by suspected cuban agents , federal officials said they also come as cuban exiles , smarting from the federal prosecution of a group of exiles accused of plotting to kill mr castro , are demanding that the united states target cuban agents working in the united states fbi officials said their investigation of cuban intelligence gathering in south florida began after brothers to the rescue , known for making mercy flights between florida and cuba searching for people in boats fleeing cuba , lost two planes in an attack by cuban fighter jets in 1996 but the officials declined to say whether the beginning of their effort was related to that incident in a bizarre twist after the shootdown , a member of the group , juan pablo roque , reappeared in cuba to denounce brothers to the rescue and other miami anticastro groups , and it became known then that he had been on the fbi payroll since 1993 as an informer luis fernandez , a spokesman for the cuban interests section in washington , would not comment on the arrests the cubans arrested today are also accused of penetrating exile groups to create animosity and discredit their leaders and of manipulating political figures and news organizations through anonymous or misidentified telephone calls and letters in miami , where many exiles have long assumed that the city is crawling with cuban spies and double agents , none of it came as a shock if they 're finally deciding to clean house , i salute them for it , said rafael penalver , a prominent exile lawyer who is on the board of a medical clinic that employed one of the defendants as a receptionist last year i hope it s a concerted effort to get to the root of the problem the complaint said the cubans had code names , false identities and accents , escape plans and alibis for if the were arrested they reported to cuba through high frequency radio , officials said , and some traveled to and from cuba mr scott , the united states attorney , and hector m pesquera , the fbi special agent in charge , refused to say how far the defendants got in their intelligence gathering or how threatening the information given to the cuban government was the complaint said they provided cuba with detailed descriptions of the construction and geography of the southern command headquarters it also said mr guerrero gave information on security areas and aircraft at boca chica and the addresses of naval officers mr pesquera said the arrests had left cuban intelligence gathering in a complete state of disarray this is a significant blow to the cuban government , he said but even before the arrests , the espionage network seemed to have run into hard times the criminal complaint said that its officers had to routinely submit financial reports to cuba detailing expenses for the operation and that at one point cuba sent back word that it had to cut back because of the economic state of our country , one communication read , headquarters has been obligated to reduce the budget of all the comrades there the leaders of the network were identified as manuel viramontes , whom the criminal complaint describes as a cuban national and captain in the cuban military who has lived in the united states since 1992 luis medina and ruben campa they and the other seven were charged with illegally acting as foreign agents , conspiring to deliver defenserelated information to a foreign government and conspiring to defraud the united states they could face sentences up to life imprisonment and fines of 750 , 000 it s not good news for anybody who wants to see a relaxation in uscuba relations , said max castro , a cuban affairs expert at the university of miami s northsouth center even though these are things that are typically done by all governments , whenever a country finds out it s been done in its territory , it s considered a hostile act
powder her face , the thomas ades opera at the majestic theater in brooklyn , is unusual for its good nature none of the cruelty and pessimism familiar to recent central european opera here , no rehashes of the news as we have come to know it on our side of the atlantic powder her face , which opened on tuesday night , is genuinely amused by its characters it has a good time it may enjoy its frank sexuality a little too much , but outside of a little recreational spanking , there is no gratuitous violence if seriousness does descend in the form of a cautionary ending , the idea that wealth and profligacy are finite does not dampen the general cheerfulness the her in powder her face is real the duchess of argyll married well , spent accordingly and as documented in a glorious divorce trial of the 1950 s had a taste for the hired help mr ades , a young and promising british composer , presents her in eight disconnected and chronologically scrambled scenes they range from conquest in the prime of life to dispossession in old age there are only four players three of them in a number of roles , maire o'brien a constant as the duchess mr ades s music uses what it finds in the vicinity much of the opera transpires in the age of swing bands and cole porter songs , so the bright parodies of their music signal a specific period richard strauss and the viennese operetta also show up in fractured form schubert s death and the maiden , appearing in two keys rather than the usual one , says a brief hello the composer s seeming fixation on the music of his grandparents is , i think , more than just historical illustration it speaks about the extraordinary power of nostalgia in current musical culture , felt even by people in their 20 s objects of satire are by nature the objects of affection as well , and mr ades s neat approximation of a 1930 s ballad , sung fetchingly by trevor smith , shows where the composer s heart may actually lie the use of his sources is more up to date mr ades writes shattered music think of a musical episode as a piece of glass lying flat that has been struck by a hammer the glass is in many pieces , but the pieces remain close enough together that we know where they originally fit thus melodic line and metric design arrive in fragments , and they are far from symmetrical the results are fun to listen to but were not easy for the brooklyn philharmonic s small band of winds , accordion , percussion and strings set to one side of the majestic s stage and bravely led by robert spano , the brooklyn players wrestled fiercely with the difficult music mr ades s instrumental tricks are somewhat exhibitionist , but the various doorbells , deepwoodwind burps , glissando sighs and whispers of percussion are too amiable to shock they also parallel what is going on onstage indeed , the duchess s episodes of graphic copulation , even with lewinskian variations thereon , are too joyous to be lurid mr ades s solution to composing at the end of the 20th century seems sensible rather than deciding on one musical language from the many around him , he uses them all the fixed set by anne c patterson is a scaffold , a staircase and little more the duchess s bedroom furniture is hideously draped and covered as only the british know how to do ms patterson s costumes leap adroitly from one period to the next edward berkeley s direction does the same ms o'brien solidly occupies her central role mr smith is a charmer heather buck sings various parts beautifully and looks like a million dollars allen schrott s cadaverous presence as the duke and the hotel manager is very helpful to the evening as his chamber music here showed last season , mr ades has an interesting mind and a heartening frame of reference powder her nose is a delightful entertainment as well , and it recycles received information with style does greatness threaten , as his british fans insist \? let s just say that we have a distinctive composer among us and that it will be fun to follow his progress this is a joint production of the brooklyn philharmonic and the brooklyn academy of music and is part of the next wave festival there are performances tonight and saturday photos maire o'brien as the duchess of argyll in thomas ades s powder her face \( toby wales \) \( pg e1 \) heather buck as the maid and allen schrott as the hotel manager in powder her face , at the majestic theater in brooklyn thomas ades s opera is part of the brooklyn academy of music s next wave festival \( toby wales \) \( pg e5 \)
geneva , dec 21 after 317 days in captivity in chechnya , a french aid worker was recently freed by russian commandos in a gunfight that killed three kidnappers the ending could have been quite different for the worker , vincent cochetel , 37 other foreigners have been kidnapped in what appears to have become a routine way to raise cash in the breakaway caucasus republic the heads of four foreign hostages were found this month in a sack on a roadside those kidnappers are reportedly demanding ransom for the bodies mr cochetel , looking thin and wan , spoke to reporters after his return to geneva last week , the end of an ordeal that began in the early hours of jan 29 , when he was seized at his apartment by three masked men mr cochetel was head of the united nations refugee agency office in vladikavkaz , capital of north ossetia , another caucasus region that borders chechnya as with other foreigners who continue to take the risk of living and working in the caucasus mountains , he said never believed that he would be kidnapped french and united nations officials negotiated for mr cochetel s freedom despite many demands for ransom , the refugee agency said none was paid the case attracted the attention of president jacques chirac of france , who contacted president boris n yeltsin of russia to urge the rescue he was freed on dec 11 , when mr cochetel recalled , he was awakened in the middle of the night , blindfolded and driven to the border between chechnya and ingushetia , another russian republic , where russian antiterrorist forces were waiting i did n't now whether i was being liberated , he said the soldiers said nothing he heard automatic gunfire , and with his handcuffed hands behind his back he tumbled out of the car to the ground two russian soldiers dragged him to another vehicle when he looked back , he added , he saw two cars exploded the operation left three kidnappers dead mr cochetel was unharmed mr cochetel said he spent the first three days and nights of his captivity locked in the trunk of a car in freezing weather and without anything to eat he was shuffled among 10 hiding places , he estimated in each , he said , showing handcuff marks on his wrists , he was chained almost the entire time he received a pail of water daily for drinking and washing and another to use as a toilet i had 15 minutes of light each day either from a candle or a lantern , he said then they took it away when i finished my meal , the single daily meal that usually consisted of soup and bread mr cochetel lost 44 pounds in 11 months i was too heavy before , he said after arriving here , where he is being treated in a hospital
washington , april 27 when is a line item veto not really a veto \? that question was the framework for the supreme court s examination , in a spirited hour of argument today , of the constitutionality of the line item veto act in that 1996 law , congress voluntarily surrendered to the president the authority to shape the final form of spending and tax legislation , permitting him to cancel individual items within five days of signing a bill into law in his defense of the law on behalf of the clinton administration , solicitor general seth p waxman conceded that a pure line item veto giving the president the power to sign some provisions and veto others within a single piece of legislation would be unconstitutional mr waxman said such an arrangement would violate the presentment clause of article i , which every american school child learns under the heading of how a bill becomes a law it must be passed by both houses of congress and signed by the president , or passed by twothirds majorities over the president s veto conversely , a provision can only be repealed by passing a new law under the same formula however , mr waxman insisted , the line item veto act did not flout the presentment clause s requirements but instead honored them under the law the president first signs the entire bill into law in the traditional manner only then can he cancel specific provisions as long as congress has not identified those provisions as exempt from the veto , a prerogative it retained what the president is doing is not repealing a provision of law that congress has enacted , but exercising the delegated authority congress has given him , mr waxman said he is implementing the law some justices were openly skeptical is this sequence of events really more defensible than a true line item veto , justice anthony m kennedy wanted to know , asking you mean for a moment in time there is a little law he interrupted himself by laughing at his own question or a big law \? other justices took issue with the solicitor general s assertion that a cancellation of a provision was not the constitutional equivalent of a formal repeal of the provision you can call it a different word , but it s the same thing it s gone , justice ruth bader ginsburg said mr waxman was unflappable , perhaps because despite the justices' doubts about the merits of the government s case , he held a trump card that could prevent the court from ever reaching the merits an attack on the legal standing of the two groups of plaintiffs whose separate challenges to the line item veto act were before the court in the case , clinton v city of new york , no 971374 a year ago , the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of congress , only to dismiss the suit on the ground that the members had not suffered any actual injury from the existence of the veto , which at that point president clinton had not yet exercised since then , the president has canceled 82 items from 11 laws , so there is no doubt that the power is more than theoretical while the government is arguing that there is still no appropriate plaintiff , judge thomas f hogan of federal district court ruled here in february that the case was properly before the court and that the law was unconstitutional new york city is challenging president clinton s veto of a medicaid tax benefit that would have actually belonged not to the city but to the state new york s governor , george e pataki , a republican who used his own line item veto authority to cancel more than 1 , 000 items from the state budget over the weekend , was not among the plaintiffs and a group of idaho potato growers are challenging the veto of a provision that gave special capital gains treatment to the sale of stock of certain agricultural companies however , the plaintiffs were potential purchasers in the transaction , not sellers who might have benefited directly from the tax break there was almost no discussion of standing during mr waxman s half of the argument , but the justices pursued the question vigorously with the two lawyers for the plaintiffs i hate to ask this question , but what s it to you \? justice antonin scalia asked louis r cohen , representing the snake river potato growers inc none of these provisions affect your clients at all mr cohen replied that the veto had changed the terms of a deal the growers were pursuing but justice scalia said that while it might seem reasonable in this case to entertain the growers' suit , i'm really worried about the implications of opening the courthouse doors to indirect beneficiaries of tax legislation could a hot dog vendor at the ball park bring suit if sales went down due to a tax change , he wondered to charles j cooper , representing new york city , the city s health and hospitals corporation and hospital workers' unions , justice scalia expressed frustration at the prospect of once again not being able to decide the case we went into a big windup last year without a pitch , he said the plaintiffs' lawyers , both experienced , washingtonbased supreme court practitioners , returned to the merits of the issue whenever they could mr cohen said that under the constitution , the legislative power is the power to write federal statutes in their exact final terms while that power is vested in congress nontransferably , he continued , the line item veto act gives the president the power to edit tax and spending bills the result is a truncated statute that congress did n't pass , mr cohen said as a second line of attack , but one that ultimately could prove more difficult for the government to overcome , the plaintiffs' lawyers argued that the line item veto act entails such a broad delegation of legislative authority to the president as to violate the separation of powers in defense of the statute , mr waxman maintained that even a very broad delegation was permissible as long as congress has supplied an intelligible principle by which the president is supposed to act he said the court would strike down a law by which congress said to the president here s two things we think are really nice , but there is not enough money for both , so take your pick by contrast , mr waxman said , the line item veto act was not an excessive delegation because the law applies to a relatively small category of budget bills and requires that any cancellation be used for deficit reduction and not impair essential government functions the delegation question , which the court has explored on only a handful of occasions , is a potentially explosive issue in a modern state in which congress has delegated many complex policy choices to executive branch agencies in an exchange with mr cohen , justice scalia hinted at the potential ramifications if the court were to take a hard look at whether the delegation in the line item veto act went too far noting that congress has instructed the federal communications commission to make licensing decisions based on the public interest , convenience and necessity , justice scalia said why not let the president do just as much \? at least he s elected
put that hat away , before i stuff it in your ear david liben s voice , streetwise with a brooklyn accent , rang out a week ago in a hallway of family academy , a small alternative school on west 121st street in central harlem where he is the teacherdirector maybe because it was so silly , the threat sounded affectionate rather than mean the boy grinned sheepishly as he stuffed his soft black hat in a pocket , never breaking stride mr liben , a wiry , hyperkinetic figure , was wearing black jeans and hightop nikes all of it the jocular jousting in the hallway , the casual clothes , the air of informality was just what most new yorkers would expect from an alternative school on 109th street in east harlem , janette cesar made the rounds at the tag \( talented and gifted \) school good morning , miss cesar , a class chanted as the director strode in the hallways were pristinely quiet and empty , and most students wore uniforms in several classrooms , students discussed questions similar to those that will appear on citywide reading tests this spring the studious , disciplined atmosphere was just what many new yorkers expect from a private or parochial school tag , though , is also one of the city s public alternative schools despite the alternative label , none of the dozens of such schools in new york are alike they draw their curriculums and teaching methods from the traditional , the countercultural and in between and as the reading scores released last week by the board of education show , there is no magic formula that keeps their test scores high last year , the tag school was ranked as the city s no 1 elementary school this year , it dropped to 18th among middle schools , alternative ones dominated both the top and the bottom tiers one trait they do share is their size most are small , often taking up just a floor of a conventional school and teachers , parents and administrators say the schools thrive not because of test scores or a financial edge but because the school community not 110 livingston street sets their tone , culture and goals the alternative schools are the focus of more attention than usual this year schools chancellor rudy crew raised fears among parents and administrators that he did not view such schools as a cornerstone of reform and that he wanted them to take in more students and be more accountable to the board of education over the last few months , dr crew has affirmed his support for the schools a spokeswoman said last week that the chancellor wanted to make it easier for any group of parents and teachers to start an alternative school at the same time , though , dr crew has proposed that new schools be required to get approval from the board of education until now , many alternative schools have been created by community school boards you should be able to go to any district in which you want to start one or to come to central and get guidance , the spokeswoman , chiara coletti , said and the guidance should be of a far superior quality than it was even in the recent past children are entitled to go to their neighborhood school , but they usually have to apply for acceptance at an alternative school so alternative schools survive by proving themselves in the marketplace the only reason you might feel that you have to do very well is that you 're in the business of attracting kids , said esther forrest , the principal of the bronx new school , which draws students from riverdale to yankee stadium you do n't have a captive population that is going to come to you no matter what sometimes , though , even alternative schools that do n't produce high test scores command fierce loyalty from parents three years ago , anita burgos was a dedicated parent volunteer at public school 30 in mott haven , one of the poorest neighborhoods in the south bronx a school district administrator , stefan zucker , confided that he and a group of ps 30 teachers wanted to start their own school he told me , 'anita , you 're always in the building , ' mrs burgos recalled 'listen to my idea this is what i want to do what do you think \? ' at last , somebody wanted her advice mrs burgos was hooked and became a founding parent of the mott haven village school the haven , as it is called , scores no better than ps 30 , where 36 percent of children read at grade level , but every year its waiting list gets longer parents say a main reason is that they feel ps 30 , unlike most public schools , belongs to them at this school , like others with different approaches , parents think they see a better path for their children in the world of the city s alternative schools , nowhere is the difference between contrasting educational styles more evident than at family academy , which accepts students with varying academic abilities , and the tag school , which requires an iq test family academy learning skills in games call it the school of no excuses family academy scored last among public schools on the citywide reading test given in 1995 it was , to put it mildly , a heartrending public humiliation for this small experiment , begun in 1991 by an idealistic husbandwife team and a group of teachers committed to showing that they could build a school from scratch one that accepted children with differing levels of ability and make it work
amsterdam jacques goudstikker , a leading art dealer in prewar amsterdam , was one of many wealthy jewish collectors whose artworks were seized by nazi germany in the early 1940 s but unlike , say , the rothschilds and davidweills of france , who recovered most of their belongings after the war , goudstikker s collection was never reconstituted by the mid1950 s , it was as if he had never existed following the revelations of switzerland s secret retention of nazi gold , interest has been stirred throughout europe and the united states in the destiny of other jewish property seized by the nazis , including two paintings by egon schiele that have been detained in new york now questions are being asked here about the whereabouts of the valuable goudstikker collection and the answers are proving embarrassing most of the paintings disappeared , and the rest hang in dutch museums still more disconcerting to many dutch , goudstikker s heirs have discovered that locating artworks taken by the nazis is no guarantee of repossession the dutch government has rejected the claim and even an offer of a settlement by the heirs , arguing that it alone is the rightful owner of the collection and now the heirs are being forced to go to court to try to recover their lost legacy a solution may be years away for other jewish families looking for missing artwork , the goudstikker case serves as a warning of the legal obstacles that may lie ahead some pieces lost in this diaspora were hastily sold by their jewish owners , while many confiscated artworks were sold by the nazis or were later seized by the soviet army jewish heirs can expect to find museums , and governments , reluctant to surrender paintings bought on the open market or , in moscow s case , seized as war booty in the current dispute over the ownership of the two paintings by schiele , the austrian expressionist , which were part of a major exhibition at the museum of modern art in manhattan , the heirs to the works' prewar jewish owners are demanding their return from an austrian governmentfinanced museum , which claims them as its own among such disputes , the goudstikker case in the netherlands is typically complex , yet it stands out , not for what happened during the war , but after the allied victory not because the collection was coveted by none other than hermann goring , hitler s air force chief and an avid art collector , but because of the response of dutch authorities in the late 1940 s and early 50 s , and again today goudstikker was carrying little more than a black book detailing his gallery s fine collection of old masters and other artworks when he fled amsterdam on the night of may 14 , 1940 with nazi forces sweeping north through the netherlands , he , his wife and their son , 3 , boarded one of the last ships to leave for britain before german troops occupied the dutch coast had he survived , he would have been glad that he fled during the next five years , 75 percent of the 140 , 000 jews remaining in the netherlands died in nazi camps but just 24 hours after leaving amsterdam , as he walked the blackedout deck of the ss bodegraven , the 42yearold dealer fell into an open hold and died he was buried in britain , while his 28yearold widow , desiree , and son , eduard , took refuge in the united states losing a legacy a major collection plundered by nazis goudstikker s collection , which comprised 1 , 208 paintings , including works by rembrandt , goya and giotto , was soon dispersed on july 13 , 1940 , goring bought 779 paintings , albeit keeping only the best of these for his private museum , carinhall his german agent , alois miedl , purchased the rest of goudstikker s property by late summer 1940 , the kunsthandel j goudstikker nv , as the amsterdam art gallery was known , had been liquidated on orders of miedl after the war , most of the collection was never found more surprisingly , the 300 or so paintings recovered by the allies and returned to the netherlands were not returned to goudstikker s austrianborn widow rather , apparently eager to enrich its own museum collections , the dutch government created many difficulties for her finally , in 1952 , wanting to get on with her life \( she had remarried after the war \) and resume her singing career , she reluctantly dropped her claim to the paintings in the decades that followed , jacques goudstikker s name faded into the past his mother , emily goudstikkersellisberger , who survived the german occupation of the netherlands , died in 1954 desiree and eduard took the surname of her second husband , august e d von saher , and all are now dead today , 160 of goudstikker s paintings hang in 17 dutch museums without any reference to their provenance \( another 120 to 150 paintings of lesser quality were auctioned off by the government after 1949 \) then , early last summer , with a new generation of historians and journalists probing the past in the wake of the reports of the nazi gold , gerard aalders , a researcher at the netherlands national war documentation institute , pointed out oddities in the goudstikker case to a dutch reporter , pieter den hollander of the daily algemeen dagblad mr den hollander , 41 , began his own investigation and was soon convinced that an injustice had been done he tracked down goudstikker s heir , eduard von saher s widow , marei , in greenwich , conn , and briefed her
a tiny company in seattle is introducing a technology today that industry analysts say could loosen the microsoft corporation s firm grip on the valuable real estate of personal computer screens microsoft sets the rules for how the main screens , or desktops , are used because its windows operating system has a nearmonopoly in the personal computer market personal computer makers are permitted to put icons for starting software programs on the main windows screen , but only within the windows environment and in compliance with contract restrictions imposed by microsoft the company s contract restraints on what pc makers can do with the windows desktop are a key element in the antitrust suit filed by the government against microsoft last month the justice department and the 20 states that also sued the company argue that the restrictions represent an abuse of microsoft s market power microsoft replies that its contracts protect the integrity and uniformity of windows , and thus benefit consumers the seattle startup , the pixel company , has a software innovation that is essentially an attempt to grab a slender band of the computer screen , just beyond the desktop and outside microsoft s contract rules it does this by occupying some unused screen space , called the overscan area , about onequarter to onehalf inch along each edge of the screen pixel s product is a control bar called my space that sits on the bottom edge of the screen , just below the windows 95 task bar by clicking on a my space icon , a user can be linked to a site on the internet s world wide web , control hardware like a cd player or start software programs packard bell nec , a large pc maker , plans to begin installing pixel s software in its computers for the home market later this month , said mal ransom , a senior vice president at packard bell this should allow us to have a more interactive relationship with our customers , enabling us to connect them to any place we want to take them , he said pixel says it is also talking to other pc makers online information and commerce sites have signed agreements with pixel to obtain prime placement of their icons on the my space control bar , the company said these include the bookseller amazoncom , espn , abc news and nasdaq pixel would collect revenue both from license deals with pc makers and from fees paid by web site operators such arrangements would give computer companies and web programmers prime places on the my space bar , but the bar can also be customized by individual users adding icons , removing others or deleting the bar altogether industry analysts who have seen pixel s software are impressed instead of just complaining about microsoft s control of the screen , this company has figured out a way around the problem , said rob enderle , an analyst for giga information group , a research firm this could be a technology with legs computers are generally shipped with the slender bands of unused screen space partly to insure that if the monitor is jostled in transit , none of the display is obscured but many companies , schools and stores set up personal computers so that windows occupies the entire screen , including the overscan area still , pixel s business plan rests on the assumption that the overscan area is open real estate outside microsoft s direct control pixel s managers and legal adviser are experienced in dealing with microsoft pixel is a unit of ark interface ii , a computer interface designer that until recently was a wholly owned subsidiary of packard bell nec ark had developed a shell program for packard bell in 1994 , called navigator , that ran on top of windows 31 and tried to make computers easier to use last month , packard bell nec sold ark to a group of investors , including pixel s management team pixel , its managers say , was born of a sense of frustration with microsoft s contract restrictions the contracts changed every year , and 15 months ago they really closed up , said tom o'rourke , the president of pixel that forced us to think outside the box at least outside the windows desktop the technical challenge of devising a way to use the overscan space fell to david nason , pixel s vice president of research , a computer scientist who formerly worked for microsoft pixel filed a patent application for its technology last november , and the patent approval process typically takes 18 months or so pixel s legal adviser is robert steinberg , a partner at irell manella in los angeles mr steinberg is an intellectualproperty expert who wrote the patent for datacompression technology that became the center of a legal dispute between microsoft and stac electronics inc , which mr steinberg represented in 1994 , a jury ordered microsoft to pay stac 120 million for patent infringement microsoft appealed but settled the case for an estimated 50 million and took a 15 percent stake in stac pixel s patent application , mr steinberg said , is intended to protect the visual real estate of the overscan area the real question here is whether microsoft is going to challenge this and claim that even the overscan area belongs to microsoft , mr steinberg if it does , that would represent an aggressive expansion of its desktop , pushing others aside at a time when it faces a major antitrust case a spokeswoman for microsoft said the company had not yet seen the pixel software , and could not comment on it
poughkeepsie , ny , march 30 a lawyer for the state attorney general and defense lawyers in the tawana brawley defamation trial argued today over the defendants' rights to information from a 1988 state grand jury investigation that could , if released , expand the trial s scope and lengthen its duration one of the defendants , alton h maddox jr , who is representing himself , has repeatedly demanded voluminous information from the attorney general s office , which is the custodian of the grand jury records , but has not received much of it mr maddox told justice s barrett hickman of state supreme court today that without the records , the defense team would be unfairly hampered in its crossexamination of the plaintiff , steven a pagones , which could begin on tuesday mr maddox noted the judge s prior decision to allow the defense team to dispute the grand jury s conclusion that mr pagones did not rape ms brawley you know that these documents are necessary for the defense to mount a challenge to the grand jury report , mr maddox told justice hickman he also asserted that the attorney general had a conflict of interest , because mr pagones is on an unpaid leave from a job as an assistant state attorney general but christine duisin , a lawyer for the attorney general s office , said that there was no conflict and that the integrity of the grand jury process depended on witnesses' being able to trust that their cooperation would be kept confidential moreover , she added , none of these defendants saw any of these materials at the time they made their statements about mr pagones , so the relevance is nil justice hickman is expected to rule on the issue tuesday a decision in favor of the defense lawyers would give them additional avenues of inquiry for mr pagones s crossexamination and would further prolong the trial , already in its fifth month mr pagones , a former dutchess county prosecutor , is suing mr maddox , c vernon mason and the rev al sharpton for saying that he , along with several other white men , raped ms brawley in november 1987 , when she was 15 in october 1988 , the grand jury discredited ms brawley s claims about a dozen supporters of the defendants demonstrated outside the courthouse today to support the release of the grand jury information , chanting , no documents , no peace the information that mr maddox has demanded includes state police files concerning the suicide of harry crist jr , a parttime police officer , in december 1987 mr maddox has also requested mr crist s suicide note one or more of the defendants have , at various times , contended that mr crist was involved with mr pagones in an attack against ms brawley that mr crist was murdered as a result of it , and that the note found in his apartment was a love letter to a girlfriend mr crist s sister , jeanne , who was in court today , said the defendants should not be allowed to pry into a private family matter i'm sure if something like this happened in one of their families , she said , they would n't let a suicide note come out in public it s really none of their business photo with supporters of the defendants in the background , christine duisin , of the state attorney general s office , spoke to reporters yesterday \( chris maynard for the new york times \)

shane spencer was one of many yankees who arrived early enough at yankee stadium yesterday to make sure the long day of baseball in the bronx would stretch even longer that is what happens when players on the best club in the major leagues are trying to be remembered as one of the best in history that is why it made sense for them to sip their coffee in the clubhouse around 9 am with the yankees and royals playing games at 1 05 pm and at 7 35 pm , with a separate admission for each one , the whole scene was similar to an american legion tournament rather than an american league doubleheader play a game , devour a meal , wait a few hours and play another game spencer waited to play in the second game , but it was worth it actually , with the yankees , it is win a game , relax , and then win another game yesterday s wrinkle in the schedule , caused by a rainout with kansas city in may , failed to throttle the yankees they scorched the royals , 82 , in the first game behind the pitching of david cone and the offense of darryl strawberry , and then destroyed them , 142 , in the second game with david wells outdoing cone with a completegame sixhitter and the unlikely spencer outdoing everyone spencer , a rookie who filled in while right fielder paul o'neill was rested in the second game , ripped the first two homers of his career , had five hits , scored four times and drove in three runs the first homer had help from spectators who hung over the leftfield seats in the seventh inning as hal morris tried to catch it so teammates teased spencer and called it a cheap homer one inning later , spencer hit the ball into the upper deck in left field i say , 'wow , ' a lot , either to myself or out loud , manager joe torre said this ball club keeps coming at you it did it in the second game with a lineup that included luis sojo , who had three hits and three runs batted in , and bernie williams and chuck knoblauch , who each hit a home run knoblauch s nine homers since the allstar game break are more than mark mcgwire has in the same period but mostly the yankees completed the sweep with spencer , whose mother , althea , watched him play in the major leagues for the first time last night and who he guessed was still crying 20 minutes after the game i have n't stopped smiling , said spencer , who had a most memorable 10th game in the major leagues i 've never had five hits not even in little league a smiling torre called the 26yearold spencer the kid while holding his own 2 1 2yearold daughter and said it took me about 11 years to do that i'm happy for him he hit a couple of homers at home that s big you do n't forget that , hitting your first homers at yankee stadium no one can forget these yankees \( 8229 \) , who overwhelmed and intimidated an inferior team before the smallest crowd of the season \( 14 , 425 \) in the opening game and before 37 , 988 spectators in the second game forgive the battered royals if they cancel their wakeup calls and sleep in this morning cone \( 164 \) became the first 16game winner in the majors and strengthened his status as a strong candidate for the cy young award by halting the royals on two runs and six hits , striking out five and walking none in six and twothirds innings tino martinez drove in three runs , williams knocked in two and strawberry had another mammoth homer his last six hits have been home runs , giving him 21 , and he has nine homers in his last 29 atbats arthritic knee and all , strawberry has been awesome he s such an imposing figure , torre said every time he swings the bat , it s a home run at least it s been that way the last few weeks strawberry simply said , i feel a great confidence when i come to the plate that is similar to what cone and wells experience on the mound after allowing a run in the first , cone retired 15 of the next 17 batters and watched the yankees slap pat rapp for four runs in the first and assume control of the game after the royals took a 10 lead against wells \( 143 \) in the third inning of the second game , he retired 16 of the next 18 batters as the yankees leveled kansas city both davids are on pace to win 20 games sixteen wins is amazing to me , cone said again , it s a byproduct of a great record i 've had great run support strawberry provided a splashy show by rocketing rapp s 12 fastball into the fourth row of the rightfield upper deck he jogged stifflegged around the bases , a sight that has become more and more familiar spencer was splashier as the yankees mugged the royals a second time , prompting wells to say mr spencer did it it was the shane spencer story inside pitch david cone has pitched 149 innings and , because he is expected to get 10 more starts , he has a good chance to eclipse 200 innings , which will cause the yankees to give him a 55 million option for 1999 cone can accept it or become a free agent cone is 100 at yankee stadium this season and 253 as a yankee in the bronx he has gone 90 consecutive starts without incurring backtoback setbacks , the fifth longest streak since 1900 jose offerman had hits in both games for the royals to extend his streak to 27

one night back in december 1982 , thea r dubow , then a yonkers resident , awoke to find her husband of almost 10 years near death from a gunshot wound to his head and the gun lying nearby eighteen months later , after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the case , for a crime she says she still has no recollection of having committed , she entered bedford hills correctional facility , where she served three and a half years ms dubow , who has a master s degree in early childhood education and is now a resident of eastchester , tells a story of years as a battered wife on the fateful evening , she and her husband got into a fight , he made her swallow some drugs that to this day she says she cannot identify , at some point she passed out and awoke to find her husband suffering what were to be fatal wounds today , ms dubow , in her mid 40 s , is the assistant executive director of my sister s place , an agency that runs one shelter for battered women and their children in westchester and will soon open a second october is national domestic violence awareness month , and as part of that the jewish women international s rita salberg chapter of northern westchester will sponsor a forum on the topic at the chappaqua library ms dubow , carla horton , executive director of the northern westchester shelter for women , and representatives of the westchester district attorney s office will be among the speakers for the free event further information may be obtained by calling jayne kaplowitz at 2326068 here are excerpts from a recent conversation with ms dubow q how did you come to be a battered wife and a killer \? a i met my potential husband at a mutual friend s house in about february of 1973 and we got married may 27 my marrying him was n't even my own choice i say that because i wanted to live with him , but being this was the beginning of the 70 s my parents did n't want me living with him so i married him i was 21 q did the abuse begin immediately \? a before he physically abused me he i realize this now he laid some groundwork he was able to isolate me from my family and from my friends there were many control issues going on and then i stopped driving what happened is when we got married we both had a car , but one of the cars ceased to work when my license was up , i just did n't renew it because by that point he was driving me around everywhere and in westchester , as you know , you need a car after i stopped driving , i could only go where he would drive me so my world got smaller and smaller as time went on i was a substitute teacher at the time , and he would take me to work , meet for lunch and pick me up is n't he attentive \? is n't he considerate \? but how controlling what better way to monitor my every move and not let me do anything without his knowledge \? q did you argue in those early days about these issues \? a no i was naive i was 21 i was n't worldly , and i was trusting and the first time he slapped me he alleged that i was having a sexual liaison he alleged i was having a sexual liaison with one of my friends a female friend , yet q and you were not \? a i was not , and i was angry and said , i do n't have to take this , i'm leaving you know that whole spiel and he slapped me across the face hard he was 180 pounds and 6 foot 2 it was hard i'm a small person i threatened to leave him , but he was so sorry , so apologetic and the thought , he told me , of me being with someone else made him lose control and i fell for it i thought the way i think women are raised in our society that anybody is allowed to make a mistake and should be forgiven this was , he said , a mistake , and he lost control out of love for me love in quotes , i guess so i let it go i did n't even in my nine and a half years of marriage ever string all of these things together and put a name to what was going on , to see the ongoing pattern in fact , i did n't name my own experience until after i was in prison for his death q when he struck you , what was it \? a slap , a punch , more \? a all of those things hitting , punching , slapping , kicking q we hear of battered wife syndrome where the wife thinks it is all her fault did you feel it was your fault \? a yes he always had a reason why he did it it was n't because of anything that he did , it was because i had a big mouth , i was sarcastic , i was manipulative q did you ever go to the authorities \? a yes i called the yonkers police once after he threw me out of our apartment he would n't let me back in i went to a neighbor s house and called the police and the police arrived and had one question whose name was on the lease \? when i told them my husband , they said they were very sorry about my situation but there was nothing they could do to help so i never called the police again eventually , he opened the door and i moved back in q did you share your experiences with family at this point \? a no i think maybe they suspected , but nobody talked about it when he broke my arm i lied to the emergency room staff , i lied to my parents i said i slipped on some water then , of course , he was so sorry then there was another time where i had taken some prescribed barbiturates i woke up with a hangover , and he bound and gagged me and told me he was going to have me committed he called a psychiatrist from a local agency who he talked into committing me then he convinced the psychiatrist not to commit me , and the doctor prescribed heavy dozes of thorazine so now i was taking barbiturates and thorazine , so i was kind of out it i saw the psychiatrist for about six months q did you tell him what was going on \?
the federal reserve board bowed to investors' expectations with its rate cuts yesterday but for its trouble , it earned only halfhearted applause from stock and bond traders there s a good reason for that muted reaction ever since investors fled risky markets this summer for the safe haven of united states treasuries , the bond market has been leading the fed on interestrate policy , trading at levels that predicted even further drops in key rates but yesterday , both stock and bond investors seemed to respond to signals in the fed s comments that this , its third cut since sept 29 , could be the last for the year the two quarterpoint cuts yesterday one in the federal funds rate to 475 percent , another in the discount rate to 45 percent was pretty much what stock traders had been counting on from the fed s monetary policy meeting consequently , while the moves briefly helped propel the dow jones industrial average to around 9 , 100 points , up more than 92 points , by the end of the day the rate cuts were not enough to keep the average in positive territory the dow ended the day down 2497 points , closing at 8 , 98628 other indexes reacted more positively the standard poor s 500 crept up 345 points the nasdaq composite ended the day up 1684 points , almost 1 percent bond traders had been less cocky about a fed cut when the announcement came , treasury bonds mustered only a temporary rally , hitting a wall of selling that left the yield on the 30year bond up just onehundredth of a percentage point , at 530 percent yields on bonds with shorter maturities notes coming due in two years and five years , for instance inched up further assessing the markets' reaction to yesterday s move by the fed is more crucial than usual because financialmarket stress not troubling economic figures has driven fed policy in recent months this is unusual the last time it happened was in 1987 , after the stock market crashed had the fed been looking strictly at recent economic data , it would almost certainly not have cut rates where is the slowdown \? asked peter canelo , united states investment strategist at morgan stanley dean witter what they did today was unnecessary , it was a precautionary move the economy is doing well and is going to be doing even better now indeed , gross domestic product is growing at more than a 3 percent clip , there is a boom in housing demand , and sales of both automobiles and smallerticket consumer goods are strong consumer confidence is rising again after a couple of troubling dips and the stock market is soaring none of this would typically signal a need for a drop in rates bondmarket stability is , however , a more complex matter to measure the fed has been looking for signs of a credit contraction there that could push the economy into a recession if the markets appear to be more stable in the coming weeks , then the likelihood of further rate cuts recedes by several measures , stability is returning to some of the investment arenas that had been hardest hit by the russian default and other meltdowns in emerging markets what had been cavernous spreads in september in the yields between treasuries and nontreasury debt like junk bonds or mortgage securities are much narrower now the yield on merrill lynch s master index of highyield bonds closed yesterday 537 percentage points more than treasuries with similar maturities though still wide , the gap is a full percentage point slimmer than it had been furthermore , investors are piling into junkbond funds at a furious rate roughly 1 billion a week recently enlivening a market that had been comatose the environment certainly seems to have changed dramatically from late september , when companies were starting to fail for lack of ability to roll over their debts , martin fridson , chief highyield strategist at merrill lynch , said that s exactly the reaction from investors the fed was hoping for and investors in the stock market are almost swaggering again mr canelo noted that after the market crash of 1987 , it took 15 months for stock prices to recover half of what they had lost following this summer s market drop , it took less than four weeks to recover half of what stock indexes had lost one reason stock prices may have rebounded so spectacularly is that the supply of money in the country s financial system has ballooned of late and while some of this money has flowed into the stock market , the growth may also preclude a recession next year i have never seen a recession take place when money growth is rising at these rates , said lief olson , director of absolute return investors , an institutional money management firm in new canaan , conn with low inflation , continuing growth , and low interest rates , you do not have a recipe for weak growth or recession but even if the nation averts a recession , higher stock prices may not be the result daniel laufenberg , chief united states economist for american express financial advisers in minneapolis , is a bull on corporate earnings for next year , but he thinks stock prices will only tread water in 1999 why \? because he reckons that interest rates will rise credit spreads and risk aversion by investors has created the need for the fed to ease , mr laufenberg said at some point , the fed will have to start focusing on economic fundamentals rather than financial market conditions and when they do , i believe the fed will discover that the fundamentals are still very positive a rate increase next year , he said , could be the result graph a bullish hour the dow jones industrials rose more than 150 points yesterday after the federal reserve cut rates , but later gave back most of the gains graph tracks data yesterday \( source bridge information systems \)
washington , dec 17 the polls show americans do not want president clinton impeached and they show that the public is squarely behind the president s bombing of iraq nonetheless , republican leaders are not only questioning mr clinton s motives in attacking iraq , but are rejecting pleas by democrats to put off the house debate on impeachment , even by one more day by pressing forward , even brazenly , against the president , republicans are inviting attacks that they are so impatient to exile mr clinton that they are rushing heedlessly forward to conduct a public vote on an unseemly scandal while american troops are in harm s way some republicans worry that their party is increasingly perceived as motivated by a ferocious partisanship and a desire to cripple mr clinton in their zealous pursuit of bill clinton are they doing longterm damage to their political interests \? many democrats hope so and some republicans fear they are right but others in the republican party insist they must press forward at any cost not only do they believe , fervently , that mr clinton should be impeached , they are determined to act quickly before he somehow finds a way out representative todd tiahrt , a kansas republican , said that when his party s caucus met wednesday night , members expressed fears that a delay would give the president time to find a way out representative bob barr , the georgian who backed impeachment before anybody heard of monica s lewinsky , put it this way the administration will try to pull anything out of a hat whether it s a rabbit or a red herring remains to be seen still others are confident that by the next elections in 2000 , the events of this week will be long forgotten republicans said they have grown so distrustful of mr clinton that they cannot help but question his motives that is why many republicans say they were were unapologetic about their accusations that mr clinton s order to bomb iraq was an attempt to put off the impeachment debate , which was to begin today q whitfield ayres , a republican pollster , said , very few republicans are willing to give this president the benefit of the doubt mr ayres said it was mr clinton who appears suspect because the attack on iraq deepens the cynicism among people who already think this guy will say anything or do anything to retain power representative michael g oxley , an ohio republican , said of mr clinton he s manipulated our military and his advisers for his own preservation you 'd have to be basically retarded not to think there was some manipulating going on many republicans argue that mr clinton has lost such credibility and is so mistrusted that most americans would not blame any republican for questioning his motives still , some in the party warned privately that the party s lawmakers should show more restraint because they risk being viewed as obsessed with impeachment at any cost the admission tonight by robert l livingston , the incoming house speaker , that he on occasion strayed from my marriage could only further weaken the republicans' efforts to undermine mr clinton already , polls show that the republican party s image has suffered in recent weeks longterm risk for the party would be if it was unable to shed an image of naked partisanship before the 2000 elections while many republicans questioned mr clinton s motives in bombing iraq , many in the party said they were particularly stunned that senator trent lott , the republican leader , asserted on wednesday that both the timing and the policy are subject to question lawmakers have often denounced a president s military operations , but they usually do not do so at the moment of attack more commonly , senior members of congress in both parties rally behind the president to display a united front and out of deference to the fact that the administration has more access to confidential information for today at least , the comments by mr lott and the republican push to open the impeachment debate gave democrats grist for trying to shift the discourse to the insensitivity of republicans while american troops are in harm s way only a day ago , the white house was struggling in an uphill battle to save mr clinton from being impeached while that threat seems undiminished , throughout today republicans were on the defensive they found themselves responding to attacks by democrats that they were so singlemindedly out to get the president that they dared to question his motives and refused to postpone the impeachment vote even mr lott backed off from his statement on wednesday , and insisted today that he had not questioned the president s motivations but was responding to the concerns of others representative herbert h bateman of virginia reminded fellow republicans that they might regret the political fallout of rushed action we should not be perceived as doing things too precipitously by going ahead as if none of this had happened , he said
an auxiliary police officer and a security guard captured a knifewielding man who is suspected in a stabbing death last week in manhattan after he repeatedly slashed a woman in a chinatown mall , the police said yesterday the man , gerald marcellin , 50 , whom the police characterized as a mentally disturbed drifter who lived in a single room occupancy building in the bowery , was charged yesterday with attempted murder in the attack monday evening on the woman , shi kam lam , said assistant chief kevin p farrell , the commander of manhattan detectives after being questioned in that attack , mr marcellin was also charged with two stabbings last week , one of them fatal chief farrell said the attacks were unprovoked they were precipitated by a state of mental outrage , he said certainly none of the victims did anything to provoke or cause such a violent act mr marcellin was captured after stabbing ms lam at the hungda shoe store in the 88 east broadway mall , below the manhattan bridge , the police said she had just sold him a pair of sneakers an auxiliary police officer in the fifth precinct , shen wen wu , was working as a private security guard in another shop in the mall when he heard the woman scream and ran to the shoe store to confront the attacker i told him , 'you stop ! police ! ' mr wu recalled last night the attacker tried to flee through a back door but was stopped by rafael rivera , another security guard i went up to him , told him to stop and wait right there until the cops arrived , mr rivera said he told me , 'i stabbed the woman because she harassed me' then he was taking out the knife to stab me , and at that moment i held his hand and held him back ms lam underwent surgery on monday night at bellevue hospital for two stab wounds in her chest , four in her stomach and one in her leg she remained in critical condition last night , the police said mr marcellin , who served six months in prison for stabbing his brother in 1994 and was on parole until 1999 , was also charged with the oct 14 slaying of cheuk wong , 43 , in the vestibule of 85 bowery and on oct 13 , the police say , mr marcellin stabbed jose ajera , 32 , as he sat on a bench in madison square park apparently , mr marcellin became upset after he saw mr ajera spit on the sidewalk mr ajera was hospitalized for six days all three attacks were committed with a militarystyle navy seal knife with a sixinch serrated blade and a fiveandahalfinch handle mr marcellin is charged with seconddegree murder , attempted murder , two counts of assault and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon
acknowledging that he had become more and more comfortable as a met last season , mike piazza said yesterday that he decided to remain with the team because of the challenge and potential rewards of playing in new york the 30yearold catcher , who agreed over the weekend to a sevenyear contract worth a record 91 million , appeared at a news conference at shea stadium and proclaimed his desire to succeed amid the pressure that accompanies a baseball career in this city when i looked inside , i realized this is where i wanted to be , piazza said when you 're not successful here , it s tough but when you win here , it s twice as good as anyplace else and if i happen to be so fortunate to go in the hall of fame , it s definitely going to be in a mets uniform his comments reflected a turnaround from late summer , when he appeared bothered and subdued after being booed for not producing with runners on base but piazza said he became convinced that the flip side of this reaction would be an embrace by the fans and the city that could not be equaled elsewhere when i realized what had transpired with the dodgers , i knew that no matter where i went , it would have been the same , piazza said and i just felt i might as well get booed by the best going somewhere else with no offense to any other place would be a letdown when you come here , you get infected by the attitude and you always know where you stand the mets , meanwhile , are convinced that they have secured the cornerstone of their franchise into the next century as they try to build their first world series winner since 1986 they introduced piazza on the same day they acknowledged that they would raise ticket prices for next season in all probability by more than the 20 percent they raised ticket prices before last season fred wilpon and nelson doubleday , the team s owners , said the increase was not solely because of the contract for piazza they said they had given general manager steve phillips the goahead to significantly expand the team s payroll beyond the 57 million for 1998 the sixth highest in baseball including piazza s signing , the mets have committed 40 million to 10 players for 1999 that includes todd hundley , who will make 53 million , but who is virtually certain to be traded in the wake of piazza s signing but it does not include a new contract for al leiter , the pitcher who was expected to sign a fouryear 32 million deal in the next several days at an average of 13 million a season , piazza s contract is the richest in baseball , surpassing the 125 million the red sox are paying pitcher pedro martinez it also includes a limited notrade agreement , something the los angeles dodgers refused to provide when piazza turned down what his agent said was a sixyear offer for 79 million earlier this year the dodgers traded piazza to the florida marlins on may 15 , and a week later the mets acquired him for three minor leaguers piazza is usually guarded when discussing himself but yesterday he was relaxed , open , even forthright when he spoke of his reasons for staying even though he had been booed at shea during a good part of the season i know it s not going to be easy , piazza said but at least he knows what he is in for the mets , who have won 88 games each of the last two seasons , were eliminated from playoff contention on the final day of this season after losing five consecutive games resigning piazza and leiter , their top pitcher , appears to be the beginning of a strategy in which the mets could have a new old left fielder , bobby bonilla , hitting behind piazza in the lineup \( something wilpon hinted strongly would happen \) , plus another powerhitting corner outfielder and either a new second baseman or third baseman that means that carlos baerga is almost surely gone , along with hundley and so the mets are now in the market for some more free agents , maybe even another pitcher or two but there is no question that phillips had already pulled off perhaps the most important freeagent signing in the team s 37year history piazza who has shaved his mustache for what he called an incognito look for the off season called his signing an easy decision over his first seven seasons in the majors , piazza has put up hall of fametype numbers a 333 batting average , 200 home runs and 644 runs batted in he is one of the most fearsome righthanded hitters in the game and surely its best hitting catcher last season , he finished fourth in the national league in hitting with a 329 average in 109 games with the mets , he batted 348 with 23 homers and 76 rbi that was why phillips called yesterday a momentous day in new york mets history and with piazza in the fold , phillips said , the mets have the identity and the marquee player they were sorely lacking heading into last season not to mention renewed credibility in our fans' eyes , phillips said to show how badly the mets wanted to sign piazza , they came to an agreement with him in three days , beginning last wednesday , after going nearly five months without having any contract discussions there is some question as to whether the mets were essentially bidding against themselves , although piazza s agent , dan lozano , said yesterday that he thought he could have got piazza more money elsewhere but lozano did say that the mets raised their offer from their first proposal last wednesday the main reason we wanted to do it as quickly as we did is that we did n't want him out on the market , wilpon said we did n't want to take the chance lozano said i did n't expect it to get done as quickly as it did not a contract of this magnitude lozano described his past dealings with the dodgers as akin to pulling teeth piazza , he said , had become disenchanted with how the dodgers had handled negotiations with his best friend , eric karros , in the last off season piazza said it was simply time to turn the page on his dodger career whether he is able to catch for the next seven years is another question , however phillips indicated yesterday that at some point , piazza could move to first base but he s actually guaranteed us that he would n't get hurt for the seven years , phillips said with a smile there is a history with catchers that their offensive performances can decline but none of those other catchers is mike piazza so i'm not concerned about it and right now , about the only thing piazza is concerned about is finding a place to live in new york photos mike piazza with the mets owners who will pay him 91 million nelson

with less than three months left before 14 , 000 4yearolds are supposed to begin new prekindergarten classes established by the state , new york city s overcrowded public school system is planning to enroll a third of those children in private and parochial preschools unable to squeeze the preschoolers into public schools ripping at the seams , officials expect to use public funds to educate about 5 , 000 children in private schools it is a rare example of the city s public school system relying on the private sector for basic academic services the only precedents are smaller programs in counseling and tutoring the state law that established prekindergarten classes encouraged local school districts to draw up contracts with private preschools the law requires each district to devote at least 10 percent of its funds to contracts with private agencies , and education officials in albany said the requirement was added because they knew many districts would be unable to find the space or the qualified teachers on their own the private preschool industry , worried about losing business , also lobbied heavily in albany when state lawmakers enacted the law establishing the 500 million program last summer , they allocated money for teachers and aides , but none for construction , despite the space problem since then , translating the language of the law into reality has flummoxed school officials across the state , especially in new york city , which now expects to be spending 35 percent of its state allocation for the program on private and parochial schools indeed , the story of prekindergarten in new york is emerging as the story of good intentions crashing into difficult realities in some areas of the city , parents have been unable to submit applications for their preschoolers because district officials have not picked the private preschools they will use bathrooms and playgrounds are still being inspected , teacher credentials reviewed and classrooms observed as school officials have discovered , conditions at private preschools vary widely dirty floors and a dearth of books at a day care center on the ground floor of an east new york housing project dismayed one superintendent , while the emphasis on penmanship at a preschool in northern queens troubled another district official , who considered the school s approach too rigid and recently , a new complication was unearthed when a brooklyn superintendent showed up to inspect a yeshiva , it was closed for a religious holiday , revealing the potential chaos that mismatched school calendars could create for working parents still , most educators unequivocally embrace the concept of preschool education , not just in new york but around the country a survey taken last year by the children s defense fund , an advocacy group based in washington , found that 21 states had increased financing of preschool programs , most of them intended for poor children last year , the new jersey legislature set aside 125 million for prekindergarten classes in 125 of the state s poorest school districts in connecticut , lawmakers agreed last year to spend 86 million over two years on prekindergarten classes in more than a dozen poor , mostly urban districts who can say anything bad about children having earlychildhood education \? said dr arthur greenberg , the head of community school district 25 in flushing , queens is it well planned \? no i know a whole bunch of superintendents who would have liked more time to get this off the ground when the universal prekindergarten law was enacted a year ago , it drew bipartisan support from lawmakers , and got a strong boost from lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross the program is voluntary for parents new york city s board of education voted to require each of its 32 districts to provide the classes champions of the program cited research pointing to the longterm benefits of early education for instance , studies of head start , the federally financed prekindergarten program for poor children , showed that preschoolers enrolled in the program initially showed measurable improvements in health , school attendance and cognitive test scores the gains in cognitive test scores , however , faded after a couple of years to stretch its resources , new york city decided to establish halfday prekindergarten classes a few other districts in the state are creating fullday programs the program is financed with 46 million in state funds for the 199899 school year , matched by 5 million from the board of education unlike head start , which is limited to needy children , new york s prekindergarten program is available to children regardless of their family income , though in the first year only districts with the largest percentage of poor children including all new york city districts are eligible private preschools that want contracts with the city school system must be licensed by the city , and they cannot offer religious instruction any parochial schools involved in the new program will , under the state law , have to scrub classroom walls of religious icons and agree to a secular curriculum given the stipulations , several private agencies , including schools run by the roman catholic archdiocese of new york , have passed up the offer
on blustery winter days , hellen beepat says , the cold was unbearable it swept in on her as she and others in her crew of workfare participants picked up trash alongside highways in queens sometimes i just ca n't take the cold , she said it is the rain that sylvia ruff talks about most vividly it would pour as she swept streets in the bronx the rain poncho from the sanitation department was so thin that it was all but useless i was wringing out my sleeves , i got so wet , said mrs ruff , who has been given a new assignment , cleaning inside a garage for alberto deleon , the most frustrating part of workfare is the search for a toilet mr deleon , who sweeps streets in the south bronx , said that sometimes a police station or a school will allow workers to use the bathroom but other times they have to use the streets or wait until the end of a sixhour shift you know what they call this \? he asked discrimination against the poor mr deleon and dozens of other workfare participants who toil outdoors for the city s sanitation , parks and transportation departments complained often about working conditions during interviews over the last four months workers said they lacked adequate rain gear and boots to protect them from being cut by sharp objects some participants said they had received no training on what to do when they came upon bloody syringes , dead animals , poison ivy and other hazards and some workers said toilets and fresh water were sometimes unavailable many experienced workfare participants said conditions used to be worse a year ago , women on welfare who picked up trash and cut tall grass beside highways in queens had no drinking water when it was hot and no rain gear or warm coats when it was wet or cold the workers were not allowed to leave to find a bathroom , so women were sometimes forced to go behind trees or inside large plastic bags held up by other workers to shield them from the eyes of motorists conditions like these led critics of the city s work experience program to file a classaction lawsuit last year that accused the giuliani administration of violating state labor laws last august , justice jane s solomon of state supreme court in manhattan issued a preliminary injunction against the city , ruling that welfare recipients could not continue to work outdoors for the departments of transportation and sanitation until the agencies provided them with necessities like toilets , drinking water and protective clothing municipal officials , who contended that they were already providing everything ordered by the judge , appealed the decision the injunction is on hold while the appeal is pending giuliani administration officials refused to be interviewed for this article but visits to work sites and interviews with advocates for the poor indicated that the city had responded to many complaints , though unevenly these days , if a wep worker wants a warm coat , all he has to do is ask , said pedro febres , who has been sweeping the streets in the south bronx but not everyone has received one clara chalk , who sweeps streets in brooklyn , said she had not been issued a coat , nor had others in her district regular city workers receive a clothing allowance conditions have improved for the welfare recipients working alongside highways in queens there are now canisters of fresh water in each of the white vans that take them to their work sites the workers are allowed to walk in pairs to use a bathroom if one is nearby , or they are driven to restrooms if there are none within walking distance they 're doing better now , said hazel green , who worked in the highway crew a year ago and is back now a supervisor said , however , that senior managers had issued orders not to permit workers to leave to find toilets but that supervisors routinely ignored the orders other problems remain many wep workers said that boots were rarely issued at a cost of 30 to more than 100 , boots are no small purchase for those on welfare , whose cash grant can be as low as 120 a month many welfare recipients who work in the parks said that they were often required to paint benches and to paint over graffiti on park and playground equipment , even though they must wear their own clothing i 've ruined five pairs of pants since i 've been here and a couple of pairs of sneakers , said elliott roseburo , who has worked at a playground in williamsburg , brooklyn , for a year sometimes changes have come grudgingly one morning last winter , four workfare participants at a small park in the castle hill section of the bronx told a reporter that not everyone had received coats and heavy gloves one worker said she had seen many new coats , gloves and hats sitting unused in a storeroom parks department supervisors , who learned of the interview that same day , took action the next day the wep workers said nearly all of the workfare participants in the district were driven to the district office , where they were issued new coats , rain gear , gloves and boots photo elliott roseburo has worked at a playground three blocks from his home in williamsburg , brooklyn , for a year \( michelle v agins the new york times \)

fort collins , colo , oct 12 matthew shepard , the gay college student who was kidnapped , robbed and pistolwhipped , died here today , five days after he was rescued from a wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in nearfreezing temperatures his death , announced at the poudre valley hospital here , fanned the outrage that followed word of the attack , spawning vigils , producing calls for federal hatecrimes legislation from president clinton and fueling debates over such laws in a host of western states , including wyoming , that have resisted them in places from denver to the university of maryland , people turned out to mourn the softspoken 21yearold who became an overnight symbol of deadly violence against gay people after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby russell a henderson , 21 , and aaron j mckinney , 22 , were charged with attempted murder and are expected to face firstdegree murder charges that could bring the death penalty their girlfriends , chasity v pasley , 20 , and kristen l price , 18 , were charged as accessories in denver , mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national gay awareness week in san francisco , the giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to halfstaff in the castro district there is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence , said rebecca isaacs , political director of the national gay and lesbian task force in washington people have likened it to a scarecrow but it sounded more like a crucifixion the laramie police have said they believe robbery was the primary motive for the attack , which occurred outside a bar but investigators also said mr shepard s sexual orientation was a factor they said the suspects lured mr shepard from the bar by saying they , too , were gay , and one of the women said mr shepard had embarrassed one of the men by making a pass at him , the investigators said today , the laramie police said that after leaving mr shepard tied to the fence , the men returned to laramie and picked a fight on a street corner with two hispanic men , emiliano morales 3d , 19 , and jeremy herrera , 18 mr mckinney and mr morales suffered head injuries gay leaders hope that mr shepard s death will galvanize congress and state legislatures to pass hatecrime legislation or broaden existing laws conservatives , particularly christian conservatives , generally oppose such laws , saying they extend to minorities special rights in the last two decades , 21 states and the district of columbia have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed because of race , religion , color , national origin and sexual orientation another 19 states , including colorado , do not include sexual orientation in their hatecrime laws ten states , including wyoming , have no hatecrime laws , or none based on specific categories in washington , mr clinton responded to news of mr shepard s death by urging congress to pass the federal hate crimes protection act , which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex , disability and sexual orientation congress needs to pass our tough hatecrimes legislation , mr clinton said current law covers only crimes based on race , color , religion or national origin wyoming has been a holdout , rejecting three hatecrimes bills since 1994 , most recently in february but today , after the death of mr shepard , who was a university of wyoming freshman , jim geringer , the state s popular governor , opened the door to legislation at a news conference i ask for a collective suggestion for antibias , antihate legislation that can be presented to the wyoming legislature for their consideration in january , he said the governor met this morning with dennis shepard , matthew s father , and said the father did not want the death to become a media circus and that we should not use matt to further an agenda mr geringer said that dennis shepard also said do n't rush into just passing all kinds of new hatecrimes laws be very careful of any changes and be sure you 're not taking away rights of others in the process to race to this leaders of gay rights groups interviewed today said they would respect the family s privacy by not attending the burial in casper , wyo , on saturday but they added they hoped the death would have an impact matthew s death , i hope , will bring about a better and deeper understanding of hatecrime laws , said elizabeth birch , executive director of the human rights campaign , a lesbian and gay rights group that has 250 , 000 members in 1996 , 21 men and women were killed in the united states because of their sexual orientation , according to the southern poverty law center , an alabama group that tracks violence against minorities according to the federal bureau of investigation , sexual orientation was a factor in 116 percent of the 8 , 759 hate crimes recorded in 1996 but christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use today s death to expand hatecrime laws and curtail freedom of speech
washington , aug 13 safety investigators are looking into whether an air traffic control center near cleveland has routinely hidden evidence of operational errors , in which planes are mistakenly ordered to fly too close to one another , after discovering three such incidents on june 23 that went unreported the cleveland air route traffic control center , which handles about three million flights a year and is the busiest of the federal aviation agency s 20 centers that guide planes flying at high altitudes , experienced a spurt of operational errors in the last few days , about triple the normal rate the controllers blamed understaffing , but some experts say increased disclosure has raised the numbers the control center , in oberlin , ohio , came to investigators' attention because of a complaint to a special phone line maintained by the inspector general of the transportation department , federal aviation officials said the caller reported an incident on june 23 in which one passenger jet was told to descend through the path of another , bringing them closer than the rules allow investigations of operational errors are generally handled within the aviation agency , but officials of the national transportation safety board , an independent agency that regularly receives reports on such operational errors , became involved because an unusually large number of planes were in the sector when the error occurred , complicating the situation in the air on closer investigation , however , the faa found that there were three errors that night , said james h washington , acting director of the agency s air traffic services office in washington one investigator said events identified by the center s computers as operational errors had been reviewed by managers , who often reinterpreted radar data improperly and concluded that no violation of the separation rules had occurred he called it creative qualityassurance why there were so many planes in the sector was another point of concern the immediate reason appeared to be congestion and detours caused by thunderstorms , but a flow control center in herndon , va , is supposed to coordinate activity among the centers to prevent overloading any of them increased error rates draw the attention of faa headquarters , and some experts believe that local managers were trying to keep a low profile mr washington said underreporting in the past might be part of the reason for the recent jump in error rates , but he cautioned that there was no identifiable pattern to the operational errors but the president of the local union chapter of the national air traffic controllers association said that managers had an incentive to falsify data the more operational errors a facility has , the more trouble the air traffic manager gets into , said the president , patrick r forrey mr washington said that his staff had not identified any unreported errors beyond the ones on june 23 but that the aviation agency had rearranged management responsibilities at the center and made quality assurance a fulltime job for one manager previously , no one had that job full time mr forrey , the union official , said the number of errors had jumped lately , with eight in the last two weeks compared with an average of two or three a month , because of a staffing shortage we 're working short , and they wo n't use overtime , said mr forrey , who complained that sectors that would normally be staffed by 15 or 16 controllers were down by one or two people the center in oberlin is authorized to have 422 controllers but has only 389 , mr washington said controllers work around the clock , every day of the year mr washington disputed that staffing was a problem , saying , none of our followup investigations has identified staffing as a causal factor of operational errors he denied that managers at the center had become more reluctant to call in controllers on overtime controllers get about 50 an hour for overtime he said the aviation agency would hire 15 more controllers by sept 30 and more early next year the agency said that analysis of errors was crucial for maintaining safety and that it collected extensive statistics but there have been signs that the agency does not find all the errors the agency recently removed a supervisor from duty in the tower at la guardia airport in new york temporarily , after it discovered that he had failed to report an error controllers charged with an error are relieved of duty and sent for retraining those who accumulate two errors within two and a half years can be fired or reassigned to less busy offices

so my friend michael mandelbaum , the foreign policy expert from johns hopkins university , calls me the other morning with a trick question what s the difference , he asks me , between nato expansion and the indian nuclear tests \? think about it when the indians look at nato expansion , argued mr mandelbaum , they see the us extending nuclear protection to poland , hungary and the czech republic against russia the us has told these three countries none of which share a common border with russia or have any border disputes with moscow that at a time when the russian communist regime that once occupied central europe has been overthrown and replaced with russian democrats , and this new russian government has withdrawn from central europe and signed sweeping nuclear arms reduction treaties , poland , hungary and the czech republic nevertheless need and are entitled to nuclear protection from moscow at the same time , adds mr mandelbaum , the us is telling india that it is not really entitled to nuclear protection from china a china with which india shares a long , disputed border that has been the subject of a bloody war , a china where communists still rule and where democrats have been suppressed and a china that has not only refused to enter into any nuclear arms reduction treaties but is expanding its nuclear arsenal what s more , the us has told the indians that their nuclear tests were just a dangerous symbolic political gesture by the ruling hindu nationalists to thrill their followers let s see now a political gesture for domestic politics but with longterm , negative strategic consequences not readily apparent today hmm this indian nuclear test is exactly like nato expansion what s the lesson here \? it s that nato expansion , india s nuclear tests and , i would add , israel s refusal to accept us proposals to break the palestinianisraeli stalemate because not every rightwinger in the cabinet agrees are all manifestations of the same phenomenon the collapse of the coldwar international system and the creation of the illusion that the world is now safe for countries to drive their foreign policies solely by their domestic needs of the moment the cold war was a bad thing , notes mr mandelbaum , but it was nevertheless an international system that did provide a certain discipline and impose a certain prudence , by threatening very serious costs to anyone who would go too far in indulging his domestic whims on the world stage the soviet union was there to block any nato expansion with its own nukes it was there to arm israel s arab foes at a moment s notice and the us was there to defend pakistan at the drop of a hat reckless policies could and did have immediate , lifeanddeath consequences but the collapse of the coldwar system has changed that it has created more space for assertive , domestically driven foreignpolicy initiatives that assume few , if any , external costs that s because the international system that replaced the cold war globalization of markets and technologies provides a different set of disciplines in the coldwar system you could be punished immediately and brutally by either superpower for strategic misbehavior , but economic misbehavior tended to be tolerated or ignored in today s globalization system you are punished immediately and brutally by the supermarkets for economic misbehavior \( see indonesia \) , but more politicalstrategic misbehavior is tolerated up to a point this is because the immediate disciplining mechanism of two competing superpowers is gone , and therefore punishment now often has to await action by the un , nato , some ad hoc coalition or global investors the coldwar system was good at restraining missile madness , by threatening those who misbehaved with the death penalty the globalization system is better at restraining economic madness by threatening those who misbehave with loss of investment and bankruptcy which is why nato expansion , indian nuclear tests and israeli obstinacy are all playing with fire they are all acts of domestically driven foreign policy in a world system that is now safe for countries to be reckless but not safe for them to be ridiculous actions still have consequences , the possibility of miscalculation and unintended escalations is still alive and well , and they can burst the restraints of any international system
moscow , aug 31 russia s top network news program , vremya , led off tonight with parliament s rejection of viktor s chernomyrdin as prime minister , the ruble s continued wobbliness and the anniversary of diana s death then it flagged fascinating plans by muslim extremists for several villages in rural dagestan and oh , yes the president of the united states arrives tuesday morning for a summit meeting with the president of russia , boris n yeltsin that item was relegated to the second half of the newscast such meetings used to be called summits for a reason one can harken to reykjavik , where reagan and gorbachev nearly disarmed , or vienna , where khrushchev took kennedy to the woodshed , or even washington , where mr yeltsin ascended to the world stage on the arm of george bush it would hardly be fair to call the latest meeting a nadir there still are important issues to chew on but in russia , at least , it is close to a nonevent four newspapers published monday issues in moscow \( most newspapers take the day off \) , including two serious journals , sevodnya and komsomolskaya pravda not one mentioned the next day s meeting not merely on page 1 , but anywhere there s no enthusiasm , said sergei karaganov , a foreign policy specialist and sometime adviser to foreign minister yevgeny m primakov it s not an issue for the simple reason that there are more important issues on the agenda most people , even in the political class , do not even suspect or remember that there is a meeting indeed , the most spirited comment on the summit meeting came today from russia s wildesteyed nationalist , vladimir v zhirinovsky , who said people with russia s high moral standards had no business meeting with a man who cannot settle his relations with a secretary to an extent , russians can be excused for their indifference in the judgment of most experts , the country is in its worst political crisis since 1993 , when mr yeltsin s tanks shelled parliament to put down a rebellion , and perhaps since the soviet union dissolved in 1991 the great national issues these days , discussed everywhere , are the number of rubles a dollar will buy and the odds of a civil war or a putsch mr clinton s arrival seems trivial in comparison , especially since he has little but moral support to lend russia s democrats after their calamitous sevenyear experiment with capitalism mr clinton s threeday visit will cover the usual bases , from international terrorism to the spread of nuclear weapons to disarmament to average russians indeed , to russia s parliament and much of its executive branch none of them hold a candle right now to the 40 percent rise in the cost of cooking oil at local markets or their almost complete inability to tap savings accounts at the neighborhood bank for mr clinton this visit is also a comedown his advisers first held out the meeting as a glittering prize for russia should it finally ratify the start 2 nuclear weapons treaty unfortunately , the gettogethers are not so prized anymore , and the communistcontrolled parliament was more than happy to let the treaty languish , even if it kept mr clinton out of town and so the president s trip has been recast primarily as an economic pep talk for mr yeltsin and his troops , urging them to stay the agonizing course to freemarket prosperity what i want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy thing to do is not the right thing to do , mr clinton said today in virginia , in an apparent reference to alternatives to capitalism the easy thing to do would be to go back to the way they did it before , and it s not possible if there is a problem with this message , it is that russians have heard it several times from virtually every western leader , and with the ruble s drop of nearly 40 percent this month alone , it may be starting to ring a bit false the west may have had the best of intentions , mr karaganov , the policy specialist , said today , but its advice and mr yeltsin s westerntrained advisers have brought about the total collapse of the economy and effectively bankrupted most of the russian bourgeoisie in the last few days as so the little summit news that is playing in moscow this week , on talk radio and even in some newspapers , is more often the refrain sung this afternoon by kazbek tzikou , a communist legislator from the depressed southern region of kuban yeltsin stands over everyone like a cobra and forces them to do what his friend bill wants , mr tzikou told the lower house of parliament today tell clinton not to come people would tear him to pieces if they could let him go to the moon with his advice and his dollars nothing personal , of course tell the american people that we wish peace and accord with them , mr tzikou added photo a representative from ryazan commercial enterprises picketed yesterday in front of russia s central bank in moscow his placard demanded the resignation and trial of sergei

through another lens my years with edward weston by charis wilson and wendy madar illustrated 376 pp new york north point press farrar , straus giroux 35 when the photographer edward weston , strapped for cash and tired of taking portrait photos to support himself , applied for a guggenheim fellowship in the early 1930 s , his list of sponsors situated him comfortably in the pantheon of american modernism the collector walter arensberg , the painters charles sheeler and rockwell kent , and the gallery owner karl nierendorf were among those to champion his cause but whereas most applicants filled many dense pages with their project descriptions , the taciturn weston confined his to a single sentence saying he would continue his epic series of photographs of the west from satires on advertising to ranch life , from beach kelp to mountains in the 10 lines allotted for a history of his education and training , he put only selftaught there was ample space for scholarships and fellowships weston wrote , none on professional affiliations he remarked , i avoid them of his previous positions , he wrote , with the exception of a few months of federal work i have worked for myself for over 25 years this is how weston s personality emerges in through another lens , written by his former wife and model , charis wilson , with the assistance of wendy madar , a columnist for the corvallis \( ore \) gazettetimes as in his camera work , weston is blunt and candid , his style disarmingly lean and straightforward but could the man who took photographs as lusty and celebrative as weston s nudes and still lifes really have been as dry and remote as wilson depicts him \? why is her account so lacking in the flair and creativity that fired her subject \? wilson was 19 years old and weston 48 when they met in 1934 in carmel , calif soon she was his model and they became lovers , remaining together for 11 years in a partnership and marriage in which she posed for him , assisted him at work and wrote texts he illustrated writing with hindsight half a century later , she has made a noble attempt at clarity and objectivity , but she is selfcontrolled to the point of inertia this should be a sexier book weston s images of wilson go far beyond the boundaries of reportage stunning forays into the human body as abstract form , they are also about flesh and blood wilson has diligently reconstructed aspects of her former husband s life and worked hard to repudiate ben maddow s biography , edward weston 50 years \( 1973 \) , toward which she voices much animus but while trying to correct maddow s book and subsequent aricles that in her eyes rendered weston a clicheridden myth created by people who had never known him , she fails to establish why we might want to have known him to begin with wilson s strength is that she is both conscientious and guileless describing one of the first afternoons when , still a teenager , she posed in the nude for the older man , what she dwells on is his use of the hornrimmed pincenez she had noticed clipped to his jacket the night they met he wore these glasses to focus his shot in the graflex hood over his camera , but pulled them off and tossed them over his shoulder they were suspended on a cord to look at his subject a few feet away he would then retrieve the eyepiece by pulling the cord this is a graphic description of the sort of issues that are often of primary concern to a visual artist , far more than the gratuitous interpretation technicians like weston deplore but although wilson touches on weston s appeal for her , one longs for more of the ardor and , assuming it existed , pleasure in this early encounter restraint , however , sometimes scores its victory the guggenheim foundation responded to weston s abrupt replies by granting the photographer 2 , 000 , which enabled him and wilson to buy a new ford v8 and head to death valley and the mojave and colorado deserts for a year wilson provides informative details about the material issues of the photographer s life in this and other periods we learn of weston in the desert , covering the windows of that new ford with a heavy tarp to make the car his darkroom wilson portrays weston in the dunes before dawn waiting for the precise moment when the rising sun made shadows in the ripples and highlighted their contours so that he could take his shot instead of imposing her own ego , wilson elucidates weston s technique she describes his device of applying butter to cats' whiskers to hold the creatures still while they licked it off until the photographer would emit a high squeak that summoned them to face the camera as he snapped the shutter we encounter him framing images all over the united states to illustrate walt whitman s leaves of grass but wilson provides too many details and avoids charm too deliberately this memoir would benefit from more on weston s art and less on his dental care and sock preferences \( white \) the food descriptions are gratuitous and ghastly old pea soup turned cold and solid , coffee in which bits of gray mush and bacongrease globules floated along with coarse grounds and meals of fish balls in bouillon combined with a can of tomatoes or ham steaks drowned in butter weston s struggle and austerity were real , but unfortunately this repulsive cuisine encapsulates the anhedonia that permeates too much of the book
the port of new york and new jersey s days as the epicenter of maritime trade on the eastern seaboard may be numbered halifax , nova scotia , according to a moody s report , has grabbed about 10 percent of its midwestbound cargo business in recent years sealand and maersk , carriers whose leases start expiring next year , have been shopping for a deepwater port along the atlantic coast this summer the message delivered by their focus on alternative ports is louder than a ship s horn the two states must drop their rivalry over jobs and develop a joint strategy to insure the harbor s future as one of the world s premier ports of call none of this will be easy dredging for deepwater terminals and improving rail and truck access will require hundreds of millions of dollars the environmental obstacles will be challenging as well but these costs will be far lower than the price of vacillation why stunt the potential of a port that generates 92 , 320 direct jobs and hundreds of millions in taxes \? nothing illustrates the tortoiselike pace of redevelopment more than the schedule for deepening the kill van kull the harbor s gateway to the port newarkport elizabeth complex from 40 to 45 feet dredging of the waterway is supposed to start later this year and will be completed by 2003 or 2004 but between 2001 and 2003 , the sealand and maersk alliance expects to begin deploying megaships requiring channel depths of 50 feet or more when fully loaded ports like norfolk , va , and baltimore offer that depth , making them attractive candidates for new business from asia via the suez canal and the atlantic the army corps of engineers' study of potential deepwater areas in the harbor is not due until late 1999 given the normal cycle of environmental and congressional review , deepening the kill van kull to 50 feet or more will not happen before 2009 unless the region and its congressional delegations put the review process on a fast track the kill van kull is by no means the only attractive option the military ocean terminal in bayonne , nj , could be dredged to 50 feet without the blasting the kill van kull needs , and its rail access could be upgraded but with other cities vying to be the east coast s first megaship port , this region s first choice should be the site with the shortest construction turnaround for dredging and landside development if the harbor needs several deepwater terminals , building one in brooklyn might make sense , provided it was linked to a rail freight tunnel , a project in its infancy , and to vastly improved highways brooklynites and new yorkers would have to decide whether the regional benefits of a terminal would outweigh the benefits of other forms of land use no joint plan of action , however , would be complete without a heavy , bistate investment in cleaning up the hudson and its tributaries , which , despite improvements , continue to flush tainted sediment into the harbor the 1997 ban on disposing of contaminated dredge material in the ocean , as well as tight restrictions on doing so in the harbor , have spurred promising pilot projects , but not a fullblown disposal industry one advocacy group , the environmental defense fund , suggests that companies with decontamination technologies be invited to develop plans for dealing with toxic sites upstream an aggressive program over several decades would result in cleaner sediment moving into the harbor that would certainly lower dredging costs because clean material is cheaper to dispose of and has onland uses dramatic , not incremental , progress on any of these fronts will require more than interagency collegiality only the sustained involvement of two governors and one mayor can keep the port s 21stcentury potential from drifting out to sea
on various levels the federal tax code and the internal revenue service have been under attack last year , congress held hearings on reported irs abuse earlier this month , vice president al gore called for a friendlier irs there is talk of eliminating the income tax entirely and replacing it with a national sales tax , and seemingly everyone decries how complicated the tax code is stuart kessler of ardsley , a certified public accountant , lawyer and senior tax partner at the manhattan firm of goldstein golub kessler company , recently became chairman of the american institute of certified public accountants he said he hopes to change the image of accountants he is not , he wants people to know , a bean counter and begin outreach programs to encourage minorities to enter accounting the association recently started approving sale sites on the internet , assuring the public that the sites provide the services they claim and that credit cards are being protected mr kessler , a cpa for about 40 years , was named one of the country s leading tax practitioners by money magazine in 1997 and was listed among the 100 most influential people in accounting by accounting today in 1995 here are excerpts of a recent conversation q you make a point that you want to change the image of the cpa what is that image and why is it the wrong one \? a it is really our grandparents' image that was handed down to our parents and down to us that of somebody who is basically a number cruncher , who is conservative with a green eye shade and rolledup sleeves i 've been trying for over 20 years to bring to the public s attention the fact that we 're a different breed now we are now computer literate we 're broad thinking we look to do things for business and individuals that are far beyond what our grandparents thought we did in fact , the students today do n't learn to add in any college they use computers they used to use adding machines but today , even on the cpa exam you can use a calculator when i took the exam , we 'd spend half our time adding and subtracting and multiplying that s no longer we 're business consultants we bring a lot to the table for individuals and businesses estate planning , financial planning , systems and health care we 're all over the place i 've long felt a great tv show is in the waiting dealing with cpa s i think it could be compelling tv drama dealing with technology and human relations q congress recently had hearings on irs abuse were the horror stories just anecdotal , or are problems of abuse widespread \? a i'm a modest irs defender they have a duty to perform , and they get their marching orders from the congress many congress people pound on the irs and blame the tax code but what they do is based on what congress promulgates congress puts in a myriad of crazy laws , which they did last year 804 pages of complications and then they say , boy , you guys in the irs , you should simplify it the congress people are the ones that create the mess i say all the time that a congressman or senator should not be permitted to vote on a tax bill until they 've prepared their own tax returns in around 1989 , for example , they did this terrible thing putting on a 15 percent excise tax on retirement funds , in addition to the state tax and income tax i said at the time this will not fly when congress people start to retire and that s exactly what happened when they started to retire they saw this heinous tax could in effect bring people over the 100 percent tax point it was repealed last year as for the irs , there are abuses there are aggressive agents there are aggressive managers by and large they 're like any of us we try to do our best q you say that people who make these laws often do n't know the ramifications of what they 're adopting \? how do we get around that \? a i 'll tell you a really far out way of doing it i think somewhere along the line , in the year 2050 when none of us will be opining on this , there probably will have to be a domestic president and a foreign policy president a domestic congress and a foreign congress the breadth of knowledge to run the country is so incredibly vast that we ca n't expect an ordinary man or woman to go up to capitol hill and learn all about commerce , industry , agriculture , taxes , foreign affairs all of those things we 're in a era of specialization just to know the tax code itself we have to go back to wilbur mills , the famous wilbur mills that got caught in the fountain in washington with fanny fox , to find someone in congress that knew the tax laws inside out q can flattax proposals for the income tax really simplify things \? a there are a couple of issues they figure that those who do simple forms can use a postcard for filing the postcard does n't leave room for the listing of dependents before listing dependents by name and with social security number was required , people were writing in all sorts of dependents i had an experience about 14 years ago of a woman who when i asked who her dependents were , said only tommy and i said , is that your child \? she said , my cat she had been claiming the cat as a dependent if you eliminate the requirement that dependents be identified , the fraud will just go exponentially where it was

dimension if you confess your sins , do your penance , you are forgiven jim phelan , the head coach at mount st mary s for 45 years , conceded that his team could not have attracted an athlete of

assistant basketball coach anderson had forged a relationship with whitaker at the request of cleveland null , anderson s dentist , whose son had played with whitaker at oak hill academy anderson counseled whitaker before his sentencing and signed him to a letter of intent while he was in prison whitaker , from raleigh , nc , had led oak hill , a prep school in mouth of wilson , va , that is well known for basketball , to a 333 record in 199495 he was considered one of the top 25 high school players in the country , and had blocked 11 shots in the capital classic allstar game to break patrick ewing s record he was going to play in the highly visible atlantic coast conference and face the likes of duke , north carolina and maryland now his opponents will be commuter schools like wagner , long island university and quinnipiac in the unglamorous northeast conference off the court , his greatest challenge will be to move beyond what he calls a very unfortunate situation playing at virginia s recreational center , whitaker was involved in an extremely physical pickup game with some of the school s football players maurice anderson had fouled whitaker hard on a few occasions , and the two had exchanged words whitaker left the gym , borrowed a blade from a friend and came back he opened a gash on anderson s face that required 75 stitches to close anderson suffered

at mount st mary s athletic office at the same time , i do n't dwell on it i have to do what i have to do whitaker described his prison experience as a suspended blur in which he focused his thoughts toward when he would resume his life on the outside when i went in , i sort of understood that everything that i have just came to a standstill , he said nothing was lost he read voraciously he did hundreds of pushups and ran countless miles in place daily in his prison dormitory he even played pickup games with other inmates everything he did was to prepare himself for freedom yet the present still has a limbolike quality whitaker has been living with null s family in nearby gettysburg , pa , until he moves into a campus dorm , perhaps as soon as monday until his basketball career starts , he works as a janitor on campus in the afternoon for a little more than 5 an hour , occasionally skipping work to audit a class in the morning , he shoots 200 baskets , then runs a mile and does wind sprints i'm trying to figure out where i 've left off , whitaker said phelan is prohibited from watching whitaker s workouts , but the center s teammatestobe occasionally sneak a peek when you think about driving to the basket and the defense collapses on you and you can dish to a guy who you know is just going to dunk it he s going to finish the play , it s a lock that s unbelievably exciting , mount st mary s forward tony hayden said whitaker , aware that he is under scrutiny , has been careful about the company he keeps one of his friends is forward newton gayle we hang out every day , gayle said of whitaker nice guy , nice attitude , very peaceful within himself very social with everybody none of my teammates have voiced any objections about melvin everybody s being very supportive about it even though whitaker chose mount st mary s because of its lack of distractions , he expects plenty of them when he suits up for a game i expect to be taunted , whitaker said it s a mental game and a physical game , anything to interfere with my game , period phelan , whose team is 44 over all and 22 in the northeast conference , is curious to see whitaker in action , but has been able to keep his anticipation in check i do n't miss what i 've never really had , phelan said i feel a lot of expectations from different people in a lot of different ways , said whitaker , who is expected to immediately improve the conference s worst rebounding team what it all boils down to is just being who i am and just doing what i can do don anderson , the assistant coach who brought him to the school , wants whitaker to graduate even if he does not finish his four years of eligibility whitaker said that he would take studies seriously , but that he would play in the national basketball association if the opportunity arose maurice anderson , meanwhile , would like to play in the national football league i wish i could be known for something else , he said about being

maurice sagoff , a reformed journalist who made a latelife name for himself abbreviating great literature into terse humorous verse , died on march 18 at a hospital near his home in acton , mass he was 88 and the author of shrinklits 70 of the world s towering classics cut down to size at first blush it might not seem all that obvious that , say , crime and punishment required reduction to 10 couplets , even \( or especially \) these uptight student axes pair fearful , with the cops aware yet vainglorious , he wo n't chicken till by saintly sonia stricken then confession , trial and sentence eight siberian years repentance floods his spirit , hangups cease , she will join him seeking peace in that bleak siberian hovel , watch him , sonia , with that shovel indeed , even mr sagoff had long been content with the dostoyevsky version then he read about a middle western university that had appropriated 2 million for a gymnasium and 20 , 000 for library books , and it set him to thinking , for mr sagoff a process that frequently veered into the absurd , in this case producing the notion that with library space clearly at a premium , what the world needed was a oneinch shelf of great literature mr sagoff shared his view in a tongueincheek 1968 article for mademoiselle magazine , which included an abbreviated alice in wonderland \( holed up with bunny , preteen acts funny aberrations hallucinations wild scenes tarts , queens clearly , she needs therapy \) for mr sagoff , who for years had been dashing off doggerel to celebrate special occasions , the subversive excursion into mock literature might mercifully have ended there if the verse had not caught the eye and tickled the fancy of elizabeth charlotte , a new york book editor as ms charlotte recalled , she wondered if mr sagoff had enough similar verses to justify a book , called him and reached his wife , who assured the editor that her husband had composed dozens of shrinklits it was not until after she had commissioned a book that the editor discovered that mr sagoff had no such supply but had been spurred by her interest to churn them out first published by doubleday in 1970 , the book was an immediate sensation , making the new york times bestseller list and eventually becoming a staple for workman publishing company , which issued a version in 1980 including modern classics like portnoy s complaint \( alec portnoy , none too choosy , went for any willing floozy still a jerk in matters phallic alec also went for alec \) by the time shrinklits , his only book , was published , mr sagoff , a native of cambridge , mass , had graduated from boston college , spent one happy decade working as a research librarian for the boston public library system and two miserable decades working as regional editor for fairchild publications gratefully taking early retirement in 1954 , he was contentedly managing the visitor center at the boston children s museum when he came up with the idea for shrinklits the success of the book , which has sold more than 150 , 000 copies and is still in print , spurred him to sell his verse to a variety of publications , including the new york times he had recently finished a volume of clerihews , a rarefied and not especially celebrated form of verse whose four lines always begin with a name , a format that allowed mr sagoff to continue his interest in literature \( oscar wilde married , and fathered a child , which proves , you might say , he was not toujours gai \) while expanding his humorous horizons to fields like painting \( michelangelo buonarroti carried his own personal potty high up in the sistine to keep it pristine \) and anthropology \( pithecanthropus , said mrs erectus , your friends , the big apes , may reject us , but i think it s time you began to stand up and act like a man \) for reasons that might seem all too obvious , he had planned to have it published privately mr sagoff , whose first wife died in 1969 , is survived by his second wife , charlotte two children , sara mitter of montpellier , france , and mark , of bethesda , md , and four grandchildren
fort belvoir , va , march 14 when military jurors here considered the sexual misconduct charges against sgt maj gene c mckinney , they were caught in the same muddle that often complicates such harassment cases , whether civilian or military whom to believe when a woman says one thing and a man says another faced with conflicting testimony , little physical evidence , six female accusers whose credibility was questioned and a defendant with an otherwise shining reputation , the jurors concluded they could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes had been committed the eight jurors , four officers and four enlisted soldiers , exonerated sergeant major mckinney on 18 of 19 charges , finding him guilty of one count , obstruction of justice in keeping with practice in courtsmartial , the jurors did not make themselves available for comment the sergeant major was on trial here for many offenses that would not be crimes in the civilian world but the uniform code of military justice sets higher standards of conduct to maintain an orderly fighting force and prevent abuses of power in a hierarchical system where men and women live and work together 24 hours a day the higher standard is necessary , legal experts generally agreed , because the stakes are higher life and death for the soldiers themselves and for the defense of the nation but in cases like sergeant major mckinney s , where an unwanted kiss is considered assault and a provocative remark a solicitation of adultery , a courtmartial may be too blunt an instrument for determining right and wrong , some legal scholars said there are nuances to interpersonal relationships like these , said eugene r fidell , president of the national institute of military justice but the switch only has two positions on and off it may be a poor fit to use the criminaljustice system here with only one charge to consider , the penalty phase of the courtmartial , which begins on monday , promises to be brief sergeant major mckinney could receive five years in prison , a dishonorable discharge and loss of retirement benefits , although legal observers doubt that he will serve any time still , even a discharge or reduction in rank could cost him dearly in retirement benefits , a prized perquisite and his stellar career he rose from the peanut fields of florida to the highest enlisted rank in the army lays in ruin despite his nearly complete exoneration mr fidell pointed to what seemed at times an odd dissonance between the charges and the events in the mckinney case charge i , specification 1 , for example , was maltreatment of staff sgt christine fetrow , for repeatedly calling her and asking her to come for drinks to the hotel where he was staying charge iii , specification 4 , was indecent assault of sergeant fetrow for grabbing her waist , hugging her and kissing her face and additional charge i , assault and battery , is for touching maj michelle guzelman on her arm with his hand and then pulling her toward him mr fidell said that , without trivializing the concept of sexual harassment , provoking outrage over an invitation for drinks or a hamhanded physical advance can be difficult , especially when a conviction could have landed the sergeant major in prison on paper , you could jam those facts into those categories , yes , mr fidell said but if the jurors think the categories have taken an artificial turn , they wo n't play we have n't completely decoupled the notion of moral stigma from criminal law and we are trying to use criminal law here to penalize conduct that society tells us has little if any stigma in the classic moral sense but in the context in which the charges were made against sergeant major mckinney , the army had little alternative but vigorous prosecution , mr fidell and others said there had been the debauchery of the navy tailhook convention and the resulting scandal the case of the air force bomber pilot kelly flinn and , most recently , the scandal of army drill sergeants' abusing young female recruits at the aberdeen proving ground in maryland all eyes were on the military district of washington to see how it would handle the mckinney case as a practical matter the army had no choice given where our society and the defense establishment were when the case unfolded , mr fidell said the army needed to provide a forum , for its own purposes and for the vindication of the rights of the accusers if there was not trial , the army would still be on the defensive a year from now about whether it really cared about the interests of women in a coeducational workplace this way the army appears to have spared no effort in bringing him to justice in more pointed language , that is just the charge that sergeant major mckinney s civilian lawyer has leveled against the army that it staged a show trial because of media attention and public opinion , and that his client faced courtmartial while other , more senior officers were permitted to retire quietly after similar complaints were filed
james t pyle , who got such a boyhood thrill from charles a lindbergh s pioneering solo flight across the atlantic that he devoted his life to aviation , died on april 1 at a hospital near his home in oyster bay , ny he was 84 and had become something of a pioneer himself as the first deputy federal aviation administrator , he was widely known as a father of modern air control systems his family said the cause was complications from a stroke to say that mr pyle was an impressionable teenager would be an understatement a new york native who was 13 when lindbergh took off from roosevelt field in may 1927 , mr pyle , the son of a wealthy insurance man who formed a precursor of the blue cross system , endured groton on the ground , but soon after he got to princeton he was off to the wild blue yonder , learning to fly during his college days and joining pan american airways soon after his graduation in 1935 curiously , although he flew at every opportunity , including ferrying clippers from base to base , and eventually accumulated more than 14 , 000 hours of flying time , mr pyle , who owned a series of singleengine planes , was never a pan am pilot , but worked in administrative posts before entering the navy in world war ii and serving as an air controller in the south pacific after the war , mr pyle helped start an air taxi service linking denver , then a neglected city in the nation s airline network , with other cities unfortunately , the venture succeeded so well that major airlines moved in and doomed the business determined to play even a peripheral role in aviation , mr pyle then formed a company to launder airline uniforms at the denver airport , but within a few years the alltooappropriately named terminal laundry succumbed , and mr pyle , who had invested most of his family fortune in the enterprise , lost his shirt fortunately , a 10 , 000 investment in a friend s startup business manufacturing telephone switch boxes eventually restored his wealth , but in the meantime , mr pyle needed a job , and through an old navy buddy he got one in 1953 , as special assistant to the assistant secretary of navy for air in washington three years later , in 1956 , another friend , charles j lowen , the civil aeronautics administrator , recruited mr pyle as his deputy , and when mr lowen died a few months later , mr pyle succeed him as administrator at a time of exponential growth in commercial aviation , mr pyle made air safety a major priority among other things , he helped to develop a vast new system of radarbased ground controls and other safety improvements , typically taking the controls to test the latest jumbo jets and visiting national airport at night for a firsthand check of runway lights he also became an architect of the plan to combine the activities of the commerce department s civil aeronautics administration and major functions of the civil aeronautics board into a powerful new independent agency , the federal aviation agency , which came into existence on jan 1 , 1959 , with e r quesada as administrator and mr pyle as deputy administrator as deputy administrator , and as acting administrator during mr quesada s frequent absences and through the first months of the kennedy administration , mr pyle extended his interest in air safety , among other things imposing the regulation requiring commercial pilots to retire at 60 after leaving government in 1961 , he worked as the washington representative of an air equipment manufacturer , then came to new york in 1964 as director of the aviation development council , a private group formed by airlines and the port authority primarily to deal with the issue of airport noise abatement mr pyle also developed education programs to encourage aviation careers for minority and other new york schoolchildren he continued to fly until he was 73 \( and forgot to lower the wheels before making a landing \) , but by then mr pyle had had his share of triumphs in the sky , none perhaps so thrilling as the day in may 1977 when at the age of 63 he climbed into the cockpit of a silver 1928 ryan brougham , a sister ship of lindbergh s spirit of st louis , and a plane that had been flown by both lindbergh and jimmy stewart , and took off from bethpage , ny , for a short hop that commemorated a flight 50 years earlier that thrilled a nation and gave an impressionable teenager a career mr pyle is survived by his wife , ann two daughters , diana rowan of manhattan and ann brickley of malvern , pa three sons , david , of washington , gordon , of jericho , vt , and john , of halesite , ny , and nine grandchildren photo james t pyle
chicago , dec 1 one team of huskies , in the midst of a multipletimezone road trip , played tired the other huskies , the nation s newly anointed no 1 team , was just awful in the end , it took an acrimonious huddle and a salty tirade from forward kevin freeman to set his connecticut teammates' minds right and their pressure defense in motion tonight on the way to a 6948 victory over washington in the opening game of the great eight tournament at the united center in the second game , an allround effort by the senior forward heshimu evans led no 8 kentucky past no 7 kansas , 6345 freeman s outburst came with a little more than 15 minutes to play and no 15 washington within 4039 uconn point guard khalid elamin had just picked up his fourth foul , and until then , his team s offense had struggled , primarily because of elamin s poor decisionmaking kevin made sure everyone knew in no uncertain terms that we needed to forget about what we were doing with the ball and stop them , uconn coach jim calhoun said he said it in a way that got their attention over the next seven and a half minutes , with elamin on the bench , uconn produced a 202 run that began with nosetonavel pressure and ended with a clinic of insideoutside shotmaking by richard hamilton , a player of the year candidate who scored 11 of his gamehigh 17 points in the second half it overwhelmed washington , which had come here from hawaii after winning the big island invitational over the weekend and is in the midst of a twoweek , 7 , 000mile road swing you have to give them the credit for the pressure , said washington coach bob bender , who refused to blame fatigue for the loss we needed to make some stops and use the 45second clock , and they did n't allow us to nor did calhoun allow elamin off the bench in what the sophomore confessed was the most humbling night of his career he scored 10 points , turned the ball over five times and did not dish one assist in a dismal performance he also earned calhoun s wrath first , when he was yanked from the game with 486 seconds left in the first half after losing the ball , and then when he returned with 44 seconds left , presumably to run the final play of the half on that play , the chunky point guard raced the length of the court on the dribble the drive got him only a third foul , for charging at halftime , in the tunnel on the way to the locker room , an animated calhoun stayed on elamin you still got all the answers \? he barked at his guard afterward , calhoun said flatly , khalid was n't delivering the offense elamin agreed i'm not happy how i played , he said at point guard especially , you have to take the criticism i earned it i'm not happy about it , but we won , and i 've got to get this game out of my mind and move on the huskies found their way by moving hamilton to point guard and taking help wherever they could find it i have to handle the ball more and do the little things to keep the game going , hamilton said of his seamless transition to running the team freeman , who sounded the alarm after a first half in which connecticut turned the ball over 15 times , contributed 12 points , 6 rebounds and a harassing defensive presence that resulted in a steal and a blocked shot off the bench , the sophomore guard albert mouring slashed through washington for 13 points 11 of them in the first half and battled for 5 rebounds but connecticut s uneven effort 46 percent shooting to go with 22 turnovers was enough to bury washington , which was not equipped to deal with the other huskies' athleticism washington shot only 345 percent and was outrebounded , 4828 when you get their point guard in foul trouble , you 'd think you 'd have them in trouble , said washington s donald watts , who had 12 points but there was no dropoff at all they 're great athletes calhoun and his huskies conceded it was not exactly a performance worthy of the no 1 ranking but none of them wanted to give the honor up you dream to be no 1 , and if you do n't want to , you do n't belong in college basketball , hamilton said kentucky s evans , a 66 swingman , got the wildcats off to a 4122 halftime lead , and the jayhawks never recovered he finished with 11 points , 11 rebounds and 6 assists as kentucky \( 61 \) shot 43 percent and pressed kansas \( 41 \) for 40 minutes the ball was coming my way in tonight s rhythm , evans said wayne turner led kentucky with 14 points and tayshaun prince added 10 in wednesday s games , no 21 utah \( 32 \) will meet rhode island \( 33 \) , and no 4 duke \( 41 \) will play no 9 michigan state \( 41 \) photo connecticut s kevin freeman , dunking over thalo green , contributed 12 points , 6 rebounds and a tonguelashing for his teammates \( reuters \)
boston pedro martinez is the richest player in baseball history he attained that status by being the best pitcher available last winter the red sox acquired him at the montreal expos' latest fire sale , then induced him to stay in boston beyond this season by giving him 75 million for six years money buys loyalty , and yesterday martinez was loyal to his employer , or at least his manager he made some comments that were politically correct under the circumstances , but on even superficial examination could not be taken seriously responding to a question about boston s pitching rotation , martinez , who did not face the yankees this weekend , asked , what s the difference between the yankees and the white sox \? chicago being the team he pitched against , and beat , last wednesday the yankees are in first place and the white sox are not , he said but believe me , there is nothing the yankees have that the white sox do n't if martinez pitched the way he thought or spoke , he would not be the richest player in baseball history if he really wants an answer to his question , there are 14 victories and 354 winningpercentage points difference between the yankees and the white sox translated into nonbaseball terms , the yankees and the white sox are as far apart as their cities they are in the same league , the american , but the white sox are not in the yankees' league no one in the american league is right now the yankees demonstrated their awesome dominance again yesterday , crushing the red sox for the second successive game , this time by 144 forget the accident of friday night s game , when the red sox rallied for four runs in the seventh inning and stole a 54 victory in the other two games , the yankees scored 26 runs , the red sox 7 \( shades of the 1978 fenway massacre \) that is the difference between the yankees and the red sox but martinez was talking about the difference between the yankees and the white sox , who happen to be the yankees' next victims and were the team the red sox played before the schedule dictated they play the yankees the question that was raised before the game was whether the red sox would have been wise to alter their starting rotation slightly so that martinez , the best pitcher in the league , could have pitched against the yankees in the weekend series the red sox needed every victory they could grab from the yankees , and martinez was more likely to win than any other starter boston manager jimy williams had the critical start could have been arranged by a simple flipflop of martinez with bret saberhagen , the recovered but still questionable veteran starter the red sox had a day off last monday , meaning that martinez could have pitched tuesday with his usual four days of rest he then could have pitched against the yankees yesterday but williams opted to keep his starters in rotation we have to pitch the people we have with the long haul in mind , the manager said before the game are you supposed to look at a 162game schedule or a threegame series \? is this september or is it may \? as a man named yogi might have said , september might have come early this year but that s only if the red sox have thoughts of wanting to catch the yankees in the al east race if they are thinking solely of the wildcard quest and they should be williams had no reason to tinker with the rotation martinez pitches against toronto today an almost certain victory today is better for the red sox and their wildcard dreams than an uncertain outcome against the yankees it s not up to me , martinez said when asked about pitching against the yankees i only came in the rotation the way i came i'm not the boss here the boss is jimy williams would he like the challenge of pitching against the best team \? every team is the best team to me , he said i 'll go against any team you bring up there with the same attitude i go against any other i faced them last year it was almost the same team i'm not afraid of facing them i can tell you that did the yankees get a break not facing him \? martinez leads the league with a 174 earned run average , 88 strikeouts and a 1000 winning percentage \( 50 \) no , i would n't say that , the righthander said they can beat me any time i can shut their butt down any time , too you got to play the game and see what happens in this game you ca n't tell what s going to happen from out here i could have probably gone out there and lasted less than derek lowe did lowe lasted an inning and a third saturday chances are that martinez would have lasted longer yesterday longer , too , than saberhagen , whom the yankees battered from the game after two and twothirds innings williams said he did n't want to change the rotation because he wanted to protect his starters , not spread them out too much had he switched saberhagen and martinez , saberhagen would have started last wednesday with six days' rest he is still coming back from two and a half years of shoulder problems , and williams apparently feels he needs consistency the problem is that after winning five and losing none of his first six starts , saberhagen has lost his last three while allowing 19 runs in 10 innings i 've always taken a lot of pride in staying away from big innings , saberhagen said i have n't been able to do that the last three starts they say bad things come in threes , and hopefully the bad things are over and done with saberhagen will find out saturday at yankee stadium if they are martinez will find out the following day if he is right , if there is no difference between the yankees and the white sox photo yanks' chuck knoblauch hit his second homer yesterday in as many days he had a grand slam on saturday \( c j gunther for the new york times \)
a meal is eaten , a whisky bottle drained , a foghorn sounded virtually nothing of real consequence occurs in long day s journey into night , and yet , in its way , it is one of the bloodiest plays ever written james tyrone and his agonized kin are oppressors and victims both , psychic cripples who swing their crutches at one another with quiet abandon wallowing in disappointment , they no longer believe in the things they once held sacred religion , art , parental authority they are lost , and in their unmoored state , unable to empathize , to connect all that really calls them to life , as they wander their unhappy summer home , nursing past grievances and reliving past hurts , is the reassuring ability to draw blood there is a twinge of pain on nearly every page of o'neill s epic tragedy try counting the twists of the knife committed by the four souls who make up this spectral family unit , and you quickly lose track which is why the revival of long day s journey by the irish repertory theater is so disappointing no need for a score card here the production , which opened last night , is absolutely painless under charlotte moore s tepid direction , the tyrones barely lay a glove on one another , reducing what might be an evening of draining invective to a rushed and mildly dyspeptic gripe session the intent may have been to avoid the kind of tablepounding overacting that can turn a huge play into something unbearable for an audience but ms moore has traded histrionics for blandness , and even with heavyweights in the cast like brian murray and frances sternhagen who seem compelling choices for the roles of the cheapskate father , james , and the morphineaddicted mother , mary the production lacks a certain esthetic heft something is definitely off when the most engrossing drinking scene is the one involving the maid , cathleen \( rosemary fine , who in a realistic , squareshouldered performance , lives up to her surname \) mounting long day s journey can be an act of hubris a director not only has to contend with the demons of o'neill s characters , but also with the ghosts of past productions , the memories of actors like ralph richardson and katharine hepburn or jason robards and colleen dewhurst , in the marquee roles by even less demanding measures , however , this revival , while skeletally proficient , is undistinguished you have only to witness the scene between james and his younger , tubercular son , edmund \( an oddly hardy paul mcgrane , whose only concession to consumption is one shallow cough \) , to get a sense of the missed opportunity it s the scene in which james first makes , and then horrifically qualifies , his vow to place edmund in a convalescent home , regardless of cost like so many of the brutal twists in the play , this one fixes the characters ever more firmly in their separate , private hells it is a shattering indictment of the father , who lives more in dread of the poorhouse than in devotion to his sons , and a devastating confirmation for edmund , tormented by the intimation that his birth brought on his mother s addiction , of his place in the family in this unspectacular account , the scene has no dramatic punch mr mcgrane misses the opportunity to help us understand what expectation of edmund s has been so cruelly crushed mr murray who , having played in everything from the entertainer to the little foxes over the past two years , is fast becoming a oneman repertory company , and ms sternhagen , who won a tony for her performance in the heiress , look as if they could be an old married couple all four tyrones , in fact , bear a credible resemblance to the others \( paul carlin , who plays the older son , jamie , actually is ms sternhagen s son \) mr murray , in particular , has some affecting moments , as when he provides historical context for the father s lack of generosity he is convincing in the depiction of james s coldly distancing selfpity still , none of the actors come terribly close to the complexity of their characters the problem is especially acute for ms sternhagen , whom ms moore makes the play s pivotal figure wearing a lacy white dress , she drifts in and out of the shabby living room , a ghostly bride haunting the tyrone men morning , noon and night ms sternhagen , however , captures only mary s distraction she fairly gallops through her speeches the whole play feels hurried , with great chunks seemingly lopped off with no consideration of mary s own , subtler venom mr carlin and mr mcgrane have a brotherly ease in their scenes together , but they both lack an ineffable quality , that weighty o'neillian essence , that fills out productions in which the battles are epic in scale akira yoshimura s design of the tyrone s new london cottage looks crammed into the irish rep s difficult space , and jason robert brown s lush musical interludes often sound like the underscoring for a harlequin romance long day s journey was meant to be a downer , but not of this particular variety long day s journey into night by eugene o'neill directed by charlotte moore produced by ciaran o 'reilly sets by akira yoshimura lighting

shortly after personal computers and wordprocessing programs became commonplace tools for writers , a brave new future for fiction was trumpeted in 1992 , robert coover informed the readers of the book review that the novel , as we know it , has come to its end hypertext , writing done in the nonlinear or nonsequential space made possible by the computer , would at last enable the reader to amble through a network of linked text blocks , or lexias instead of following a linear story dictated by the author , the reader could now navigate at will through an endless expansion of words proclamations about the death of the novel \( or , as coover s essay was titled , the end of books \) can still get a rise out of a surprising number of people , even though , so far , they 've all proved to be little more than empty , apocalyptic showboating six years after coover s essay was published , and five years after a second article by him , this one recommending several hyperfictions for the curious reader , the market for hardcover books may be flat , but over a million people have nevertheless bought charles frazier s literary novel cold mountain , and i 've yet to encounter anyone who reads hypertext fiction no one , that is , who is n't also a hypertext author or a journalist reporting on the trend surely those readers , however few , must exist , but what s most remarkable about hyperfiction is that no one really wants to read it , not even out of idle curiosity the most adventurous souls i know , people amenable to sampling cryptic performance art and even those most rare and exotic of creatures , readers of poetry who are n't poets themselves all shudder at the thought , for it s the very concept of hypertext fiction that strikes readers as dreary and pointless yet coover s announcement was n't the last of its kind recently janet h murray examined the future of readercontrolled narratives at length in her book , hamlet on the holodeck the future of narrative in cyberspace , and mark amerika started grammatron \( www grammatron com \) , a novellength hypertext work on the world wide web the promise that the fiction of the future will have no story , or a story of the reader s own devising , recalls a lily tomlin joke about the afterlife it turns out that there is sex in heaven , you just ca n't feel it that coover and hypertext authors and theorists like michael joyce , george p landow , stuart moulthrop and mark amerika apparently still believe in the eventual triumph of hyperfiction over the novel becomes less baffling when you understand that hypertext is a form of writing perfectly suited to contemporary literary theory in his aptly titled book web site , hypertext the convergence of contemporary critical theory and technology \( www stg brown edu projects hypertext landow ht contents2 html \) , landow observes that using hypertext , critical theorists will have , or now already have , a laboratory with which to test their ideas in fact , he says , hypertext is an almost embarrassingly literal embodiment of key poststructuralist notions what the laboratory of hyperfiction demonstrates , though , is how alienated academic literary criticism is from actual readers and their desires the theory of hyperfiction insists that readers ought to be , and long to be , liberated from two mainstays of the traditional novel linear narrative and the author the reader , cruelly forced to read one word after another to reach the end of a sentence , one paragraph after another to reach the end of a scene , will rejoice to learn that , according to coover , true freedom from the tyranny of the line is perceived as only really possible now at last with the advent of hypertext in reality , the common reader most likely will be surprised to be told that structured storytelling from the most basic beginningmiddleend scheme of fairy tales to more elaborately constructed , nonchronological literary narratives and frolics like murder mysteries is actually a form of oppression , rather than the source of delight it has always seemed in the past in jostein gaarder s novel sophie s world \( proof that a story can transform a seemingly uncommercial primer on philosophy into a popular book \) , a character describes a cat and a little girl in a room if a ball rolls across the floor , the cat will chase it , but the little girl will look to see where the ball came from story the idea that events happen in a specific , causal order is both the way we see the world and what interests us most about it , and story is fiction s trump card people who read for nothing else will read for plot , yet hyperfiction s advocates maintain that we find it confining and chafe against its limitations a primary source for the peculiar notion that linear narratives tyrannize their readers and need to be broken is the french critic roland barthes , who in s z , his booklength dissection of a balzac story , champions an ideal that he calls the writerly text it has no beginning it is reversible we gain access to it by several entrances , none of which can be authoritatively declared to be the main one barthes complains of the pitiless divorce which the literary institution maintains between the producer of the text and its user , between its owner and its consumer , between its author and its reader , which prevents the reader from gaining access to the pleasure of writing
washington , july 14 the federal aviation administration said this evening that it was fining america west airlines at least 25 million , and possibly 5 million , for violations of maintenance and operations requirements the fine , which the airline has agreed to pay , would be the largest ever paid by an air carrier , eclipsing the 2 million the agency fined delta air lines in november 1992 in 1986 , the agency said it was fining eastern airlines 95 million , but only 1 million was collected in a statement this evening , the company said it had reached an agreement with the faa to move forward in a spirit of partnership , to avoid the cost of protracted litigation and focus resources on improving operations and customer service it did not admit to any wrongdoing america west airlines has one of the top safety records in the industry , said richard goodmanson , president and chief executive , in the statement we take our responsibility to the flying public and the faa very seriously and we are pleased by the faa s willingness to work with the company the safety of our passengers was never affected thomas e stuckey , the acting deputy director of flight standards for the faa , said the airline , which is based in phoenix , had permitted 41 , 000 flights of its airbus a320 widebody jets without performing periodic inspections for cracks of the fuselage skin around the cargo and crew doors it also flew boeing 737 s and 757 s without proper installation of webbing meant to prevent cargo from shifting in flight , the faa said at another airline , fineair , a cargo jet crashed on takeoff in miami last year because of shifting cargo america west was also faulted for flying a boeing 757 that had problems with its elevator system , which controls the plane s attitude , nose up or nose down it either flew with an elevator unit that was inoperable or the device that monitors that function was inoperable , the faa said in assessing the fines , the faa deemed the airline safe to fly now all the operational and airworthiness items have been corrected , said mr stuckey , in a telephone conference call this evening mr stuckey said the airline would pay 25 million now the other 25 million is due in 12 months , unless the airline complies with an agreement to improve its operations the agreement calls for teams that include agency personnel to broadly review the airline s operations the airline said it had been inspecting the doors on its airbuses visually , but the airline did not follow the manufacturer s recommendation in 1994 to switch to monitoring the doors by using instruments the company said airbus had later changed its recommendation to postpone instrument inspections until 16 , 000 takeoffs and landings , a milestone that none of america west s airbus aircraft have reached mr stuckey of the faa said the airline s inattention to those inspections was inadvertent , they missed it , and was n't included in their program until we found it in december the airline also failed to supervise contractors performing maintenance on the planes , the agency said airlines are responsible for work done by subcontractors , and the agency has been concentrating on this area since the crash two years ago of a valujet airlines dc9 near miami , which occurred in part because of contractor errors the faa began bringing charges against america west last december and some violations were as recent as may , mr stuckey said the airline and the agency began negotiations in phoenix on monday , he said , and finished today the airline , which says it is the ninthlargest passenger carrier in the nation , reported strong first quarter earnings of 251 million , up from 14 million in the first quarter of 1998 its revenue for the last 12 months was about 19 billion , with earnings of 86 million america west , with headquarters in phoenix , also has hubs in las vegas , nev , and columbus , ohio the airline has 11 , 000 employees and 101 planes with mostly shorthaul routes , it flies nearly 600 flights a day , to 91 cities in this country and seven in mexico and canada
lakeland , fla , march 27 faced with a difficult decision on who will play left field and when , yankees manager joe torre handled his choice like a deft politician he decided to not decide darryl strawberry will play against righthanded pitchers , as expected , after smashing nine extrabase hits and driving in 13 runs in 63 atbats in the exhibition season but torre would not be more specific about how he will use tim raines and chad curtis , other than to say that curtis will start in left field on opening day and that he likes raines s ability to hit coming off the bench torre , instead , will make his decisions daily , rather than identifying a specific platoon neither raines nor curtis seemed particularly pleased raines was in many respects the best offensive player in camp , batting over 400 , and keeping his slugging percentage near 900 until recently curtis has played well and is the best defensive player of the trio when you come to spring training and you 're told you 're fighting for a job and you have the type of spring i had , raines said , you expect to get the job curtis said , i expected things to work themselves out a little bit more but raines and curtis said they understood torre s decision , because all three players had performed well and were healthy what he s done is fair , curtis said i 've said it over and over , i 'd like to play 162 games but it s just not going to happen raines said i 've been around a long time , and i know it s not what you do , but what they want like i said , i'm not going to worry about it i'm just going to be ready when they call my name with chili davis , the designated hitter , bothered by a right groin strain , two from among strawberry , raines and curtis may start in the opener on wednesday , when the angels will start the lefthanded chuck finley davis said today he hopes to be ready to play by then , but torre conceded there is a chance davis could miss the first game or two potential yankees bernie williams , the center fielder , and scott brosius , the third baseman , can become free agents after this season already there is speculation around baseball that the yankees will pursue two members of the san diego padres , third baseman ken caminiti and center fielder steve finley , who can become free agents after this season if it was early in my career , i 'd probably be a little timid about ny , caminiti , an 11year veteran , said this week , because it s definitely a different place it s a media market where they can get in your head that s what i 've been told , but it s all about making adjustments they definitely have an attitude there , but if you do your job and play hard , it s the same i plan on being a padre , but if it does n't happen , i 'll play for whoever has an interest in me asked of his possible interest in signing with the yankees , finley said , you 're not going to get an answer why would i say there s no way i'm going to go there \? i'm not going to get into that if i want to go there and it s right , i 'll go there but i would rather stay here the yankees will get a firsthand look at both this weekend in two exhibition games against the padres at san diego s qualcomm stadium irabu reports no pain hideki irabu threw 62 pitches in a bullpen workout today and reported no pain in his right elbow , giving torre more reason to believe irabu will be ready to make his scheduled start against oakland on april 5 irabu is scheduled to start in an exhibition game at san diego state on monday but torre seems to feel none of that will be an issue , based on irabu s insistence today that the sharp pain in his elbow has disappeared unless our interpreter does n't know what he s talking about , torre joked irabu said i was pretty satisfied with the way things went today i gradually increased the pace willie banks will most likely start in irabu s place if irabu goes on the disabled list banks is coming off a couple of poor starts against detroit today , he allowed five runs \( four earned \) in five innings , walking two and striking out two

and corruption and there s always more to do in the eight months since mexico s city s opposition mayor appointed him to office , he has dismissed police commanders accused of torture , auto theft , assault , kidnapping and narcotics trafficking last week , 63 detectives were dismissed after they tested positive for drug use three days later , he ordered the arrest of a prosecutor and eight subordinates after the jailcell rape of a teenage prostitute who sought police protection from her pimp along this march of dismal events , however , mr del villar had cause to brighten one recent day when , on a visit to a downtown police precinct , he heard a detective complain that typing up routine reports took hours on a manual typewriter could you use some computers \? mr del villar asked , savoring the july 21 settlement that followed his prosecution of international business machines on conspiracy charges related to a procurement contract ibm is to pay mexico city 375 million in cash and new computers , which he says will help to modernize the city s vast criminal justice bureaucracy we 're going to have lots of computers ! he said the ibm case is the largest achievement so far for mr del villar , whom mayor cuauhtemoc cardenas swore in last december with the pledge , we 're going to take the city back from the criminals mr del villar is under pressure to show progress before mr cardenas s expected presidential run in 2000 , but he faces a staggering challenge , not just because organized crime is so entrenched but also because the police are discredited and he faces daily nitpicking in a hostile press corruption has been mexico s disaster , because nobody has taken the law into account , said mr del villar during a breakfast of papayas and mangos at his downtown offices this is our chance to work for the rule of law mr del villar , who is 53 , presides over the attorney general s office of mexico city , supervising the city s 3 , 700officer detective

whom mr del villar discussed new york s efforts against police corruption during a dinner last year at the home in new york of victor gotbaum , the longtime union leader he was looking at what we 'd

mr del villar recalled he said that to be on the supreme court was just to be in limbo mr del villar got his own chance at reform when president miguel de la madrid appointed him in 1982 to head a campaign aimed at rooting out corruption eventually mr del villar concluded that he lacked presidential support and resigned , but not before arranging passage of a law requiring competitive bidding in government procurement contracts that was the law he accused ibm executives and city officials of violating when they arranged the 1996 purchase of a 26 million computer system his largest step toward political reform came after the 1988 presidential voting , which he denounced as fraudulent he quit the pri and helped mr cardenas form the party of the democratic revolution if the ibm case

the yankees worked out in near silence last thursday after learning that darryl strawberry had been found to have colon cancer but their mood had changed dramatically yesterday as they prepared for the start of the american league championship series strawberry is faring well , according to teammates who visited him in the hospital on sunday , and with his encouragement , they are focusing on the job at hand winning the final round of the playoffs , and then the world series , and assuring the team s potentially lofty standing in history the yankees' david wells will pitch against cleveland s jaret wright at yankee stadium tonight in game 1 of the fourofsevengame series the yankees swept the texas rangers in three games in the division series to advance to the alcs , while the indians beat the boston red sox , three games to one with one more victory , the yankees will match the singleseason record for combined victories in the regular season and postseason with 117 victories , they are one short of the record set by the 1906 cubs , who won 116 games in a 154game regular season and two in the world series a small group of yankees , including manager joe torre and pitcher david cone , visited strawberry at columbiapresbyterian medical center on sunday night , chatting with him for about 30 minutes he was very alert , torre said he looked real good i mean , he was sitting up , and of course the one complaint he had is that he is not going to be able to eat for a couple of days derek jeter said , he looked great , he talked normally , everything you would expect from straw the yankees intend to send small groups of players to see strawberry each day , for small doses of conversation scott brosius , the third baseman who sprained his ankle on friday in texas , stopped by yesterday after undergoing a cat scan that revealed no fractures brosius , who batted 400 with three runs batted in against the rangers , worked out after the tests and said he was fine and ready to play as of last night , the yankees intended to add outfielder ricky ledee as their 25th man , rather than another third baseman , mike lowell ledee will probably be used as a lateinning pinchrunner and defensive replacement there s no instability , brosius said , just a little bit of pain there brosius will probably bat ninth in tonight s game , two spots behind the rookie left fielder shane spencer , who is becoming a fixture in the yankees' postseason lineup tim raines will bat sixth and start as the designated hitter , rather than chili davis probably because raines is a little better at handling high fastballs , such as those thrown by wright cleveland manager mike hargrove and wright tried to play down the ill will caused by wright s two incidents with the yankees this season when he broke luis sojo s hand with a pitch in spring training , in what sojo believes was an intentional act , and when wright hit paul o'neill with a pitch on june 19 , prompting o'neill to offer personal commentary on wright as he walked to first base pitching inside is part of my game , and i'm not trying to hurt anybody or hit anybody , wright said but the bad feelings exist below the surface , and memories remain intact wells obliquely made reference yesterday to others who headhunt , after mentioning how sojo had his hand broken the yankees do not like the 22yearold wright , do not like what they perceive as his smugness , and though no one would say so for the record , they would love to score lots of runs against him wright pitched erratically this season , winning 12 and losing 10 and compiling a 472 earned run average but he throws very hard , and on those days when he is able to get his curveball over the plate for strikes , he can be very difficult to hit what the yankees will try to do , raines said , is make wright throw strikes , make him pitch deep into counts wright averaged 1744 pitches per inning this season , and the yankees will want to drive up that count and drive him off the mound in the middle innings wells made one start against the indians this season , beating them with eight solid innings on june 20 , when he struck out nine and walked none while yielding eight hits and two runs in eight innings wells , 50 in the postseason , has shown he has a knack for pitching in big games wells remembers that when he was a junior at point loma high school , in san diego , he started and lost a championship game and was angry about it for a year , then came back the next year to beat sweetwater for the cifsan diego section championship i am not a follower , and i believe that i am a leader going out there and trying to set the tone , wells said , especially if i get the ball first i am not afraid to fail , and i hate to lose the yankees won 7 of 11 games against the indians this season , including the last three meetings in the final week of the season , when both teams kept their best pitchers out of action to prevent the other side from getting one last look photos jaret wright was 21 with a 366 era against the yankees , while david wells was 10 with a 225 era against the indians \( associated press \)

mineola , ny , oct 27 an unexpected increase in school property taxes that is costing many homeowners in nassau county an estimated 100 more this year is causing a lot of finger pointing among republicans , democrats and local school board officials it s all the result of an antiquated county formula for figuring out tax rates that was compounded by a possible computer glitch in albany , according to county and school board officials it would take an albert einstein to figure it all out , said bruce nyman , leader of the democratic minority in the nassau county legislature everyone is blaming everyone else charles o shea , a republican who assumed his duties as chairman of the nassau county board of assessors 11 months ago , insists it is all much ado about nothing and part of an electionyear conspiracy to embarrass republicans in a county where residents are sensitive to any kind of tax increase if there has been any school tax increases , nine times out of ten it s due to a school budget increase approved by voters last spring , mr o shea said the amount of increase due to any change in the equalization rate is negligible it all started last march when the board of assessors challenged the rates set by the state office of real property services in albany for four classes of property in nassau county class one for detached homes , class two for apartments and condominiums , class three for utility company properties and class four for factories , offices and stores believing that the state s rate for both class two and class four were too low , the county filed an appeal with the state agency and convinced it to change the apportionment formula the state then evened out the pie and shifted the tax burden to homeowners and utilities in recent years , taxpayers have become used to small tax increases to account for inflation but when the year s tax bills arrived in mailboxes last week , homeowners in school districts with a large percentage of commercial properties found that their bill jumped a lot more than they were expecting for the average homeowner about 100 more than the 2 , 766 he paid in school taxes last year \( those taxpayers who have the bills sent directly to their mortgage lenders will see the increase the next time they receive a report on the escrow accounts from which their taxes are paid \) school board officials said they did not find out about the shift in the equalization formula until it was too late to tell voters in their districts we were off this year because the county never told us , said steven b witt , president of the nassausuffolk school boards association to prevent this situation in the future , the nassau county legislature approved legislation in june requiring the board of assessors to notify school districts of future challenges filed with the state that will be definitely help , said richard hirt , assistant superintendent for finances in the locust valley central school district the percentage of taxes that each group pays is based on an extraordinarily complex formula , but there is no doubt that this time around nassau county erred by putting a higher percentage on the homeowner he said that while voters in his district approved a 4 percent budget increase in april , it was difficult to determine how much of the new tax bill was due to the changes caused by the county and the state we determine how much we need to run the schools , but the rates come directly from the county , he said , noting that 87 percent of the tax base in locust valley was homeowners , about 10 percent commercial and 2 percent utility company properties , with no multiple family dwellings the state s real property office said it may have contributed to the problem when it attempted to feed data provided by nassau into its own computer format resulting in a delay in setting the new rates the delay meant that homeowners were given no advance warning of the new calculations and because mr o shea failed to warn school districts that the tax rates might be changing due to his appeal , there was no way for most taxpayers to find out until their bills came but mr o shea insisted that no matter what happened in albany or in his own office , that most of the tax increase was due to budget increases at the local school district level he said that not every school district in the county got a tax increase and that no one was certain how much of any increase was due to the change in the state and county formula this is much ado about nothing and if it were n't for election day , i doubt anyone would be talking about this , he said as for the possibility of refunds because of the mixup , everyone agreed there would be none nothing retroactively can be done to change what has been done the cake is sort of baked for this year , said chuck cutolo , counsel to the democratic minority in the county legislature we 've gotten over the sticker shock and can only hope things will be better next year
washington i think it s working , said defense secretary william cohen , referring to the pentagon s do n't ask , do n't tell policy for gay members of the armed services he said this while announcing that discharges of homosexuals have increased by 67 percent since 1994 when you factor in the military s downsizing , the real figure is closer to 80 percent if this is mr cohen s definition of success , one wonders what failure would look like the real picture is actually grimmer although do n't ask , do n't tell forbids military commanders from pursuing investigations of suspected homosexual conduct without compelling evidence , violations of the policy not to ask , pursue or harass homosexuals have soared , according to the servicemembers legal defense network , the only watchdog group tracking discharge cases under this policy the organization has documented 563 violations by military authorities of do n't ask , do n't tell in 1997 , a jump from 443 violations in 1996 reported cases of physical and verbal harassment of gay service members rose 38 percent from 1996 to 1997 cases in which military authorities illegally asked troops if they were gay increased 39 percent until august of last year , the military was still even using enlistment forms that directly asked about a person s sexual orientation in its report , the pentagon said the original form was preserved for four years as a cost savings measure witch hunts have continued in 1996 , an airman convicted of forcible sodomy at hickam air force base had a life sentence reduced to 20 months in return for outing 17 other allegedly gay servicemen all the accused air force men were discharged the rapist served less than a year secretary cohen s improbable defense is that the vast majority of discharges were voluntary the proof \? none in the pentagon report , except for this the services believe that most of the cases involving a disclosure of homosexuality although not all of them involve service members who voluntarily elected to disclose their sexual orientation to their peers , supervisors or commanders that s what it comes down to the services believe the report later concedes that because extensive inquiries or investigations are not conducted in most of these cases , the reasons for the increase in numbers are not known and would be difficult to ascertain compare this with the documentation of the servicemembers legal defense network the pentagon further claimed that 80 percent of discharges were statement cases , implying that individuals were discharged after spontaneously declaring their orientation to their superiors but that is misleading at best all that a statement case means is that the grounds for discharge arose from what a service member allegedly said , and not what he or she did such statements can include private confessions to therapists , friends , peers or family members that were subsequently reported to military authorities i asked michelle benecke , codirector of the servicemembers legal defense network , how many of the 1 , 300 people her group has helped in the last four years have truly voluntarily disclosed their orientation none that i 've come across , she said to its credit , the pentagon does admit in its report that it has a problem while insisting that the policy is generally being implemented properly , the military concedes that it has not been vigilant enough in policing antigay harassment as it now stands , someone attacked for being gay cannot report the abuse without risking discharge as a result the report also acknowledges that some women have been intimidated into not reporting sexual harassment , because they are sometimes accused of being lesbians if they reject male advances more needs to be done to inform commanders of the regulations , the report adds these admissions would be more encouraging if the record was not so damning last year , despite the 563 reported violations of do n't ask , do n't tell , not a single military commander was disciplined for misconduct it s now clear that the policy has not simply failed it is far worse than what went on before gay service members are now allowed into the military , only to face a series of tripwires intended to flush them out they have become , in effect , the unintended bait of rogue military commanders other , more decent officers \( and there are many \) simply do not know the rules , since the pentagon has done a poor job of telling them what to do about this \? the pentagon has embraced a mix of spin , denial and confession the president has other options last year , he denounced employment discrimination against homosexuals but as commander in chief , bill clinton has now fired more homosexuals than any other employer in america is it too much to ask that this president finally live up to his own words \? or with this president , is that now utterly beside the point \? drawing \( luba lukova \)
melva max , cop fighter , was squirted out of the criminaljustice system last week if it was n't for all the anxiety , expense and the troubling ramifications of her case , it would be another amusing instant urban legend a 41yearold mother of two is arrested outside her chelsea restaurant at midnight after complaining to a passing police sergeant about noisy motorcyclists annoying her customers according to the official complaint , she hurled herself into the patrol car and grabbed his badge she was handcuffed in the street and stripsearched at the precinct house it was n't until 4 am that her husband , jeanfrancois fraysse , who is the chef , was able to take her home so why did n't everyone feel better after the case was dismissed \? oh , they hugged in the dismal corridors of 100 centre street and made plans to meet later in the day for a victory meal at her restaurant , la lunchonette , but you could tell they were let down , especially the lawyer , joseph tacopina his juices were bubbling in less than 12 hours he would be on television for his weekly appearance on geraldo rivera s legal show this is a 34yearold , cameraready exjock with two major clients on his cellular phone s memory a police officer involved in the abner louima assault and the reputed head of the genovese crime family accused in a major wall street stock swindle but melva max , so darkhaired , so pale , so willowy , so clean , gave a certain sense of completion to his calendar a cop , a crook and a citizen , i told him none of them are crooks , mr tacopina said firmly rosario gangi is a hardworking individual pigeonholed by the government thomas wiese is a highly decorated police officer who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and melva max his associate , tama beth kudman , a 27yearold out of barnard and the cardozo law school , said i wish all our clients looked like melva max last wednesday morning in room 400 , ms max , jaw set , heroic in a red jacket , faced judge eileen rakower for the second week in a row on jan 7 , the case had been adjourned because the assigned assistant district attorney had not read the motion for dismissal that was an edgy morning for ms max and mr fraysse in a building reeking of fear and failure but last week , now seasoned defendants , they seemed more relaxed mr fraysse even raised his eyebrows with gallic worldliness when a court officer in jeans and tshirt began screaming at a young man with dreadlocks under a backward cap that young man had stepped over the yellow chain between the spectator seats and the judge s bench rather than unhooking it lightning bolts of attitude flashed between the two until the young man stepped back over , removed his cap and unhooked the chain while mouthing i'm sorry without a hint of apology anything could happen in this tense place so why did n't ms max just accept the da s offer of an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal , a routine plea bargain that would be wiped from her record after a few months \? a trial could cost her thousands and end in jail she whispered that she had been asked the same question by a fellow mount holyoke alumna , a woman she had never met , who recently called to offer support from the college s new york chapter i told her that i had a responsibility , that if it could happen to me , just imagine what could happen to a black woman in brooklyn , ms max said there was a pause , then she told me she was a black woman in brooklyn , and when their boys get to be 10 or so they start training them how to act when the police stop them for nothing at all then ms max was called through the yellow chain for the second week in a row , the assistant da did not show up who could blame him \? what a case , an anthill better left unpoked had cops perjured themselves \? how far would the city go to defend a sergeant one of the guardians of our night when the complaint sounded so shaky \? who wants to address the mounting perception that police disrespect and brutality has spread from mr louima s neighorhood to ms max s \? according to mr tacopina , when judge rakower dismissed the case she said the charge of obstruction of government administration was flawed how could ms max obstruct a police officer from doing something about the motorcyclists when he had refused to do anything at all \? i do not blame judge rakower for refusing to discuss her decision with me this legend is not over a civil litigator , joel berger , has filed a suit for false arrest ms max wants the city to pay mr tacopina s fee outside the courtroom , mr tacopina s cell phone was ringing and his pager was vibrating and he was moving on his exit line okay , ma barker , now do n't go jumping into any more police cars drawing \( mark matcho \)
a strong sense of deja vu pervaded this week s supreme court hearing on the constitutionality of the line item veto act the justices held a similar hearing last may , but then dodged ruling on the merits , saying that the lawmaker plaintiffs , including senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york , lacked legal standing to sue because they had not been personally injured now the clinton administration is challenging the legal standing of a new set of plaintiffs to sue , but none of its arguments are sufficiently compelling to put off deciding , once again , the momentous constitutional question the case poses by now the nation is owed a definitive ruling against the line item veto act s rash departure from the fundamental constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills in their entirety the plaintiffs in the current round new york city , the greater new york hospital association , two hospital labor unions and a potato growers' cooperative in idaho face the prospect of tangible financial injury as a result of vetoes carried out by president clinton last year , so their standing to sue would seem plain but plainer still is the tangible damage to the constitutional separation of powers that congress wrought when it voluntarily surrendered its lawmaking responsibility to the president , allowing him to alter a budget bill by canceling items in it within five days after signing it into law solicitor general seth waxman tried to persuade the court that in canceling the provisions , the president was not really repealing a congressionally enacted law in violation of the constitution but rather carrying out the law by exercising the delegated authority congress has given him some justices openly expressed skepticism at such definitional games , which is an encouraging sign the court s important task now is to get past the overwrought issue of the plaintiffs' standing to sue and move on to restore the traditional balance of power between congress and the executive branch as mapped in the constitution
washington , feb 12 a special inspection of the factories that make tails for boeing 737 s , carried out by the federal aviation administration after the wreckage of one such plane showed missing fasteners in that section , found that workers sometimes lacked training for their jobs , tested parts without proper supervision and sometimes used bolts that were too short , the agency said today but the agency said the planes were well built and that none of the deficiencies were safety hazards we would expect to find some deficiencies in an audit as specific and focused as this one is , said thomas e mcsweeny , director of aircraft certification at the agency none of these findings is considered to be very significant the inspection was ordered after a 737 operated by silk air , a division of singapore airlines , crashed on dec 19 on a flight from jakarta to singapore , killing all 104 passengers and crew the accident began while the plane was cruising , which is unusual most crashes occur on takeoff , approach or landing the accident also puzzled investigators because the plane was so new , having been delivered on feb 14 , 1997 investigators initially said that fasteners were missing from the tail section , and that the plane might have broken up in flight , which led the agency to issue an emergency order for the airlines to inspect more than 200 new 737 s those inspections turned up a variety of missing or loose fasteners , but nothing that constituted a structural problem , the agency concluded the agency s message to the airlines said the jetliner was missing 12 fasteners from the upper surface of the tail s horizontal stabilizer and 14 from the lower surface the bolts , spaced about two inches apart , hold the aluminum skin to the skeleton of the tail american investigators now believe that on the silk air airliner , the fasteners may have been stolen from the wreckage before they arrived paint on the tail section showed no sign of cracking or chipping from flexing , indicating that the parts were held together firmly at the time of the crash investigators say they now think that some of the first people at the scene simply took the fasteners and other parts home this is a poor country , one investigator said that aluminum and stainless steel could be dinner money for somebody another reason for suspicions about boeing was that the 737 production line had to shut down for a month last year because factories , in renton , wash , and wichita , kan , were overwhelmed with work and could not train new workers or get parts shipments fast enough the factories , and a plant in everett , wash , that builds 747 s , which also shut down , had resorted to assembling parts out of the proper sequence when some parts were not available , the agency said that increased the workload and the possibility for error but in giving the world s largest aircraft manufacturer a mostly clean bill of health today , mr mcsweeny said that there were paperwork problems in fact , boeing officials said , the faa had conducted nearly 100 inspections of its production plants since 1991 , and has cited other findings or observations , but never found a safety problem boeing said that it welcomed the findings and would correct the problems , but said the findings showed that safety was not affected for example , the company said that an engineering analysis had found the bolts to be long enough , even if they were one32nd of an inch shorter than the specifications called for
louisville , ky , may 2 they are closer than brothers they are doppelgangers , sharing each other s pain , feeling each other s joy their bond seemingly reached its highest point at last year s kentucky derby , but the trainer bob baffert and the owner mike pegram went one better today their victory with the colt real quiet in the 124th kentucky derby at churchill downs was an appropriate encore to a friendship that was revealed in all its glory last year , before a national television audience baffert had won last year s derby with silver charm , and minutes after the race , after fighting his way through the crowd and getting his picture taken in the winner s circle , he made his way to a podium for the waning minutes of the abc telecast he thanked the owners of silver charm bob and beverly lewis and marveled at his good fortune and he did not forget his best friend pointing off camera , baffert said , and mike pegram , who talked me into going into the thoroughbreds , this is for you , buddy this week , pegram was front and center with baffert before the derby , pegram wondered how he would react if he won words would n't be able to describe what i would feel , he said i wo n't have to go to disneyland this is my own disneyland after the race , pegram said i told everybody last year that i felt like i had won the kentucky derby i did it again today there was a rush that could be no higher last year , and a low that could not be any lower the year before , with cavonnier , pegram said , referring to the bafferttrained horse who lost the 1996 kentucky derby in a photo finish you know you are good friends with someone when you feel as bad as he did baffert and pegram , both 45 , met 12 years ago and hit it off immediately they first had quarter horses , but then pegram persuaded baffert to switch to thoroughbreds the quarter horses race at night , pegram said bob was starting a family i told him , 'you need a day job' baffert told pegram he would need 300 , 000 worth of horses to feel comfortable diving into the thoroughbred world how about 1 million \? pegram offered i'm your man , baffert replied pegram said if bob got out of the business , i 'd get out with him it would n't be the same once you 've had that kind of relationship , you can never replace it both baffert and pegram are intensely serious about their work baffert was the nation s champion trainer of thoroughbreds last year , and pegram owns 22 mcdonald s franchises in washington state but both believe they should play as hard as they work pegram gets to the races as often as he can besides his main residence in mount vernon , wash , he has a home in phoenix and a spectacular summer home in southern california that overlooks del mar race track and the nearby beach pegram never stands on formalities while most everyone dresses in their finest for derby day , pegram had his usual attire on jeans , no tie i do n't own anything other than jeans , pegram said i do n't wear a tie at mcdonald s , and i 've made more money there the last time i wore a tie was at my dad s funeral pegram has a terrific sense of humor he likes to give his horses racy names or tongue twisters \( letthebighossroll , letthebiggatorout \) just to see how the track announcers handle it and his choice of beer switched recently when he discovered he could fit 21 cans of one brand into his cooler , instead of a mere 19 of the brand he had been drinking we 're going to drink a lot of beer tonight , pegram said baffert said the greatest thing about mike pegram is that i'm never worried about him some clients , if you make a mistake , you 're afraid you 're going to get yelled at when things get tough , mike does n't secondguess you perhaps that is because baffert has helped pegram grow his racing business with as much success as the big mac pegram now has 70 horses including those racing at the track , yearlings and broodmares and has hit the jackpot with several purchases pegram bought 10 yearlings two years ago , none for more than 110 , 000 real quiet was the cheapest , at 17 , 000 after today s victory , real quiet has now earned 1 , 319 , 923 pegram also was a coowner of thirty slews , who won the 1992 breeders' cup sprint in addition , pegram owns 25 percent of the californiabased stallion in excess , the sire of indian charlie , who went off as the derby favorite and finished third this week has been a homecoming for pegram he grew up in princeton , ind , about 90 miles northwest of here hometown of gil hodges and red skelton , pegram said he first went to the races with his father , jim , at ellis park , a small western kentucky track on the indiana border pegram regularly attended the races at churchill downs , but did not go to the derby until 1979 , when he was 26 and had just two mcdonald s franchises i remember exactly where i was standing when they played 'my old kentucky home , ' pegram said in the cheap seats today , pegram had the best seat in the house he was up on the podium , sharing the glory of a derby victory with his best friend photo mike pegram , the owner of real quiet , displaying the winner s trophy , as the trainer bob baffert applauded \( reuters \)
nairobi , kenya , aug 7 two powerful bombs exploded minutes apart outside the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania this morning , killing at least 80 people , 8 of them americans , in what officials said were coordinated terrorist attacks in nairobi , an enormous explosion ripped through downtown shortly after 10 30 am , turning the busy haile selassie avenue into a scene of carnage and destruction that left more than 1 , 600 people wounded and dozens still missing long after night fell the blast , which leveled a threestory building containing a secretarial school and gutted the rear half of the embassy next door , dismembered more than a dozen people passing on foot and incinerated dozens of others in their seats in three nearby buses just minutes before , a bomb apparently planted in a gasoline tanker detonated near the front entrance of the united states embassy in the tanzanian capital , dar es salaam , about 400 miles to the south the blast destroyed the front of the building and toppled a side wall , throwing charred debris down the street , setting cars on fire and toppling trees at least 7 people were killed and 72 wounded , none of them american , officials said in washington , president clinton condemned the attacks as abhorrent and inhuman acts of cowardice he vowed to bring those responsible to justice no matter what or how long it takes transcript , page a8 the bombings underscored how vulnerable american officials and diplomats remain in an age of global terrorism , particularly in some thirdworld capitals where borders are porous and security is not as tight as in the industrial world the blasts seemed to be coordinated attacks against the united states , and appeared to be unconnected to any local grievances or political currents in the two capitals , american officials said at least eight americans , one a child , and an unknown number of kenyan employees of the embassy died in nairobi in the blast which left the offices a honeycomb of burnedout rubble with bodies buried inside it s going to take a couple of days to find out what s in there , said bill barr , an embassy spokesman mr barr said 15 american officials were hospitalized and six others were still missing witnesses said the explosion , which shattered windows for several blocks and blew the roof off a building across the street , was preceded by a smaller blast , perhaps a grenade both appeared to emanate from a parking lot just behind the embassy , the police said hundreds of people were cut by falling glass and ran bleeding from the area , flooding local hospitals this is a real national disaster and we highly suspect it is a terrorist attack , said otieno osur , the director of police operations in nairobi by nightfall , rescue workers and soldiers in nairobi toiled under floodlights with backhoes to extricate dozens of bodies still buried in the rubble of the ufundi house , which is situated behind the embassy in dar es salaam , embassy officials said they did not know who was behind the bombing at this point , only several hours after the bombing , we have no idea what the motives of the bombers were , said john lange , the deputy chief of mission at the embassy all we know is that an explosion occurred right in front of our embassy the cairobased newspaper al hayat reported in its saturday editions that it had received a call taking responsibility for the bombings from a previously unknown group called the liberation army of the islamic sanctuaries the united states has been threatened by at least two terrorist groups in recent months american officials said that early circumstantial evidence was leading investigators to focus on a saudi arabian islamic militant , osama bin laden mr bin laden , identified by the state department as a sponsor of terrorism , urged his followers to wage holy war against the united states in may mr bin laden , who isbelieved to be in exile in afghanistan , is not only a suspect in the june 1996 car bomb blast that killed 19 american soldiers in their barracks in dhahran , saudi arabia , but also in the 1995 car bombing in the saudi capital that killed five americans he is also believed to have links to the holy war movement in egypt earlier this week the islamic holy war group , which is banned by egypt , warned it would retaliate against americans because of washington s role in pressing for the extradition of three suspected terrorists from albania to cairo but no firm evidence has emerged linking either group to today s bombings , the kenyan police and united states officials said washington has dispatched a special team from the federal bureau of investigation to assist the local police with the investigation kenyan investigators said late tonight that they suspect a van full of explosives was parked behind the embassy in front of the ufundi house among the wounded in nairobi was the american ambassador , prudence bushnell , who suffered cuts from falling glass she was meeting with a kenyan minister in a building adjacent to the embassy when the explosion occurred , mr barr said
buffalo , nov 4 federal authorities investigating the murder of an obstetrician who performed abortions have identified a vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his arrest today to bring him in for questioning the man was identified as james charles kopp , 44 , whose last known address was in st albans , vt his whereabouts are not known , investigators said investigators said mr kopp s car was seen near the amherst , ny , home of dr barnett a slepian in the weeks before the doctor , whose work at an abortion clinic had long made him a target of harassment , was killed mr kopp , according to police records and abortion rights groups , has often moved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions denise o 'donnell , the united states attorney for the western district of new york , said mr kopp was not considered a suspect in dr slepian s killing but was believed to have information material to the case she declined to give details on what evidence was being sought from mr kopp , describing it only as information that is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise the ongoing investigation ms o 'donnell said that federal law allowed for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person had information that was important to a case if mr kopp is found , he will be arrested , brought to buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence , ms o 'donnell said , adding , then , most likely , the individual would be released dr slepian , 52 , was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on oct 23 , shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue he was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons when the bullet crashed through a back window he died two hours later law enforcement officials also sought today to underscore the potential danger of antiabortion violence in advance of remembrance day , a canadian holiday that falls on nov 11 and that the authorities have associated with some antiabortion crimes at the same time , the justice department and the federal bureau of investigation were trying to find ways to step up the federal response to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the slepian killing the officials said that attorney general janet reno would soon announce that the justice department , aiming to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries , would revive a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence ms reno and senior fbi officials , including robert bryant , the deputy fbi director , have met with physician and abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance federal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies federal authorities organized an abortion clinic task force in 1995 after the killing of a florida doctor the unit , which was charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed , spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence the unit disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy law enforcement officials said that the unit s operation did help reduce violence at abortion clinics and that , in part , the decision to reestablish it was prompted by ms reno s desire to send a renewed message to antiabortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate these crimes dr slepian s murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper attacks on abortion doctors in canada and western new york , dating from 1994 none of the attacks have been solved bernard a tolbert , special agent in charge of the fbi in buffalo , said at a news conference here today that investigators had not determined whether there was a link between the five attacks there s a possibility they could be linked , but certainly no information , he said mr tolbert gave little information about the subject of the materialwitness warrant except to say that mr kopp s black 1987 chevrolet cavalier , with the vermont license plate bpe216 , was seen near dr slepian s home beginning several weeks before the murder we do n't have any idea of where he is , mr tolbert said of mr kopp we are looking for him every place we can , every place he might be a photograph of mr kopp taken in january 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around the united states and canada the national abortion federation has sent out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search for mr kopp , said melinda dubois , assistant director of womenservices , the clinic where dr slepian worked she said naming mr kopp a material witness in the case had not brought relief to the nurses and other workers at the clinic i do n't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic feel differently , she said i do n't want anybody to relax and say , 'oh god , they got the guy' that s easy to happen i still want people to be very vigilant susan dudley , deputy director of the national abortion federation , said mr kopp had been spotted at least a halfdozen times at protests in the last decade , many of them with a group known as lambs of christ , whose members often move from town to town conducting civil disobedience outside clinics ms dudley said mr kopp might have been involved in such a demonstration outside dr slepian s clinic in buffalo in late 1989 the clinic is the last in the buffalo area that is performing abortions dr slepian was one of only a handful of doctors in buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure in the face of pickets , protesters and threats since his death , doctors from outside buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing abortions an obstetrician and gynecologist , dr slepian also had a private practice friends and former patients have described him as a caring man who was dedicated to women s health , whether it was delivering babies , treating gynecological problems or providing safe abortions for those who chose them it all boiled down to this he was trained as an obgyn and he was n't going to say he would n't do abortions because of controversy or danger , said glenn edwin murray , a friend of dr slepian for 10 years and the clinic s lawyer it was legal and he was trained to provide a safe abortion photo the police want to question james charles kopp
for most music lovers , the historical map of the string quartet is drawn on welltraveled roads we tend to trace and retrace the great highways named mozart , beethoven , brahms and bartok and ignore the byways many are the roads not taken , especially on the landscape of our own time but the kronos quartet would have us draw the world differently , in greater detail and from a more modern perspective through 25 years of concerts and recordings , the kronos david harrington and john sherba , violinists hank dutt , violist , and joan jeanrenaud , cellist has explored the string quartet down remote pathways of world music and along more established \( if not exactly establishment \) routes paved by the likes of john adams , henryk gorecki and philip glass now , in classic kronos fashion , comes a set of the string quartets of alfred schnittke \( nonesuch 795002 two cd s \) , which both widens a path once traveled and pencils in side roads where perhaps none had been noticed the penchant for mixing the conventional and obvious with the odd and obscure has been a major ingredient in the charm , the distinction and the significance of the kronos quartet the kronos recording of schnittke s quartet no 3 , for example , first appeared on a 1988 cd , winter was hard , a characteristic potpourri of 10 works by 10 composers schnittke s sorrowful , acerbic music seemed almost casually dropped into that laundry list , between astor piazzolla s biting four , for tango and samuel barber s famously ruminative adagio , with other pieces ranging from the title cut by aulis sallinen to the six bagatelles \( op 9 \) of anton webern that s kronos , and such curiously patchedtogether programs inevitably invite questions , criticism , even dismissal far from drawing a map , one might conclude , these musicians are all over the place but that is the conservative view , and the kronos has never approached its art , its mission , on conventional terms this is a catholic ensemble , four musical sponges who simply cannot absorb enough that was the impression mr harrington gave in conversation some 15 years ago , when kronos was just becoming the hot new band , and the group s zeal has never wavered but enthusiasm is one thing , accomplishment another the kronos s newwave trappings have caused some critics to look askance at the whole enterprise beyond the hodgepodge cd s with their pulpnovel titles \( short stories , night prayers , white man sleeps \) , the quartet s use of amplified instruments , its flair for dramatic lighting and its motorcyclehip attire have created a psychological smoke screen between the ensemble and some listeners are these guys serious \? can they really play \? or are they just marketsavvy opportunists \? only the second question can be answered unequivocally as the new schnittke survey attests , the kronos can play like demons but that fact should have been evident from the touchstones of bartok , gubaidulina , webern and \( again \) schnittke in those eclectic releases of years past the matters of seriousness and marketing smarts are more elusive what qualifies as serious , anyway \? comedians can be serious about their work commitment is serious , and the kronos is manifestly devoted to proselytizing for contemporary music the quartet and nonesuch seem to share a knack for making new music attractive that said , the schnittke package suffers from a recurring flaw in the kronos s releases on nonesuch absent or inadequate program notes here , what figures to be insight , from the pen of solomon volkov , proves instead to be casual to the point of emptyheadedness mr volkov s rambling lines essay would suggest too much organization and content endeavor above all to play out a little game announced in the title the abc s of schnittke one does n't wish to quibble , much less harangue , but when the name of the author of testimony , mr volkov s stirring astoldto memoirs of shostakovich , is attached to a commentary on the quartets of the composer who was widely regarded as the most important in contemporary russia until his death , this month , one expects more than a grammarschool diversion each succeeding paragraph begins , more or less , with the next letter of the alphabet , set as an initial among his friends in moscow , believe me when i say , certainly it is now difficult not to spoil the suspense , but things get worse to xerox or copy down , and yet , is there a contradiction , the zany moments i have spent one reach exceeds all others the vertiginous fourth quartet better , perhaps , these vacuous liner notes and that s the problem mr volkov provides almost no insight , blowing off one quartet after another with inane observations fourteen years passed between the composition of the first quartet , a rather selfconsciously defiant foray into serialism by a 32yearold soviet composer in 1966 , and the second , a work of riveting urgency by a mature artist now writing from strong internal need mr volkov s commentary a natural tie between the two quartets exists , even though the second quartet is stylistically very different from the first that s it , except that he attributes to mr harrington the improbable claim that the second quartet is somehow an inevitable sequel to the first , which was written stylistic lightyears before
washington , april 2 two months after old aircraft parts shipped as cargo caused a valujet plane to crash , killing all 110 people aboard , another small airline based at the same airport shipped the same kind of cargo on the same route on another passenger plane , the federal aviation administration said today the agency said that rich international airways , a charter operator , shipped the parts , called oxygen generators , on a delta air lines plane from miami to atlanta on july 10 , 1996 the valujet crash occurred on may 11on may 24 , in a widely publicized order , the agency banned air shipments of the generators as cargo the oxygen generators are used on some planes to supply emergency masks with oxygen they do this through a chemical reaction that also gives off heat , and the combination of oxygen and heat in flight set off the fire that doomed the valujet plane the delta plane landed safely in atlanta the airline discovered the contents of the shipment the next day and reported the violation to the aviation agency the agency said it was proposing to fine rich 450 , 000 but the agency grounded rich for other safety problems in september 1996 , two months after the shipment , and the airline declared bankruptcy a few months later the airline said last july that it would sell its assets a delta spokeswoman , tracey bowen , said she did not know how delta had discovered the nature of the shipment the aviation agency did not say what caused the delay of more than a year and a half in proposing a fine in reaction to the valujet crash , the agency has proposed fines against eight airlines and shippers in the last year for violating hazardous materials rules , but none so closely paralleling the violations that brought down the valujet plane
when al leiter came to the bench in the middle of the seventh inning yesterday , the mets' pitching coach , bob apodaca , sat beside him and presented him with the facts he had thrown 133 pitches , he was due to hit third in the inning and the mets were trailing by a run , so he was through for the day that did not stop leiter from pleading his case it was a powerful one , as he was seemingly growing stronger with every pitch , striking out seven consecutive batters from the fifth into the seventh innings but apodaca and manager bobby valentine overruled the request and sent todd hundley out to pinchhit righthanded against brian anderson hundley walked , but was stranded turk wendell , who had been pitching flawlessly of late , entered the game and surrendered what turned out to be the deciding run in the eighth , as the mets fell to the arizona diamondbacks by 43 at shea stadium with his decision , however logical it seemed , failing him , valentine met reporters' queries about the move with little patience you guys must watch tv , he said , rising from his desk and abruptly ending the interview you ca n't come up with this on your own it s ridiculous valentine s irate reaction came two days after he absorbed secondguessing for deciding to wait before pinchhitting mike piazza in a 105 loss to st louis hundley entered the game hitting 063 against lefthanders this season \( just 1 hit in 16 atbats \) , and leiter was pitching well the mets had won all six of leiter s previous starts since he came back quickly from a torn patellar tendon in his left knee , and 12 of his last 13 starts over all on this day , he had recovered from a rocky start , and after the diamondbacks' andy fox reached third with one out in the fifth inning , leiter struck out the next seven batters he walked fox in the seventh with two outs , but got bernard gilkey to fly out to end the inning i did n't know what my pitch count was , leiter said i 'd settled down any time you 're feeling as good as i was , you want to pitch it was fine , but i definitely asked apodaca if i 'd be able to go on in hindsight , i felt pretty good , but it s probably right i think you have to factor in that i threw a lot of pitches in my last start , and if hundley pops one out of here that deep in the game , it s a nobrainer this turned out to be one of those frustrating days on which the mets could only watch the scoreboard , see the cubs fall further and further behind in a game that they eventually lost , 133 , to the houston astros , and see an opportunity slip away the loss left the mets one game in front of the cubs in the national league wildcard race the mets still had more than enough chances in this game after falling behind by 30 , they closed the gap to 32 in the fourth inning on a leadoff home run by edgardo alfonzo , which was followed by a double by john olerud and a sacrifice fly by brian mcrae in the sixth , the mets had runners on first and second with nobody out and the heart of the order coming up but olerud was retired on a popup to short , piazza struck out looking and , after mcrae was hit by a pitch , jermaine allensworth hit a soft flare to right field that yamil benitez made a sliding grab on to end the inning close , but no cigar , valentine said it was one of those days we had opportunities , but did n't cash in they cashed in most of theirs while leiter kept them close , wendell , who had not given up a run in his last 11 appearances , was finally touched after striking out the first two batters he faced , he waited while the plate umpire , bill hohn , argued with matt williams over a called third strike before ejecting him jay bell and tony batista then doubled again , in the ninth , the mets had their chances mcrae led

east rutherford , nj the happy , endingaltered script for felipe lopez was playing out last night in the houston rockets' locker room , where rodrick rhodes was on a mission to round up every ticket he could , more than 30 at last count rhodes , who was lopez before lopez clanked his first jump shot for st john s , had come home to new jersey a pro , against big odds , if not all hope i would love to talk to felipe , and i would tell him that he s probably better than more than half the guys they 're talking over him , rhodes said before the rockets lost to the nets in overtime , 117112 , last night at continental arena i know he can play up here after three precious months in the national basketball association , rhodes was n't trying to sound as if he knew that much about up here he was not trying to be like charles barkley , an allstar , a big mouth he was sufficiently embarrassed when the veteran eddie johnson overheard an old jersey city buddy of rhodes s remind him that , in these parts , he was still the man you 're the what \? johnson said , feigning incredulity no , you know , rhodes said sheepishly the wide grin gave him away he is just thrilled to be here , a surprise firstround draft pick with a threeyear contract , a 31minute starter and careerhigh 16point , 6assist contributor in his homecoming last night but because he got here after being reevaluated from ca n't miss to ca n't play , he wanted to send a heartfelt message to lopez , who until recently has walked the same potholed trail of expectation he never promised to meet and did n't rod got the jersey hype , which created tremendous pressure for him , said bob hurley sr , rhodes s coach at st anthony high school , the jersey city basketball factory but is the jersey hype as tough as the new york hype \? no way rod was a victim of early success before it was even worse for felipe that poor kid was on the cover of sports illustrated an old story but one that will be recreated again and again by a system that feeds on the body and souls of oversized children rhodes wished lopez in pittsburgh tonight with suddenly surging st john s to know that it does n't have to be his excuse forget who you were supposed to be , he advised be who you are with any luck , that will be good enough doubt crept into the back of my mind , he said but everyone would tell me , 'keep your head clear what happened in college does n't have to be your whole life' things at kentucky were so bad for rhodes that rick pitino decided that he was n't worth the trouble or the scholarship and ran him out rhodes drifted to southern cal for his senior year , a basketball vagabond , a phenomenon turned foul as early as eighth grade , he was in the trap , his nba vision constant and clear when he was coming out of high school , he was kobe bryant and tracy mcgrady , hurley said maybe , he admitted , it was too easy for rhodes to just get by because he was so good of all the players hurley has coached , none , he said , could match rhodes s multitude of skills the only thing he never had and still does n't is the standingstill jumper , hurley said just like felipe not to mention a heaping portion of rhodes s new peers gerald wilkins could n't make an open jump shot when he entered the league , still ca n't , and that was 13 years ago my feeling is that felipe will be on a roster next year , hurley said rhodes , at 6 feet 7 inches , is more of a defender and passer than lopez , less of a slasher and leaper in overtime which he delivered the rockets to with one of those open jumpers he is not supposed to make he even matched up , competitively , with sam cassell at point guard coaches like that kind of player he is not the next michael , grant or penny give him one for his thoughts , he will admit to being relieved of the burden one day at a time , he said , a good thought for a guy sitting in a locker room hit by fierce trade winds last night , half the rockets not knowing whether to suit up or have their passports overnighted for eventual relocation to toronto in a deal for damon stoudamire that is on hold , or dead beyond two more guaranteed years of pay , there are no sure things only opportunities rhodes said he wished someone could have convinced him of that a long time ago one day at a time that is his mantra now , and his message tell felipe , that s what i said photo rodrick rhodes \( g paul burnett \)
moscow , sept 14 sometime next year , if it is unable to raise fresh money or delay payments , analysts expect that russia will default on as much as 200 billion in foreign debt the largest default by any government in history with only 123 billion in cash reserves in the treasury and with russian companies' pockets virtually empty , the economy is in tatters about 2 billion in debt comes due by the end of this year , and another 17 billion is due next year so , like a homeowner with outsized mortgage payments , enormous bills and many mouths to feed and who has just lost a job and has scant savings russia is on the precipice it has already missed 247 million in interest payments a debt moratorium is in place temporarily , but the bills will continue to stack up financial markets around the world have been rocked in recent weeks by the turmoil in russia , and president clinton called today for the world s industrial powers to confront the biggest financial challenge facing the world in a halfcentury with a new prime minister on board , russia must address two problems simultaneously its staggering debt and a devastated economy scarred by skyrocketing prices , unpaid wages , dwindling food supplies and the threat of even worse to come as winter approaches how the russian government tries to revive the economy , experts say , will have a profound bearing on its ability to get lenders to agree to restructure the debt russia has already damaged its credibility with foreign creditors by imposing the debt moratorium , so it is doubtful that any new solution will involve additional money at the same time , market purists have reacted with scorn to the ascendance of sovietera economic advisers as prime minister yevgeny m primakov tries to assemble a new cabinet these purists characterize russia s new stewards as stalinist retreads who desire a larger role for the state in managing the economy and are ready to print money to ease the cash crisis the new government s economic advisers say they want to preserve the strengths of the market while imposing tighter regulatory controls they also advocate reversing the government s move to effectively devalue the ruble and impose a debt moratorium , decisions that precipitated the economic crisis and they have invoked franklin d roosevelt s new deal as a model for helping the russian economy recover russia has lost the trust of its citizens in its financial and banking system , said leonid a abalkin , a top soviet economic planner in the 1980 s and now director of moscow s institute of economics , who met with government officials today to discuss economic strategies the first thing that one has to do is defend people and make them safe from poverty russia is not alone in fashioning an alternative to the market approach pressed by the clinton administration and the international monetary fund leaders of countries with economies as diverse as malaysia , china and hong kong have imposed or are considering imposing tighter controls on capital how the west approaches russia s debt problem , and how open it is to working with a russia that wants to chart an economic course of its own , is going to be a delicate balancing act an economic historian , robert kuttner , noted that it was international lenders' push for onerous debt repayments from weimar germany in the 1920 s that led to hyperinflation there and the rise of the nazis if you simply want russia to repay its debts , the economy collapses , mr kuttner said and if you only let currency speculators determine the value of the ruble , then you 'll have hot money flying in and out of the country what you need is for the russian government and the international community to work together to control capital flight and the ruble s exchange rate and to support russia s version of the new deal but other economists warn that printing rubles to stimulate demand in russia is a recipe for disaster either the government cuts expenditures drastically , allows banks to go bankrupt and lets depositors receive only a share of the liquidated bank assets in essence , lives within its means , the russianeuropean center for economic policy said in a recent report , or the central bank issues credits to cover any or all claims on the government this is the path of hyperinflation the first imposes pain on many of the powerful guilty parties in the current situation the latter spreads the pain over all holders of rubles , hitting the poor hardest of all but if loans are channeled to businesses and individuals , and if the government spends wisely , printing rubles may not be a disaster , proponents of the idea maintain americans do not have to look far for examples of the benefits of easy money when the stock market crashed in 1987 , and when american banks teetered on the edge of collapse shortly afterward , the federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , helped revive the economy by sharply easing credit i think it s terrible that the western powers are suggesting that russia follow a model that none of them have followed during times of crisis , said david kotz , an economics professor at the university of massachusetts at amherst there s room for a strong state role in guiding the economy , and the claim that a departure from the free market represents a leap back to the soviet past represents a serious misunderstanding of the russian situation oleg t bogomolov , a former top soviet economist now with the russian academy of sciences who is advising the country s new leaders said it is not in the western interest to see russia collapse the policy of the west was mistaken , he said , and in part it will have to pay it gave recommendations that did n't work , and it gave credits that went to prolong a political regime rather than to solve our economic problems graphs adding it up running on empty the russian government s current cash reserves are insufficient to handle its

washington , dec 8 the edges were rounded and the arguments were more finely honed , but at bottom , the defense offered by president clinton s team today was essentially old legal arguments in new bottles he did not commit perjury , although he misled he did not obstruct justice , although he sinned and , whatever he did or did not do , none of his actions warranted impeachment the president s lawyers did offer a more detailed and serious effort to rebut the impeachment report referred to congress by the independent counsel , kenneth w starr , and repackaged by the committee s chief counsel , david p schippers in a 184page legal brief , they provided lengthy and specific denials of assertions that the president perjured himself , obstructed justice and abused the powers of his office the results of this last stand defense appeared to be mixed the more specific and detailed rebuttal to the impeachment charges appeared to quell mounting criticism from republicans , particularly judiciary chairman henry hyde , that the president was arrogantly refusing to address the facts arrayed against him as today s hearing before the house judiciary committee began , representative james f sensenbrenner jr , republican of wisconsin , criticized the white house for a witness list that was topheavy with legal experts instead of witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the evidence i'm disappointed that there are no fact witnesses , mr sensenbrenner said for some republicans on the committee , the genial manner of the white house special counsel , gregory b craig , appeared to be a welcome tonic to the combative style of mr clinton s personal lawyer , david e kendall but the impassioned arguments of several panels of historians , lawyers and former members of the judiciary committee , did not appear to change any minds the panel made the familiar claim that the president s efforts to conceal his relationship with monica s lewinsky were not grave enough to merit impeachment , but they expressed these views with new urgency prof bruce ackerman of yale law school made a plea to the committee to save the country from a painful impeachment trial it will disrupt the nation s business , i would expect , for a year , he said elizabeth holtzman , the former democratic congresswoman of new york who served on the judiciary committee during watergate , said , the president engaged in sexual misconduct he wanted to conceal it it certainly does n't rise to what we saw in watergate i urge you to think how history will look at you if you act on a single act of misconduct that does not involve the powers of the presidency representative george w gekas , republican of pennsylvania , disagreed with the witnesses' conclusions that the accusations against mr clinton did not rise to the level of impeachable offenses all of these could be impeachable , mr gekas said , calling perjury a direct affront to the judicial process it will fall to charles f c ruff , the white house counsel , to make a comprehensive rebuttal to impeachment in closing arguments tomorrow but the 184page brief will be the backbone of his 90minute summation it takes apart the case for impeachment piece by piece , offering detailed denials that the president committed perjury , obstructed justice or abused the powers of his office it also accuses mr starr and the judiciary committee of purposely mischaracterizing the president s testimony and leaving out 11 pieces of exculpatory evidence mr craig picked up some of these themes in his public testimony , but republican members of the judiciary panel pressed him hard on whether the president had lied his answers evoked the same incredulity and anger that mr clinton s critics expressed in august , when he admitted to an inappropriate , intimate relationship with ms lewinsky seven months earlier mr clinton had denied in a deposition in the paula jones case that he had had sexual relations with ms lewinsky mr craig said today that the president believed his denials were truthful mr clinton s insistence that he did not commit perjury rests on the same legalisms that have enraged his critics for months in the legal brief and in mr craig s testimony , the president s lawyers argued that mr clinton believed that sexual relations meant sexual intercourse since he and ms lewinsky did not have sexual intercourse , the president believed he was giving the jones lawyers and mr starr s investigators a truthful denial of having had sexual relations mr craig said the president s testimony was evasive , incomplete , misleading , even maddening , but it was not perjury you may judge he crossed the line , mr craig said but in fact there is no testimony , no proof , that president clinton knew he was wrong and intentionally lied he added that the president had acted last summer to correct his misleading public denial in january of a relationship with ms lewinsky and that he had admitted to egregious conduct and apologized although they seemed to appreciate mr craig s willingness to address evidence , republicans expressed irritation throughout the day over the white house s legal semantics in the afternoon , representative asa hutchinson , republican of arkansas , said to mr craig , do n't give me word games representative charles t canady , republican of florida , pressed mr craig to the wall on the president s evasive answer in the jones deposition to a question about whether mr clinton recalled having been alone with ms lewinsky mr craig called the president s response that he did not have a specific recollection narrowly accurate , while conceding it was misleading i do n't see how anyone could think that was a truthful answer , mr canady tartly observed , adding , i believe we have convincing evidence of a pattern of lying representative elton gallegly , republican of california , also was unpersuaded by mr craig s colloquy on how the president s evasions did not amount to perjury how could his testimony be those things without being a lie \? mr gallegly asked incredulously photo abbe d lowell , left , counsel for the house judiciary committee s democrats

a police investigation into a brawl by firefighters at a restaurant in bryant park last week appeared to have stalled yesterday , with police commissioner howard safir saying that witnesses had been unable to identify any suspects the only information we have is people alleging that firefighters in uniform were drinking , urinating in public and going into the ladies room in , he said he added that none of the civilians or firefighters who witnessed the misbehavior at the bryant park cafe on june 3 had filed criminal complaints scores of firefighters had gone to the cafe to celebrate after a midmorning ceremony at city hall honoring their acts of heroism the cafe s bouncer , ethan kemp , who apparently mistook an intervening police officer as a brawler and tossed him over a flower pot , was the only person arrested he has been charged with assault , resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration , the manhattan district attorney s office said the information we have is that if any assaults took place , they were between firefighters , not with civilians , commissioner safir said if the criminal investigation stalls , the firefighters who took part in the brawl and other public indiscretions could face administrative charges brought by the fire department the district attorney s office granted the fire department s request to begin an administrative investigation yesterday while refusing to comment on the evidence gained so far , michael regan , a fire department spokesman , said that the internal investigation will include interviews with firefighters two firefighters have been interviewed by the fire department s investigative panel , said a fire official who spoke on the condition of anonymity he said that more interviews had been scheduled for today
only in the last couple of years did it even enter agnes grossmann s mind that she could in fact , would become music director of the vienna choir boys she is certainly qualified to take charge of the prestigious choir , continuing its traditions , its tours and its recording projects , which date back to arturo toscanini , bruno walter and numerous other conductors of that rank but its 500 years under solely male leadership just would n't make it a likely career dream for a woman yet here she is , following in the footsteps of her father , ferdinand grossmann , who for 20 years led the boys the alumni choir , viennensis \( trebles grown into men \) , and the vienna chamber orchestra , which joins the two choirs for mass each sunday in the imperial chapel in vienna and here she is , too , leading the three ensembles on a halfmillennium celebration tour , which comes to the united states beginning on friday at the new jersey performing arts center in newark the program they are to perform touches five centuries of works composed for the choir , including some by alumni schubert , whose talent was spotted by salieri , one of his teachers there joseph haydn \( who attended with his brother , michael \) , and heinrich isaak , the choir s first artistic director when it was founded in 1498 the centerpiece of the program is mozart s coronation mass , written for the imperial choirs , of which the vienna choir boys were part ms grossmann s sex was a bigger handicap in her credentials than the fact that her mother is half jewish not that that helped any speaking by telephone from her home in vienna , ms grossmann recalled that her mother , marie durant , who sang in the vienna state opera chorus in the 1930 s , had to stop , because of , you see she paused and began again my mother decided to give up her career she was not allowed to perform my father tried to get her to australia , but it was too late they had to live separately we were in tremendous danger the war stopped just in time born in 1944 , young agnes was taken to the imperial chapel , and she remembers her fascination with the color of the sound these are our sacred roots , she said but having no thought of any future connection with the choir , she hoped to be a pianist and loved sitting under the family piano , feeling surrounded by sound when lili kraus , her eminent stepgrandmother , came over to play ms grossmann , who married but kept her own name , eventually wound up in canada , conducting choirs and chamber orchestras the experience enhanced her understanding of her father s role in restoring a choir sonority that had been in decline since hapsburgs' demise early this century it also made her so well suited for her present position that her sex had to be overlooked , especially after she survived a sixmonth trial she wasted no time making changes in the choirboy school when she took charge last year each of the 24member choirs the haydn , mozart , schubert and bruckner \( named as naturally as american schoolchildren s red or blue reading groups might be \) is now headed by both a man and a woman the boys , age 10 to whenever their voices change , are listened to in a motherly way they now sleep in bedrooms , not in dormitories , and the corridors of their converted 18thcentury palace are arranged to encourage individual play and reading during leisure time ms grossmann described the atmosphere as more kindgerecht , right for children ms grossmann estimates that a good third of the boys make it through from their admission as nonresident aspirants at age 4 to the boarding school and tour years , and the eventual end of their treble life as to how candidates can be spotted at 4 , she said , you realize their musicality immediately , from their musical ear perhaps her most startling project is the admission of girls into the academic and musical school programs this in a city whose philharmonic only last year accepted the first woman the girls study with the boys until age 10 , and there are plans for a separate girls' choir , though none for them to join the boys' choir boys make a very specific sound , ms grossmann said it can be floating , tender and transparent , but it can also be dramatic and astonishingly loud there is a wide span of expression , and the tour program will stress that range whatever other issues she must puzzle through , she has no problem defining what she has learned so far , and the lessons are clear and deep first , and necessary to build on , she says she understands the old way better , although she still ca n't believe that in world war ii , austria , with all its great artists and philosophers , could possibly be caught by a liar she also sees that you cannot change something immediately , that she requires immense patience , with the goal clearly in front of me , and finally that you must fight with conviction and kindness vienna choir boys new

washington , nov 30 mike espy , a former congressman and agriculture secretary once thought to be a rising political star , spent his 45th birthday today in a federal courthouse hearing himself denounced by prosecutors as a corrupt official and praised by defense lawyers as a dedicated public servant in closing arguments before the case went to the jury in mr espy s corruption trial , donald c smaltz , an independent counsel , sought to portray mr espy as thoroughly insensitive to ethical regulations and laws , someone who eagerly accepted gifts from companies and lobbyists who had business before the department of agriculture , which he led in president clinton s first term until he was forced to resign in 1994 reviewing the two months of testimony , mr smaltz told the jury that mr espy was especially fond of major sporting events and thought nothing of seeking hardtoget tickets for professional football and basketball games and tennis matches from companies that had vital business before the agriculture department ted wells , mr espy s lawyer , told the jury that mr espy had committed no crimes and that the items he had received were gifts from friends , which is explicitly allowed under federal law mr wells said the prosecution did not and could not present any evidence that mr espy made any decisions based on the gifts he came to work in the morning and he treated everyone fairly , mr wells said and he made his decisions on the merits mr wells also sought to portray mr smaltz and the staff of the independent counsel as a gang of legal bullies who sought to concoct a case out of small matters the trial , in fact , has not been only about mr espy , but also about the wisdom and effectiveness of the law that allows for the appointment of independent counsels to investigate accusations of wrongdoing by senior administration officials mr smaltz s fouryear 17 million investigation of mr espy s conduct has been hotly debated by opponents and supporters of the law , which expires in june but can be renewed the espy investigation has received a level of scrutiny second only to that given the investigation of kenneth w starr , the independent counsel who has reported to congress that the president may have committed impeachable offenses mr espy is charged with taking about 35 , 000 in illegal gifts , lying about it and trying to get a friend to cover for him last week a federal judge dismissed 8 of the 39 counts against him and part of a ninth if convicted on the most serious charges , violating the federal meat inspection law , mr espy faces a minimum of three years in prison mr smaltz s summation was halting and uneven he jumped around among many of the 30 remaining counts in the indictment and the complexity of the case made it difficult to follow which contractor had offered mr espy tickets to which sporting event and which law might have been broken as mr smaltz spoke , mr espy glanced at a bible in his lap the issue of race has been near the surface from the beginning of the trial mr espy s lawyers sought to press the idea that he attached little importance to such secondary matters as game tickets because he was preoccupied with running the agriculture department that chore was made especially difficult , the lawyers argued , because he met resistance to new ideas from the staff because he was the first africanamerican agriculture secretary facing the jury of 10 blacks and 2 whites , mr smaltz , who is white , implored them to decide the case on facts , not politics or race mr wells , who practices in new jersey , offered a passionate oration , adopting a downhome flavor by sprinkling his argument with y'all and dropping his 'g s' at the ends of words this case has been a bunch of garbage , said mr wells , who is black just garbage mr wells disputed each of the charges , saying , for example , that when a lobbyist gave mr espy 4 , 400 worth of tickets to the us open tennis tournament , mr espy was told the tickets were free when another lobbyist paid 3 , 200 to mr espy s girlfriend at the time so she could accompany him to greece , mr wells said , the money represented the winnings of a bet between the girlfriend and the lobbyist mr espy , he said , had no knowledge of the money paid to the girlfriend and when a lobbyist gave mr espy a set of new luggage , mr wells said , that was because mr espy had come to an event with a brokendown duffel bag in none of those instances , mr wells said , did mr espy know that the lobbyists had billed the expenses to their companies many commentators have said that the conduct mr espy is accused of demonstrates that when he became a cabinet officer in 1993 after serving six years in the house , he brought with him a notion of ethical behavior more typical of congress that it is customary if not acceptable to trade a few favors that view was reinforced during the trial when carol e browner , the head of the environmental protection agency , testified about a conversation she had with mr espy early in the clinton presidency ms browner testified that mr espy said that he thought the stringent ethics code

seoul , south korea , feb 21 his head shaven , his taut body dressed in a prison uniform , kim dae jung lay huddled under a blanket in his freezing cell , shivering uncontrollably and despairing that he had wrecked the lives of his wife and three sons sentenced to the gallows for leading the fight against south korea s military dictatorship , he had felt his roman catholic faith wavering as he faced his own death , and he upbraided himself for his doubts and for what he felt was his lack of courage as he lay in his cell that night , he tried to pray , but instead , he recalled later , he broke down and began to cry , great tears trickling down his icy cheeks that was just over 17 years ago , and the distance that mr kim and south korea have traveled since his heart broke that desolate night will be marked on wednesday when mr kim is inaugurated as the country s president often described as asia s mandela , mr kim takes office with the same kind of moral authority as nelson mandela of south africa and similar stature as an international figure at a time when much of asia has lost its footing and is groping for a more solid political and economic structure , mr kim proclaims a vision for a new korea and a new asia political democracy , marketoriented economics , and policies that emphasize social justice he says he is willing to speak out against human rights abuses in myanmar or even china , and he clearly intends to transform south korea so it can be an example for the world i want kim dae jung to be a model that is successful in asia , proving that democracy and the economy can go together well , mr kim said in english during an hourlong interview in his office this is my ambition mr kim s vision is deeply threatening to the entrenched order in much of asia and much of the developing world he insists that the solution to asia s economic crisis is more democracy , greater openness and freer markets , and he argues that the crisis arose because of political weaknesses in every country in asia , including korea , the major reason for failure was lack of democracy , he said he added that democracy was the best way to uproot collusive relations between government officials and business tycoons , while assuring that companies thrive on the basis of excellence rather than connections mr kim is a firm critic of the asian values theory , which holds that asians care more about getting rich than about getting democracy and that a measure of authoritarianism is the best way to nurture economic growth democracy has to go hand in hand with economic growth , mr kim declared that kind of language leaves officials with pained expressions in places like china or indonesia he is really going to change the whole profile of asian leadership , predicted donald gregg , a former american ambassador to south korea and now chairman of the korea society in new york i think he s going to do a fabulous job yet to fulfill the enormous expectations , mr kim will have to deal with three overarching challenges in the coming years reviving south korea s economy , easing the threat of war with north korea , and nurturing democratic institutions and a civil society these will be tremendously difficult tasks , and lesser problems have already humbled the outgoing president , kim young sam , who was also given a political honeymoon as he took office but who now commands an approval rating of less than 10 percent special difficulties of style and age kim dae jung will face some special difficulties , for he has endless experience as a gadfly but none actually running any level of government , and his aides already warn that he is a micromanager who must learn to delegate in addition , he is handicapped because his political party has only minority support in the national assembly finally , although he seems healthy , he is already 74 judging by the most credible of the several birth dates he has used over the years and it is not clear how he will hold up over his fiveyear term on the other hand , mr kim has the advantage of a strong south korean presidency and of soaring approval ratings elected with just 40 percent of the vote in a threeway race , he has rapidly won over many critics , and a recent poll found that 83 percent of those surveyed said it was good for korea that mr kim had been elected there is a mood of elation and relief in part because many south koreans and foreigners , particularly establishment figures , initially regarded mr kim with deep suspicion he was suspected of being a populist who would pander to labor unions , take revenge on his political opponents and engage in battles and renegotiations with the international monetary fund so far , none of these worries has come to pass one of mr kim s first actions after the election in december was to arrange the release from prison of two of his greatest persecutors , former presidents chun doo hwan and roh tae woo , under whom he was nearly executed the gesture was an important effort at national reconciliation , for south korea is bitterly divided between the cholla region in the southwest , where mr kim comes from , and the kyongsang region in the southeast , where the two former presidents have their roots

to the editor re after deaths , county asks 'why \? ' \( news article , july 20 \) it is unfortunate that mayor abraham seroussi attributes the rash of violence in gloversville , ny , partly to the whole ghetto chic from the city i assume he is referring to the glorification of violence in music and videos by africanamerican and hispanic youths in the inner city but none of the crimes described remotely resemble the driveby shootings and turf wars of gangsta rap if there is a connection between the crimes in fulton county and the problems of the ghetto , perhaps it has more to do with economic dislocation and the absence of options for young people of course , bleak job prospects do n't excuse violence glorification of violence by the broader culture and the availability of guns must be examined as well it is too easy and divisive to blame the inner city for violence that plagues our society as a whole tim ledwith staten island , july 21 , 1998
federal officials said yesterday that they had broken up the largest foodstamp fraud ring ever in new york , a 60 million scheme in which individuals sold their food stamps to chinese takeout restaurants , which in turn sold them to bodega owners , who then redeemed the coupons from the government in some cases , federal prosecutors said , bodegas with just hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual sales had redeemed millions of dollars worth of food stamps the case was unusual both for its vast scope and for the fact that the scheme cut across ethnic lines , involving individuals , chineseowned restaurants and hispanicowned grocery stores in manhattan , brooklyn and the bronx but the mechanics of the scheme , in which individual recipients apparently sold their coupons for less than face value and business owners illegally turned them in to the government , were typical of foodstamp frauds , investigators said there s no reason to change the plan since it works , roger c viadero , inspector general of the united states department of agriculture , said in a telephone interview last night do n't reinvent the wheel the government unsealed documents showing that it had charged a total of 18 people with conspiring to defraud the federal food stamp program and conspiring to launder money prosecutors said large sums of money from the scheme ended up in banks in the dominican republic as part of the scheme , the government said , some of the defendants made transfers of money in checks of just under 10 , 000 , to evade federal banking reporting requirements the case stemmed from a twoyear investigation by the federal bureau of investigation and the agriculture department fbi agents began to arrest suspects on friday and over the weekend , prosecutors said , including owners of some of the grocery stores that are accused of participating in the scheme nine suspects were arrested in the last few days , prosecutors said , while the rest are at large an assistant united states attorney , cheryl a krause , told magistrate judge douglas f eaton in court yesterday that several of the suspects were believed to have fled to the dominican republic although the defendants were charged with conspiracy , prosecutors did not elaborate on the relationship among those accused or on how they worked together it was also unclear how the chinese restaurant owners became linked up with the bodega owners whether , for example , the bodega owners worked with restaurant owners in their own neighborhoods four defendants who appeared in court in manhattan were held without bond , including reynaldo cespedes and his wife , ibaniris , described in court records as managers of numerous grocery stores a lawyer for mr cespedes could not be reached by phone last night his wife s lawyer , martin klotz , declined comment among the fugitives was victor ramirez , described in the documents as the owner of three bodegas in the bronx and manhattan that were used in the scheme none of the owners of the chinese restaurants were among those charged prosecutors would not explain why , saying only that the investigation was continuing in a similar case four years ago , 30 grocers in chinatown were accused of participating in a 40 million foodstamp fraud scheme the charges announced yesterday were not linked to that earlier case , prosecutors said mr viadero of the agriculture department said that the government had tried to combat the estimated 3 billion in fraud in the 26 billion program by giving recipients cards that transfer benefits electronically , avoiding the use of coupons , which are like cash and can be lost or sold but he said the electronic cards had yet to be introduced in new york according to prosecutors , the defendants , many of them owners or managers of bodegas , purchased large quantities of food stamps from chinese takeout restaurants in new york and other sources the government s court filings did not explain how the chinese restaurants obtained the food stamps , which cannot be used to buy restaurant meals , but officials said many foodstamp recipients who obtain the coupons legally sell them on the street for a fraction of their face value the coupons were then resold at a slightly higher price to the bodega owners , prosecutors said the bodega owners were authorized to accept food stamps and were thus able to redeem them from the government at full value after the scheme was used at certain locations , the government said , the suspects reapplied to the food stamp program under different names , although the stores remained the same one telling piece of evidence , prosecutors said , was the disparity between the annual sales volume of the bodegas , typically around 200 , 000 to 500 , 000 a year , and the value of the food stamps that the same stores redeemed from the government , which was many times higher in one such case cited in the complaint , a bodega called stop 1 food market in the bronx , in applying for registration in the food stamp program , estimated its annual sales to be about 371 , 000 of that , about 223 , 000 was sales of fruit , vegetables and other food that can be purchased with food stamps yet , over the next year , it redeemed about 3 million in food stamps , according to prosecutors the owners of stop 1 , at the corner of 199th street and decatur avenue in the bedford park section of the bronx , are named in the complaint as juan and teofilo ramirez both of the owners were charged but have not been arrested workers at the store yesterday said they were unaware of the charges
baltimore , june 15 the yankees insisted that the bad blood with the baltimore orioles no longer existed , that they had no intention of retaliating for the pitch armando benitez hit tino martinez with last month tonight s home plate umpire , john hirschbeck , did not believe any of it after allowing a seventhinning home run to the orioles' rafael palmeiro in the yankees' 74 loss tonight , mike stanton threw a fastball into the back of the next batter , eric davis , and hirschbeck immediately ejected the pitcher the bad blood flows again the outcome of the game has little chance of affecting the american league east race the orioles are 22 games behind the yankees in the loss column but it could be that the yankees have evened a monthold score after being hit , davis bent over in pain as hirschbeck immediately stepped in front of the home plate to wave stanton out of the game the yankee pitcher reacted as if he had had no intention of hitting davis , shrugging as if to say , who , me \? intentional or not , the coincidences were plentiful like benitez on may 19 , stanton had allowed an important home run like benitez , stanton hit the next batter with his next pitch like martinez , davis wears no 24 like benitez , stanton planted a fastball between the 2 and the 4 unlike last month s game at yankee stadium , however , there was no further pitcherbatter confrontation and no one left the dugouts or the bullpens except yankee manager joe torre , who went onto the field only to argue with hirschbeck suspicions will linger and the bad blood will simmer , as the yankees play the second game of this threegame series on tuesday night stanton plaintively said that the pitch was not thrown purposefully , but acknowledged that it would be like admitting you had leaked information to the news media after his ejection , stanton called davis in the orioles' clubhouse , where davis was being treated stanton said he apologized , promising there was no malicious intent it was absolutely a mistake , he told reporters there was no way i was throwing at him davis said if he says he did n't do it on purpose , all i can do is take his word for it i'm not happy , but i do n't get mad the orioles were having none of it , however the truth , baltimore manager ray miller said , lies within the guy who threw the ball miller added , as apparent as it was with benitez , that was apparent in other words , it was apparent to miller that stanton threw at davis i guess we 'll have to wait and see if justice is as swift and sure in the state of maryland as it is in new york , said miller , who is convinced that benitez received an eightgame suspension for hitting martinez only because it occurred in new york , the media capital hirschbeck will send a report of his ejection to gene budig , the league president , who will then determine if any suspension is warranted the score was tied , 44 , in the bottom of the sixth when b j surhoff singled and took second on a groundout lenny webster took a hard swing and lofted a high fly the dimensions in camden yards are notoriously short , 364 feet to leftcenter field , and left fielder ricky ledee , playing his second major league game , stepped back a second or two passed before ledee realized he had badly misjudged the ball and it was falling in front of him by the time he recovered , it was too late he had a heck of a jump breaking back on the ball , torre said , joking , as if to commiserate with the young player earlier , ledee had smashed a threerun homer to tie the score at 33 surhoff took third on ledee s gaffe , webster stopped at first and david wells , the yankees' starter , jerked his shoulders in some frustration ledee s would turn out to be a pivotal mistake mike bordick then lifted another fly to left surhoff tagged up , and ledee measured the fly , moving forward as he caught the ball ledee s throw beat surhoff home , but in fielding the hop , catcher jorge posada had drawn his right foot back , leaving half of the plate uncovered through this open door to home did surhoff slide safely , according to hirschbeck , to make the score 54 the yankees argued , unsuccessfully , and torre said posada might have realized later that he was late with the tag inside pitch david wells pitched six innings in his first outing since suffering from shoulder tendinitis , and he allowed 10 hits and 5 runs and struck out 1 wells \( 82 \) said he felt stiffness in his shoulder , but no pain , and once he got loose , he felt fine wells s eightgame winning streak came to an end tim raines jr , the son of yankees outfielder tim raines , signed his first professional contract monday with the orioles , who arranged a joint fatherson news conference he reminds me so much of myself , said the older raines , clearly touched by the occasion the younger raines , a sixthround high school pick who signed for a bonus of about 100 , 000 , hopes to one day play alongside his father , who is 38 it s something we 've both thought about , said the older raines if it does n't happen , it s not the end of the world for the first time since straining an abdominal muscle , derek jeter took batting practice on monday , although steady pregame showers chased all players indoors manager joe torre suggested that if all goes well , jeter may return to the lineup next weekend in cleveland photo ricky ledee watched as his first major league homer a threerun shot sailed out to left field \( associated press \)

durban , south africa mercy makhalemele found out she was hivpositive when she was pregnant with her second child she was 23 , had been married for five years , and was faithful to her husband she cried all the way home from the prenatal clinic , but was too afraid to tell anyone for nearly a year when she finally did tell her husband , he beat her to the ground , knocking her against a lighted stove and badly burning her wrist , she said then he threw her out of the house , refusing to believe that he had given her the virus the next day , he went to the shoe store she managed with everyone watching , he shouted at her to collect all her things , he would have nothing to do with someone with hiv , the virus that causes aids her employers dismissed her that afternoon my story , she told a women s group gathered for a luncheon here recently , is not just my story if you talk to other women , you will hear 90 percent the same it will not be 50 different stories rejecting us is not going to solve the problem of this disease it s just going to cause stress so please , just accept us across subsaharan africa , the aids epidemic is everywhere in several countries , one out of four people is now infected with the virus and will probably die within 10 years the disease is flooding hospitals , changing the face of work places and producing hundreds of thousands of orphans but go to a village and ask if anyone is suffering from aids , and the answer will likely be no , there is only malaria or tuberculosis or diarrhea it is hard to find anyone who publicly admits to being hivpositive many go to their graves with their secret , so great is the stigma discrimination against people with the virus exists to some degree in most countries around the world but experts say the problem is particularly severe in africa , where little has been done to study or attack the stigma the shame that people feel and the treatment they suffer at the hands of their communities has farreaching consequences for efforts to fight the spread of the virus and treat the sick , experts say for one thing , it keeps people from wanting to find out whether they have aids , and it encourages even those who know they are infected to act as everyone else does , and perhaps even spread the disease for instance , a mother who is trying to hide her hiv status may be unwilling to try infant formula to help prevent transmission to her child if other mothers in her village are breastfeeding fear of discovery can also keep people from seeking services of any sort in south africa , facilities earmarked for aids patients often stand virtually empty , even though the help they offer is desperately needed in richard s bay , on the coast north of durban , the town s six largest employers have converted an old farmhouse into a ninebed aids hospice open to any of their 10 , 000 employees , many of whom live in shacks the building is surrounded by flowering gardens services include counseling for families , free meals and visits with traditional healers if they are wanted but despite a local infection rate estimated at 30 percent , the compound is rarely used it s such a huge disgrace to be diagnosed with hiv aids that people will suffer all sorts of discomforts rather than associate with a facility that is clearly known to be for people with aids , said jenny rogers , who designed the hospice those people who do come forward , even to tell their families , face daunting prejudice in some rare cases , they have been stoned but most often they are simply rejected by their families or isolated , their utensils and bedclothes kept separate from everyone else s , their needs suddenly last on the list some are thrown out of their churches and hounded from their homes as ms makhalemele was making her plea for tolerance , a 19yearold boy was alone in a durban hospital suffering from tuberculosis a few weeks before , she had taken her pitch to the boy s village and , inspired by her courage , the young man had told his neighbors that he too was infected later that day , his neighbors had gathered around his house and , hissing and pointing , had forced him to leave his horrified family also wanted nothing to do with him , though efforts at reconciliation were under way a sad story of loss , '1 , 200 times over' some experts also argue that the isolation that sufferers experience can even hurt their family or community economically you have perfectly normal people who cannot continue to contribute to society anymore , said jean louis lamboray , a policy adviser for the united nations agency that deals with aids if they have a shop , they lose their customers , they lose their suppliers and soon they are out of business that s the typical story , 1 , 200 times over while the way people with aids are treated varies from country to country across the continent , the discrimination seems to be somewhat worse in southern africa , which has among the fastest rising rates of infection but few effective aids programs yet even to the north in uganda , which is often held up as a model because it has an aggressive education and prevention campaign

a tribe apart a journey into the heart of american adolescence by patricia hersch 391 pp new york fawcett columbine 25 in 1992 patricia hersch began a challenging but worthy effort to shadow eight mainstream youngsters as they advanced through junior high and high school in the largely middleclass washington suburb of reston , va her research was guided by the premise that today s adolescents grow up more isolated from adults than those of other generations and have formed distinct and sometimes unfathomable rules of behavior , values and rites of passage she tells their stories mostly from their point of view , and this reportorial strategy gives her book , a tribe apart , an intimacy and intensity that a more detached , rounded approach might have lacked but it also paints the author into the corner of accepting youngsters' accounts of family life and school experiences , which may be embellished for dramatic effect the kids come across as sincere and earnest they try to fulfill the expectations of adults and gain approval while cultivating their own identities it is easy for the reader and perhaps the author to suspend disbelief and surrender to the narrative with the fascination and alarm of a parent who discovers a teenager s secret diary the rhythm of these students' lives is all too familiar idealism compromised by experience modest rebellion followed by reluctant conformity to adult norms and occasional experimentation with drugs and sex constrained by ambition and selfinterest hersch has written about adolescents for psychology today and other publications and has raised three sons in reston she decided to work the middle range of adolescence , and as a result these teenagers are n't complete aliens none here are severely deprived , on crack or seriously thinking about dropping out of school in fact , the teenagers who cooperated with hersch were articulate and forthcoming they volunteered , were even eager to help her this does n't mean they did n't hit bumps on the road to adulthood consider the experiences of some of the leading characters brendon finds that his creativity is thwarted by the rigidity of his public school and protests by staging midnight raids to paint graffiti annie hungers for affection from her ungiving mother and disengaged stepfather joan , on the other hand , gets more attention than she wants from her overprotective father , an immigrant who too often disciplines her by cursing and yelling and jonathan ca n't reconcile his passionate devotion to nature with the materialism that surrounds him in his school most overcome these problems , go on to college and form stable relationships hersch ends with a plea to parents to pay more attention to their children that s probably a good idea but her book also recounts many instances when she and the students find the schools responding superficially and hypocritically \( a huge banner that greets incoming students at langston hughes middle school announces image is everything \) and when students , encouraged to compose speeches that highlight issues of concern to teenagers during the 1992 presidential campaign , predictably write about sexual harassment , drug use and abortion , the school refuses to allow students to read them at an assembly attended by politicians because they are deemed inappropriate during a lacrosse game , a player blindsides an africanamerican athlete and calls him a loathsome racial epithet all the young man and his father want is an apology from the offending player and his school , but neither responds one wishes that hersch had confronted the schools about their morally ambiguous policies and situational ethics but she is so intent on telling the story solely from the teenagers' point of view that such issues are left hanging nevertheless , a tribe apart is instructive because it demonstrates that if teenagers are a muddle of contradictions , it s partly because they reflect the adult world
washington , sept 24 seeking to repair political missteps , representative henry j hyde said today that it was he , not speaker newt gingrich , who would preside over impeachment deliberations , and mr hyde played down suggestions that republicans were seeking to broaden the inquiry beyond monica s lewinsky mr hyde , the illinois republican who heads the house judiciary committee , called a news conference a day after the white house and congressional democrats asserted that the speaker was calling the shots and was motivated by partisan zeal republicans who have been on the losing side in other confrontations between the president and mr gingrich feared they had stepped into another political trap , as mr clinton has consistently been found to be more popular than the speaker today mr hyde sought to stamp his inquiry with his voice and visage i was selected to chair this committee , presumably not as a delegate of the speaker s office , but as a person who has some autonomy , mr hyde said in the committee hearing room that bears his newly installed portrait we 've tried to exercise it and will continue to do so but the comments failed to dispel the conflicting signals sent by mr hyde and mr gingrich and left some republicans confused about who was actually quarterbacking the deliberations some committee republican called on their leaders to let the panel do its job it s a classic case of too many chiefs , said representative lindsey graham , a south carolina republican who has been a persistent critic of mr gingrich our leadership is trying to figure out what to do unlike on wednesday , mr gingrich today repeatedly refused to comment on the impeachment deliberations , and his spokeswoman , christina martin , sought to squelch the controversy , saying , henry hyde is in charge taking his first swipe at the republicans over impeachment , president clinton said the only way out of an inquiry was to put progress over partisanship , put people over politics , put the american people first in announcing lower poverty rates , mr clinton criticized inattention to issues people care about , like social security , and said , it is utterly foolish to be diverted or distracted from the urgent challenges facing us for their part , republicans pressed ahead with setting a timetable on the impeachment matter , and mr hyde outlined the panel s schedule for the next two weeks on friday , the committee will meet in closed session to decide which portions of the remaining 65 , 000 pages of evidence from kenneth w starr , the whitewater independent counsel , to release committee aides have been poring over the material , which includes the tape recorded conversations between ms lewinsky and linda r tripp aides have flagged portions deemed too private , too embarrassing or irrelevant , and lawmakers will vote on the proposed deletions the committee will then vote on oct 5 or oct 6 whether to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into 11 charges made against president clinton by mr starr in his impeachment report mr hyde said that if the committee approved a measure to open the inquiry , the full house would vote on the measure a few days later , probably on oct 8 or 9 like all americans i want to bring this matter to closure as soon as possible , mr hyde said our guide is deliberate speed , not too fast that people can accuse us of rushing to judgment and not too slow so people can accuse of deliberately stretching it out for political purposes even as mr hyde was trying to stamp out some of the political fires surrounding mr gingrich , the chairman appeared to ignite two new blazes himself first , mr hyde indicated the committee would likely release edited transcripts of the tape recordings between ms lewinsky and mrs tripp , but not the tapes themselves democrats themselves were divided about whether to release the tapes , but they accused republicans of hypocrisy , saying that republicans who had called for the release of mr clinton s videotape deposition were now balking at material that might prove favorable to mr clinton it s unacceptable to pretend to be conducting a bipartisan investigation and then vote not to release the tapes , said representative martin t meehan , a massachusetts democrat in the tapes , when you can listen to them , you can get a better sense of the credibility or lack of credibility but another massachusetts democrat , representative barney frank , said , we will not be pushing for release of the tapes republican aides said later that mr hyde did not oppose releasing the tapes if democrats insisted mr hyde was only worried about the logistics of deleting sensitive references , the aides said then mr hyde said if the committee conducted a formal impeachment inquiry , he did not think it would be necessary to call ms lewinsky as a witness , saying her sworn testimony was good enough i would rather not , mr hyde said i do n't think that would be too productive democrats pounced on those remarks how are we going to have an inquiry if we 're not going to listen to witnesses \? mr frank said what are we going to do at these hearings \? play records \? by late afternoon , mr hyde s office issued a statement correcting those comments certainly no decisions have been made on who might testify , if the committee holds formal hearings , mr hyde said after saying little on wednesday , mr hyde s main goal today seemed to tamp down mr gingrich s suggestions that the committee s inquiry might expand to include accusations about campaign finance abuses by democrats , illicit transfer of sensitive missile technology to china , and other accusations that mr starr is still investigating the committee would consider any new , serious accusations , mr hyde said , but he made it clear the panel was plenty busy none of us are interested in casting a very wide net , mr hyde said we have enough on our plate , believe me
when candace de russy taught a course called america and historical decline a few years ago at the new school for social research , her favorite author was the spanish philosopher jose ortega y gasset she was taken with his lament over the decline of european civilization , the decline of standards and the lack of leadership by the passive elite she , too , is preoccupied with the decline of standards , but she is anything but passive she was an architect of the core curriculum that the state university of new york adopted last week and as a suny trustee , she has become one of the most outspoken and powerful voices nationally in reshaping higher education she is willing to walk through fire and take hectoring and ridicule that most people do n't have the stomach for , said thomas w carroll , president of change new york , a conservative advocacy group i really ca n't think of any comparable person around the country , and i 've looked to the dismay of critics , who accuse dr de russy \( her name is pronounced duhruesee \) of micromanaging suny and trampling on academic freedom , there is little on suny s 64 campuses that escapes her attention when she found out that a women s studies conference at suny new paltz last year included sessions on sadomasochism and sex toys , for example , she drew national attention to the meeting , calling it academically beyond the pale and an irresponsible use of public funds and she has been pressing for a variety of changes at suny from the adoption of a core curriculum to stronger accountability for college presidents not content just to shape suny , dr de russy , 55 , has reached beyond new york by writing a stream of newspaper articles and delivering speeches at national conferences i do not , to say the least , perceive myself to be the font of all wisdom , she said but i was appointed and explicitly exhorted by the governor to exercise my best judgment in those fiscal and academic matters entrusted to me i believe that broad , essentially disciplinebased general education serves the best interest of students and society i believe this to be right , she added and i am obliged in my heart and mind to do what is right such activism is unusual for a college trustee , said jerry l martin , president of the american council of trustees and alumni , a conservative interest group of which dr de russy is a member the typical higher education maxim is , 'do n't rock the boat , ' he said but she s making waves not everyone is cheering assemblyman edward c sullivan , a democrat of manhattan who is chairman of the assembly s higher education committee , said such heavy oversight may hurt suny you cannot run a modern university with political appointees harassing the professors as to what and how they teach , he said , alluding to her actions against suny new paltz good professors and administrators will not come if that is allowed arnold b gardner , another suny trustee , said dr de russy has provoked discussion , but she s done some injury to the reputation of the university by suggesting they never heard of standards before with some 370 , 000 students on 64 campuses , suny is one of the largest public university systems in the country , but none of its campuses has ever had the cachet of the university of michigan at ann arbor or the university of california at berkeley and under gov george e pataki , it was ripe for change many of dr de russy s fellow board members , also appointed by the governor , share her views on education , and together they control the 15member board while she offers passion and an agenda , thomas f egan , the board chairman , and other trustees provide the political skills to turn ideas into policy unlike most of the other trustees whose jobs limit their time , dr de russy has virtually made suny a fulltime career she is a westchester county resident married to cortes de russy , a banking executive , and although she said she had considered running for office , she concluded that her family life was more important and said that she was more interested in issues than politics she devotes hours to writing articles , book reviews and memos she is frequently in touch with others focused on education , including reporters , not hesitating to call again and again to make sure she explains her positions thoroughly others might work 60 to 80 hours a week at a job she has this , said mr carroll of change new york this is her passion , and she also has the luxury of time dr de russy is an elegant woman , with a deep , melodious voice , carefully trimmed blond hair and a love for silk scarves and other rich fabrics \( she wore a red velvet smoking jacket to last week s board meeting \) but she is willing to act tough when suny s provost , peter d salins , failed to complete a survey on core courses last month , she lashed out at him during a meeting it did not matter that he was usually her ally , or that she supported him for the job she was impatient to move ahead peeeterrrr , she said , drawing out his name slowly and reprovingly , you said you would report to us dr de russy s vision grew out of her own upbringing in baton rouge , la her father , a city judge , passed on to her his love for the classics dr de russy recalled listening to the socratic dialogues on the phonograph and at st mary s dominican college in new orleans , her studies were filled with the classics , religion and philosophy i will be forever grateful for the strong liberal arts foundation i was given , she said , and i want to bring that great advantage to students today after studying jean genet at the sorbonne and earning a doctorate in french literature at tulane university , she headed north with her husband and began teaching european languages and literature at small catholic colleges but she always has been interested in public affairs and causes , from efforts on behalf of vietnamese boat people and cuban prisoners to the westchester branch of change new york , an antitax group she was an early supporter of mr pataki for governor as her two children entered school , dr de russy also began writing and speaking on education she was distressed by what she saw as a lack of educational standards and she believed that a critical solution was to require rigorous courses that would give students basic knowledge about subjects like history and literature and skills like writing five years ago , she was named to the board of westchester community college , and in 1995 , governor pataki promoted her to suny s board , where she quickly offered her own agenda last week , she delightedly declared victory when the core curriculum was approved by her fellow trustees , and said she hoped that governing boards across the country would take similar action she also expressed excitement on friday about the state s new provisions that would allow suny to issue charters for autonomous public schools , which she said will present suny with an exciting opportunity to contribute at the cutting edge to the improvement of kthrough12 education in the state and she was already turning her attention to the issues she said she wanted to press next grading policies , teacher education , admissions standards and measures of what students have learned photo candace de russy , a trustee of the state university of new york \(

at the request of president clinton , the ethical implications of creating hybrid humancow cells were discussed by the national bioethics advisory commission at its meeting yesterday in miami , but at least in the public portion of their discussion , none of the commissioners voiced concern about the creation of the hybrid cells mr clinton requested the discussion last week in a letter to the commission s chairman , dr harold shapiro of princeton university mr clinton said he was deeply troubled by news that advanced cell technology , a small biotechnology company in worcester , mass , had created the hybrid cells the company proposes to use the technique to take any body cell from a patient , return it to its embryonic form and use it to grow any of a variety of body tissues for possible transplant back into the patient one advantage of the technique is that the patient would receive tissues made from his own cells another is that no cells would be taken from human embryos or fetuses noting that scientists had been fusing together cells of different origin for years , dr david r cox of stanford university , a member of the commission , said , we should tell the president there is nothing new in cells fused from different eggs the hybrid cowhuman cells consist of the nucleus of a human cell inserted into a cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed factors in the cow egg are thought to make the human cell nucleus revert to its embryonic form because the proteins of a cell turn over rapidly , the cow proteins are expected to be rapidly replaced by human proteins the mitochondria of the cell , however , are likely to remain cowlike , giving rise at least initially to cells that are not wholly human an outside expert who spoke to the commission by telephone , ralph brinster , a physiologist at the university of pennsylvania , said of the cowhuman hybrid cell , most scientists would not regard it as a chimera chimeras are animals made from the cells of two different individuals by injecting the embryonic cells of one into the embryo of another making human chimeras is widely regarded as unethical dr michael west , the president of advanced cell technology , attended the commission s meeting and was invited speak in response to questions , he said he did not believe the cells formed in his procedure , called embryonic stem cells , were capable of forming a fetus if transferred to a uterus , something he said he had no intention of doing asked how he would prevent the technique from being misused , such as in cloning a person , he suggested that the cloning of humans should be made a crime the commission members said they would draft a reply to mr clinton
the san diego padres were set up to be road kill by the time may arrived a club that scared precious few last year faced a daunting task this spring play 25 of its first 37 games on the road and survive how could the padres , just another underachieving club along the southern california coast , do that if left intact \? padres management did n't wait to find out instead the club imported some bite first it signed kevin brown , an irascible but often brilliant pitcher brown , one of the stars jettisoned by the world champion florida marlins , is just 22 , but his earned run average sparkles at 293 brown , winner of 33 games the last two seasons , was expected to be a formidable addition to a team that had no starter with more than 12 victories last year the padres then added an even fiercer persona their new pitching coach , dave stewart , whose fu manchu mustache and withering glare were as much a part of his legend as were his four 20victory seasons with oakland , his three world series rings and his record eight league championship series victories stewart had been serving as a special assistant to san diego s general manager , kevin towers , as he pursued his own goals a berth as a general manager and the challenge of building a world championship team , to round out my career , he said stewart , speaking from miami where the national league westleading padres split a fourgame series with the marlins ending yesterday , had n't seen his course to a gm s office necessarily going through the dugout but the padres implored him , seeing a need to toughen their pitching approach in the wake of a timid effort in 1997 when no starter had an era under 400 , none managed a shutout and the team compiled only four complete games so far the added presence of the two aces , old and new , has put a decided growl in the padres' pitching attack , helping san diego build a 209 record , tops in the league the usual stars have shined on offense , with tony gwynn wielding his golden bat , hitting 362 , and ken caminiti leading the club with 21 runs batted in despite concerns over an injured quadriceps then there is the pitching , sizzling and strong only the brewers and mets have done it better than the padres , whose team era after yesterday s 10 loss to the marlins stood at 351 opponents were hitting only 239 against san diego going into the game , the second lowest average in the league behind the 226 being hit against the dodgers the rotation is led by andy ashby , who fell to 42 after losing yesterday to the marlins' jesus sanchez it was ashby s first loss in his last six starts the bullpen has recorded 11 saves trevor hoffman is a perfect eight for eight i wish i could say it was me , but there s a lot of talent on this staff , stewart said still , stewart s presence cannot be ignored he remains as competitive as he was in the days when he soared over the likes of the future hall of famer roger clemens \( stewart 9 , clemens 1 in headtohead matches \) that was made eminently clear in spring training when stewart levied fines for fraternization intense , stewart is also undeterred when it comes to his longterm goals if someone called me tonight and offered a general manager s job , i 'd take the uniform off , he said but stewart realized that he was not likely to receive any overtures for another few years the team needed him in another capacity so stewart consented , on the advice of friends like the former yankees gm bob watson , the white sox gm ron schueler and the mets assistant gm omar minaya , and after assurances that his other job title remained undisturbed and his goals remained clear now stewart is completely immersed you develop such strong relationships with the players , it would make it difficult to walk away , he said stewart demands high standards as well as effort , and believes his credentials give him that right kevin asked me what i would do if somebody would question what i was about or what i was trying to teach , stewart said of towers i said that my response would probably be to bring in my rings , from three championship teams and five league championship teams , and lay them on the table then i would say , 'hey , i will without a doubt listen to you if you 've done the same or more' no such conversation has been necessary i think they perfectly understand what i'm trying to get at , stewart said they 've gotten it done that s what has been so special about this the padres pitchers are not the only beneficiaries of stewart s detour my responsibility as a player was to take care of my business , stewart said now i have to think in terms of taking care of other pitchers , to figure out what works for them you 're dealing with personnel , and personalities that will help in management right now it is helping san diego on the field , so much so you can almost detect the smile behind the glares and the growls

toronto , june 2 you can study here and be home for supper , declared an advertisement for the university of windsor published recently in the detroit news but just in case that was not inducement enough , officials of the university in windsor , ontario , on the detroit river opposite detroit are lowering tuition for americans beginning this fall we think this is a tremendous deal for us students , said dr ross h paul , the university s president with this new tuition fee , we are offering young american men and women access to a solid education at a competitive price the price is 3 , 500 \( united states \) a year for american undergraduates , compared with about 6 , 500 for other foreign students and about 2 , 500 for canadians information has been sent to more than 4 , 500 high school seniors in michigan , ohio and indiana , eliciting several hundred inquiries with only 10 american undergraduates out of 10 , 000 at the university of windsor this year , administrators are hoping for a windfall by the september application deadline for the coming school year what struck me was the small number of american students we have enrolled here now , dr paul said crossing the border both ways is an everyday occurrence for many people the aggressive marketing strategy comes in the wake of deregulation of foreign student fees by the ontario government , along with severe cuts in money from ottawa over the last five years the cutbacks have forced a more corporate mindset , with the united states seen as a largely untapped market about 3 , 000 americans study in canada every year , compared with 23 , 000 canadians in the united states the deregulation of international fees has really changed the climate , said david a scott , senior adviser for government and community relations at the council of ontario universities while recruiting foreign students is not a new idea , mr scott said , the strategy is business tactics become fuzzy when talking about academic institutions , he added other universities are also looking to the united states to increase their visibility , enrollment and income in 1996 the university of toronto teamed with mcgill university in montreal and queen s university in kingston , ontario , for a 15city marketing tour of the united states , visiting high schools and college fairs it s simple economics , said paul r beel , mcgill s recruitment activities officer there is great opportunity for american students to come up to canada our dollar makes it a lot less expensive , plus they can study in a foreign country without facing cultural shock applications from american students were up by 30 percent this academic year mcgill now has the highest number of american students of any university in canada 1 , 500 , or 15 percent of students all three universities , among the most prestigious in the country , considered last year s marketing effort a success , and a similar endeavor is planned for this fall but none intend to lower fees for noncanadian students , though they are watching windsor s experiment closely some canadian students are concerned about the shifting priorities this is nothing short of a cashgrab to make up for federal government cutbacks , said brad levigne , national chairman of the canadian federation of students part of the problem is that costs have become so prohibitive for southwestern ontario residents that they have to turn to american students they 're just cash cows with government cutbacks of more than 75 billion for postsecondary education since the 199394 academic year , the proportion of a university s operating revenue financed through student fees has increased to 40 percent this year from 25 percent in 199293 tuition has always been regulated by canada s provincial governments , largely because it has been so heavily subsidized by taxpayers but two years ago the ontario government deregulated foreign student tuition , allowing schools to set their own fees it has just announced the deregulation of fees for graduate programs and professional colleges for the coming academic year while tuition for canadian students has risen to 2 , 500 \( united states \) at most institutions from about 1 , 000 in 1991 , fees for foreign students have remained stable at about 6 , 500 until windsor s discount to americans dr paul , windsor s president , is excited about the initiative , but he is not immune to a certain amount of handwringing over the changes that the university s decision signifies we have to be really aware of the danger of focusing on the short term just to get bodies in here , dr paul said if i denied there were strong market forces at work behind this decision , you would n't believe me but we 've watched the same thing happen in the united states and learned some lessons when the arena gets more competitive you can oversubsidize students you can almost buy them but we know if we lose our academic integrity we are lost tom sees , assistant vice president of wayne state university in detroit , windsor s closest competitor , says he does not feel territorial about a canadian university dipping into the american student pool nonetheless , wayne announced last month that it was lowering its tuition , to 2 , 500 from 7 , 000 , for canadians as well as for ohio residents in four counties bordering michigan we 're looking at this as a sort of good neighbor policy , mr sees said about 200 canadian students attended wayne this year if you do n't look at your students as consumers , mr sees said , you are not going to stay in business much longer this is exactly the kind of americanization the students' federation fears with this market mentality , degrees will be devalued , mr levigne said people should be concerned about the quality of their education , not what kind of bang they are getting for their buck david b young , president of the university of windsor s student alliance , took a different approach any additional student we get is better than nothing , mr young said it will help reduce the overhead , reduce the pressure for canadian students' tuition to go up and having more american students here will increase our cultural diversity how can that not be a good thing \? photo the detroit skyline , viewed from the university of windsor in ontario , presents an alluring metropolis ripe for recruiting students map showing the locations of wayne state university and the university of windsor colleges on opposite sides of the border compete for students
beijing , march 16 china s new leadership lineup was partly completed today as the national people s congress , the national legislature , elected the man who has been prime minister for 10 years , li peng , as its next chairman the vote , which ratified a choice made earlier in secret by communist party leaders , marks the continued survival near the top of a man many chinese dislike because of his prominent role in the suppression of studentled demonstrations at tiananmen square in 1989 there had been speculation that mr li might be embarrassed by significant numbers of no votes or abstentions by delegates , all of whom were selected by the communist party he received 89 percent of the votes cast a poor showing by the historic standards of partyrun elections , but not so bad as to seriously weaken him today s balloting by the nearly 3 , 000 delegates followed weeks of vigorous lobbying behind closed doors by party officials eager to show a unified face to the nation and the world approaching the end of its 15day session , the national people s congress also formally reelected jiang zemin as president of china and chairman of the central military commission mr jiang , who is also general secretary of the communist party the core of his power remains first among the country s leaders on tuesday , the congress ratified zhu rongji , the guiding hand in recent economic policy in recent years , as the new prime minister by a vote of 2 , 890 in favor to 60 no votes or abstentions , the associated press reported on wednesday , the new government ministers will be confirmed mr li is believed to represent a more cautious and conservative strain among china s top leaders he is stepping down as prime minister , a more powerful job than his new one , because he has served out the maximum two fiveyear terms set by china s constitution but he is officially ranked in second place within the party s ruling politburo , perhaps setting the stage for conflict with the impatient , boldly assertive mr zhu , who is ranked third in the party hierarchy today the congress also confirmed hu jintao as vice president , a possible measure to groom him for future top positions at 55 the youngest member of the politburo s sevenmember standing committee , he has long been seen as a comer within the party and has enjoyed mr jiang s patronage in the past , the position of vice president has been seen as mainly ceremonial but senior officials are said to hope that his new post will give mr hu more visibility trained as an engineer , he was party chief in two provinces and is now the president of the central party school in beijing , which trains party officials as the newly shuffled leadership takes over , chinese and foreign observers are wondering about the possible effect on the congress and its evolving role the congress is often called a rubber stamp for party decisions , and it is largely that but under mr li s predecessor , qiao shi , it had become more assertive , helping to shape new laws and monitoring how they are carried out in recent years , sizable minorities of delegates have also made protest votes to register unhappiness with the government s response to crime , for example , or to express opposition to the costly , giant three gorges dam project on the yangtze river the question is whether under the more conservative mr li , the congress may cease to be a force for spreading the rule of law but some analysts point out that mr li will now see the congress as his own base of power he would n't be the first person to move there and start to become a bornagain fan of legislative autonomy , said murray scot tanner , a political scientist at western michigan university who has studied the national people s congress if li peng is to have a bureaucracy to support him on policy issues , it will be the npc s bureaucracy curiously , the liberal secondranking person in the congress , first vice chairman tian jiyun , will continue in that influential job he was allied with the ousted mr qiao but was associated earlier with zhao ziyang , the communist party head who was removed in 1989 when he expressed too much sympathy for the tiananmen square demonstrators mr zhao is under house arrest , and mr tian is a rare former associate now in high office he is also a member of the party politburo mr tian , even more than the departed mr qiao , has pushed the idea that the way for the party to save itself is to become a party of law , with a more assertive legislature and greater oversight of the government , mr tanner said mr li and mr tian have been bitter rivals in the past , and how they will get along inside the congress is unclear but mr li has secured the appointment of one of his followers , he chunlin , to the key post of secretary general of the national people s congress , the person who directly supervises its expanding professional staff despite the differences in emphasis among these various senior leaders , none have questioned the central role of the communist party in ruling china but some , like mr tian , have placed greater emphasis on fostering more open discussion and choice a major emphasis of the reform wing , too , has been using provincial and national legislators to monitor the performance of the government , especially at local levels where corruption is a serious problem and laws often are ignored at least one official allied with the reform forces professes not to be worried about mr li s move li peng has served as prime minister for a long time ,

alan b shepard jr , the first american to fly in space , lifting national spirits at a decisive moment of cold war anxiety , and later one of only 12 astronauts to walk on the moon , died late tuesday night at a hospital in monterey , calif he was 74 and lived in houston and pebble beach , calif the family would not disclose the cause of death , saying only that it came after a long illness but another former astronaut , senator john glenn of ohio , said mr shepard had been suffering from leukemia on the morning of may 5 , 1961 , mr shepard became an immediate american hero a lean , crewcut former navy test pilot , then 37 , he began the day lying on his back in a cramped mercury capsule atop a sevenstory redstone rocket filled with explosive fuel after four tense hours of weather and mechanical delays , he was shot into the sky on a 15minute flight that grazed the fringes of space , at an altitude of 115 miles , and ended in a splashdown in the atlantic ocean 302 miles downrange from cape canaveral , fla though not much by today s standards , the brief suborbital flight had stopped a whole country in its tracks , waiting anxiously at radios and television sets when the message of success came through with a phrase that would enter the idiom , everything is aok ! everyone seemed to let out a collective sigh of relief yuri gagarin of the soviet union may have been first into space , 23 days before , and have flown a full orbit , but with mr shepard s flight the united states finally had reason to cheer in fact , mr shepard s success is credited with giving president john f kennedy the confidence to commit the nation to the goal of landing men on the moon within the decade he announced the goal to congress on may 25 daniel s goldin , head of the national aeronautics and space administration , said the shepard flight was a tremendous statement about tenacity , courage and brilliance , adding with a tone of lingering awe he crawled on top of that rocket that had never before flown into space with a person aboard and he did it that was an unbelievable act of courage dr john m logsdon , a political scientist at george washington university and author of the decision to go to the moon , said , one can make the argument that the success of the shepard flight enabled the decision to go to the moon the historian arthur m schlesinger jr , a member of the kennedy white house staff , recalled that the gagarin flight and then the bay of pigs fiasco in cuba a few days later had given americans a slight inferiority complex then the shepard flight produced a great exhilaration and renewed our confidence in our capacity as a nation president clinton hailed mr shepard as one of the great heroes of modern america ten years after the first flight , mr shepard made a comeback from a serious innerear problem , called meuniere s syndrome , that had grounded him and it was also a comeback flight for the space program on jan 31 , 1971 , he took off for the moon in apollo 14 , the first lunar mission since the neardisaster of apollo 13 the year before he and edgar mitchell spent 33 hours on the moon , a visit made memorable by mr shepard s taking several spirited whacks at golf balls with a makeshift sixiron he had taken along in the weak lunar gravity , the balls sailed he lived every golfer s dream , mr clinton remarked , taking a six iron and hitting the ball , in his words , 'for miles and miles' mr shepard was one of the original seven mercury astronauts chosen in 1959 by the fledgling space agency and introduced with great fanfare his death leaves four survivors scott carpenter , l gordon cooper , walter schirra and senator glenn , who at 77 is training for a kind of farewell flight on the space shuttle in october mr glenn in 1962 became the first american to orbit the earth virgil i \( gus \) grissom died in a cockpit fire during a launchingpad training exercise in 1967 donald k \( deke \) slayton died of cancer in 1993 in 1974 , mr shepard retired from both nasa and the navy , where he had achieved the rank of rear admiral already wealthy from real estate and other investments , he became chairman of the marathon construction corporation in houston and later founded his own business company , seven fourteen enterprises the name recognized his two missions , freedom 7 and apollo 14 alan bartlett shepard jr was born on nov 18 , 1923 , in east derry , nh , where his father , a retired army colonel , was in the insurance business young alan took odd jobs at a local airfield to learn more about planes his education began in a oneroom country school , continued with high school at the pinkerton academy in nearby derry and was completed at the united states naval academy , where he graduated in 1944 he served briefly on a destroyer in the pacific in world war ii before turning to aviation after flight training in texas and florida and service on aircraft carriers in the mediterranean , he entered testpilot training at patuxent river , md , elevating himself into the elite of military aviation when nasa asked 110 test pilots to volunteer to be astronauts , mr shepard made the list and was one of seven chosen

celebration , fla one hot afternoon last month , my wife , catherine collins , was riding her bicycle home from the post office here when a blue car with pennsylvania license plates pulled alongside her one of the children in the car leaned out the window and asked , can you tell me where truman lives \? pardon me \? catherine replied , suspecting some kind of tourist joke truman , the child s mother said emphatically did n't you see the movie \? oh , that truman , said catherine , who had in fact seen the truman story , the media satire starring jim carrey he was just a character it was all makebelieve and anyway , it was n't filmed here it was filmed over in seaside , on the panhandle it was n't the first time we had run into the misconception that the movie had been filmed in celebration or that the new town where we live is some sort of unticketed gate for disney world , which is about eight miles away there are similarities between the fictional movie town and this postneotraditional town built by those masters of makebelieve , the walt disney company both are pretty and orderly , populated by smiling , waving residents and blessed by sunny skies and warm temperatures and like the movie town , celebration has its own unique rules and designs for social engineering but , after living here for 15 months , we can testify that celebration is a real place , with its own attributes and its own problems indeed , the town represents an ambitious , reallife attempt by disney to employ architecture and urban design to revive the sense of community and place that americans tell pollsters are missing in traditional suburbs as journalists , we have lived all over the country , mostly in or on the edges of major cities we have been pleasantly surprised to find a degree of community spirit and neighborliness in celebration that we have n't encountered elsewhere we know everyone on our street , except for one family that never seems to be at home , and block parties and townwide festivities are frequent and popular part of the reason for this community camaraderie is the sense that we are all pioneers in this new town but some of it is attributable to the careful planning that went into celebration s design the first residents moved in during the summer of 1996 , and today the town has about 2 , 000 people out of a projected population of 20 , 000 the 5 , 000acre tract on which the town is being built is part of the 30 , 000 acres walt disney accumulated in the early 1960 s for his second theme park when company planners determined that this swath of swamp and cow pasture would not be needed for the future expansion of disney world , michael eisner , the company s chairman and chief executive , gave a green light to developing the town , though it had nothing to do with the company s core business of entertainment the architect robert a m stern , a disney board member and one of the designers of celebration s master plan , described mr eisner s motives in grandiose terms michael s feeling was that , if the company were going to do this , it was going to be something that would set an example , he said it would demonstrate that this was a great company with a great sense of public obligation mr eisner , in a telephone interview from his corporate jet a few days ago , was more pragmatic the motivation was to do something with the property , he said once you decide to do something , you want to do it in an excellent way in fact , mr eisner professed surprise at all the attention celebration has received in the press i just thought we were doing something small and unique , he said , though in the past he has said he hoped the town would be a model for development in the next millennium but no one involved in the project ever thought small along with mr stern , the roster of architects for celebration s public buildings included many of the profession s biggest names michael graves designed the post office , robert venturi and denise scott brown designed the bank and cesar pelli designed the 1930 sera movie house philip johnson created town hall , and the real estate sales center was the last building designed by charles w moore , who died in 1993 mr stern and his collaborator , jacquelin robertson , another new york architect , paid close attention to the details of the master plan for the town most of the streets are straight and narrow to slow traffic and empower pedestrians and bicyclists but there are also sweeping arterial streets that carry the tourist and business traffic to the town center the houses are close together , most with front porches to promote neighborhood interaction garages are tucked away at the rear and entered from alleys most houses are within a fiveminute walk of downtown , though that will change as sections farther from the town center are developed lots are small , with as little as 10 feet separating houses in many instances , but the tradeoff is plentiful parks and other public spaces house prices range from about 175 , 000 to 1 million or more , but even the mansions must conform to a strict design code that reflects a southeastern vernacular architecture from the pre1940 s there are deep porches , gables , dormers , loggia and largecolumned porticoes to promote consistency and cohesiveness , the exterior color palette is limited to white and pale shades of beige , blue , yellow , green and pink

chicago , sept 4 the yankees achieved their 100th victory tonight , the earliest date any team has reached that mark in the 20th century they will continue to surpass or threaten other historical standards in the last three and a half weeks of the regular season but yankees manager joe torre would swap any and all recordbook notations for assurance that the middle relievers jeff nelson and mike stanton will be pitching effectively by the time the american league playoffs start on sept 29 both made progress in tonight s 116 victory over the white sox at comiskey park the final score was deceptive the yankees trailed by 43 before bernie williams and tino martinez hit backtoback home runs in the eighth inning and before the yankees added four more runs in the ninth williams hit two of the yankees' four home runs this is all new ground to me , torre said in noting the yankees' 100 victories the closest i came to 100 was 99 losses with the mets the 1906 chicago cubs and the 1954 cleveland indians each earned their 100th victories on sept 9 , the previous calendar record the '98 yankees are 10038 , and only four teams in the 20th century have reached 100 victories with fewer losses , the last being the 1909 pittsburgh pirates \( 37 losses \) the yankees' magic number for clinching the american league east title is down to five but the performances of nelson and stanton are what will make torre s breakfast go down easier this morning nelson , activated before tonight s game after spending more than two months on the disabled list with back trouble , relieved orlando hernandez at the start of the seventh inning to face frank thomas and albert belle throwing a good fastball and complementing that with his slider , nelson retired each on fly balls before being replaced after the yankees took the lead in the top of the eighth and the white sox scored a run in the bottom half of the inning , stanton , who has pitched miserably lately , came on with runners at first and second and two out and struck out the lefthandedhitting mike caruso to end the inning this was good , torre said i was happy to get nelly in that situation that was huge for stanton said nelson after being out two months , and facing two of the best hitters in the league , i escaped i thought i 'd be nervous , but i was n't that bad in the context of pursuing a world series title , getting nelson back and restoring stanton s confidence will be the only issues that really matter in the season s final 25 games they are the first priority , torre said before the game , referring to nelson , stanton and darren holmes , another reliever activated off the disabled list today we need to find out if they 're healthy and figure out what our options are in torre s perfect world , nelson will come back , quickly regain his dominance over righthanded batters and provide the yankee manager with the option of keeping hernandez in the rotation should nelson falter and some members of the organization think the chances of his complete recovery are 5050 torre may be forced to shift hernandez to a relief role in the playoffs to give the bullpen a righthander who can generate strikeouts nelson pitched in two injury rehabilitation assignments for class a tampa , but his real tests began tonight , beginning with thomas and belle nelson feels that his arm strength and the quality of his slider are back to normal , but he acknowledges that his back , which has kept him out of major league action since june 24 , is not fully healed he can still feel a hint of discomfort that probably will not go away until he is able to rest fully but nelson says that the back has not bothered him when he pitched , and that any discomfort the day after has not forced him to alter his rehabilitation he believes he will be healthy enough to pitch , but he will soon discover how effective he can be i have 25 games to get ready for the playoffs , nelson said nelson s status already has had a domino affect on the yankees' staff because nelson was on the disabled list , stanton assumed responsibility he normally would n't have had stanton has struggled , compiling an 807 earned run average in his last 29 appearances going into tonight s game , allowing 40 hits , 15 walks and 33 runs in 35 2 3 innings torre has tried to replace nelson with a number of righthanders , including holmes \( before he was injured in late july \) , mike buddie and ramiro mendoza but none of those pitchers has duplicated nelson s ability to strike out righthanded batters , which could be pivotal in various playoff matchups cleveland has the righthanded hitters manny ramirez and sandy alomar jr anaheim fields tim salmon texas has juan gonzalez and ivan rodriguez and boston has nomar garciaparra and mike stanley it s important for me to come back , nelson said said david cone he s the kind of swingandmiss righthander we miss out of the bullpen he can strike out guys like juan gonzalez and frank thomas shifting hernandez into nelson s role carries some risks hernandez has never pitched in relief and the yankees have no idea how his arm will respond to being used on consecutive days , or how long it would take him to warm up torre may be reluctant to move hernandez into relief simply because he has been one of the team s most effective starters the last month inside pitch chicago led , 43 , but singles by chuck knoblauch and derek jeter tied the game and bernie williams s tworun homer gave the yankees' a 64 lead before tino martinez followed williams with a homer of his own jeter had another hit in the ninth inning to push his batting average to 335 , while three hits left williams with a 344 average the teammates are ranked first and second in the american league in batting average i told them before the game , 'i'm going to get you guys tied and then i'm not playing you the rest of the year , ' manager joe torre joked martinez leads the yankees with 25 homers , williams has 23 , and the yankees have eight players with 15 or more home runs , tying a majorleague record set by the 1991 texas rangers jim abbott , the pitcher with one hand who has slowly made a comeback to the big leagues , will make his first major league appearance in nearly two years on saturday , against the yankees torre said that while he wants the yankees to beat abbott , he hopes the pitcher , who once threw a nohitter for the yankees , does well enough the rest of the season to regain some of the enjoyment in baseball that he once had
hardwick , vt , march 9 as new towers for cellular phone traffic have cropped up by the thousands from coast to coast , so have the spats , the lawsuits and the local rebellions , from california to new jersey to florida but vermont , with its sylvan sensibilities , is mounting an antitower offensive unlike any other these days , making itself the new national focal point for what until now has been a scattered guerrilla war i do n't want vermont turned into a giant pincushion with 200foot towers sticking out of every mountain and valley , declared the state s democratic united states senator , patrick j leahy we 're not asking that vermont be left out of the telecommunications age but we vermonters want to be able to determine where the towers are located so hot is the tower issue in vermont that mr leahy and two congressional colleagues , senator james m jeffords , a republican , and representative bernard sanders , an independent , held a meeting today to discuss it in this north country hamlet , where a 150foot tower is planned for the top of buffalo mountain their special guest was william kennard , the new chairman of the federal communications commission , who traveled the state s muddy roads to hear vermonters' concerns what mr kennard heard was plaints that cellphone towers ruin the scenery and reduce property values mixed with expressions of appreciation for the brave new wireless world that compote was the kind of jumble of opinions that has troubled hundreds of american towns like hardwick in recent months as they contemplated their part in the construction of more than 100 , 000 antenna sites by 2005 , more than a tenth of them requiring towers it s a stark clash that is upon us , mr kennard told the 200 or so vermonters gathered in a high school auditorium the essence of the issue is that ageold political flash point , local control congress decreed in 1996 that it was in the national interest to create a seamless network of cellular communications across the country , and few people in this nation of about 56 million cell phone users would object to that concept to make sure that this seamless network was created , congress also decreed in effect that though local governments could exercise their usual zoning powers in deciding where towers went and how tall they were , they could not simply say no to cellular phone companies that wanted to put towers in their cities or towns if localities resisted unreasonably , the federal telecommunications act of 1996 said , the federal government could override them around the country , scores of local groups have banded together to fight particular towers planned for particular spots as tracked on a cellular tower coalition web site , they range from residents in north barrington , ill , trying to stop a 200foot tower on their village hall to a boca raton , fla , group fighting towers on school property more than 600 towns have put moratoriums on new tower sitings at some point , cellular industry groups say , and some of the bans have lasted as long as two years but vermont , its officials say , is leading the charge in the national political arena for local control over tower decisions mr leahy , mr jeffords and mr sanders have combined forces to push bills in congress that would restore full local control over towersiting decisions all three are vehement in their assertions that vermont , with its love for its green hills and its new englandy independent spirit , should be sovereign over its towers and they have many allies in the populace none of us are antitechnology , said holly fournier , an investment adviser who has been fighting for years to have a tower taken down in her vermont town of charlotte we just want to make sure the towers are appropriately sited but even in vermont , the hardwick discussion showed , opinions are deeply split most everybody likes the convenience and lifesaving potential of cell phones but they do not trust cellular phone giants backed by federal clout the natural landscapes of vermont are our greatest economic resource , said janet newton , a resident of the thistle hill area of cabot , which has been fighting a proposed cell tower we vermonters claim the right to make landuse and quality of life decisions at the state and local level one resident said a study had shown that property values would drop 25 percent near a cell tower several others commented that the longterm health effects of living near microwaveemitting towers were not yet known on the other side were residents who wanted to be able to dial 911 from anywhere , and those like deb moore , an emergency room nurse , who described how important it was to be able to sustain contact between an ambulance crew and the hospital preparing to treat its patient it is a problem in vermont , as wonderfully rural as it is , to hit a dead zone , ms moore said we need to look at other issues for vermont besides aesthetics and your property values debate over tower siting has been heating up in recent months in part as a result of the 1996 federal telecommunications act , which fostered telephoneindustry competition and allowed many new players into the cellular phone market players who need towers the rash of antenna building also stems from the swelling pool of cellular phone users , and from the advent of technology known as pcs , or personal communications systems pcs systems use digital transmissions rather than analog ones and need more antennas because their range is shorter over all , said tim ayers , vice president for communications of the cellular telecommunications industry association , the largest association representing the wireless industry , it will take up to 125 , 000 antennas to build the cellular system authorized by the fcc , and the process will take until perhaps 2005 the antennas are often easy to install in cities , where they can be stuck on existing tall buildings , steeples and roofs in largely rural areas like vermont , towers are often needed the cellular companies face pressures of their own , mr ayers pointed out to keep their licenses , he said , they must be able to say they are serving a substantial part of the population they must also worry about paying off the cost of their licenses , which they got through government auction to vermonters , however , it can seem as if their towns are being invaded by corporate giants with only a bottom line in mind some towns rush to pass ordinances limiting the towers' height and possible location others declare a towerbuilding moratorium to figure out what to do but then they run the risk of legal challenges by the impatient cellular phone companies , and it is the law , as well as money , that cellular corporations have on their side court cases have generally been decided in favor of the cellular companies because the 1996 law so clearly states that they may not be turned down , mr ayers said ultimately , mr kennard and others say , there will be solutions for all of this there are compromises gaining wider practice , from disguising towers as trees or steeples to agreements that allow several phone companies to colocate on one tower , reducing the number of towers needed this is not an intractable problem , mr kennard told the gathered vermonters , without specifying plans to solve it photos some residents of charlotte , vt , want this cell phone tower removed among the concerns are levels of microwave emissions \( photographs by paul boisvert for the new york times \)
russell pratt knocked on the door of apartment 18a , delivering a firm , fearless rap that echoed down the dim , graffitiscarred corridors of the taft houses in east harlem when the door finally opened a crack , he found himself facing a snarling dog and a leery , unwelcoming glare good morning , sir , mr pratt said as the man sized up his white shirt sleeves , charcoal trousers and dark tie , which made him look like an insurance salesman or an investigator from the internal revenue service pointing to the plastic name tag on his breast pocket that read elder pratt , the 22yearold missionary from tooele , utah , flashed an eager smile i'm from the church of jesus christ of latterday saints , he told the man , and i was wondering if the door slammed shut mr pratt stifled a wince , uttered a cheery bless you , and moved on to the next apartment and so it went on a recent wednesday as mr pratt and his partner , shon denning , worked their way through the housing projects and tenements of el barrio in their effort to draw converts to mormonism , one of the nation s fastestgrowing religions , they have become inured to curious stares , cold indifference and the occasional unkind word this is new york city , mr pratt said , taking a quick lunch break in his 12houraday proselytizing routine you expect people here to be a little suspicious still , despite a spate of morning rejections , the two found their way into a halfdozen apartments that day , secured a handful of followup appointments and returned to their east 110th street apartment that night with eight fewer copies of the book of mormon , which they had given to anyone who showed a glimmer of interest a crossing guard , a nurse s aide and an unemployed handyman were among those who allowed the men into their homes it s amazing how many people will listen to us , said mr denning , 21 , his cheeks burnished red from a long day in the sun new yorkers are hungry for what we have to offer the mormon church , based in salt lake city , has found new york fertile ground for new converts , doubling its membership to 20 , 000 since 1988 to accommodate the city s growing congregations , the church built a sparkling 8 million meeting house just off the grand concourse in kingsbridge , the bronx , last year another is under construction in inwood , and a recently formed branch that meets at sylvia s restaurant in harlem is scouring that neighborhood for larger quarters last month , the president and prophet of the mormon church , gordon b hinckley , filled all 24 , 000 seats in madison square garden for a fireside chat it s amazing what s happening in this city , said ronald a rasband , who oversees 240 unpaid missionaries in new york , most of them men between 19 and 23 years old we are a church on the rise worldwide , the church has grown to 10 million members , up from four million in 1978 most of that growth has taken place beyond utah , where mormonism has long had a powerful presence we 're growing so fast , we have to build a meeting house a day just to keep up , mr rasband said church officials and nonmormons who study the church agree that the intense focus on proselytizing has helped feed this astounding growth the missionary system is the engine that makes this church so robust , said gary shepherd , a former missionary who is no longer active in the church and is now a professor of sociology at oakland university in rochester hills , mich there are 60 , 000 mormon missionaries working in 160 countries , said michael leonard , a church spokesman the roman catholic church , by comparison , has 6 , 000 missionaries around the world , according to the united states catholic mission association what separates mormon missionaries from those of other evangelical faiths , say those who study the church , is the generous attention they pay to potential converts , known as investigators missionaries make repeated home visits to investigators and encourage them to join church gatherings even before they are baptized this is a church where sweetfaced boys and girls make house calls , sit down and answer your questions eye to eye , said richard bushman , a professor of history at columbia university and a lifelong mormon even before you 're a member , they lavish a lot of time on you , offering you a wonderful sense of community i do n't know if that s matched by any other religion mormonism does especially well in new york , a place rife with alienation , instability and fractured families , said jan shipps , a professor of religion at indiana universitypurdue university at indianapolis people whose lives are in disarray , newly arrived immigrants and those looking for a sense of community and stability are especially drawn to the church , ms shipps said urban converts , especially blacks , were not always so eagerly courted until 20 years ago , the church priesthood was closed to blacks , who , according to mormon doctrine , carried the mark of cain the policy was reversed in 1978 , after the president said he had a revelation
atlanta , oct 8 before this national league championship series began , john smoltz had warned that no matter what happened to the braves this year , when atlanta fans looked back on the 1990 s they would finally realize how good they had it during an era when their team played in seven league championship series in a row when the braves think back over the last two seasons , though , all they are likely to have are bad memories of kevin brown for the third consecutive time in the last two league championship series , brown took it to the braves brown , a 33yearold righthander , tossed a threehit shutout tonight , striking out 11 he even singled twice , during the game s only two fruitful rallies , as the san diego padres beat the braves , 30 , before 43 , 083 fans at turner field because of brown , who has now defeated atlanta six straight times dating from september 1996 , the padres are heading back to san diego with a twogamestonone lead over the heavily favored braves and history is on the padres' side since the league championship series went to a fourofsevengame format in 1985 , no team from either league has advanced to the world series after losing the first two games at home what more could we want at this point \? said brown , who guarded a 10 lead through the eighth inning tonight , until the padres were able to capitalize on a number of defensive breakdowns to score twice more in the ninth and put away the game it s huge to win the first two games i think it was a real moral victory for us to come in here and play like this against this caliber of a team , considering the pitching we were going to face not that the padres , who slipped past smoltz and tom glavine the first two games , are taking anything for granted as tony gwynn cautioned there s still a lot of work to be done greg maddux is throwing for them on saturday and that s no day at the beach , either but even if the braves somehow scrap their way back into this series , they will eventually have to face brown one more time and considering that brown , who scattered three singles tonight , defeated atlanta twice during the florida marlins' sixgame upset of the defending league champions in the nlcs last fall , it was fairly easy to see why the padres were optimistic about their chances today brown had struck out 16 batters in game 1 of san diego s firstround victory over the houston astros , before allowing just one run in six and twothirds innings four days later in game 3 when kevin brown is on , he s as tough as any pitcher in the game , padres manager bruce bochy said tonight he s as tough a competitor as i 've ever seen he feels good right now he s just locked in if you ask atlanta manager bobby cox , he would probably say he has seen enough of brown against our club , this was the best i 've ever seen him pitch , cox said brown , whose fastball topped off at 96 miles an hour , said i think i threw everything but the kitchen sink out there tonight i was just winging it , making stuff up as i went which was fortunate for the padres , who were without their best power hitter , greg vaughn , who strained his left quadriceps muscle on the wet outfield grass of turner field chasing a ball on wednesday vaughn could be out for the rest of the series the doctors think possibly three to four days , but it could be up to 10 days , bochy said vaughn , who hit a careerhigh 50 homers this season , said , i do n't know how long they said i'm going to be out , but it s not going to be that long vaughn said the padres would probably rest him on saturday , now that they have a 20 lead in games tom glavine was wild he walked a seasonhigh six tonight , including ken caminiti in his first three atbats , and wally joyner in his first two but none of the walks hurt glavine , who threw 31 pitches in the second inning and 26 in the third , and left the bases loaded both times brown was a little sharper he struck out the side in the first , but walked the first two batters he faced in the second , before pitching out of the jam two innings later , brown was able to induce javy lopez into an inningending popup to left field with runners on second and third by the fifth , glavine s pitch count had reached 100 an inning later , the padres finally broke through with two out and nobody on , glavine allowed a single between short and third to chris gomez , his second hit of the game up stepped brown , who had taken a called third strike to leave the bases loaded in the second on a 12 count , brown grounded a single between short and third , and the padres , 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position , had runners on first and second this time , they came through on glavine s 121st pitch of the game , quilvio veras singled up the middle to score gomez andruw jones s throw from center skipped away from lopez , but glavine backed up the play , and his high throw to third was pulled down by chipper jones in plenty of time to get the sliding brown to end the inning but brown had helped himself to one run and , after the padres scored twice more in the ninth after brown had led off with his second hit of the game , it was more than enough to enable the padres to travel west with an improbable sweep of the first two games in atlanta photo kevin brown mesmerizing the braves with a threehit , 11strikeout shutout last night in atlanta \( associated press \)

washington , july 8 a pentagon review has concluded that two sensitive encoded circuit boards that disappeared after a failed launching of an american communications satellite in china two years ago were probably destroyed in the fiery crash last month several defense department officials said they suspected that chinese officials had stolen the devices from the wreckage of a 200 million loral space and communications satellite that was obliterated when the chinese rocket carrying it exploded shortly after launching but a review by the national security agency , the military s super secret code makers and code breakers , found no evidence of wrongdoing by the chinese authorities it is highly unlikely that the devices survived the crash because of the crash impact and high temperatures produced by burning rocket propellents , said the review , which noted that the devices were housed close to the rocket s fuel tank in the off chance that the chinese recovered the circuit boards , each of which contained scores of individual computer chips , they would not have learned much , the review concluded it is highly unlikely that these items could have been recovered in sufficient detail to enable the chinese to reproduce them , it said moreover , clinton administration and industry officials said the chinese would have had no way to know which of the chips were encoded because they all look alike loral employees could tell them apart by comparing company records with code numbers on the circuit boards none of the recovered chips were encoded , the officials said the administration ordered the review after house republicans , notably representative curt weldon of pennsylvania , expressed fears at a hearing last month that the loss of the encoded circuit boards might have harmed national security the encoded technology tells an orbiting satellite which way to point to receive and transmit signals the case of the missing circuit boards became part of congress s multipronged inquiry into whether sensitive american satellite technology was given to china that might ultimately enhance beijing s military after the house hearing last month , the white house released a statement from the national security agency that said the loss of the devices would have minimal impact on american security because the technology was 20 years old even before the accident , the government had scheduled a routine upgrading of algorithms , the set of instructions that guide american satellite encoding equipment , the statement said thus , encoded devices for one satellite could not gain access to or control other satellites mr weldon , who is a member of a house select committee looking into accusations involving china , today expressed skepticism over the administration s explanation the whole thing is very suspicious , he said why did n't they have these answers a month ago \? the pentagon provided a copy of the onepage review today after franklin miller , a senior pentagon official , testified before a senate governmental affairs subcommittee on the export of sensitive technology to china mr miller had expected questions on the missing circuit boards , but none were asked when asked about the issue after the hearing , mr miller said , the government s position is that the devices almost certainly did not survive american officials had said that only one circuit board was missing , but the report today made it clear that two encoded circuit boards were involved mr miller said the administration never asked china for an accounting of the missing technology because an american team of industry and military observers concluded the day after the accident that the devices were probably lost in the crash on feb 15 , 1996 , at the launching of the loral satellite in southern china , the chinese rocket exploded 22 seconds after liftoff , showering debris and burning fuel on a nearby village by american accounts , as many as 200 civilians were killed for five hours , american officials said , the chinese authorities barred american monitors at the launching center from visiting the crash site , purportedly for their own safety according to an industry official , an american inspection team , made up of representatives from the pentagon , loral and intelsat , the communications consortium that had planned to use the satellite , finally was able to comb the crash site for pieces of the satellite the team recovered pieces that made up about onethird of the satellite , but many parts were mangled or melted beyond recognition , the industry official said the loral satellite contained about 100 circuit boards that resembled trays about 1 , 000 computer chips were built into the circuit boards , but the industry official said only two chips each on a separate circuit board were actually encoded the american team found parts of 12 trays , and three of them were battered but mostly intact loral sent these parts back to its laboratory in palo alto , calif , for analysis the american inspection team concluded the chinese had not taken anything because they were too busy dealing with the emergency , and had made no apparent effort to pick up any of the circuit boards if they were trying to search the field for something , they 'd have collected every recognizable piece and sent it to a lab , an industry official said the china investigation pushed ahead elsewhere on capitol hill today george j tenet , the director of central intelligence , and louis j freeh , the director of the federal bureau of investigation , testified before at a closed hearing of the senate intelligence committee

nagano , japan , feb 22 ron wilson , the coach of the united states men s hockey team , sat in big hat arena late last week , watching national teams of rival coaches playing in the semifinals of the olympic tournament most of wilson s players had already returned to the united states , but wilson remained he wore on his head a black cowboy hat any movie buff could recognize the symbolism the bad guy usually wore the black hat in the old hollywood westerns wilson was not personally a villain , but his hat stood as a symbol for his players , who had become notorious around the winter games throughout big hat much of last week , the chatter was about the behavior off the ice of these elite national hockey league players who had won only one of four games and looked disorganized and frustrated on ice off ice , early in the week , some american players were sighted in local bars in the early hours of the morning after they were eliminated by the czech republic in the quarterfinals , some united states players returned to the athletes village and broke chairs , broke a table , broke a door , squirted three fire extinguishers and threw several objects , including a bicycle , from the fifthfloor balcony they caused 3 , 000 in damage , according to olympic officials the racket awakened other athletes , who were trying to rest before competing the next day in symbolic terms , the american hockey players gave their nation s hockey image a black eye , a bloody nose and a few broken teeth their tour of duty here amounted to a 10day misconduct i feel sad for them , said anita defrantz , vice president of the international olympic committee that s how they will be remembered athletes should be remembered as olympians who competed with honor and had some dignity plenty of hockey players did compete with honor and dignity among them were the members of the american women s team , filled with earnest and articulate young athletes , who won gold medals with a victory over canada in tonight s closing ceremony , cammi granato carried the american flag as her fellow united states athletes marched behind her and in the championship game of the men s tournament , the czech republic beat russia by 10 today for its first olympic hockey championship with the czechs winning gold , the russians silver and finland bronze , it was a medal sweep for europe on the wider ice surface on which most european players learn the game now the players of all the nations return to their national hockey league teams to finish the last eight weeks of the regular season before beginning two months of stanley cup playoffs along with identifying the culprits in the village vandalism , the nhl and the players association must assess the impact of shutting the league for more than two weeks to send the best professionals to the winter games for the first time did the effort help or hurt the marketing of hockey in the united states \? was it worth the injuries to canada s joe sakic of the colorado avalanche and finland s teemu selanne of the anaheim mighty ducks \? will the shutdown hurt nhl fan interest , television audiences and arena attendance for the rest of the season \? should the league again close down and send its players to the salt lake city games in 2002 \? did the nhl suffer by the success of the european teams and the failures of the united states and canada , where the nhl does business \? too many people in north america are equating our coming to the olympics with the success of their home teams , nhl commissioner gary bettman said i think it was a great tournament bettman said the league and the union will review the experience next summer and decide , possibly then , about 2002 when asked about the league investigation into the vandalism , bettman said the united states olympic committee is leading the investigation , with help from the league he said he did not yet know which players were responsible , but wanted to find out i wish the responsible party would step forward , bettman said it would be nice to know what happened to start with , an apology is in order bettman said he would n't read too much into the fact that the winning czech team had the fewest nhl players 11 of the big six teams that arrived after eight others began their preliminary round he noted that czech goalie dominik hasek , who plays for the buffalo sabres , was the most valuable player in the nhl last season , and that czech forward jaromir jagr of the pittsburgh penguins is one of the league s best players slava lener , coach of the czech team , said after today s gold medal game that the wider international ice surface helped the european teams , which are used to it , and hurt the north american teams vladimir yurzinov , coach of the russian team , said the results might teach north americans to respect european hockey more than they do now the nhl takes the good european players , he said , using europe as a farm club and diminishing european leagues some sort of reciprocity and mutual respect should be in order , yurzinov said he added that too many promising european players disappear in north american minor leagues and that the movement of talent from europe to north america is bad for attendance in european leagues bob clarke , general manager of the canadian team , which finished fourth with a record of 42 , alluded to the perceived chauvinism of north americans , particularly canadians , who think hockey is uniquely their game we are canadians , we love our sport and there is a passion for our sport , clarke said but if we do n't recognize that our opponents are as good as us , we wo n't beat them the wider ice was not the only refreshing aspect of this tournament , although it was certainly important wilson , the american coach , noted that players could not hook and hold each other as much as they do in the nhl because the players are spread farther apart the ice itself , and the sideboards , had none of the commercial advertising that clutters nhl rinks both had only a few olympic symbols , tastefully spaced as fans entered the arena , they saw and heard drummers in traditional japanese costume inside , when the fans disagreed with a referee s call or noncall many would whistle , as they do in europe , instead of boo , as they do in north america the games were played at a brisk pace because there were no television timeouts , as there are in the nhl and there was no fighting international rules do not permit it aside from the boorish behavior of some american players , the biggest legal issue involved ulf samuelsson , a ranger defenseman who played for sweden when it was revealed that samuelsson also has a united states passport , he was expelled from the tournament because sweden could no longer recognize his citizenship among the players who distinguished themselves were selanne and saku koivu of finland both led the tournament with 10 points pavel bure , the russian captain , had 9 points , all of them goals , 5 of them in the 74 semifinal victory over finland boris mironov of russia was one of the hardesthitting defensemen none of the american players were near the top in anything good before coming over , wilson had said you 've got to get the right guys together this is something special that our players will remember forever we want to win we expect to win we know we can win , but that does n't mean we 're going to win instead , they lost face , lost dignity and lost three of four games they did beat belarus as hasek said , the united states is better than belarus photo goaltender dominik hasek , center , receiving his gold medal after the czech republic defeated russia , 10 \( barton silverman the new york times \)
mayor rudolph w giuliani moved swiftly yesterday to head off criticism of his new budget even before formally releasing it , defending his plan to channel most of an expected 12 billion surplus in the current fiscal year toward closing projected shortfalls in the next two years mr giuliani dismissed suggestions from some independent budget experts that it might be more prudent for new york city to use the surplus to reduce its outstanding debt , which in relative terms is higher than that of most other major cities calling that advice totally irresponsible , he said that if he followed it , he might have to make deep spending cuts and scale back tax cuts in an effort to patch the projected gaps in the next two years we 've got to first reduce those gaps before you start worrying about reducing debt four and five and six years from now , he said mr giuliani made his comments in an unusual briefing a day before the official announcement of his preliminary budget for the 1999 fiscal year , which begins on july 1 he declined to give many details on the budget , but his aides said he called reporters to his office because he wanted to discredit the views of independent budget experts who believe that the city should use the surplus to reduce its longterm debt the mayor trained most of his fire on the citizens budget commission , a nonpartisan watchdog group that has often drawn his anger raymond d horton , the commission s president , said on tuesday that mr giuliani should consider using at least some of the surplus for cutting the longterm debt most of the surplus stems from increased tax revenues that the city has reaped from the boom on wall street in the budget that he is to present today , the mayor is expected to propose that the city reserve 70 to 75 percent of the surplus in a socalled rainyday fund that could then be allocated to reduce the expected budget gaps in the 1999 and 2000 fiscal years about 20 percent would go to new programs , and the rest would be used to make up for revenue lost to new tax cuts none of the money would go toward lowering outstanding debt while mr horton raised questions about those choices , he and some other independent budget experts praised the mayor for not spending most of the surplus on socalled recurring items programs and tax cuts that the city would then have to continue paying for each year if he had done so , then the city might have had trouble financing them in the future if the economy sags those budget experts , including analysts at wall street firms that rate the city s bonds , also noted that mr giuliani was proposing that the city spend more of its surplus on deficit reduction than it did last year , when it also had a surplus last year , the mayor and the city council adopted a budget that allocated the majority of the surplus for new programs and tax cuts the mayor also opposed any plans last year to reduce the city s longterm debt todd whitestone , a managing director at standard poor s , the wall street firm , said mr giuliani s plan and any competing proposals to reduce the city s longterm debt both appeared to be appropriate ways for allocating the surplus he said he understood why mr giuliani favored putting the money toward cutting the projected shortterm shortfalls they do have a nearterm issue with 1999 and 2000 , mr whitestone said , and i think they quite correctly want to deal with that and put themselves in the best possible position for the future
washington , june 15 the pregame conversations had a postgame tone with the detroit red wings leading the washington capitals by three games to none in the stanley cup finals , the questions were less about tuesday s game 4 than about what might happen if detroit captures its second consecutive championship will steve yzerman win the conn smythe trophy as the most valuable player in the postseason tournament \? if the center does not , it will be almost as big an upset as a fourgame winning streak in the next week by the capitals will detroit coach scotty bowman return next season to try to break toe blake s coaching record of eight cup winners \? the red wings' general manager , ken holland , and most others around the team expect that he will be back yzerman leads the tournament in points with 24 the only other candidates for the smythe award would be nicklas lidstrom , the detroit defenseman who is second with 19 points , and sergei fedorov , the detroit center who is tied for third with 18 and leads everyone in goals with 10 but no european has ever won the trophy , which has been given out since 1965 and is awarded in voting by the news media named after a toronto maple leafs executive , the trophy bears a maple leaf and a miniature maple leaf gardens the only noncanadian to win the award was the rangers' brian leetch , an american , in 1994 yzerman , who grew up near ottawa , did n't discourage speculation he was the favorite , but was n't gloating either asked who would get his vote , yzerman replied obviously , i 'd like to pick someone from my own team he mentioned goalie chris osgood and lidstrom i do n't really want to start thinking about other things , yzerman said a 15year veteran , yzerman has changed his playing style in recent seasons earlier in his career , he was primarily an attacker now , he gets back to cover his own end of the ice he checks opponents , cuts off their skating angles , blocks shots and displays a wellrounded style knee injuries and age have taken some of his skating speed his hand quickness on scoring chances is not what it once was the arrival of russian centers like fedorov and igor larionov may have taken some of the pressure off yzerman to carry the offensive burden while demonstrating to him the dual responsibilities of centers trained in the russian style another factor was the arrival of bowman , who demanded defensive consciousness from forwards he did n't really say that to me specifically , yzerman said it was a statement to the team what he did n't say is 'if you do n't , you 're not going to play' that was implied bowman , asked about yzerman s smythe chances , said i'm sure he s not thinking about it but he added i'm sure he 'll take it if it s there and i'm sure he 'll take it with a lot of modesty that s the way he is bowman has another year on his contract , at his option i do n't know what i want to do right now , he said holland , the general manager , said he expected bowman would work at least a sixth season in detroit i find it hard to believe he s not going to want to come back , holland said there are many factors favoring a return by bowman and a continuation of the red wings' winning ways they have reached the finals in three of the last four seasons none of their key players will be free agents this summer , except for slava fetisov , 40 , the veteran defenseman the wings have remarkable depth , particularly at the forward positions , with young players making strong impressions left wing tomas holmstrom , 25 , in his second nhl season , is tied with fedorov with 18 playoff points right wing martin lapointe , 24 , is second behind fedorov in playoff goals with eight \( yzerman is tied for eighth in goals with six \) on defense , the wings are weaker than they were last spring , mostly because of the serious injuries suffered by vladimir konstantinov in a limousine crash lidstrom is a candidate for the norris trophy as the league s best defenseman in goal , osgood has been adequate , particularly in this series , because his teammates have held the capitals to as few as one shot a period the capitals , making the first finalround appearance in their 24year history , have played respectably , losing all three games by one goal aside from goalie olaf kolzig and the members of the muscle man line of dale hunterchris simoncraig berube , no washington player has had an outstanding series ron wilson , the coach , has tried to keep his sense of humor i love coming to the rink every day so what , we are down three to nothing you know , if we lose on tuesday , i do n't believe a firing squad is going to show up at my house and put me down although , in this league , the last three or four coaches who have lost in the finals have been fired

in the fall of 1995 , officer anthony nieves was accused of two offenses that could hardly have been more different already a suspect in the murder of one girlfriend , he was arrested for harassing another then he was caught , while off duty , sprinting onto the field at yankee stadium to highfive a player yet when police officials considered the incidents , they imposed punishments that could hardly have been more similar his antics at the stadium earned him a 30day suspension harassing his girlfriend earned him a 29day suspension the way the nieves case was handled is not unusual for the new york city police department , which critics say has long been complacent in its approach to domestic abuse complaints against its officers complaints that are rising sharply a review of department records shows that police officers who are found guilty of domestic abuse in administrative proceedings are rarely fired , and that some are punished with suspensions of just 15 days the same penalty that is given to officers who are caught sleeping on the job or taking an unjustified sick day law enforcement and domestic violence experts say the department is far less aggressive in detecting and punishing domestic abusers on the force than are departments in other large cities already this year , the police department said it had received 821 complaints of domestic abuse by officers , from threats to actual assaults , a 40 percent increase over the total for last year in the last three years , more than 120 officers have been arrested on charges relating to domestic violence in one highprofile case , officer patrick j fitzgerald , a patrolman in the 34th precinct , shot and killed himself , his wife and their two children in september at the family s home in orange county , ny relatives of officer fitzgerald s wife , leeanne , said afterward that she had called the 34th precinct station house several times to complain that he was abusing her , but that the calls were not taken seriously police officials have said they cannot find any record of such calls there is a culture in the police department that just does n't want to admit how serious this problem is , said eleanor pamm , a domestic violence expert at john jay college of criminal justice and a member of the mayor s task force on domestic violence and until they get serious about it , she said , the situation is n't going to get any better people are going to continue to suffer domestic violence experts say that when police officers , with their ready access to guns , are involved in household disputes , arguments that would otherwise end in bruises can quickly escalate into bloodshed over the last three years in new york , domestic incidents involving officers have claimed 10 lives by murder or suicide three more spouses died under suspicious circumstances , according to investigators new york police officials say they are vigilant in rooting out abusive officers and punishing colleagues who try to protect them but abuse by officers , both on and off duty , is difficult to combat , experts said a feeling of futility often prevents victims from reporting abuse , and a code of silence among officers frequently makes them reluctant to turn in their peers except in the most serious crimes , prosecutors generally leave the punishment of officers up to the department s internal disciplinary system but records show that the department rarely punishes officers severely for any offenses , even when the accusations involve domestic violence police departments in other large cities have made greater strides in addressing domestic abuse among officers , according to domestic violence experts in baltimore , officials set up an elaborate network in 1997 to monitor complaints against officers who lived in outlying suburbs in los angeles , officials created a fivemember investigative team last year devoted solely to accusations of battering by officers in chicago , the department hired fulltime counselors in 1994 to help victims of police domestic abuse follow through on their complaints new york city has adopted none of these strategies patrick kelleher , the first deputy police commissioner in new york , said that , given the size of the 40 , 000member force , he would describe the abuse problem as relatively small , but very serious in the last three years , according to police statistics , the department has suspended 162 officers without pay for domestic violence , and fired 13 since a 1995 domestic dispute in which an officer was killed , the department has required that a captain respond at the scene to every abuse complaint against an officer mr kelleher said the department is trying new policies , including a pilot program this year in which officers with a history of domestic violence attend an eightweek course in stress reduction and conflict resolution i'm really not familiar with what s happening in other cities , like chicago , mr kelleher said , but i do know we are lightyears ahead of where we were a few years ago

boston when my love swears that she is made of truth , i do believe her , though i know she lies in these lines and the 12 that follow written 400 years ago shakespeare succinctly captures much about the complexity of truthtelling the sonnet expresses his gratitude that his beloved allows him to avoid much truth her lies claiming that he is still young though he knows he is not make growing old bearable the psyche is complex so are relationships and society the amount of truth human beings seek , or tolerate , shakespeare recognized , is no simple matter making a similar point , a european friend often berates me you americans are so naive you think that it s such a noble thing to tell the truth in her mind , the person demanding truth is a soldier at the door the poor women i worked with in a housing project clinic also instructed me on my naivete about truth of course they lied to welfare workers , they told me when they finally trusted me if you admitted you traded sex for pampers money , they 'd take your kid because you were an immoral mother if you did n't make such deals , you could n't afford diapers , and they 'd take your kid because you were an incompetent mother those of us who champion honesty usually live in contexts that cut some slack we 're willing to rein in vices and sacrifice rewards for the gratification of experiencing ourselves as basically truthful but we wisely think hard before we trade our lives , our kids or our marriages for truth i'm not suggesting that lying is good , or truth bad i lecture my kids as much as the next mother when i was 4 and denied pilfering a cookie the protest issuing from crumbcovered lips my father told me about george washington and the cherry tree i felt duly chastened \( trying to instill a moral truth , he did n't mention that his tale was a historical lie \) but none of us always tells the truth in fact , it is exactly because their behavior is exceptional that truthtellers become heroes of plays like the crucible we honor them because a deeply human inclination , when one sees the man with the mask and the noose in hot pursuit , is to try to worm out of it often we tell less than the full truth to spare the feelings of those we love it s a delicate matter too much frankness and people feel hurt , too little and they feel betrayed however much we 'd like to have it otherwise , politicians' lying and truth telling is an equally complicated matter too much or too little and we vote them out we tend to elect them if they make the right false promises conversely , if , like woodrow wilson , they insist on the value of open covenants openly arrived at , we know they 're too idealistic about truth to survive at the same time , we get angry if they go too far into dishonesty many of us do n't forgive lyndon johnson for lying about vietnam , or richard nixon for watergate johnson s distortions escalated an unnecessary war and nixon s aimed a blow at the heart of the constitution on the other hand , president clinton s apparent untruths \( i did n't inhale \) have seemed so transparent that many have treated him as a likable schoolboy who merely needs to pull up his socks with politicians' private lives , the mix we want of truth and lies is difficult and perplexing this is not new to democracies barrington moore wrote about how the athenians struggled to figure how private and public behavior should go together some argued that a politician s behavior in daily life would predict his handling of public office but they were more concerned with whether he took care of his parents than with his sex life my own feeling is that short of seriously criminal behavior \( rape , child molestation , incest \) we ought to send all politicians for a medical exam , rule out serious illness , insanity or severe addiction , and leave the rest alone the truth of character will out in people s public work if we pay attention , we have plenty of opportunity to assess it it s true that warren harding manifested bad character when he had the secret service deliver hush money to a mistress , but his public lawmaking was equally incompetent unfortunately , we seem to be creating a standard of truthful selfdisclosure for all wouldbe leaders that is neither socially desirable nor psychically possible we 're trying to make hard and fast rules about intimate truthtelling , and they are absurd even poisonous few people grow up without making some mistakes must each one be confessed \? one reason henry cisneros is facing criminal prosecution is that when the fbi interviewed him for his cabinet post , he confessed that he had only had two mistresses so now he s accused of perjury this is the fbi that taped martin luther king s adulterous encounters and then blackmailed him in the hope of making him commit suicide what reasonable adult would give more than a minimal answer \? amateur linguists have spent two days trying to parse mr clinton s sentence , it was n't an improper relationship , to find a lie meanwhile he s dancing with words the way cowboys used to dance over the bullets aimed at their feet if we 're serious about the ethics of truth , should n't we notice how awful it is that linda tripp secretly taped monica lewinsky when ms lewinsky thought she could speak frankly \? ms tripp s is a profound betrayal of intimacy and the nearsacred privacy of friendship if we 're going to make simplistic rules about truthtelling , mine would start here ms tripp should have told ms lewinsky why she invited her to lunch , before they even sat down and i 'd like the answer in 14 lines of iambic pentameter
elizabeth , nj , feb 5 this week a multinational parade of immigrant asylum seekers who had seen a federal detention center ruined in a melee gave graphic accounts of what happened at a county jail where they were held next testifying at a trial of three jail guards , they said they had moved from bad to worse that guards at the union county jail had beat them , stuffed their heads in toilets and squeezed their genitals with pliers speaking in halting english or through translators , the witnesses talked of escaping religious or political discrimination in india , pakistan , ghana , albania and rumania , only to find themselves hurt and humiliated in new jersey it was the first direct testimony of conditions in the county jail by the witnesses , some of whom are living in the united states awaiting rulings on their asylum claims the others have been deported to their native countries many spent weeks or months in the federal center , were gassed and dazed by the melee that started as a protest against abusive conditions there , and then , on the night of june 18 , 1995 , were shunted to the jail lawyers for the three guards on trial called the former detainees' testimony an exaggeration and said their clients had to work across a language barrier to establish control over people who had been described as rioters and hostage takers the witnesses testified in a union county courtroom against the backdrop of a luminous mural of the revolutionary war era , titled coerced but undaunted , depicting a sternfaced farm woman feeding british troops they slumped on the witness stand , speaking in barely audible voices , often averting their eyes from the defense table where the three guards , who are the first to go on trial in the case , sat i stopped seeing , i stopped feeling , and i did n't know what was happening to me , said amitindar pal singh , who was 18 years old when he spent three days at the jail , where he said guards , in between beatings , used pliers to pinch the skin on his genitals and to squeeze his tongue speaking through a translator in response to questioning by alan silver , the assistant union county prosecutor , mr singh said his injuries were not so much visible as internal ones that cannot be seen simion fiat , a 32yearold rumanian who wound up at the federal detention center after stowing away on a ship to the united states , told of the gantlet of jeering guards who met him and others at the jail , and of how the detainees were kicked and pushed and made to crawl through the guards by the end of that night , mr fiat said , he had blood streaming down his face from beatings and kicks still , none of the seven former detainees who have testified so far have been able to identify any of the three defendants as the guards who abused them in the chaotic swirl of that night prosecutors are looking to the testimony of other corrections guards , who are cooperating in the case , to place the defendants at the scenes of the abuse the trial here of the three guards comes as a distant echo of the fivehourlong disturbance at the immigrant detention center here that was run by esmor correctional services corporation a disturbance that triggered a sweeping national reexamination of immigration and naturalization service policies on detaining asylum seekers and contracting with private corrections companies the center was once called the worst immigration detention center in the nation by a member of congress , representative robert menendez , democrat of new jersey , and it was later determined that bad management on the part of esmor corrections , as well as poorly trained and abusive guards , led to the disturbance the center was closed and the company was ousted then a year ago it reopened under a new contractor and with a host of new federal policies that apply nationally to asylum seekers detained by a host of private and public prison contractors to minimize detention periods , speed asylum hearings and provide for the parole of detainees the case against the union county guards over what happened during the three days , june 1821 , 1995 , the detainees spent in the local jail will not be resolved for some time the case has split the county s corrections department as a dozen of its guards have been indicted , largely on the grand jury testimony of their fellow corrections officers in addition , the county faces lawsuits by at least two groups of former detainees , some of whom have been deported john j murphy 3d , a cherry hill lawyer representing 13 of the former detainees in a civil suit , said that his clients' case was built not only on the horror of what they say they experienced at the prison but on at least two independent studies of the union county jail over the last six years , which criticized conditions and training at the jail you have to keep in mind that there were several hundred detainees at the esmor center , and they were sent to places all over the region just after the riots , and this is the only one where you had complaints of this nature and criminal charges of abuse , mr murphy said it would be very difficult for the guards and the county to claim innocence in the civil case if there is a conviction in the criminal case , but an acquittal in this trial does n't bar our civil case because the standard of proof is less stringent
ottawa , ill , nov 1 since casting a ballot for harry s truman in 1948 , harold hiles , a world war ii veteran , has always deemed it an honor and a duty to vote but on this election day , he is staying home do n't want any part of it , said mr hiles , 76 , over a piece of apple pie on sunday morning , as church bells pealed in this small midwestern city clinton , starr , the whole bunch of them who do you believe anymore \? who can you respect \? people are just losing faith for all the handicapping about the races between democrats and republicans on tuesday , there is little doubt what most americans will effectively choose none of the above it is a virtual certainty that fewer than half of all eligible voters will visit the polls on tuesday some political analysts say the number could plummet to about onethird while grousing about politicians is a timehonored american tradition , wouldhavebeenvoters say this season s campaigners have wallowed in far more than the usual level of muck vicious namecalling , transparent pandering and , of course , the lascivious details about president clinton s sexual behavior it just seems like politics are spinning out of control , said jerry hanck , a 60yearold liquor salesman who will be sitting out the election there are bad actors on both sides it was in this old river town 140 years ago that 10 , 000 people turned out at washington square for the first debate between stephen douglas and abraham lincoln , a discussion that focused on constitutional principles and the most fundamental of human rights issues , slavery it does not escape notice here that the last national election of the 20th century seems to be driven by sound bites , attack ads and sex talk that brings an embarrassed blush even to a crusty old navy man like mr hiles but gauging the sensibilities of voters is tricky , especially when it comes to mr clinton s affair with a former white house intern mr hiles , a retired glass factory worker and union member , would surely fall in the approval column in polls on the president s job rating he s been a wonderful president , mr hiles said and yet mr hiles said he would boycott the ballot box on tuesday largely because he disapproves of mr clinton s relationship with monica s lewinsky , and the president s failure to tell the whole truth about the affair it was a sentiment that surfaced frequently among nonvoters , mostly among democrats these were not people who intended to bolt to the republican side they had simply become dispirited democrats just feel kind of embarrassed right now , said connie jolley , 29 , a restaurant manager ms jolley , who described herself as a majorly democratic voter in most years , plans to go to the polls on tuesday , but only to vote on a local referendum she intends to skip the races for governor and congress , saying that she could not bring herself to vote for the republicans , but did not believe the democrats had earned her vote compared to voters , nonvoters are younger , less educated , have lower incomes and tend to support democratic candidates for the house of representatives , according to the latest new york times cbs poll the poll , taken oct 26 to oct 28 , found that 32 percent of nonvoters are under age 30 , compared with just 13 percent of voters nearly twothirds of nonvoters have never attended college , whereas 43 percent of voters have not attended college forty percent of nonvoters have households incomes of less than 30 , 000 a year , compared to 24 percent of likely voters in races for the house of representatives , 49 percent of nonvoters favored democratic candidates and 27 percent favored republicans the likely voters , meanwhile , were evenly split between the two parties the extent of political apathy this year will not be fully measured until the votes are counted , but at least two studies suggest an increase four years ago in a times cbs news poll , a third of voters said they were paying a lot of attention to campaigns in their state , and 20 percent said they were paying little or no attention this year , the times cbs news poll shows interest in the campaigns slightly down , with less than 3 in 10 voters saying they were paying a lot of attention , and about a quarter saying they were paying little or no attention and a report released on friday by the committee for the study of the american electorate , a nonpartisan research institution in washington , found that turnout was likely to be between 36 percent to 38 percent of eligible voters , down from the 388 percent who voted in 1994 no one can yet accurately measure how much of the expected decline can be attributed to disgust with the lewinsky scandal , or for that matter , the starr investigation the conventional wisdom predicting a lower turnout in november is generally based on the relatively low turnout in this year s primary elections but thomas mann , director of governmental studies at the brookings institution in washington , cautioned that turnout was difficult to predict indeed , he said some political analysts were expecting something of a surge in voting by blacks , who have been among mr clinton s most loyal defenders he added that union members , whatever their feeling about the lewinsky affair , were unlikely to sit out the election , given strong getoutthe vote efforts by labor leaders

newark a federal judge has ordered four directmail companies based in barbados to stop pitching fraudulent getrichquick schemes to elderly people in new jersey and at least 10 other states , prosecutors announced yesterday judge alfred m wolin of federal district court in newark signed a temporary restraining order on friday enjoining baj marketing inc , facton services ltd , blc service inc and triple eight international services from using the mail to promote the schemes , said kimberly m guadagno , an assistant united states attorney ms guadagno said the companies had sent thousands of letters promising seniors up to 10 , 000 for solving a simple word or number puzzle , and instructing them to send the puzzle back with a judging fee of 5 to 19 but instead of prizes , seniors got back only promotional material for additional schemes , she said one mailing drew about 600 , 000 responses nationwide and about 3 million , she said the postal inspection service notified prosecutors after receiving about 1 , 100 complaints about the schemes , said tony esposito , a spokesman for the agency s newark division none of the companies could be reached for comment
aetna inc , one of the nation s largest health insurers , is in discussions to buy the health care subsidiary of the new york life insurance company in a deal that would be valued at about 1 billion an agreement to buy the unit , nylcare health plans , is expected to be reached within the next few weeks , people close to the deal said yesterday spokesmen for aetna and new york life declined to comment on whether their companies were in negotiations but the people close to the deal said the talks had been under way for some time and were moving toward conclusion aetna has been growing quickly through acquisitions , while focusing on health care operations and shedding other businesses one that has been for sale is aetna s life insurance business aetna is expected to use the proceeds of the sale of the life insurance business which analysts believe would fetch about 12 billion to buy another health insurer , an investment banker said yesterday a number of targets had been mentioned , including nylcare , said the banker , who insisted on not being identified further at one point , the banker said , oxford health plans was considered a possible acquisition target for aetna but oxford has suffered sharp losses in the last few months , attributed in large part to deficiencies in corporate control and its computer systems , a set of problems that , the banker said , aetna apparently did not want to take on nylcare provides health care coverage to about 25 million people about 15 million of them in managed care networks and had revenue last year of about 3 billion it provides coverage in every state , but is strongest in metropolitan new york , the washingtonbaltimore region and in texas it has been losing money for the last two years , but , even so , it could be attractive to a bigger insurer like aetna , said douglas b sherlock , the founder of the sherlock company , a philadelphia research firm , because it could significantly add to aetna s market share in some important regions analysts estimate that nylcare has 200 , 000 customers in new york , new jersey and connecticut , which would give aetna a total of 11 million in the region in texas , nylcare has 600 , 000 members , compared with 125 , 000 for aetna , giving a merged company 725 , 000 in the washingtonbaltimore corridor , nylcare has 400 , 000 customers and aetna has about 100 , 000 greater market share , mr sherlock said , gives insurers more leverage in negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals if you have two competitors in a market , a merger is going to produce higher value to the acquirer than either company had separately , because of the added negotiating power , he said in discussing its future , aetna has told wall street analysts that one of the most prized attributes of potential acquisitions would be large concentrations of customers concentration means fewer regulatory procedures than with widely dispersed customers , who are also often served by different kinds of operational systems that can prove difficult to integrate with the systems of the acquiring company for new york life , the nation s fourthlargest insurance company , a sale of nylcare would be a way of focusing more sharply on traditional insurance , annuities and asset management the primary goals of sy sternberg , who became chief executive about a year ago new york life had been a traditional health insurer when it bought the sanus corporation , a provider of managed care , in 1987 it ran sanus and the other health care operations separately until two years ago , when they were merged to form nylcare in an effort to obtain increased efficiencies mr sherlock said the company s loss of 30 million last year was modest for a company with nylcare s revenue but it was still a loss , and nylcare does not seem to fit with mr sternberg s vision of his company , analysts said new york life , which has not yet reported last year s financial results , had 183 billion in revenue in 1996 the company also runs the mainstay family of mutual funds aetna , long a provider of traditional health insurance , became a giant in managed care in 1996 , when it bought us healthcare for 82 billion in 1997 , its first full year with us healthcare under its wing , aetna s revenue was 185 billion aetna bought another small managed care company , the virginia mason health plan , with about 40 , 000 customers in washington state , in september but absorbing us healthcare has been more difficult than anticipated thirdquarter earnings for aetna last year were 16 percent short of the consensus estimate of analysts , partly because of the trauma of integration , as one analyst , kenneth s abramowitz of sanford c bernstein company , put it some analysts said that they were uncertain how the market would react to an aetna purchase of nylcare there has been rising skepticism about big acquisitions throughout the industry , one analyst said , because none of the acquisitions over the last two years have delivered on promised benefits
washington , oct 3 in his impeachment report to congress , kenneth w starr said he was first informed about president clinton s affair with a white house intern by a pentagon employee , linda r tripp , who called the whitewater independent counsel s office on the evening of jan 12 what the report does not disclose is that the independent counsel s office had already been tipped off by a lawyer with connections to the paula jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against mr clinton at least a week before mrs tripp s call , jerome m marcus , a philadelphia lawyer with ties to the jones legal team , informed a law school friend in mr starr s office of the accusations related to mr clinton s relationship with monica s lewinsky , lawyers familiar with mr starr s inquiry said today the tip in early january indicates that the independent counsel s office could have been developing a strategy to persuade the justice department to expand the scope of the stalled whitewater inquiry before the call from mrs tripp that strategy arguing a parallel in the efforts by the president s friend vernon e jordan jr to find jobs for webster l hubbell , the convicted justice department official , and ms lewinsky prevailed for months , mr clinton s lawyers and political advisers have complained that lawyers sympathetic to ms jones s case had fed information to mr starr in hopes of prompting a criminal inquiry of the president and elevating the importance of the jones sexual harassment lawsuit after the scandal became public later in january , hillary rodham clinton claimed that there was a vast rightwing conspiracy determined to destroy her husband according to people familiar with the discussions , the role of gobetween played by a group of conservative lawyers with ties to the jones case created an early and previously undisclosed backchannel between mr starr s office and mrs tripp mr marcus is one of a group of conservative lawyers who assisted the jones legal team and then secretly helped mrs tripp find a lawyer and bring her accusations to mr starr s attention , according to lawyers familiar with their actions mr marcus , a partner with the law firm of berger montague in philadelphia , did not respond to messages left at his office nor would mr starr s office confirm any involvement by mr marcus a person in our office did get a headsup call that some information may be coming or may be out there , charles g bakaly 3d , a spokesman for mr starr , said today and this person was instructed that we accept information through the front door , and that the appropriate person to contact is jackie bennett , the washington deputy mr bakaly said it was against the office policy to name either the lawyer who tipped off mr starr s office in early january about the lewinsky matter , or the prosecutor who took the phone call starr spokesman denies conspiracy responding to white house charges that the investigation of mr clinton is the product of a conservative conspiracy , mr bakaly said , we believe these kinds of allegations that something was improper or inappropriate are merely efforts to divert attention from the facts and evidence that was gathered by this office besides mr marcus , the group of lawyers that helped mrs tripp included richard w porter , a law partner of mr starr s at the chicago firm of kirkland ellis , and george t conway 3d , a partner at wachtell lipton rosen katz in new york the three lawyers , who were all members of the federalist society , a conservative legal organization whose events have been attended by mr starr , helped mrs tripp find a new lawyer , james a moody , who was also a member of the federalist society they then worked together , in secret deliberations with mrs tripp s confidante lucianne goldberg , a new york literary agent , to bring mrs tripp s tapes and story to mr starr ms goldberg said today that she had told these lawyers and several other friends who are politically conservative about ms tripp s accusations in late december and early january who else would i go to to get involved in something like this \? ms goldberg asked the people who have the most axes to grind the three lawyers who formed a secret bridge between mrs tripp and mr starr share involvement in the paula jones case , membership in conservative groups and friendships , some of which extended into mr starr s office long before the lewinsky matter , mr marcus had signed a friend of the court brief filed with the supreme court in support of the jones case and had been a critic of the president in an oped article published on sept 23 in the washington times , mr marcus wrote mr clinton s lies did n't just cover up an adulterous act his lies covered up his selfishness his lies covered up his total lack of respect for the american people , and his lack of respect for the house of ours in which we have invited him to live for a time firm investigates lawyer s work mr conway and mr porter have also done legal work in support of the jones case
is new york city big enough for both the yankees and the mets \? such a question would have once resulted in only the most visceral , chestthumping responses , the sort that will very much be on display tonight when the yankees and mets meet in interleague play at a soldout shea stadium but these days the question has a deeper resonance and a less clearcut answer , as both teams pursue new , multimilliondollar stadiums amid what seems to be an increasingly intense competition for the city s affection and fan base chicago may have the cubs and the white sox , southern california the dodgers and the angels and the bay area the giants and the athletics , but none of those regional rivalries seems to have the depth of new york s , where the turf war not only involves the living , but also the ghosts of yankees , brooklyn dodgers and giants teams of the past and yet for all that history , and all the interest in the coming series , the onus seems to be on the mets these days to prove that they still count , that they have not been permanently pushed to the fringes by a yankee team that revived the club s longdormant dynasty by winning it all in 1996 , that is clearly the best team in baseball right now and that has so many appealing personalities that all the people who used to love to hate the yankees are now finding it harder to do so no one understands the question hanging over the mets better than fred wilpon , one of the team s coowners wilpon no longer thinks all his club need do is win big , again , as it did on its way to becoming world champions in 1986 , to assure that the yankees become second fiddle , again , as the mets were when handily winning the attendance wars between these two teams in the 1980 s i do n't know what would happen in the remainder of the 90 s if we both were terrific teams , said wilpon , whose team is trying to put the finishing touches on the transformation from terrible to good the dynamics of things change as the country and city change the city is different than it was five years ago the perception and reality of where people will go or wo n't go does n't exist in the same way , because of the perception that there is a great deal more safety in the streets we have the giuliani administration to thank for that so i do n't know what would happen if we were as good as the yankees right now i have a feeling they would draw as many as we would the yankees' appeal was not so much a problem for the mets when both teams set attendance records in 1988 that last to this day the yankees' attendance that year reached 2633 million tickets sold at the same time , the mets were counting a record 305 million people coming through the turnstiles , which projects , says national league president leonard coleman , to about 35 million to 36 million tickets sold that means that in a strong season for both teams the mets won their division , the yankees were contenders nearly 6 million people paid to watch them play the mets' attendance withered through much of the 1990 s because of bad play on the field but even when the mets made a quick turnaround last season , they sold only 1 , 766 , 174 tickets and shea often seemed a lonely place that , in turn , made the club question its strategy of rebuilding without any marquee players , but it never led them to question their territorial prerogative , insists wilpon who , unlike the yankees' principal owner , george steinbrenner , is n't seeking to move , but merely rebuild , planning a stadium with a retractable roof right in the shadow of shea we never felt we were losing our grip , because the yankees have their fans and we have our fans , then there are those who will go between when one or the other or both are good , wilpon said lately , the yankees have been great not good great but that does n't mean they are taking our fans it only meant that the fans who also might come to us were n't coming still , wary of too much disinterest , the mets reversed a conservative course and acquired the allstar catcher mike piazza on may 22 since then , attendance is up an average 13 , 786 tickets a game , from 18 , 876 to 32 , 662 , although this surge also reflects warmer weather and the ending of the school year i think what our fans were articulating before piazza was , 'we 'll come out if you win , but we 'll come out stronger if you increase the wins and have some marquee names , ' mets general manager steve phillips said now the mets have to hope a victory or two over the yankees will continue the warming trend in a city they hope will always have room for one more winner
the chief musical consequence of james cameron s film titanic has been the ubiquity of james horner s soupy , swelling soundtrack , which was released on a classical label and has risen to the top of the overall sales charts , eclipsing even madonna but happily , it is not the only consequence now three compact disks appear , each claiming to feature works actually heard on the illfated liner no one knows precisely what was played on the titanic , since all eight members of its orchestra went down with the ship but the white star line , which owned and operated the vessel , had its own music book , consisting of 352 selections overtures , dances , marches , opera excerpts and other short works from extant copies of that book , researchers and musicians have gleaned notions of what might have been performed aboard the ship yet there seems to be little consensus only paul lincke s glowworm , sydney baynes s destiny , dvorak s humoresque and the intermezzo from mascagni s cavalleria rusticana appear on more than one of these cd s as for what the band may have played for its final number , that question will almost certainly never be settled titanic music as heard on the fateful voyage \( rhino r2 72821 \) insists that it would have been archibald joyce s songe d'automne and the band played on \( london 289 458 3822 \) opts for a more melodramatic choice , the hymn nearer my god to thee the rhino album is the most striking of the three , not least because it is the most beautifully designed \( it won a grammy award for packaging \) conceived by ian whitcomb , an instrumentalist and an authority on light music , the disk features six players in various combinations , including a trio called the musical murrays , which performs tunes presumed heard on the lower decks the playing sometimes lacks finesse , and a version of elgar s salut d'amour is positively grating yet mr whitcomb \( on piano and accordion \) and company bring welcome vividness to these oldfashioned strains reading mr whitcomb s extensive , lively commentary while listening to this disk will make the experience all the more rewarding the booklet s many pages of photographs and drawings further enhance the effect the cd opens , appropriately , with the white star march , in an instrumentation fancifully including electronic organ mr whitcomb then recites thomas hardy s convergence of the twain , the most famous meditation on the sinking although mr whitcomb does hardy s moving stanzas full justice , they might better have been presented as a postlude from there , it is a series of greater and lesserknown light hits oh , you beautiful doll , the waltz from lehar s merry widow , alexander s ragtime band , shine on , harvest moon and the like some of the tunes , like herman finck s in the shadows and leslie stuart s lily of laguna , emerge amazingly fresh after all these years and a tender version of mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix , from saintsaens s opera samson et dalila for violin and piano seems especially well judged the album , with more than 20 tracks , ostensibly concludes with songe d'automne \( dream of autumn \) , the tune most modern titanic scholars believe was the last heard on the ship but with questionable taste , mr whitcomb delivers an unlisted bonus track , harry poole s raggin' the waves it spoils what would have been a lovely moment the london album lacks the authoritative writing and dash of mr whitcomb s effort and if i salonisti , the swiss quintet of piano and strings heard here \( and in mr cameron s film but not on the soundtrack album \) is technically more proficient than mr whitcomb s band , it is also generally less characterful what s more , the cd offers only 15 tracks among them , a host of salonmusic stalwarts like tchaikovsky s none but the lonely heart , johann strauss s wiener blut and dvorak s humoresque still , robert vollstedt s bright comic cake walk is played with a fine old world sense of irony and destiny and the ever beguiling glowworm are treated with a fetching light touch best of all is the quintet s version of the intermezzo from cavalleria rusticana , which becomes haunting rather than bathetic when played by so small an ensemble on the other hand , sousa s el capitan makes little sense without brass instruments , and grainger s molly on the shore sounds strangely stiff in this account yet the choice of nearer my god to thee to close the disk is inspired , even if purists will protest true , no selfrespecting british band \( which the titanic musicians certainly were \) would play a favored anglican hymn in a setting by an american , in this case , lowell mason but only the hardhearted will fail to feel a chill hearing this plain tune so evocatively played unlike the other two cd s , which are generally well planned efforts to capitalize on current interest in the titanic , the third , the last dance \( deutsche harmonia mundi dhm 05472 77377 2 \) , appears to be a rush job the band is i salonisti again , but the tracks are merely repackaged from earlier recordings without access to the white star book , it is hard to know whether most of the 15 items here might have been played on the titanic by and large , they are chamber versions of lighter classical fare a melange of debussy , sibelius and ravel leavened with some anton rubinstein and kreisler though one violinist is different from those on the london disk , the same high standards of performance apply indeed , in some cases , like dvorak s humoresque , there is much more heart on this record the lilting , then tempestuous account of sibelius s valse triste and a cheeky reading of rubinstein s melodie in f are special treats and a diaphanous arrangement of debussy s plus que lente glints with color but the absence of good notes and anything more than a lone sepiatinted photograph leaves one feeling cheated there are reasons we ca n't stop thinking about the titanic , and connecting with music that might have been played on the doomed ship is a way of getting closer to the event perhaps it does n't matter how many , if any , of these tunes the ship s passengers heard before their collision with destiny maybe our believing that we share something tangible with those people is what counts one thing is certain listening to these records summons ghosts and reminds us yet again that music has the power to conjure photos music to dance by kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio in the movie titanic \( merie w wallace paramount pictures20th century fox \) winning song

hartford , aug 20 gov john g rowland , who this year opposed a bill to increase the state tax on cigarettes , has accepted nearly 140 , 000 in contributions from tobacco interests since he was elected in 1994 , according to a report released today by a publicinterest group the connecticut citizen action group , which has been a frequent critic of mr rowland , said the governor s acceptance of tobacco money also drew into question his other positions on tobacco , including his refusal to ask connecticut s treasurer to divest the state of tobacco stocks even as it pursues a lawsuit against tobacco companies to recover the costs of treating tobaccorelated illnesses so far , governor rowland has put his support behind the money , and not on the side of public health or children s health , susan d haviland , a spokeswoman for the group , said at a news conference held today in the governor s empty parking space at the capitol according to the report , mr rowland has so far accepted 47 , 425 from tobacco industry executives , employees and political action committees for his reelection campaign he has also accepted 27 , 099 from lobbyists hired to work for tobacco companies , the report said after his election in 1994 , tobacco companies contributed 65 , 000 to support mr rowland 5 , 000 from the us tobacco corporation for his inaugural dinner , 10 , 000 from us tobacco and the philip morris companies to aid his transition into office , and 50 , 000 from philip morris to renovate the governor s mansion after mr rowland took office dean pagani , mr rowland s campaign spokesman , said that the governor did not support any new taxes whether on tobacco , gasoline or income and that he had in no way been influenced by donations from tobacco interests he said the treasurer , not the governor , should decide how best to invest the state s money mr pagani noted that the donations for the inaugural dinner , the transition costs and the mansion renovation were made to committees , not to the governor himself campaign leaders for mr rowland s democratic challenger , united states representative barbara b kennelly , were quick today to criticize the amount mr rowland has accepted mrs kennelly has vowed not to accept tobacco industry money in this campaign the governor pointed out that mrs kennelly had accepted tobacco money before as a congresswoman , mrs kennelly accepted about 30 , 000 in donations from political action committees for the tobacco industry from 1987 to 1997 , according to a report released in march by common cause the report did not track individual contributions by tobacco executives or employees , but the center for responsive politics in washington said that none were made to mrs kennelly s campaigns between 1991 and 1998 i have to laugh a little bit , mr rowland said today at a news conference in old lyme , where he was speaking about joint efforts by new york and connecticut to reduce nitrogen levels in long island sound she s received more tobacco support than the rest of the connecticut delegation and the rest of the new england delegation combined so , thou protest too much according to the common cause report , mrs kennelly has been the top recipient of tobacco industry money among house members in new england mrs kennelly said today that she had decided not to accept money from tobacco companies or executives because of what she had learned about the companies' practices , the addictiveness of tobacco and the impact of smoking on children i'm like a lot of people i got religion on the issue , she said jonathan w pelto , mrs kennelly s campaign spokesman , said mr rowland had accepted more money from tobacco in about 2 years than mrs kennelly had in 11 they 're not just funding his campaign , mr pelto said they 're working hard to make his life more enjoyable
after squabbling for weeks over the future home of the yankees and its repercussions on life in the city , some prominent politicians tried to project a more conciliatory spirit yesterday in response to a highly tentative peace offering by the team s principal owner , george m steinbrenner 3d mr steinbrenner said on wednesday that he would consider keeping the team in the bronx if attendance reaches three million this year a record level and could be guaranteed to stay there two of mr steinbrenner s antagonists in the fight over the stadium , the city council speaker , peter f vallone , and the bronx borough president , fernando ferrer , reacted to mr steinbrenner s unexpected overture by inviting him to the bargaining table i'm ready to meet with george steinbrenner any time , any place to discuss the responsible things the borough , the city , the state and the yankees together must do to improve attendance , even beyond an alltime high , mr ferrer said yet even as mr ferrer , mr vallone and mayor rudolph w giuliani who says his primary goal is to keep the team somewhere in the city said they were encouraged , mr steinbrenner took no steps yesterday to explain further his idea about guaranteeing attendance of three million a year that total is about 6 percent more than the team is on pace to draw this year and 14 percent more than its previous record mr steinbrenner has long sought a stadium on the west side of manhattan , contending that his team cannot flourish financially in the bronx because people are worried about crime and traffic mr vallone and mr ferrer want to block such a move in recent weeks , mr steinbrenner has appeared to be on the defensive over the stadium , as mr vallone has tried to rally opposition to a manhattan site by putting a referendum on the november ballot the referendum would ask whether tax dollars should be spent on a new stadium the yankees have the best record in baseball and are on the way to setting an attendance record as well , with the total number of fans for the season projected to reach 283 million do the three million , and then we 'll talk about the bronx after the season , mr steinbrenner said in an interview on wednesday by saying , even with many caveats , that he is willing to consider staying in the bronx , mr steinbrenner may have been trying to immunize himself from attacks that he is an irrational opponent of the existing stadium because the attacks have hurt his effort to gain a new stadium in manhattan , parrying them would be useful even if he has no intention of remaining in the bronx mr giuliani , who has often contended that a west side stadium would be very successful , said in a radio interview that if attendance in the bronx remained robust , it would help persuade the yankees to stay there , though he did not address whether the city would agree to guarantee a certain number of fans if the yankees have big attendance , if they start to match the orioles and the indians , then our job becomes much easier , mr giuliani said , referring to two teams whose attendance has surged since they moved into new stadiums attendance guarantees have proven to be controversial in other cities where they have been used , including san diego , and none of the three officials ventured yesterday to say how one would work , including how much money the city would have to pay in penalties if fans started shunning the yankees for his part , mr vallone , while expressing a little optimism about the possibility of new discussions over the stadium , could not resist taking another dig at mr steinbrenner to ask the city to guarantee three million fans is like asking george steinbrenner to guarantee 100 wins every year , mr vallone said in a statement but at least we are finally talking about keeping the yankees in the bronx

because its tire got stuck on a piece of gum why do deluxe trabis have heated rear windows \? to keep your hands warm as you push how do you double a trabi s value \? fill up the gas tank but now the jokes have a new twist the company that made the trabant , now called sachsenring automobiltechnik ag , has been reborn and is booming instead of cars , it makes car parts and not for old trabis the company s main customers include volkswagen , daimlerbenz and general motors' opel subsidiary far from being an east german laughingstock , it has become a model for entrepreneurial pluck that is all too rare in the smug world of german business in the west sales have tripled since 1995 , to 153 million , and the company is expected to report its first annual profit next month assembly lines are running nearly full tilt , with workers routinely putting in 45hour weeks in november , it was listed on the frankfurt stock exchange in a 275 million public offering the company is even edging back into the car business , having designed two concept cars of its own a hybrid van powered by both gasoline and electricity and an updated version of a londonstyle taxi cab sachsenring s rebirth is one example of a broader trend that runs through eastern germany though the overall economy here is still a shambles , entrepreneurial startups are sprouting like grass between the cracks of a crumbling sidewalk the successes have little to do with the hundreds of billions of dollars the bonn government has pumped into the east since 1990 , an effort that has been an epic failure more often than not , successful startups break away from western german approaches they are abandoning the collective wage agreements that are a hallmark of the west s social consensus between employers and unions they are demanding more flexibility from workers they are experimenting with new kinds of businesses , from the shrewd to the kooky and they are taking chances in the saxon town of mittelbach , bruno banani underwear has carved out a name for itself in designer underwear in glashutte , the heir to a oncefamous watchmaking family has built a new company that sells superluxury watches in leuna , a bulgarianborn engineer named kiril mateew took over one tiny part of a dilapidated east german chemical complex the new company , leunatenside , is now exporting specialty chemicals to japan and the united states and here in zwickau , two west german brothers , ulf and ernstwilhelm rittinghaus , have created a de facto startup from the wreckage of the trabant the sprawling complex here was built in 1904 by august horch , who founded audi after world war ii , it became a government factory that produced the hated trabants the rittinghaus brothers , whose father sold his family company for a substantial profit in the mid1980 s , were looking for investments when , in 1993 , a friend encouraged them to look at sachsenring we flew our own plane and landed on a grassy field nearby the factory , ulf rittinghaus recalled it was very disturbing everything was so destroyed , and smoke was coming out everywhere the workers looked down and depressed the company was in a state of virtual collapse it had stopped making trabants in 1991 , because no one would buy them , and was getting by as a supplier of trabi replacement parts and as a parts supplier for volkswagen but it was losing about 20 million a year , and its work force had plummeted to 300 from 12 , 500 one prospective buyer wanted to have the whole complex torn down a service provided free by the government and sell the land the rittinghaus brothers , along with a third partner , jurgen raab , decided there were better possibilities it is much easier to turn an automobile manufacturer into a parts supplier than the other way around , ulf rittinghaus said at least some assembly lines were in working order and the workers had tremendous experience and a surprising amount of technological expertise and ideas unlike the bailouts of most other east german conglomerates , the project received relatively little in government subsidies about 30 million over several years on a purchase price of roughly 10 million by contrast , dow chemical will receive up to 7 billion to revamp three chemical complexes bremervulkan , a shipbuilder taken over by west germans , received more than 1 billion and still went broke amid accusations of fraud at sachsenring , the new owners pumped in about 100 million their own money and assorted bank loans and kept their goals modest most of the old assembly lines were shut down or razed , but those that remained were spruced up to offer both quality and just in time delivery they also rebuilt the research and development areas , looking for new products and technologies

washington , sept 11 the day , as ominous as it was extraordinary , took a jagged tangent as the house finished its furiously partisan faceoff on the question of impeaching the president instantly the city s focus , like the nation s , shifted to a long , salacious journey down the information highway the radio of manhatt bahia , a flower dealer three blocks down pennsylvania avenue from the capitol , suddenly blared forth an early bulletin , the words spilling like mercury across the sidewalk and the starr report vividly describes several sex acts that some people might consider unusual ! mr bahia blinked in absorbing the details , his hands clasped steady on his cane and the odds are 178 trillion to 1 that the semen is the president s ! the bulletin concluded , and the flower dealer only nodded slowly in acknowledgment clinton will bounce back , he declared everything is premature , he insisted , resisting the enormous vector of accusation and humiliation directed at the president across a blistering day for the history books other government business moved forward , but one item seemed ludicrous in the context of the day s agenda a house subcommittee on trade and consumer protection held a hearing on protecting children from inappropriate material on the internet the vases of mr bahia s colorful flowers arrayed on the sidewalk were one of the few grace notes on a capitol day given over to a fury of partisan cutandthrust and dizzying absorption of the chaucerian details of the starr report over the democrats' vehement objections , republican speakers on the house floor repeatedly showed their wariness that to yield the president even an hour s advance look at the starr report would give him houdinilike room to spin some masterly escape we are unwilling to give you a public relations advantage any greater than the one you have had for the past eight months , declared representative henry j hyde , republican of illinois , who , while saluted bipartisanly for his anticipated statesmanship at the helm of the impeachment inquiry , did not shy from a toothandclaw rebuttal when the democrats riled him the outcry from the democrats was intense , but the final , lopsided vote showed most unable to resist the releasing of the report , poised as it was on the threshold of the internet with its tales of presidential sex and mendacity find a rope , find a tree , and ask a bunch of questions later ! boomed representative jim mcdermott , democrat of washington , angrily warning of a political lynch mob the republican whip , representative tom delay of texas , would have none of that the president is no better than any other american , mr delay told the democrats , surveying them with a a hardedged stare and belittling the explanations and apologies of the president as the spin , the whole spin and nothing but the spin at the white house , mr clinton s press secretary , michael d mccurry , weathering a storm of reporters' questions , had to pause when he was asked , is this the saddest day of the clinton presidency \? the president s spokesman thought for a moment , then came up with the ultimate alternative the days on which we 've dealt with the tragic deaths of people woeful as the day was for democrats , many feared the worst was yet to come with individual members of the house judiciary committee now free for two weeks to pore over perchance to leak the report s still secret appendix of 2 , 600 pages of detailed and intimate information this information will leak out drip by drip , day by day , said representative joe moakley , democrat of massachusetts , warning the nation of a nightmare of grim titillation to come as the impeachment question loomed , the house was cautioned by a longtime veteran , representative david r obey , that the welfare of all politicians , republican and democrat , would be put at stake in a grueling constitutional ordeal i was here during watergate , mr obey , a democrat from wisconsin , said gloomily i hated it , because it bittered up the politics of the entire country after authorizing the internet distribution of the scathing report , lawmakers quickly poured down the steps of the capitol into the day s sunshine clinton had such tremendous potential , said one tourist , newton stafford of escondido , calif , a clinton supporter whose regret inched toward eulogy his wife , geraldine , sadly told him , men with political power are very attractive to women it s a double whammy the couple watched the emerging politicians steadily work enormous lines of television crews from across the nation , foraging for air time who are you \? one reporter demanded of senator arlen specter , and the pennsylvania republican , who had detoured over from the other chamber , instantly took no offense and genially offered his name and a volley of sound bites now i'm going to read , the senator concluded , beaming as he departed toward his office to delve into the sordid details of the day
just how focused must a company be \? and how much does it have to cut before wall street is happy \? these are the questions that the directors of tenneco inc will ponder when they meet today at the company s headquarters in greenwich , conn no one expects them to announce any decisions yet but as the day wears on , they will most likely decide how to jettison tenneco s moneylosing corrugated and containerboard mills then the board will probably set a timetable for splitting the remaining businesses specialty packaging and automotive parts into two companies it will be tenneco s final attempt to slim down to fighting weight the company , founded in 1940 as the tennessee gas and transmission company , a pipeline company , spent its first 50 years growing into a sprawling conglomerate with businesses as farflung as shipbuilding , energy and agricultural equipment and it has spent the last five years whittling itself down , from six businesses to four and now two each time , tenneco figured wall street would embrace it as a stronger , betterfocused company each time , wall street declared it an outofstep hodgepodge doing too little , too late even in july , when tenneco first publicly floated the idea that it would split , its stock rallied just a bit , then sank this time , the board is expected to call it quits on the whole conglomerate notion , probably by spinning the remaining two businesses to shareholders i thought investors would see a miniconglomerate made up of two superb performers , and think two plus two equals five , said dana g mead , tenneco s chief executive they still think two plus two equals three so we are probably looking at the holding company s liquidation tenneco is unlikely to carry out , or even publicize , a decision to rip itself in two until the stock market improves but clearly , it is poised to join itt and westinghouse in the dustbin of conglomerate history , reduced , like the cheshire cat in through the looking glass , to a fading smile there is no guarantee that investors will apply more favorable equations to the separate companies but history should give them cheer the case corporation , once tenneco s agricultural equipment subsidiary , did a lot better after tenneco overhauled it and sprung it loose in 1994 and while case s stock has slipped badly in the last six months , analysts say investors were reacting to the turmoil in the company s asian markets , not to its management individual companies are always more focused , and thus more formidable competitors , said george l staphos , an analyst with salomon smith barney still , automotive parts and packaging are cyclical , slowgrowth businesses moreover , diversified companies generally have higher credit ratings than singlebusiness ones , and it remains unclear which of the two spinoffs will acquire the lion s share of tenneco s 32 billion in debt they might run into problems meeting debt obligations if they are split apart , warned brian l eisenbarth , an analyst with the brokerage firm of collins company for now , the businesses seem robust both units enjoy aboveaverage margins in their industries tenneco automotive , whose brands include monroe shock absorbers and walker mufflers , has acquired some 20 other companies since 1994 , and earned 407 million on 32 billion in revenue last year tenneco packaging , which makes baggies and hefty bags , has also grown rapidly , earning 372 million on 4 billion in sales last year spinoffs generally do better , both in profits and share price , when freed from their parents lucent technologies , for example , has been able to capture a higher stock valuation after it left att , and many chemical companies have done better without their pharmaceutical parents analysts have difficulty understanding multiindustry companies , said robert f greenhill , chairman of greenhill company , an investment bank which is advising tenneco maybe so but that has not depressed multiples at general electric , allied signal , textron , or other modernday conglomerates some investors say it is tenneco itself , not its diversity , that is the problem the moment case spun off from tenneco , its performance started to improve , said warren e spitz , a portfolio manager of the prudential equity income fund , an investor in case tenneco just never seems to wring profitability out of businesses it keeps the prospect of a tenneco split has not whetted investor appetite for tenneco shares since december 1996 , when the company became two businesses , the stock has fallen 265 percent , to 334375 , while the standard poor s 500stock index has risen 347 percent tenneco s priceearnings ratio is 144 , trailing the 237 average for the s p 500 their multiple stinks because wall street understands exactly who they are and what they are doing , and none of us buys into it , said joel tiss , an analyst with lehman brothers holdings such harsh criticism is not universal among analysts many others say that mr mead and his troops have worked wonders with what had been a badly managed company they squeeze the most profits out of their revenue dollars , mr eisenbarth of collins said
washington , jan 22 in what appears as the strongest sign yet that he intends to run for reelection in november , mayor marion s barry jr spent more than 12 hours today tapping the pulse of constituents in the anacostia section of town , his political base in all six of his previous campaigns from elementary schools to senior centers to a church community meeting at the end of the day , mr barry listened to comments and fielded complaints but he artfully dodged the biggest question on the minds of many district residents with much of the power for running the city vested in the financial control board created by congress and appointed by president clinton three years ago , would he seek a fifth term as mayor this fall \? you plan to run \? dan campbell jr , 58 , a retired engineer , asked mr barry inside the recreational vehicle that mr barry often uses as a mobile city hall , as it says on the outside i do n't know , the mayor responded i'm still deciding would it do any good to vote for you when congress do you the way it do \? that s one of the big questions , mr barry replied so what good is a vote for you \? mr campbell pressed on that s a great question , mr barry said in recent public appearances and again today , mr barry called this time of year his ascertaining period he professed to be thinking about running again , discussing the possibility with friends and praying for help to make the right decision he told mr campbell he was likely to make a decision by april but from all outward appearances , it seems as if the 1998 campaign is up and running , with his chief opponent the financial control board all picked out it is now routine for mr barry to lash out at the fivemember panel , calling it , he did at his weekly news conference on wednesday , horrific , undemocratic and immorally set up , largely for the fact that none of its members was elected never mind the three members of the district council who could be his challengers in the september democratic primary harold brazil , kevin p chavous and jack evans their mention almost never raises mr barry s emotional pitch the way the control board does at one point on wednesday , mr barry called the board s control of the city a dictatorship and harkened the day the board would go out of existence by law , the board remains in place until the city has balanced its budget four years in a row city officials expect that an audit for the 1997 fiscal year , which ended on sept 30 , will show a balance for the first time so whoever runs in 1998 will have two clean years of democratic rule , as opposed to undemocratic rule , said mr barry , who has been mayor for 16 of the last 20 years then it s goodbye active control board , thank god and good riddance longtime barry watchers say the prospect of gaining full control over the city once again is enough of an enticement to draw mr barry into this year s race they point to the campaign begun today taking the mobile city hall into each of the city s eight wards as a sure sign he s a very political man , said mr brazil he does not do anything without making a political calculation though chilly weather held down the number of residents waiting to meet the mayor inside the van , which was parked outside a supermarket , many of the people he did encounter encouraged him to try for another term please run again i 'll be there 100 percent for you , said sharon pinkney , a computer student from anacostia we need you in this city , not the control board many of the visitors had to be reminded to keep their comments short not julian ashberry , 39 , a retired supermarket employee a staunch barry supporter , he popped in long enough to say god loves you so do i see you at the polls photo mayor marion s barry jr , with his mobile city hall , fielded complaints and comments from washington residents yesterday the 12hour day among constituents was seen as a sign that he intended to run again \( scott robinson for the new york times \)
ciudad juarez , mexico for nearly a decade , the united states government has been trying to prosecute a mexican multimillionaire who is accused of running a cartel that smuggled tons of cocaine into california several years ago when american drug agents raided one of his warehouses , it was the largest single drug bust in history and it remains so today american agents thought it was an open and shut case against the suspect , rafael munoz talavera , because several traffickers who were arrested after the drug seizure identified him as their leader but despite two trials , one conviction , and what american prosecutors say is overwhelming evidence against him , mr munoz is free mexican and american authorities say he is directing a violent campaign to seize control of a major part of the mexican drug trade neither government has ever publicly explained the collapse of the lengthy effort to convict mr munoz but a history of the investigation , based on interviews with law enforcement officials , judges who tried mr munoz , and an examination of documents , shows a mexican criminal justice system in chaos , rife with corruption and mismanagement in the first trial , the police and prosecutors , who were later accused of accepting bribes from the drug cartel that officials say was run by mr munoz , steered a watereddown package of evidence to a friendly judge a second trial , bolstered by stronger evidence from investigators in the united states , ended in a conviction but a mexican appeals court freed mr munoz , ruling that he had been illegally tried twice for the same crime during the trials , mr munoz was lodged in comfortable suites in mexican federal prisons , including one with a bar we knew he was going to walk from the date of his arrest , said an american official who spoke on condition of anonymity in mexico the guy with the biggest pocket book always wins now mr munoz has been reported back in ciudad juarez , just across the border from el paso , tex , and american prosecutors are working to assemble yet another case against him mr munoz did not respond to requests , left at his juarez restaurant , to discuss his legal fight but in december , in a newspaper advertisement , he denied any involvement in drug trafficking and described himself as a simple and hardworking man the lawyer who defended him in his sevenyear legal battle , sergio roldan ramos , was slain in ciudad juarez last october mr roldan s partners and other lawyers who have worked for mr munoz did not respond to requests for interviews mr munoz s release , and criminal comeback , dramatize the legal crisis threatening mexico s modernization the economy has opened up and opposition political parties are finding a voice but criminal syndicates are casting a widening shadow and the justice system is riddled with graft and incompetence , mired in archaic procedures and shielded from accountability mexicans hold every element involved in disrepute , from the police and prosecutors to judges and jailers a 1996 united nations survey asked mexicans how much confidence they had in their judicial system and 80 percent responded little or none , the worst showing of any latin american country we have a justice system immersed in the routine violation of every basic principle , said eduardo lopez betancourt , a law professor at the national university nothing is respected prosecutors rig evidence and judges sell verdicts according to the highest bidder , without delay , favoring every kind of criminal from drug traffickers to car thieves confronted with this crisis , american prosecutors routinely press to extradite traffickers for trial in united states courts although the extradition of mexicans is constitutionally barred , officials in washington say that mexico has recently vowed to honor future extradition requests still , the united states government has never successfully extradited a major mexican drug dealer four years ago , president ernesto zedillo of mexico replaced the entire supreme court and set up a judicial council to attack corruption by requiring competitive examinations , the reform cleaned up the system of judicial appointments , based on cronyism but otherwise the council has been timid mario melgar , a council member , said that of 1 , 538 complaints filed against federal judges , only 8 had been forwarded to prosecutors not one mexican judge has been punished for accepting payments from traffickers , he said i do n't see any way to know if a judge receives a bribe , mr melgar said it s practically impossible the justice system bribes can blind judges to crime many of the forces that foiled the prosecution of mr munoz are embedded in the nation s justice system graft is considered rampant in the munoz case , only the police and a prosecutor were accused in american testimony of corruption , but many judges are also suspect the general accounting office , the investigative arm of the united states congress , told a committee in march that a specially vetted mexican police unit fighting organized crime trusts only one of mexico s 500 federal judges and magistrates to authorize wiretaps without tipping off the suspects
just before the playoffs , goalie martin brodeur mused about all the attention that would soon come to his successful but oftenoverlooked devils with the rangers and the islanders failing to qualify for the tournament , the devils were the new york area s only hockey team still playing and with the knicks and the nets not expected to advance in the national basketball association tournament , the devils would soon share the metropolitan spotlight with only the two baseball teams it should n't be too long before we 're by ourselves , brodeur said before game 1 with ottawa this is the best team in the devils' history everybody remembers you for playoff hockey the attention span lasted just 11 days , but the bad memories will linger with a 31 victory in ottawa on saturday night , the senators eliminated the devils in the first round of a fourround tournament , winning the fourofsevengame series by 42 the senators will move on to face washington in the second round the devils , the eastern conference champions during the regular season , are left to wonder what went wrong against the eighthseeded qualifier , which finished 24 points behind them in the standing the devils scored only 12 goals in six games the senators clearly resented the hubris in the words of brodeur , scott stevens , the devils' captain , and coach jacques lemaire even after saturday s game , stevens said the senators were an average team that played great while the devils were an aboveaverage team that played poorly lemaire said , i still feel we 're a better team and brodeur said the devils ca n't allow ourselves to lose against these guys , an eighth seed we had high expectations , brodeur said it s unacceptable the senators talked a bit , too they did n't give us any respect the whole series , and we were the better team , defenseman lance pitlick told the ottawa sun they always had excuses for why we beat them but in the end , they had none actually , they had a few , beginning with the food poisoning that kept bobby holik out of the final game then there is the crackdown on obstruction fouls that seems to favor smaller , quicker teams like ottawa over bigger , slower teams like the devils the crackdown came late in the season , when the devils were at their best , and it was designed to hurt the plodding , defenseoriented teams that have adopted the style with which the devils won the stanley cup in 1995 but doug gilmour , who led the devils with five goals in the series , was not buying that one we ca n't blame this on the crackdown , said gilmour , who will become an unrestricted free agent on july 1 everybody s got to face what happened everybody s got to look in the mirror it has n't even sunk in yet sometimes it s not what they do it s what we do the possibility of rules changes next season to further encourage even more free skating might force lemaire and general manager lou lamoriello to redesign the blueprint for what has been one of the league s best regularseason teams for the past five seasons when asked about the devils' approach , gilmour said we had a great year by playing that role , and then it did n't work in the playoffs i'm sure they 'll go over that stevens said that during the regular season , opponents play a little looser , and we find ways to score then playoffs come , and it tightens up a bit and we have trouble scoring we 're losing , 21 , all the time scott niedermayer said maybe things have to change ottawa has maybe not the biggest team in the league , but some guys who are strong and a lot of good skaters i can appreciate that hopefully that s the way the game is going to go , back to skating , a real game of hockey lemaire said on saturday night that he and lamoriello would discuss lemaire s job status in the next few days it is not certain that he will return , although he has dropped other hints about leaving in previous years organized in his methods and insightful in his strategies , lemaire is also a stubborn and proud man who reacts grudgingly to changing realities but even lemaire showed an inclination toward adapting after ottawa took control of the series with victories in games 1 , 3 and 4 with bigger , older players like dave andreychuk , randy mckay and holik in scoring slumps , lemaire began to find more use for younger , slicker , smaller players like patrik elias , brendan morrison and petr sykora holik s illness and jason arnott s wrist injury prompted lemaire to use niedermayer , a defenseman , on the forward lines on saturday although kevin dean scored the devils' only goal on saturday on a fluky shot , the devils' best chance a shot stopped by goalie damian rhodes came from an unlikely attacker it was krzysztof oliwa , a rookie who finished the season with 2 goals , 3 assists and a teamhigh 295 penalty minutes the scoring attempt was a credit to oliwa , one of the most energetic devils in the six games but to have his moment as the game 6 offensive highlight is an indictment of the team s system the devils , mechanical to a fault , never seemed to get enthusiastic they do not play hockey they work it elimination from the playoffs frees the players from the devils' mandatory team meals and secluded team hotels ken daneyko , one of few players praised by lemaire on saturday , seemed to be one of the saddest he played well after missing much of the season in alcohol rehabilitation a senior devil , the 34yearold defenseman joined the team in 198384 it s devastating , daneyko said of the early exit probably the most heartbroken i 've

washington , oct 8 with their deadline just hours away , congressional republicans and the white house made little progress today toward resolving their differences over the mustpass spending bills needed to keep the government open aides said that up to 150 matters were on the table , about a dozen of them major but all of them needing attention , and that new issues were cropping up by the minute as the impeachment vote dominated the stage and members sought to slip in pet projects these included such items as extending patent periods on various drugs , subsidizing importers of fine wool and increasing military pensions today was a day that we slipped backwards , said one top democratic aide with the senate s vote today to pass the bill financing the veterans affairs and housing programs , congress has still cleared only 6 of the 13 spending bills in advance of the midnight friday deadline , when temporary financing of the government runs out both sides are expected to agree on friday to extend the temporary financing for at least a day or two republican leaders in both the house and senate were scrambling behind the scenes and in negotiations with the white house to piece together the remaining bills , while in public , the house voted to begin an impeachment inquiry of the president and the senate addressed matters unrelated to spending in a kind of surreal reminder of his power as president , mr clinton , on the eve of the impeachment vote , set the appropriations back a notch by vetoing one of the six spending bills that congress had cleared this was the measure on agriculture matters and disaster relief for farmers mr clinton said in his veto message that he wanted more money for farmers , but the veto , which he signed just before midnight wednesday , was widely perceived as a lastminute attempt to please democrats from farm states before they voted on impeachment administration officials said mr clinton wanted to give congress time to fix the matter before the friday deadline it struck republicans as odd , though , that he would veto the bill since congress had put more money into the agriculture bill than he had requested it was only after democrats said they wanted more that the president joined the cause with time running out , republican leaders said they would not try to override the agriculture veto but would roll the bill into the everexpanding omnibus package that will contain other contentious issues but they did agree tentatively to meet some of the president s morepublicized demands , including providing money for fuel assistance for lowincome people , for summer jobs and for child care for most of the day , house leaders were sequestered in closeddoor sessions deciding what to include in the omnibus and what to exclude , leaving many members to gesture with futility toward the speaker s office and say in a phrase repeated throughout the capitol that all decisions were above their pay grade the house , which has yet to act on six spending bills , voted on none today the senate , which has seven spending bills outstanding , easily passed the bill covering veterans affairs and housing but never got around to the next spending bill on its docket , the one covering the treasury department and the united states postal service the fact that so many bills remain unmoved at this point in the process was a sign of how deeply divided republicans are among themselves , between the two houses and from the administration perhaps the most contentious bill , despite some progress today , is the one financing labor , health , human services and education this is the first time since congress started funding these agencies together more than 40 years ago that both houses appeared unlikely to pass the labor and health bill hangups include millions of dollars that president clinton wants for education , including 100 , 000 teachers and expanded afterschool programs the president also wants national testing for students , but the bill bars any steps toward that complicating the outlook for the bill is a proposal floating in the senate to add a tobaccorelated measure that would prevent the federal government from receiving any of the money that states receive from tobacco settlements another difficult bill is the one financing the interior department , which has passed the house but not the senate the president has warned for months that he would veto the bill if it retained the numerous riders that he calls antienvironmental these include provisions to increase nationwide timber sales , to allow clearcutting in alaska s tongass national forest , to allow roads to be built through wilderness in alaska s isembek national wildlife refuge and across wetlands in alaska , to halt plans to reintroduce the grizzly bear into the selwaybitteroot system in idaho and montana and to mandate the renewal of grazing permits on land owned by the bureau of land management potential roadblocks to agreements on other bills include a measure that the administration says would weaken the background checks in purchases of handguns , bar the use of money to study global climate change and deny aid to international familyplanning groups that use their own money to advocate abortion rights many republicans said that while numerous problems loomed , especially over big topics like the census and the money for the international monetary fund , they expected to work them out rather than shut down the government with the impeachment vote over , members are increasingly anxious to get home to campaign for the november elections representative john porter , republican of illinois and chairman of the labor subcommittee of the appropriations committee , said his committee still had 25 issues to resolve but mr porter said a government shutdown was highly unlikely , mainly because of the negotiating skill of erskine b bowles , the president s chief of staff a shutdown has receded as a possibility because of the way erskine bowles has approached the discussion , mr porter said administration officials , including jack lew , the director of the office of management and budget , and lawrence stein , the administration s liaison with congress , were meeting tonight with speaker newt gingrich and others in another part of the capitol , treasury secretary robert e rubin was trying to strike a deal under which republicans would agree to full financing of the international monetary fund republicans want to impose conditions on the lending agency in exchange for 18 billion to shore up its reserves representative sonny callahan , republican of alabama and chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the appropriations committee , said a deal could materialize tonight or tomorrow but this matter too is likely to be tossed into the omnibus package , which would be presented to the president on a takeitorleaveit basis

nashua , nh , sept 18 visits to new hampshire have always been de rigueur for presidential candidates , and vice president al gore has made his share today , on his third trip to the state this year , he visited a health care seminar in keene and a computer company here in nashua but for all his previous tours through the host state of the nation s first presidential primary , mr gore had never before come under such extraordinary circumstances with leading republicans , and some democrats , clamoring for president clinton s impeachment or resignation over the scandal involving a former white house intern , mr gore appears to many new hampshire voters as a presidentinwaiting even if it remains a fanciful notion well ahead of events i definitely think people are paying more attention to him , said dr alan rogers , medical director at a hospital in manchester and one of about 200 people who heard mr gore and new hampshire s governor , jeanne shaheen , discuss health care issues at keene state college everybody assumes he will be the democratic nominee anyway so , yeah , i 'd say it has intensified a bit mona anderson , a therapist at the college agreed , saying i overheard someone misspeak , calling him 'president gore' at teredyne , a company that makes computer modules here , strat smith , an operations manager , listened to mr gore s 20minute speech on job creation and said of the scandal s possible effect on mr gore this brings things to the fore he has to make his case sooner , which is obviously what he did today in the weeks leading to the midterm elections in november , mr gore has steadfastly avoided saying anything that might fuel such thinking his oftstated goal these tumultuous weeks has been to support president clinton , administration policies and democrats running for election in speeches , he never mentions the scandal or deliberations in congress over impeachment hearings or calls for mr clinton s resignation or the smattering of protesters who have begun appearing on the route of mr gore s motorcade , as they did today in interviews with new hampshire newspapers and a television station , wmur also de rigueur for visiting politicians mr gore acknowledged for the first time that he had not read the report to congress by kenneth w starr , the whitewater independent counsel but i feel i'm thoroughly familiar with it based upon briefings and news accounts , he said he also said he believed that most americans could put the scandal in a larger perspective , and predicted that mr clinton would finish his term with a distinguished record that will go down in history as a virtuoso performance in none of the interviews did mr gore reveal any personal feelings about the president s predicament , noting that the president had already apologized and said his actions were indefensible mr gore would say only that mr clinton and his wife , hillary , are good friends and i feel badly for them and for their family when mr gore began a tour of the plant and a reporter asked about the house judiciary committee s vote along party lines to release on monday the videotape of president clinton s grand jury testimony , mr gore said if that s the case , it should n't be that way they should adopt a more bipartisan approach to this for many of mr gore s listeners here and in keene , frank discussions about issues affecting the country provided welcome relief from events roiling washington after the health care discussion , alan green , a health care administrator , said , this is refreshing to me , putting the of scandal aside
outside passage a memoir of an alaskan childhood by julia scully 219 pp new york random house 23 anyone who loves photography owes a debt to julia scully as an editor at modern photography in the early 1970 s , she was one of the first people to recognize the quality of photographs taken by a man who called himself disfarmer , an odd , solitary creature who ran a portrait studio from 1939 to 1946 in heber springs , ark scully s essay on disfarmer accompanied a collection of his photographs published in 1976 , and it was reprinted when twin palms publishers issued a larger collection , called disfarmer , in 1996 disfarmer s technique was simple his subjects the ordinary people of heber springs were placed before a plain , dark backdrop any props they chose were their own a newborn child , an enormous catfish , a spouse , a friend , a cigarette disfarmer merely waited for a moment of clarity , that instant when everyday flesh caught fire , when he could see the weight of blood and bones the spirit carried and how beautifully , if wearily , they were carried after all it s hard to imagine that julia scully s plain but lovely new memoir , outside passage , was n't affected by the memory of disfarmer the proposition their work shares is that the subdued rhetoric of directness has a grace equal to a more heightened rhetoric , and that its force is often greater the central figures in outside passage scully s mother , rose her father , whose suicide was discovered by his two daughters a man named hessel green , who owned a liquor store in nome , alaska a bad woman named norma , who occupied a cabin in taylor creek , a nearby town , where rose ran a roadhouse the miners who drank and played cards there each of them stands before the unadorned background of scully s memory while her prose catches the light that plays against their skin or pauses in their liquid eyes the props are few , the poses are natural , the mood is one of unforgiving acceptance the events described in outside passage might have kindled a much angrier , far more accusatory memoir the story begins during the depression in san francisco , where scully s parents ran a coffee shop on franklin street in nome they had owned the prosperous north pole bakery and coffee shop but the itch to live outside , as they called the world beyond alaska , led them to sell their business and move to san francisco not before scully s father , a russian immigrant named julius silverman , squandered a small fortune in a furtrading scam to him and his wife , depression san francisco meant one failed smalltime business after another , a downward spiral that ended when he took his own life for a time , rose and her daughters managed on their own but one sunday , rose took julia and her elder sister , lillian , to the pacific hebrew orphans asylum , better known as homewood terrace , and left them there rose returned to alaska and began searching for the business opportunity that eventually allowed her to send for her two girls what she found was a summer roadhouse in the kougarok , a remote mining district in the seward peninsula , and , during the winters in nome , a life of unwed domestic habitation with a considerate liquorstore proprietor , hessel green it was good enough scully writes of her own experiences in the present tense , but of her mother whose narrative runs separately for the first part of this book she writes in the past these tenses , you would think , must have an emblematic quality , the present meant to capture the immediacy of young julia s experience , the past meant to set at one remove the source of so much pain but that is not how it works in outside passage the alienation , the selfdistancing , in young julia s life was extreme enough to wall her private self off from the world around her at homewood terrace , she writes , i crawl between the tall hydrangea bushes and find a piece of clear ground just big enough so that if i scrunch down , knees under my chin , i'm completely hidden for julia s sister , lillian , the selfdistancing is even more complete only as adults do the sisters discuss their childhood when she finally could talk about it , what she tells me is that she remembers none of it , not the sutter street apartment , not homewood , not the seattle children s home nor the long , horrible boat trip she hardly even remembers taylor creek and the roadhouse what she says , in fact , is that she has no memory of her childhood at all the present tense , so evocative in this book , measures the distance between the memoirist and the girl who had never imagined a world that was n't edged by the horizon of what she already knew , whose enlightenment came late in high school when she first read that gospel of disillusionment , main street the present tense marks , in other words , the discontinuity in her selves and the peculiarity is that scully s use of the past tense , that workmanlike narrative engine , is saturated with understanding , with a perception of her mother that has been worked out over years , so long , in fact , that the barrier between the memoirist and her mother seems smaller than the one between the memoirist and her own distant incarnation when past and present converge , as they do near the end of the book , you understand that scully s imagination , the tool with which she probes her mother s life , is a moral imagination , whose root is forgiveness , even at the moment she prepares to flee this shack , she writes , this makeshift store , with its plywood shelves and musty , sour smell of used clothes , the waves of dry heat from the oil burner , the view out to the muddy stretch of front street , the sagging , weatherworn buildings this is the opportunity that has shaped so much of our lives to my mother , it is security , it is fortune , it is the future to me it seems a prison worse , solitary confinement i have hardly mentioned alaska , which , in all its immensity , is represented in young julia s mind as the narrow scene at nome where the bering sea meets the land and , at taylor creek , as the edge of the world , where the pebbles on the bottom of the creek , the palest blue and gray and salmony pink , seem to be vibrating there were , as it happened , no rules in alaska , which turned out to be the antidote to the orphanage it was a place within whose grimness a young girl found unexpected beauty , even human beauty amid the roughness of the miners it was a place that taught her to find the same hard beauty in the shape of her own life drawing
the warrior s honor ethnic war and the modern conscience by michael ignatieff 207 pp new york metropolitan books henry holt company 2495 it is not easy to categorize michael ignatieff he has no academic position , but he writes something very like moral philosophy he has been the host on an upmarket television talk show , but so much more thoughtfully than 90 percent of those who have worked in the same genre that it would be absurd to describe him as a television journalist twentyfive years ago , he was a historian of ideas , and a talent for historical exposition marks everything he writes today cultural commentator is near the mark , but perhaps public moralist would be the proper description , if only it were not so likely to be misread if only it did not convey the impression of someone who gazes on the world around him with pursed lips and censorious eyes the warrior s honor inspires such anxious reflections because it is itself a mix of reportage , history of ideas and moral and political speculation it consists of five essays , reprinted and sometimes reconstructed , from lectures and from articles in magazines like the new yorker and social research all but one of its chapters are no more than two or three years old the opening essay , is nothing sacred \? , dates back to 1985 , but its doubts about the ethics of television journalism are as apt after somalia , rwanda and bosnia as they were in the aftermath of the ethiopian famine in any case , it makes an appropriate start , because one of ignatieff s themes is the feeling of impotence that has overtaken the rich , liberal , militarily powerful western world in the years since the fall of soviet communism thanks to television , the inhabitants of western europe and the united states daily have their faces rubbed in the horrors perpetrated in the collapsing states of subsaharan africa , the balkans , chechnya and afghanistan it is impossible that they should not respond by wanting to do something to prevent those horrors it seems equally impossible to intervene in ways that do not make matters worse the structure of ignatieff s argument is simple , and to my mind irresistible the collapse of the soviet empire left no competitor to the united states as a global superpower the united states was part of , though indisputably also the leader of , an alliance of liberal states with the economic and military resources to impose their will on any government in the world it was no surprise that george bush could hail the dawn of a new world order one dedicated to peace and prosperity , the protection of human rights , the inviolability of national integrity and the reconciliation of national minorities president bush may have despised the lword , but the idea of a new world order was , as ignatieff insists , an essentially liberal one consistent conservatives , after greeting the end of the cold war with a sigh of relief , would tend to think that the united states government s job was to protect united states citizens against foreign invaders , terrorists or whomever else , that death and destruction in other countries were none of their business and especially none of their government s business washington should not be acting as combination cop and nursemaid to the rest of the globe faced with the worldwide enthusiasm for religiously and ethnically driven civil war , the conservatives' wish to keep out of other people s quarrels looks like basic common sense liberals of the stripe of ignatieff \( and myself \) are therefore on shaky ground the essays in the warrior s honor explore that ground with admirable sensitivity to its shakiness , but without emerging onto anything firmer a chapter entitled the narcissism of minor difference starts in a command post in eastern croatia , where ignatieff tries to get a serbian militiaman to tell him what he has against his former croatian neighbors the man looks scornful and takes a cigarette pack out of his khaki jacket see this \? these are serbian cigarettes over there , ' he says , gesturing out of the window , 'they smoke croatian cigarettes' feeling , perhaps , that this is not a large enough issue over which to kill one s neighbors , the young militiaman returns to the topic look , here s how it is those croats , they think they 're better than us they want to be the gentlemen think they 're fancy europeans but , he continues , serbs and croats are all really just balkan garbage as ignatieff says , this sort of incoherent wavering between thinking that our neighbors are alien and thinking that they are exactly like us is commonplace in these situations it is not only puzzling , of course , but damaging to the kind of theories that social scientists are so fond of contrary to samuel huntington , ignatieff says , it s hard to believe that a deep theological and civilizational rift had opened up in eastern croatia all the same , it is not easy to know what rift had opened up , and why it should be so hard to close ignatieff comes as close as common sense allows , i think , when he suggests that there is a twostage process one is what he calls the hobbesian stage to the other he gives no name , but the inspiration comes from some of freud s reflections on the horrors of world war i
indianapolis the clock struck midnight for patrick ewing in the first quarter , when arguably the greatest player in knicks history poked at the ball like an infant stretching for a mobile in his crib all thumbs reaching for air even if you never cared for this team or ewing as a player , it was a disturbing sight a proud veteran unable to find his shooting stroke or his timing the perennial allstar going scoreless in the first half , loping up and down the court awkwardly like a newborn colt patrick , you 'll never get a ring ! a middleaged man yelled from courtside as callous as it sounded , it made you think again about another futile may night in ewing s brilliant career ending awfully , a 9988 loss in game 5 of the eastern conference semifinals it s been a bad year all around , everybody getting hurt , he said afterward i feel that if i stayed healthy and the rest of the guys stayed healthy , maybe , you know , we would n't have been such a low seed , and who knows what could have happened \? he missed 9 of 13 shots , and three of them never hit the rim he grabbed 11 rebounds , but he missed 6 of 8 free throws , committed three turnovers and played about as poorly as anyone could imagine in a deciding game tonight , nothing was there , he added my field goals my free throws they just would n't drop with his inept performance , the knicks' season disintegrated the cause of death was not him alone it was not heart failure nor a severe lack of talent the knicks lost to a better team the indiana pacers will soon give michael jordan his sternest test yet they are a veteran , playoffsavvy club that has at least three good years left conversely , you wonder how many contending years these knicks have left ewing , their leader , will be 36 years old in august , with three years left on his current contract and , ostensibly , his career it was not apparent by the scoring droughts in the second half of game 5 , but he has more help now than when he was in his prime and who can say whether the knicks will contend for a title next season if they trade for a competent point guard and an athletic power forward to give ewing and charles oakley the needed rest \? whining about chris childs s decisionmaking he almost certainly played his last game as a knick and john starks s shot selection is like complaining about cavernous potholes they 're not going to get fixed soon maybe you have to consider it good fortune that the knicks even got this far but as the knicks' 7foot aging star goes home early again , you ca n't help but feel that something other than time is working against him ewing s comeback will be denigrated instead of celebrated now , with everyone complaining that he helped ruin a developing underdog story that is more misguided than his shot was last night instead of the league s marketing department releasing the latest kobe bryant ballet video , it should have filmed the work and diligence that went into rehabilitating ewing s surgically repaired wrist the past four and a half months financially secure superstars refusing to give up that is what the national basketball association should be about but last night brought some of the most disturbing footage of ewing s career he fell for simple pump fakes from the 74 rik smits never a man with great hands , ewing had buttered fingers each time the ball went into the post almost five months after his teammates had done their best to hold down the fort , he came back not as a cavalry , but as a casualty of this trying season first of all , i want to take my hats off to my teammates , he said they had a great year , and they afforded me the opportunity to come back i wish that when i came back i could have been more of a help to them especially tonight he sat down with 461 seconds left after he picked up his fifth foul , with the game out of reach sweat dripped profusely off his brow and his cheeks he looked blankly onto the floor as reggie miller , mark jackson and the pacers began to celebrate last season , it was tim hardaway and alonzo mourning the year before , he draped a towel over his head and led a procession off the united center floor , a victim of jordan and the chicago bulls again reggie in 1995 hakeem olajuwon in 1994 on it goes , a rerun what percent were you \? someone asked does n't matter , ewing replied i'm going home , and they 're moving on this is the fourth straight year the knicks have fallen short in the second round they have a few dozen builtin excuses , none greater than the night ewing tumbled to the floor in agony last december he walked off the floor at market square arena last night with that same , vacant gaze from frustrating seasons past the pacers fan behind the bench was still hollering , patrick , you 'll never get a ring you looked at ewing marching off toward the locker room , and suddenly he was not the guy who fumbled the ball away he was just another beleaguered , beatendown warrior who may never win a championship
nairobi , kenya , aug 11 fbi agents began reconstructing hundreds of pieces of vehicles blown apart by a powerful bomb at the american embassy here last friday , in a painstaking attempt to identify the pickup truck that apparently carried the explosives working on the grounds of a railroad company headquarters across the street from the site , dozens of agents tagged parts and arranged them in a circle kenyan police technicians in white lab coats carried more canisters of debris from the site , which the american experts sifted with rakes for metal parts the federal bureau of investigation declined to comment on its investigation the agents here said they had received orders from washington not to talk to reporters we are not an official presence here , an fbi supervisor said but it was clear that the american agents had in large part taken over the investigation from the kenyan police the local criminal investigations division headquarters was swarming with american lawenforcement officials , who carried computers and other sophisticated equipment into the building at the blast site , the toll continued to rise as workers from israel , france , the united states and kenya continued to pull bodies from the rubble of the sevenstory ufundi cooperative building the building bore the brunt of the explosion , which was aimed at the american mission next door , and collapsed by nightfall , more than 18 mangled bodies had been extracted from the tons of concrete , bringing the death toll here to 217 , kenyan authorities said many of the bodies were found in groups of two or three some were too disfigured to be easily identified another 10 died in the bombing in tanzania as cranes and backhoes ate away at the mountain of rubble , rescue workers said no one was believed to be left alive in either the embassy or the ufundi structure we are getting down to the area now where we have uncovered most of empty spaces and we are getting to compact rubble , capt james chinn of the fairfax county , va , fire department said chances are getting very slim of finding someone alive at this point under a contract with the federal government , a special county team is deployed in cases of disaster , including the oklahoma city bombing the bomb detonated about 10 35 on friday morning in a parking lot behind the embassy the lot is sandwiched between the fivestory mission , the sevenstory ufundi cooperative building and the 22story cooperative house the accounts of witnesses interviewed by news organizations and investigators so far vary wildly in many details , but they agree on a few key points most witnesses say a pickup truck with a covered flatbed made its way past a flimsy crossing gate manned by the cooperative bank s security guards then , according to most accounts , the pickup approached the entrance ramp to the embassy s underground garage , which was staffed by a kenyan guard , and at least one man got out of the truck what happened next is unclear some witnesses recall gunfire others say the attacker hurled an explosive device at the embassy , perhaps a grenade or some other small explosive intended to stun the guards a few seconds later a devastating explosion gutted the rear of the embassy , leveled the ufundi house and damaged buildings in a 200yard radius , united states officials and witnesses said another witness surfaced today at kenyatta hospital douglas sidialo , a 27yearold car salesman who was blinded in the blast , said he saw the pickup enter the parking lot through a gate normally used as an exit to mr sidialo , who was sitting in his car in traffic , it appeared that the truck was trying to force its way through the gate into the embassy parking garage i think the security officers at the american embassy retaliated , he said from his bed i did n't exactly see the retaliation , but i heard the gunshots mr sidialo said he saw a man in a blue uniform with a handheld radio walking calmly away from the pickup just before the explosion then he lost consciousness capt rhyl jones , a british army engineer and explosives expert who was one of the first to arrive on the scene , said the truck carried between 400 and 500 pounds of explosive , judging from the destruction the explosive appeared to be a commercial substance dynamite or a plastic explosive , for instance captain jones said most of the blast went upward but was bounced back toward the embassy by the towering wall of the cooperative house building , whose structure withstood the shock wave if the cooperative building had n't been there , there would have been a bigger space for the blast to dissipate , he said had the bombers managed to gain entrance to the underground parking garage , he said , it would have devastated the embassy building , killing most of the people inside it fbi agents would not comment on what their preliminary analysis of forensic evidence has told them about the bomb but many of the bomb experts working here were also involved in the investigation of the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 , in which 168 people died in that case , investigators discovered the axle of the rented van that carried the bomb the axle bore an identification number that ended up being the crucial piece of information that led to an arrest the search for such evidence can take weeks or months , and none of the lawenforcement officials on site are predicting a quick solution for kenyans , the scale of the tragedy is beginning to sink in some families have begun burying their dead , but there are scores of bodies still lying unidentified in the morgue and the authorities are inundated with requests from frantic people looking for missing relatives , red cross officials said hospitals have issued appeals for blood for the wounded , and have collected thousands of pints , which they say they are screening for the aids virus a sense of hopelessness surrounded the ufundi building today as firefighters brought down body after body on canvas stretchers at 5 pm , the people working on the top of the rubble called for silence and used listening devices and a special television camera on a long pole to check for signs of life inside the mound an expectant hush came over the site after 20 minutes , the people operating the listening equipment slumped in disappointment someone shouted , back to work ! and the heavy machinery ground into motion again but some kenyans refused to give up hope kibera karima , a 47yearold banker , waited all day on the edge of the wreckage of the ufundi building , where his daughter , jacqueline , was attending a secretarial college at the time of the explosion i'm hoping against hope that by some miracle from god , that somehow i'm going to see her rise up wherever she is , he said i 've been here since yesterday afternoon i spent the night here a vigil for my daughter photos more bodies have been pulled from under tons of concrete in nairobi and kenyan authorities have put the death toll in the embassy bombing there at 217 rescue workers removed another body yesterday \( malcolm linton gamma liaison for the new york times \) fbi agents have begun trying to identify the pickup truck used in the attack on the american embassy in nairobi , kenya american investigators inspected wrecked vehicles taken from the blast site yesterday \( associated press \)
there was a time around 1940 , cornelius harper recalls , when he had the uniforms of seven baseball teams hanging in the closet of his stamford home he wore all seven that season for teams that had one thing in common they were all black it was an era when baseball in the united states was strictly segregated one of those seven teams was the stamford royal giants , which drew large , and virtually all black , crowds to its sunday afternoon games at the old yale and towne field on canal street in the south end of stamford in connecticut mr harper also played for for the park city giants in bridgeport , the norwalk community club , the new canaan grays and the greenwich rangers then there were two teams in westchester county i played at least one game just about every day of the week and as many as three on sunday , said mr harper , now 83 years old i loved the game mr harper , who was a powerhitting third baseman and a pitcher , is a guest today at the opening of an exhibition entitled before you can say jackie robinson black baseball in stamford , connecticut and in america in the era of the color line at the stamford historical society on high ridge road in stamford allblack teams like the royal giants and the stamford sentinels \( for which mr harper played after the royal giants folded during world war ii \) as well as the monarchs , an allblack stamford team in the 1920s' , will be among those honored during the exhibition , which will run through may 2 james \( buddha \) scott of stamford , now 85 , was also part of the action in the 1930 s and 40 s there was a lot of betting on the games , and sometimes among the teams , he recalled and when the teams bet , it could be winner take all mr scott , who played with the stamford royal giants , the stamford monarchs and the greenwich rangers , remembered having made as much as 15 a game , a large amount for a semipro player of that era but if we lost the game , i might not make anything , said mr scott who plans to attend today s opening how competitive were those black teams with white teams , mr scott was asked \? well , one year when i played with the greenwich rangers , we did n't lose a single game , he said , and most of the teams we played were white teams assembled and owned by lawrence hogan , a stamford native and professor of history at union county college in cranford , nj , the exhibition focuses mainly on the old negro leagues it has been displayed at the national baseball hall of fame in cooperstown , ny , and as far west as galveston , tex in recent years , mr hogan , who is white , has acquired perhaps the most comprehensive collection of black baseball memorabilia in the united states , short of the negro league museum in kansas city , and , along the way , developed friendships with scores of former negro league players in the negro leagues heyday the 30 s and 40 s a few black players from cuba and some other latin american countries did play professionally in an otherwise allwhite game they included ron teasley , who played for the new york cubans \( who were also known as the cuban all stars \) then there was carlos santiago , who also played for the new york cubans and served as an infielder for the stamford bombers of the shortlived class b colonial league in 1947 mr santiago , who lives in his native puerto rico , was one of six black players the other five were pitchers to play for the bombers that season what made that particularly noteworthy was that in 1947 , the year that jackie robinson broke the major league color barrier , there were only 17 black players among the thousands in the minor leagues meaning that the stamford bombers had more than onethird of the total that , in mr hogan s opinion , makes stamford a particularly appropriate venue for an exhibit on black baseball so , too , does the fact that jackie robinson lived on cascade road in stamford , less than a mile from the stamford historical society , during the last two years of his playing career with the brooklyn dodgers in the mid 1950 s and until his death in 1972 stamford was one of many places in the country where there was a considerable black baseball presence during the time of segregation , said mr hogan , the son of a stamford fireman the stamford royal giants were a good example of that presence also , many of the great negro league teams of the era made appearances in stamford in the late 1930 s , several teams from the negro leagues , which barnstormed around the country playing exhibition games in addition to league games , played local teams at the yale and towne field some players from those teams would not only hit the ball over the left field fence , but over the yale and towne foundry building that was across the street from the field , mr harper recalled then in the 1940 s , negro league teams like the newark eagles , black yankees and homestead grays played exhibition games at mitchell field , across from cummings park in stamford , against a local semipro team , the stamford pioneers , and against stamford s minor league team in the colonial league negro league players who appeared in stamford and elsewhere in the state included the legendary catcher josh gibson , buck leonard and leon day as well as larry doby and monte irvin , who were among the first black players in the major leagues
irving , tex , nov 26 the minnesota vikings have no secret weapon their big play is the bomb every team throws it , but none use it with such devastating results everyone has it in their game plan , but we throw it even when it s covered , said viking quarterback randall cunningham , the highestrated quarterback in the national football league we have guys who are willing to go up and get it the vikings \( 111 \) , who had already clinched a playoff spot , leveled the dallas cowboys \( 84 \) today with their weapon of choice using four touchdown passes of 50 yards or more and a 50yard run by leroy hoard , the vikings left the cowboys in ruins , 4636 , before 64 , 366 in the traditional thanksgiving day game at texas stadium the cowboys had been 2091 in thanksgiving games entering today the rookie receiver randy moss caught three passes for 163 yards , and all three went for touchdowns , of 51 , 56 and 56 yards he also set up a 12yard touchdown run by hoard by getting a 55yard passinterference call in the third quarter moss has the ability to make every deep throw a potential highlight clip on that little hitch that he ran , i was blocking and i heard everybody cheering he was gone , hoard said , referring to moss s third touchdown i did n't know what happened i had to look up at the scoreboard to see the replay of what happened the cowboy cornerbacks are still trying to figure out what happened , and they had advance film on moss and his teammate cris carter , who caught a 54yard touchdown pass dallas did not have cornerback deion sanders in its secondary , because sanders has an injured big toe on his left foot it would have been an interesting matchup between moss and sanders , because sanders has great speed the vikings took advantage of his absence any time you have a premier player like deion out of the game , the dropoff is tremendous , carter said that hurt their defense today and we were definitely on our passing game it s tough for the defense when you 've got 510 defensive backs challenging 63 and 64 receivers moss entered this game with a chip on his shoulder he was still upset with dallas and the other 18 teams that passed on him in last april s college draft many teams deemed moss a risk because his college career was spotted with charges of marijuana possession and assault he was drafted late in the first round by the vikings moss left the field with a scowl on his face and refused to speak to reporters after the game at this point the vikings are happy that moss is on their team his ability has added another dimension to what viking coach dennis green describes as a multidimensional offense i have n't seen a kid come into this league this good ever , said brian billick , who has been with the vikings since 1992 and is the team s offensive coordinator until you 've faced randy , you do n't know how good he is the green bay defensive backs , you could see the looks on their faces like 'i ca n't believe he just made that catch' when we first faced them his size and his speed and his jumping ability you ca n't duplicate that in practice you do n't know what it s like until you face it on the vikings' first three possessions , cunningham threw touchdown passes of 51 yards to moss , 54 yards to carter and 56 yards to moss moss s second touchdown reception gave him 958 yards receiving and helped him break the viking record for most yards receiving by a rookie , which was set in 1976 by sammy white meanwhile , the cowboys got field goals on their first two possessions and quickly found themselves behind by 216 with 2 minutes 41 seconds to play in the first quarter the cowboys were able to take advantage of the fact that the vikings lost running back robert smith to a sprained knee in the second quarter hoard , who is not as swift as smith and likes to run up the middle , replaced him in the lineup without that speedy threat in the backfield the cowboys did not fear the rushing attack and were able to gamble with blitzes against minnesota and knock them out of their offensive rhythm the cowboys' receivers were afflicted with a severe case of the drops , not holding on to six catches they should have made in the first half michael irvin , normally a surehanded receiver , dropped two passes and looked completely out of sync the cowboys displayed their own bigplay capability with a 67yard touchdown pass from troy aikman to receiver patrick jeffers in the second quarter , but the 2point conversion failed after a 45yard field goal by gary anderson with 16 seconds to play in the half , minnesota led by 2412 at the half the cowboys opened the second half with an 11play , 76yard drive that was capped by a 2yard run by emmitt smith , who passed jim brown on the nfl career rushing list during the game , to help make it 2419 vikings sometimes as an offensive unit you have to go punch for punch if you can , emmitt smith said we tried to do that today they got off to a fast start and we hung in there for as long as we could smith s third touchdown of the game , a 4yarder with 1 06 left , tied him with marcus allen for most rushing touchdowns \( 123 \) the cowboys blew a great opportunity late in the third quarter after izell reese intercepted a cunningham pass and returned it to the vikings' 32 the cowboy offense moved the ball to the 17 , and there was nearly a firstandgoal from the 7 after a pass from aikman to receiver billy davis but the play was wiped out when dallas guard flozell adams was penalized for a chop block the 15yard penalty moved the ball to the 32yard line , and dallas wound up settling for a 48yard field goal by richie cunningham that made it 3222 aikman was 34 of 57 for a careerhigh 455 yards photos randall cunningham \( above \)

the sign atop yankee stadium said reassuringly , safe at home , in case fans driving by missed the engineer s decision that their beloved ball park was fit for play it was almost enough to make you forget that the city s first fan , mayor rudolph w giuliani , has suggested spending hundreds of millions for a new stadium , most likely in manhattan for now , the yankees have a place to stay four blocks away , people who cannot make the same claim filed into the city s emergency assistance unit to see if they were sufficiently down and out to qualify for emergency housing for some , their lives are a series of road trips between welfare hotels and the assistance unit they spend a night or two sleeping in chairs or on the floor , then are sent to a hotel for 10 days until investigators decide if they can stay with friends or relatives and deem them ineligible for shelter this cycle can go on four or more times before applicants get their papers in order or get lost while officials debate how many millions , if any , should be spent to replace an existing stadium with one featuring highpriced sky boxes , parents and children at the unit wonder how many trips they must make before they 're given adequate shelter whatever happened to one city , one standard \? it s like , order of importance , said carlos lavezzari , 22 , who arrived at the assistance center for the first time on thursday night with his two young sons a lot of these people are on public assistance that s not a favorable group the system feels they 're mooching and there s not a big urgency to help them the city s policy was established to root out fraud among applicants with suitable housing options this is , after all , the city of a thousand schemes that shelter vacancies and budget surpluses exist indicates that some of this has worked but advocates for the homeless said that the stricter policies have been applied too broadly and quickly families with children are being sent back to live with relatives whose own children were removed by the city because of danger in those households , said steven banks , a legal aid society lawyer who has sued the city over shelter policies and conditions we 're so concerned about the mets and yankees doubling up in one stadium , yet on a nightly basis the city says 10 people should live in an apartment when the landlord and prime tenant wo n't permit it that s what stephanie sloan told investigators during the five trips she has made to the assistance unit along with her 11monthold son , tyrell she was now at the king s inn near la guardia airport , waiting for word on her latest application she held out a letter from her sister , who investigators had insisted could house her i once told you people that my sister stephanie sloan can no longer stay in my apartment , it read my house is overcrowded and i am now expecting a baby ms sloan suffers from seizures her son had a wheezy , wet cough from past bouts with pneumonia and upper respiratory infections it was all documented in other letters my sister keeps saying that i ca n't stay there , but they say the hell with that , she said i'm not going to jeopardize my sister s lease behind my staying there she s saying the city keeps harassing her charlene binard learned this week that she could move from the king s inn to a family shelter in queens before a legal aid lawyer helped her get her papers in order , investigators had told her three times that she could stay with her mother in east harlem her lawyer helped her get letters from the administration for children s services that said such a move would create unsafe and hazardous conditions she had been staying at a harlem hotel in early april the last time she was rejected she and her two daughters took the bus over the 145th street bridge to the emergency assistance unit , walking the last few blocks in the rain she said they got soaked , then slept on the floor on a mat they made from folded blankets the same week she got the news of shelter , her daughter gina , 4 , was admitted to elmhurst hospital with triple pneumonia to me , the eau did this , she said , standing in the pediatric intensive care unit , where gina lay tethered to a monitor each time we slept on that floor what s the connection to the yanks \? none , right \? the banners dangle and flutter outside the bars and souvenir shops on river avenue the fans are cheering and their current home is safe , at least until a new stadium is built time to play hardball
vero beach , fla , march 9 after being limited to five minor league appearances in 1997 while trying to come back from shoulder surgery , paul wilson arrived in camp intent on defying the odds he would make the mets' opening day roster as the fifth starter on manager bobby valentine s pitching staff he would pick up where he once left off a rookie season with the mets in 1996 in which he went a disappointing 512 but at times showed the talent that made him the first pick of the 1994 draft but none of that seems likely to happen any time soon tuesday morning , three days after his second threeinning sting of the spring , wilson will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test on his suddenly sore right shoulder , the same shoulder on which he had arthroscopic surgery in late 1996 to repair a torn labrum i'm as dumbfounded as everyone else is , a very dejected wilson said in port st lucie this morning until i find out something else , i'm going to think it s tendinitis , wilson , a 24yearold righthander , added i have n't thought any negative thoughts all spring and i'm not going to do it now but his body language and subsequent remarks at one point wilson described himself as crushed revealed the mindset of a fearful young man the news about wilson was the latest in a long line of setbacks for three young pitchers around whom the mets thought they would build the team s future bill pulsipher , 24 , has yet to pitch in the major leagues since elbow surgery two years ago , and jason isringhausen , 25 , who missed most of last season because of assorted injuries , is out for this year following elbow surgery and now wilson , who worked as hard as anyone on the team to get ready for spring training , faces an unwelcome visit with dr david altchek , the mets' team physician so badly did wilson want to pitch his way onto the mets' staff , he did not inform valentine and the pitching coach bob apodaca of his discomfort until sunday , when he told them that he had felt pain during a session on the sideline on thursday wilson apparently felt more discomfort in his shoulder while warming up saturday , but it went away and he conducted his second respectable outing of the spring , allowing two runs in three innings to the dodgers but the next morning , he felt pain in the front part of his shoulder while trying to play catch at that point , he stopped keeping his problem a secret today , after the mets had beaten the dodgers here , 64 , in 10 innings , valentine was secondguessing himself about wilson , saying his instincts had told him to take the pitcher out of the game saturday after his second inning of work because wilson seemed to be laboring a bit i should n't have done what i did , whether he got hurt in the third inning of work or not , said valentine , who said he left wilson in because if he was n't injured , there would have been a big todo about him not getting a fair chance to make the team to be fair , valentine had no idea that wilson was hurting he could need a couple of aspirin or an operation , and i dare say it s somewhere in between , valentine said less than real serious \? it could be more than nothing \? it is one player who clearly felt for wilson was pulsipher , who endured a nightmare of his own last season as he descended to the lowest levels of the minor leagues but is now pitching reasonably well there has to be a sick feeling in your stomach on that flight back to new york , pulsipher said i ca n't even imagine what he s going through right now you can tell him all the cliches , like , 'hopefully , it s just tendinitis' but he does n't want to hear that right now i know he s definitely bummed out even though he was almost certain to begin the season at class aaa norfolk , wilson had been impressive in camp since he began throwing from a mound for apodaca on feb 1 after experiencing tightness in his pitching elbow last november during winter league ball in puerto rico , wilson had rested his arm for more than a month he began working hard on redeveloping the leg strength that had accounted for the power and drive that had made him a star at florida state and then led to a quick path to the major leagues nobody works harder , said apodaca , who described himself as devastated by today s developments nobody i 've never had anybody work harder for me you have to drag him away and the results this spring were encouraging there was the increased velocity on wilson s pitches that opened apodaca s eyes from day one there were the good performances in games he was on the right road , apodaca said he had made tremendous progress all he needed was time that s what upsets me inside pitch in their search for a catcher who can hit , the mets are talking to the houston astros about swapping pitcher juan acevedo for tony eusebio eusebio , 30 , who bats righthanded , hit 274 with 1 homer and 18 runs batted in over 60 games last season craig paquette s tworun homer in the top of the 10th inning gave the mets a 64 victory monday on a windy day at dodgertown acevedo , who figures to be traded before opening day , started and allowed a run on two hits in three innings masato yoshii , the favorite to win the fifth spot in the rotation , allowed five hits and two runs in four innings photo the mets' paul wilson s right shoulder , operated on in 1996 , is sore again wilson missed last season \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \)
raleigh , nc , july 3 as lawmakers in washington prepare for a legislative duel over managed care , the issue has begun to shake up a number of political races across the country , none more so than the senate challenge here between a millionaire lawyer and a conservative incumbent back when few candidates were talking about it , john edwards , the democrat who is challenging senator lauch faircloth in one of the year s tightest races , noticed that people got sputtering mad almost every time he mentioned managed care he has n't stopped talking about it since the habit seems to be catching next week , senator faircloth , a republican not prone to talking about health care issues , is expected to release a television advertisement that dives right into the topic the issue just strikes home , mr edwards said about managed care , and he added , it s an issue that is close and personal to them more than any other race in the nation , the matchup between mr edwards and mr faircloth , who is best known for his ties to the business community , has catapulted the debate over managed care into the same electionyear stratosphere as education and social security it has been the focus of campaign television commercials , special interest radio advertisements and countless speeches across north carolina in a year with few zesty causes , overhauling managed care has become a defining campaign issue for a growing number of candidates , mostly democrats candidates are talking about it in georgia , illinois and indiana , among other states but it is the senate race here in north carolina that best mirrors how the issue has unfolded around the nation and on capitol hill , underscoring the differences between the two candidates , the two parties , the two major health care proposals in congress and the special interest groups on both sides of the issue the edwards campaign is one of the more important ones on managed care , said senator bob kerrey , the nebraska democrat and chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee , who visited here to help mr edwards , a wealthy political novice who trounced his opponents in the primary election this is one issue where you can very clearly make your case to a large number of people for democrats , who have watched tobacco virtually disappear as a wedge issue and have seen campaign finance lose its footing , managed care appears to be a pulseracing cause but just how much traction the issue will acquire with voters in the septemberoctober home stretch remains to be seen some of the democrats who have used the issue so far , in california and new mexico , for example , lost their races and republicans are beginning to fight back in the house , speaker newt gingrich is pushing patientprotection legislation the senate is pondering its own plan it s one of the few things that seems to be working this year , said charles e cook jr , a political analyst for the washington journal but i do n't think many people are going to lie across the railroad tracks everyone will be for reform if you handle it carefully , incumbents ought to be able to inoculate themselves for mr edwards and mr faircloth , the issue is on the table already at 45 , mr edwards , a telegenic , spitpolished candidate , ranks among the best personal injury lawyers in the state , so good he made millions in the courtroom , some of those fees in medical malpractice cases his enemy on the campaign trail \( and in the courtroom \) is the insurance industry , which he says fleeces patients and holds lawmakers hostage with their influence portraying himself as an outsider , mr edwards , who so far has put up at least 25 million for his own campaign , has said he will not accept money from political action committees or from lobbyists he has , however , accepted nearly 550 , 000 as of april 15 in individual contributions , mostly from lawyers the principal remedy mr edwards seeks for patients mirrors that of democrats in congress it should be easier for people to sue their hmo s for the improper denial of benefits to drive home his point , mr edwards made managed care a centerpiece of two of the television ads that ran before his may primary i think it just infuriates people that medical decisions , things that affect their lives and their children s lives , are being made by some bureaucrat sitting behind some computer screen up in hartford , conn , mr edwards intoned to his television audience mr edwards s plan makes senator faircloth and the rest of the republican party shudder imagine that , they say , a wealthy trial lawyer advocating lawsuits at first , senator faircloth , a millionaire himself , shuffled his feet a bit over the issue , much like his republican leaders but when the issue touched a populist chord and his opponent turned into a serious , viable candidate , that changed now mr faircloth finds himself in a race so close that former president george bush and his son , george w bush , the popular texas governor , have made appearances here and the national republican senatorial committee is running its first statewide television commercials this year , highlighting mr faircloth s accomplishments democrats think this is one of their best shots at unseating an incumbent republican making sure not to step too harshly on his business constituency , insurance companies among them , mr faircloth , a 70yearold hog farmer , began to address the issue in april , he signed on to a bill that addressed some of the concerns , but without the liability provision , which he says would lead to socialized medicine by driving up costs he helped push legislation that creates a new stamp to benefit breast cancer research , something he mentions regularly and just before the primary , he weighed in with his own television advertisement , drawing attention to mr edwards s profession , one that is widely reviled by republicans john edwards is north carolina s no 1 personal injury lawyer , the ad said he makes millions suing people our hospitals and family doctors so we all pay more for health insurance and medical care sensing either danger or promise , the special interest groups also got in the mix and ran radio advertisements one group , the coalition for health benefits , made up of business organizations and hmo s , ran a second commercial this week , excoriating the democratic proposal and its sponsor , senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts the alliance for good government , a group that counts trial lawyers and educators as its benefactors , ran an ad attacking the coalition in late may there is no indication that the issue will fade with senator kerrey and a couple of doctors by his side last wednesday , mr edwards railed against insurance lobbyists and lear jetriding executives we need to make this law work for the patient , the people of north carolina , he said if they have a senator speaking for them , and not the health insurance industry and hmo s , this will happen the next day , mr faircloth , surrounded by credit union officials , challenged his opponent to sign a pledge never to raise taxes then he turned to managed care it s a major issue , an important issue , one that we will do something about , the senator told reporters but we can do it in a proper manner , without , he added , an inconceivable amount of lawsuits photo john edwards , center , seeking the senate seat held by lauch faircloth of north carolina , at a patients' rights forum along with senator bob kerrey of nebraska

no tengo dinero by los umbrellos may be one of the strangest songs climbing the pop charts it s based on a 1960 s movie melody never on a sunday , by the greek composer manos hadjidakis , produced like a reggae song and topped with spanish lyrics sung by a pair of danish models and an english rap delivered by an exiled african prince originally intended to bring the world together in a pop song and sweep through vacation resorts like a new macarena , no tengo dinero ended up as a hit in america before europe and club med even accepted it the funniest thing with this whole project is that people thought we were a hispanic band when they first heard us so we had a lot of trouble getting into the top 40 because radio is so segmented , said al agami , the band s leader , while on break from filming a video for the single in los angeles none of us really even speak spanish we just wanted to do something that was so much pop , fun and games , but with tongueincheek lyrics on closer examination though los umbrellos like to distance themselves from the disposable europop tag given to their friends and fellow danes aqua \( of barbie girl notoriety \) , in many ways the band is a europop answer to puff daddy in flamenco funk , the title track from its forthcoming virgin album , the band uses a puff daddy technique and layers together different popular songs of the past , taking its chorus from an oldschool rap anthem , in this case the breaks , by kurtis blow its melodramatic version of drive , by the cars , is not all that different from puff daddy s elegiac take on the police s every breath you take and obsession combines the bass line from show me love , by robin s , and extracts of theme from a summer place unlike puff daddy , however , los umbrellos use the world as their canvas it s not just their flamenco interpolation of the breaks , it s also the bossa nova , dub reggae , afropop and spaghettiwestern themes sprinkled throughout the album perhaps the band s personality is best summed up in mr agami s lyric from the song gigolo i can be who i want to be , a desperado loco or elvis presley mr agami traces his musical and stylistic meanderings to his upbringing born in uganda , mr agami , 25 , and his family fled the country for fear of persecution by idi amin and moved to zaire , where his father worked as a financial adviser to the american embassy from there , they moved to denmark , afghanistan , and then back to denmark , where his father is campaigning for the sovereignty of the state of lado in northeast africa my father is an artistic , creative guy , but his mother made him learn about the volatile world that is african politics , mr agami said so i asked my mama , 'what do i do \? ' she said , 'if you do n't like politics , say no' that s the only advice i got , and the best advice i got the first record mr agami ever made was a vaguely political album , which he said was about his situation as a refugee and the idea that you can assimilate and integrate , but you 're always a guest in the years since , mr agami headed different rap and jazz projects in denmark until a friend in television asked him to translate a song by two danish comedians into english several mutations later , it became no tengo dinero and auditions were held to find two female singers , the mellifluously named maibritt grondahl vingsoe and grith hojfeldt he plans to move the band to america after its current tour with the backstreet boys ends i want to break through where nobody said i could , he said i 've done everything that you can do in denmark and gotten my laurels for it the only thing i have n't had is commercial success , which i 've shied away from with los umbrellos that was the challenge can i get both a hit and something i 'll be happy with at the end of the day and so far it s succeeded sounds of silence over from midnovember until earlier this week , there was nobody scheduling concerts at irving plaza , resulting in a very dismal winter for one of manhattan s top rock clubs now , not only has irving plaza announced that concerts will resume there next month , but two organizations consider themselves to be the club s exclusive concert booker the reasons lie in a longstanding rivalry between two concert promoters , john scher and ron delsener , and the new york state supreme court last fall , the lease to irving plaza , which was booked by mr scher s metropolitan entertainment , was sold to mr delsener s concert promotion company , delsener slater enterprises this meant that until mr scher s contract to find bands to perform at the club expired in september 1998 , the two promoters would supposedly be working together this was evidently something mr scher could not stomach , because he soon stopped booking shows into the club and irving plaza went from having 18 to 20 shows a month to 5 in december and none this month \( metropolitan says it has n't been booking shows because it recently discovered a licensing snag that needs to be resolved the club s legal capacity is not 1 , 000 to 1 , 100 , as metropolitan had believed , but 480 to 725 , a spokesman said \) in addition , mr scher sued irving plaza and delsener slater and asked for a preliminary injunction , arguing that the club s assignment of the booking agreement to delsener slater was in violation of its contract with metropolitan last week , a judge ruled against mr scher immediately afterward , delsener slater sent a letter to mr scher that contended his failure to book the club and his taking negative action against it by suing it constituted a breach of contract , thus giving delsener slater the right to book the room delsener slater followed the letter by seeking a temporary restraining order to try to prevent metropolitan from discussing the litigation and booking of irving plaza with third parties on tuesday , a judge ruled against delsener slater it s our position that the booking agreement is still in effect and we 're the party exclusively authorized to book national acts at irving plaza , said eric levine , the senior vice president for operations at metropolitan we reject their unilateral termination of our right as bookers now the two companies have been competing even more fiercely for bands , driving up the prices for performers , with ticket prices sure to follow the club reopens on feb 14 with ska from the pietasters meanwhile , mr scher said he was negotiating for comparablesize room andrew rasiej , the irving plaza coowner who prompted the dispute by selling the club s lease to delsener slater in the fall , said those being hurt the most were the concertgoers in reality , bands are going to want to play the room and fans are going to want to go there because it s a great club , not because of who the promoter is , he said photo al agami of los umbrellos \( robin skjoldborg virgin records \)
doth the woolworth corporation protest a bit too much \? the company , which closed the last of its namesake fiveanddime stores last summer , now gets most of its revenues from its foot locker division , and nike , the leading maker of athletic shoes and clothing , accounts for a big portion of sales in those stores nike has reported several bad quarters and has dragged down much of the athletic market with it yet woolworth s executives keep telling wall street they are undaunted and that the future looks bright investors are on board , having pushed up the stock 31 percent this year to close at 26625 , unchanged , yesterday still , woolworth s sales fell 56 percent last year sales in its stores open at least one year , the best measure of a retailer s health , fell 43 percent 59 percent in the critical fourth quarter alone meanwhile , sales at finish line , just for feet and some other competitors rose when it comes to investor relations , woolworth scores points for damage control last week , when nike announced that its fiscal thirdquarter earnings fell 69 percent because of slumping sales at home and in asia and that it would lay off 7 percent of its global work force , woolworth put out its own cheery announcements a licensing deal to make and sell shoes under the brand name champion , owned by sara lee , and the sale of a handful of nurseries in the silicon valley woolworth no longer reports monthly samestore sales , but has managed to placate wall street stock analysts with news about how it plans to increase its square footage by 20 percent a year for the next few years and how it has budgeted 1 billion to remodel tired stores and open new , bigger ones further , it has been peddling a story to business reporters about its impending name change for several weeks , apparently in hopes of drawing attention away from the real question just how much of nike s pain will woolworth share \? woolworth does not disclose what portion of its sales come from nike merchandise , but analysts and money managers estimate that woolworth controls about 16 percent of the united states athletic footwear market , and about 40 percent of the market for athletic shoes over 40 \( ie nike \) the next biggest footwear merchant , j c penney , claims just 6 percent of the athletic shoe market finish line and just for feet each hold about 3 percent at foot locker stores , footwear makes up roughly 75 percent of the merchandise , with nike representing 30 to 50 percent of that category , investors estimate this hardly represents immunity to nike , which conceded last week that earnings would not improve until the 1999 fiscal year calls to the office of the chairman and chief executive , roger n farah , were not returned changes are afoot , though , at woolworth s athletic division , including foot locker , lady foot locker , kid s foot locker and champs stores in remodeled stores , nike is not front and center , but other hot fashion brands like vans and timberland woolworth is also working to freshen its apparel merchandise , a weak portion of the athletic store business many athletic retailers have given lip service to better clothing but woolworth is one of the few run by a highly regarded merchant , mr farah , formerly of r h macy company and other stores investors say that remodeled stores are outperforming expectations what is more , the company has done a good job with its balance sheet when mr farah took the helm in 1994 , the company was teetering under a load of debt it now has virtually none selling , general and administrative costs fell to 232 percent of sales last year from 244 percent of sales in 1996 , even as the company expanded stores taking advantage of cash flow , woolworth has made acquisitions to strengthen its lead the company , which is expected to announce a new sporty name the first week of april , has acquired eastbay inc , an athletic goods catalogue business , and athletic fitters , a regional chain with stores in the west and midwest and the company s mall stores that do not sell athletic goods have been pared down to the best and brightest what is more , investors give mr farah and his company high marks for the plan to increase sales space by 20 percent a year for three years , arguing that even if samestore sales are flat , there will be revenue growth i think he has done a very good job with the company , said william sams , a portfolio manager for first pacific advisors in dallas before he got there , they were in real serious trouble with shortterm debt , and when he got in there , it was worse than he thought it did n't take him long to get the debt down and on a positive note for all retailers , nike has begun offering special deals and better allocations of once scarce merchandise woolworth should benefit the most , given its vast business in the past with the sneaker company but if woolworth s primary strategy is to fill its stores with brands like vans and timberland , those nike deals may prove illusory and while adding stores and brightening old ones are often easy ways to please wall street , woolworth is hardly alone in its growth plans susan silverstein , a retail analyst at nations bank montgomery securities , expects the top six athletic footwear retailers to increase their square footage by 20 percent in 1998 , on top of a 21 percent increase last year if investors believe in mr farah , and those who remember his federated days have good reason to , woolworth s stock still looks cheap at about 14 times trailing earnings but while america returns to shoes as diverse as candies and timberland in what have been traditionally considered athletic apparel stores , woolworth will probably continue to smart from nike s woes they are trying to diversify by adding privatelabel exclusives and other nontraditional athletic brands , ms silverstein said but nonetheless nike is still half the athletic footwear business and athletic footwear , no matter what the company s name , is what the market believes woolworth is about graph rebound the woolworth corporation s stock has bounced back this year , up 31 percent graph tracks the company s daily closes , since september 1997 \( source bloomberg financial markets \)
in the scattered cities of niger , they have talk radio of a different kind it s more like walkin radio on saturday and sunday mornings , farmers and merchants and homemakers gather outside the independent stations run by radio anfani in niamey , maradi and zinder to await the start of a twohour program they want to talk about their children s health or the price of tomatoes or the latest decree of the military government of ibrahim bare mainassara they want to talk about some of the news broadcast by radio anfani , like reports translated from voice of america or the german service deutsche welle we do n't take telephone callers and put them on the air , explained gremah boucar , the director general of radio anfani those who own telephones , he explained , are automatically considered rich , and it should n't be such a small circle of people doing the talking for a fee equivalent to about 1 a year not so small in a country where per capita share of the gross domestic product is 200 a year listeners can join radio anfani s club , which has 36 , 000 members membership lets them talk to listeners and suggest programming changes or otherwise object to the material the stations broadcast the only way to really be free is to accept criticism , mr boucar said in niger , a landlocked country of 10 million people without don imus , rush limbaugh , howard stern , arbitron ratings or democracy , radio is a truly intimate medium when people want to talk , they walk in and talk when the military sorry , maybe it was just people in stolen military uniforms wants to close down a station , it storms in and smashes the equipment when people who control the military or the police want to lodge a complaint about his news broadcasts , they take gremah boucar from home , stuff him in a bag , throw him on a flatbed truck and spend hours discussing how to kill him mr boucar , a 39yearold who saw a journalist for the first time when niger s president came to his village of mainesoroa 30 years ago , is about as distant from new york s and washington s brand of journalism as possible his country is remote and obscure , often confused with its richer and more populous neighbor , nigeria his medium is radio in the archipelago of settled communities in africa , it is more ubiquitous and influential than any newspaper he and his editorial committee create their 20houraday schedule with a practical eye they produce programs on health \( ways to prevent aids or diarrheal illness in infants \) , the economy \( the price of food \) and politics \( including pronouncements of mr mainassara s political opponents \) mr boucar s attitude toward his profession carries none of the overt cynicism about the business that tends to permeate discussions in this country it seems to me that journalism goes with democracy , he said to practice journalism , therefore , is to give life to democracy my moral obligation , he calls it such earnest simplicity can veer into the dreaded realm of platitude but that is a risk the committee to protect journalists is willing to take when it gives out its international press freedom awards at its annual dinner last week , the group honored mr boucar and four other journalists , from indonesia , peru , belarus and eritrea , who have been persecuted , arrested , tried and otherwise hindered by governments that have little history of or tolerance for a free press it was an occasion for some of the profession s most accomplished or just plain famous members to take a quick refresher course in the underpinnings of the business sure , like any occasion that mixes professional pride with expensive food , tuxedos and celebrity , it had its tom wolfish moments \( what to do \?

united nations , oct 30 private aid groups , currently sending millions of dollars worth of food and medicine to relieve starvation and suffering in sudan , are pressing the united nations to make a vigorous new effort to end the nearly 30year civil war there instead of merely feeding its victims this week , top officials from oxfam , save the children fund , care international and doctors without borders pressed their case for a new united nations peace effort at a meeting with the 15 members of the united nations security council the encounter was only the second time the panel had agreed to meet with private aid organizations what we are saying is that this is unacceptable , david r w bryer , director of oxfam united kingdom and ireland , said in an interview the war has been going on since the 1960 s political action is needed and that is why we are here afterward , several agencies said they believed that the security council , which has shown little interest in the sudanese crisis in the past , would now become more active we have a commitment the security council will take up sudan , said guy tousignant , secretary general of care international raymond c offenheiser , president of oxfam america , said , we all feel strongly that the council is now ready to move on sudan on tuesday , the day after the meeting , the united nations announced that kieran prendergast , under secretary general for political affairs , will visit sudan and other countries in the region next month in an effort to revive peace efforts still , diplomats were cautious there were no conclusions , said sweden s deputy permanent representative , per norstrom , chairman of the meeting it s more that perhaps some seeds were sown oxfam s representatives also met with secretary general kofi annan and the aid groups spent much of the week lobbying other senior united nations officials as well as the representatives of the countries scheduled to join the security council next year as rotating members in their presentation to the security council the four aid groups said that operation lifeline sudan , the ambitious relief effort they and more than 30 other similar groups started more than a decade ago , has now been reduced to an expensive airlift because continued fighting has cut the road , rail and river supply routes they originally planned to use these groups now want the united nations to persuade the sudanese government and the rebels of the sudan people s liberation army to extend a temporary ceasefire agreed to in the province of bahr elghazal to all of southern sudan and maintain it throughout next year unless that happens , they warn that both sides may just withdraw their forces from the province and step up fighting in other parts of the country but they are not hopeful , warning that the government and the rebels have settled into a brutal routine of accepting limited ceasefires which 'buy time' for both sides peace efforts organized by a regional organization called the intergovernment authority on development achieve little for the fundamental reason that both the government and the spla act as though their interests are better served by war than peace but none of the organizations are willing to suspend relief operations , although critics have argued that the outside aid may be helping to prolong the war this is not an option far too many people would die , said mr tousignant of care international

life as a caretaker to her infirm but ironwilled mother in rural ireland , is offered a last chance at love but mr mcdonagh and the director , garry hines , are masterly at building up and subverting

the white house used to dismiss johnny chung as a hustler whose prodigious political fundraising in 1996 was illegal but harmless now , in a breakthrough for the justice department s investigation of the campaign scandals , mr chung has admitted that a large portion of the money he raised for the democrats originated with the people s liberation army in china the first hard evidence of the china connection to the last presidential campaign should compel attorney general janet reno to move at last for the selection of an independent prosecutor even more important , it obliges the administration to come forward with a full explanation of whether any campaign contributions were connected to its decision in 1996 to loosen controls over the sharing of military technology with china mr chung , an american born in taiwan , is the first of several indicted democratic party fundraisers to cooperate with investigators and name the mysterious sources of his money he has quite a story to tell the times reported on friday that mr chung said a large portion of the nearly 100 , 000 he gave to the democrats in the summer of 1996 came from the chinese military he has identified the conduit as a chinese aerospace executive , based in hong kong , who is also the daughter of gen liu huaqing , who was china s top military commander at the time there is no evidence that anyone in the clinton administration or the democratic party knew where mr chung s money was coming from but mr chung was widely known as a suspicious character with a habit of dropping by the white house with business clients , often after making large donations in 1995 , president clinton spotted him bringing chinese business associates to one of his radio addresses and told an aide afterward that it should not have happened nevertheless , a year later , after writing a generous check to the democrats , mr chung showed up at a california fundraising dinner with general liu s daughter she also got a photograph with mr clinton as a memento the white house now says the 1996 meeting was clearly not appropriate but it happened because campaign fundraising in that period overwhelmed all other considerations , including common sense it is also not clear what motivation the chinese may have had in funneling money into mr clinton s reelection campaign through mr chung but in the last few years , mr clinton has taken several steps to relax controls on the export of technology to china , and the beneficiaries of this relaxed policy included general liu and the company where his daughter works two american corporations allegedly involved in a breach of security in transferring missile technology to china , loral space and communications and hughes electronics , have themselves been major donors to the democrats all the disclosures about mr chung , other contributors and their links to china make it clearer than ever that attorney general reno needs to transfer the justice department s investigation to an independent counsel the administration maintains that none of its policy decisions resulted from campaign money but the white house was intensively involved in fundraising at the highest levels , and only an inquiry led by someone other than a political appointee of the president will satisfy the public but it is also important to remember that these abuses occurred because democrats and republicans exploited a giant loophole in the campaign finance laws , raising millions of dollars in unlimited soft money from corporations , unions and rich donors this week , the house is expected to open debate on reform legislation sponsored by christopher shays of connecticut and martin meehan of massachusetts that would ban soft money contributions to parties all the lawmakers who have deplored the abuses of the last election must rally behind a measure that can prevent their recurrence investigating past excesses will be an empty exercise if congress fails to clean up an inherently corrupt system
the archivist by martha cooley 328 pp boston little , brown company 2295 matthias lane , a reclusive widower in his 60 s , is an archivist at a university library the jewel of his collection is a set of letters that t s eliot wrote to his friend emily hale over a 20year period letters that hale bequeathed to the library , provided that they be kept sealed until the year 2020 near the beginning of martha cooley s absorbing first novel , the archivist , matthias receives a visit from a graduate student named roberta spire , who requests access to the letters she suspects they may have something to teach her about the experience of conversion when eliot was writing steadily to hale , he was experiencing great upheavals in his life his wife , vivienne , became increasingly emotionally troubled and was eventually committed to a sanitarium , where she remained until her death , and eliot converted to the church of england roberta believes that his conversion was an act of frightened selfprotection , that he fled from the turbulence of life with vivienne into a condition of complete simplicity represented by the church roberta s interest in conversion is allconsuming she is one of those people , cooley writes , who are impelled by one preoccupation that shapes nearly everything they think , do or imagine her parents were german jews who survived world war ii in hiding after immigrating to america , they did everything they could to forget their past , finally going so far as to convert to christianity roberta , who finds her parents' conversion an enraging act of denial , has become obsessed with understanding its psychological sources and consequences matthias refuses her request the archives remain sealed but , fascinated by roberta s intensity , he continues to meet with her , and the two of them enter into a friendship that moves and unsettles him for matthias , the young woman s questions come uncomfortably close to home , and they lead him to reexamine the most painful chapter of his own past after the end of the war , as the horrors of the holocaust became fully known , matthias s wife , judith , fell into the grip of a sort of political despair she increasingly devoted her life to documenting the nazi atrocities she became an archivist of evil her selfimposed task overwhelmed her after repeated breakdowns , she allowed matthias to persuade her to enter a psychiatric institution , where she lived for five years before committing suicide matthias now blames himself for maintaining such emotional distance from his wife during her tortured last years what s called love is really an empathetic and hungry imagination , cooley writes one must be willing to enter other stories even terrifying or dangerous ones unable to enter his wife s story , matthias abandoned judith , just as eliot abandoned vivienne i was too afraid of her , he says , of her fierceness of everything she was capable of seeing and feeling to love her sufficiently although the archivist takes place on an intimate stage no more than two or three characters are typically present in a scene the narrative poses large questions should art and religion seek to console us for the world s evils or to sharpen our awareness of them \? where do we draw the line between our obligation to remember a terrible past and our desire to rid ourselves of its burdens \? once one has become aware of the existence of radical evil , how should one conduct one s life \? most of the novel is narrated by matthias , and with utter persuasiveness cooley captures his cautious , scrupulous , restrained and intelligent voice yet her success comes at a cost matthias is a man who holds life at arm s length , and his descriptions of his past are distanced and indirect judith , he tells us , was ferociously funny , but we see no examples of her wit she registered the horrors of the war not in words but in actions , but matthias does little to illustrate this we hear about judith s descent into despair , but we do n't really experience it the long middle section of the novel consists of a diary kept by judith during her hospitalization judith is a woman who has been made inconsolable by history for her , the holocaust has blotted out all possibility of personal happiness has made the very idea of personal happiness seem obscenely trivial she refuses to turn away from the barbarities , refuses to forget them even for a moment cooley has an uncanny ability to put herself into the minds of widely different characters judith s voice is completely distinct from matthias s , but just as expertly rendered yet here , too , the story unfolds in a rather abstract way during her fiveyear confinement , judith receives visits from matthias , her aunt and her uncle , and spars with her psychiatrist , a wellmeaning but uncomprehending man who believes that her unhappiness has its source in familial rather than historical tragedies none of these people are able to grasp what judith is going through cooley makes their incomprehension psychologically plausible , but by providing judith with no worthy interlocutors with no one who understands her well enough to argue with her in an interesting way and by restricting judith s diary to a period in which she is living in a kind of solitary confinement , cooley deprives herself of the chance to dramatize vividly judith s plight but any novel that attempts so much will fall short in some ways the wonder is how well cooley has succeeded the archivist treats serious questions in a humane and passionate manner , and leaves one thinking about these questions long after one has read the last page cooley is an accomplished stylist there s scarcely a graceless or unintelligent sentence in the book and a subtle chronicler of the inner life she has given us something valuable and rare a thoughtful and wellwritten first novel , suffused with intellectual and moral integrity drawing

paris there are three good reasons for despising the thugs , the mostly english thugs , who ran wild in marseilles the other day and who are lying in wait to do it again the first reason to despise them is that they despise us they are sociopaths , not stupid , and they mean to attack the helpless , throw society into chaos they just happen to choose soccer for their cover the second reason to despise the thugs is that they are used as an excuse to scorn soccer back in the states apparently it is easier for television news editors and newspaper headline writers to document english criminals and racists than it is to portray nigerians running the fast break or brazilians charming the host country the third reason to despise the thugs is that they jeopardize the carnival mood of this world cup the organizers in toulouse have had to cancel their summersolstice music festival sunday night because they fear the jackals waiting in the weeds for the next england game on monday what a shame , because the hosts have planned such nice parties the other day i went to copacabana beach in nantes , the old city on the loire estuary , where hosts trucked in tons of sand so young people could play beach soccer , so elegant women from cameroon could sell tshirts and artwork , so moroccan entrepreneurs could sell middle eastern sweets out in the main square , there was a motorcade of moroccan fans \( men and women together \) , horns honking , flags waving , marching and cheering , joined by brazilians and japanese and french and scots and americans and cameroonians , all linking arms meanwhile , in marseilles , they were cleaning up the mess from their english visitors , who had gone into that hard southern port city , looking to stir up trouble among the large middle eastern community do n't get this wrong these marauders are not homeless or jobless or marginal people a number of studies have shown that these are men from their teens into their 40 s who work all week while plotting militarystyle maneuvers , trapping and wounding blacks or pakistanis or indians or jews or women or some toff whose face annoys them i could guess the cause the monarchy , the nonetoosubtle divisions of accent and school and neighborhood and ancestry the louts are encouraged by the murdochian tabloids , where anything goes , with their headlines about treacherous froggies , with the message that it is all right to go over there and bash heads any american knows we 've got more than our share of malevolence back home , but nobody has ever linked one sport with planned violence it is not the fault of the sport itself , obviously , but the question is , can these people be identified and stopped \? while marseilles was trembling , the english sent over a security official who spoke excellent french and lectured on the rights of man , on liberte , fraternite , egalite i almost expected him to break out singing the marseillaise in a way , he was right in the new european community , people can cross the old borders with fewer restrictions than the past , the price for cheaper wine and cheese after several decades of death and violence around soccer games , english officials have tried to limit the most notorious thugs from traveling , but it s not working , or else the malaise is deeper than they imagined soccer officials cannot very well ban the english team from major tournaments , although it was a stroke of luck having them fail to qualify for the 1994 world cup in the united states there is one immediate way the world soccer community might get the attention of england , currently the favorite to hold the 2006 world cup it is time for the global referee to brandish a yellow warning card at the rogue and say you are booked , sir any further infractions and you will be dispatched there are other candidates for 2006 germany , south africa , australia i say it s too soon to give the world cup back to europe , and south africa could be unstable after the mandela era australia is a good alternative , and the yobs could not just hop a ferry or a train and be at the world cup in a few hours the multinational sneaker companies might also consider their wonderful images , and threaten to cut off sponsorships if the english cannot control their own do i really think a yellow card would stop the savages \? no , not really but a red card would make the 2006 world cup safer from these thugs , to allow the brazilians and the moroccans and all the other joyous fans to link arms and dance in the streets , the way they do on copacabana beach in nantes
back in 1828 , when president john quincy adams was running for reelection , supporters of andrew jackson felt compelled to find some way to undermine the incumbent s reputation as a terrific diplomat they settled on spreading a story that adams , who had served as ambassador to russia , had gotten on the czar s good side by offering up his children s nanny as a royal mistress it was not a very convincing story anyone who looks at adams s portrait will instantly perceive that this was no goodtime charlie but the president was called the pimp of the coalition throughout the campaign , and when jackson won , he made the editor who invented the slander part of his kitchen cabinet the moral of this story is that there are negative campaigns and then there are really , really negative campaigns this year s senate race in new york strikes some voters as pretty deep in the mud representative charles schumer has been calling senator alfonse d'amato a liar on every channel in the state , and mr d'amato has been telling upstate voters that mr schumer cares more about mongolia than he does about them this weekend mr schumer unleashed a new ad called mother in which the narrator starkly announces that d'amato opposes abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest , even if the mother would die but on a scale of 1 to 10 , this one hardly registers a 6 \( a 10 would be the effort in 1856 to depict the republican presidential candidate as a cannibal \) the defining adjective for the d'amatoschumer battle is actually not negative but close most polls show mr d'amato and mr schumer running neckandneck , a condition that tends to bring out the vicious streak in any candidate close and mean is better than a gentlemanly runaway any day gov george pataki is miles ahead in the polls , and his ads are so sunny they might be mistaken for margarine commercials his campaign consultants spent years training to be political road warriors , and now they 're stuck doing walt disney , rolling out one production after another in which mr pataki appears surrounded by children and scenic vistas if his lead gets any wider , he will approach the camera with a puppy at his feet and the bluebird of happiness circling overhead the d'amatoschumer contest , meanwhile , is a sort of steel cage match of politics , in which the last guy standing wins mr schumer s too many lies campaign was fairly effective mr d'amato s gray ethical aura is his weakest spot but the lying the ad referred to was actually just mr d'amato s habit of fluffing up his own reputation and calling his opponents liberal the hypercynical voting public expects lie to means something like concealing a criminal record or a couple of surplus wives after casting about from one insult to another liberal did n't work , from brooklyn was only soso mr d'amato fell back on the classic ploy of adding up mr schumer s missed votes as in the andrew jackson campaign , mr d'amato s strategists wanted to undermine their opponent s proudest boast , and mr schumer is running on his reputation as an effective legislator the attack was trivial you can skip quite a lot in washington without missing anything but it was fair mr schumer missed the votes , and he has to accept the consequences none of this stuff would get a mention in the annals of low moments in political history it does not even rank very high this year , when one illinois gubernatorial candidate is basically calling another a murderer , and in south carolina , senator ernest hollings just had to apologize for saying his opponent was a expletive deleted skunk but with just two weeks to go until the election , new yorkers deserve something substantial , even if it is delivered in the rhetorical equivalent of a screech mr schumer s new ads , while rough , hit an important issue , since polls show most voters do not know that mr d'amato is a staunch opponent of abortion but the lifeofthemother element is a bit of a stretch it is based mainly on mr d'amato s 1983 vote for a constitutional amendment that would put the abortion issue back under the control of the states mr d'amato s office did not return calls about the content of his upcoming ads \( the senator has been avoiding me ever since the 1980 campaign , when i asked him to name the last five books he had read \) but we are eagerly awaiting the next volley it has been a long time since new york has hosted an election in which we did not know the name of the winner weeks before the first absentee ballot hit the mails it is worth hearing a lot of nasty commercials to get a contest in which everyone can imagine that his vote might really count

frankfurt , feb 8 europe s lovehate relationship with hollywood veered back toward hostility last week , when a european commission antitrust official moved to break up a joint distribution company here owned by three big american movie studios the attack infuriated the three studios paramount , owned by viacom inc mca , owned by the seagram company , and metrogoldwynmayerunited artists which together account for as much as 20 percent of the boxoffice sales in europe but the move also highlighted an important longterm change that has complicated the longrunning european angst about the dominance of american entertainment despite continued resentment in many quarters about the invasion of movies like disney s hunchback of notre dame , european demand for hollywood s output is soaring multiscreen suburban movie complexes have become a hit in many countries , and american releases account for as much of threequarters of their revenues american books , in translation , dominate the bestseller lists in most countries and the expansion of digital television has led to fierce bidding wars for payperview broadcasting rights from american studios the trend is not accidental the underlying direction of policy at the european commission has moved toward forcing more open competition on every part of the economy media included torn between promoting national cultures and open markets , the muchmaligned eurocrats generally push for the latter more often than not , american suppliers of entertainment have been big beneficiaries but the tensions are real on thursday , europe s minister of competition , karel van miert , announced that he wanted to revoke an exemption that had been issued to united international pictures , a european distribution company owned by paramount , mca and mgm uip has been operating in europe since 1989 under an exemption to a european law that prohibits any agreements that potentially restrict competition uip sells movies from the three studios to theaters around europe , allowing the studios to save money by sharing the costs of a joint distribution organization hollywood s other big studios disney , warner brothers and twentieth century fox distribute their movies in europe independently mr van miert remained vague about his objections to uip , but neither he nor other officials in brussels have argued that the company did anything wrong rather , they say that europe has simply not received much benefit a key issue , according to both industry and commission officials , is that uip is not doing as much to promote european movie producers as they had hoped in winning its legal exemption in 1989 , uip agreed to distribute at least some movies from european studios but officials close to mr van miert said that nonstudio european movies accounted for only 1 percent of all the movies that uip distributed by contrast , they said , locally made movies in european countries accounted for 14 percent to 24 percent of boxoffice sales recently , we have come to the conclusion that we do n't have to tolerate it , mr van miert said on thursday commission officials quietly rebutted press reports on friday that uip was suspected of an anticompetitive practice known as block booking the term refers to a practice of forcing theaters to accept unpopular movies as a condition for getting the big hits on friday , however , officials told reporters in brussels that they had no evidence of blockbooking rather , they emphasized the fact that uip had done very little to distribute european movies that did not come from the three studios they also argue that the movietheater industry has become more vibrant in the last several years , as entrepreneurs have built appealing complexes that offer moviegoers a big choice , big screens and big sound therefore , they said , the need to give uip an exemption had diminished brian reilly , executive vice president of uip , said his company would fight the decision on the grounds that the company had lived up to its end of the deal mr reilly said that european inspectors had raided several uip offices in 1996 , looking for evidence of anticompetitive behavior , but had made no accusations he also said uip had distributed 227 european movies since 1989 , although he did not rebut european complaints that these movies accounted for only a minuscule share of its total boxoffice revenue we agreed that we would make our distribution organization available for european products , contingent on our commercial judgment , he said we feel we have fully met our commitment if mr van miert gets his way , the three hollywood studios will have to set up separate distribution organizations mr reilly warned that this would greatly increase their costs , ultimately leading to higher ticket prices uip will have a chance to rebut mr van miert s objections , but it will have a difficult time prevailing over the longer term , mr van miert s policies have clearly benefited american suppliers of entertainment a toughminded and powerful crusader against trade barriers within europe , he has pushed relentlessly for competition in the growing field of digital television in germany , he has raised objections to a potentially monopolistic alliance between deutsche telekom , the telephone and cable company , and the two most powerful media conglomerates , kirch group and bertelsmann ag in spain , he has forced the government to retreat from measures aimed at shoring up the power of a governmentbacked media consortium at the expense of a competitor controlled by grupo prisa and canal plus sa of france those policies kicked off a brutal bidding war for rights from american studios last year that were ultimately sold for hundreds of millions of dollars the brusselsbased competition authorities are also carving new inroads in publishing several weeks ago , mr van miert formally announced plans to challenge pricefixing practices among german and austrian book sellers the practices have been defended as a protection for small publishers and local culture , because the higher prices theoretically allow bookstores to keep slowmoving titles on their shelves but mr van miert is having none of it if he prevails , and the local publishers are correct about the implications , publishers of john grisham and tom clancy are likely to be among the winners
moscow , aug 21 the man who climbed atop a tank and led russia out of communism in 1991 has scarcely been seen in public since his country s financial markets and its currency fell off a cliff last week the big question for him and for the reforms he champions is whether russians any longer care president boris nikolayevich yeltsin , already deeply unpopular , now seems to have sunk even lower in political and public esteem than his country s ruble the duma , russia s lower house of parliament , voted 245 to 32 today to ask him to resign newspapers are savaging him with headlines like , the devaluation of the president political experts say the week s events all but abort prospects that mr yeltsin , now 67 , might seek a third term in 2000 his top aides , a bestandbrightest crew widely admired abroad , are now so tarred by failure at home that their own political prospects are slight in fact , there is nobody on russia s political horizon who embraces the mr yeltsin s westernized brand of economic policy and just as important has a siberian snowball s chance of winning a presidential election there is nobody to continue the reforms , said otto latsis , the deputy editor of the newspaper noviye izvestia and a highly regarded political analyst we can only pin our hopes on some semimiracle that , in two years , russia s savior may emerge mr latsis and others are quick to stress that predicting russia s future is a fool s job , and that mr yeltsin has risen from the dead before still , this week s effective devaluation and plan to recast the terms of debt payments almost certainly will mean inflation , recession and less government revenue at a time when russians are clamoring for stability , growth and billions of rubles in back wages and pensions none of that bodes well for marketstyle reforms or their proponents to the contrary , political experts say the crisis has strengthened the two leftofcenter politicians already regarded as the early presidential frontrunners aleksandr i lebed , the former general who now governs the vast siberian region of krasnoyarsk , and yuri m luzhkov , the canny mayor of moscow both men are strongwilled , even authoritarian rulers though mr lebed can be unpredictable , both lean less toward free markets than toward centralized control of the economy mr luzhkov has a smooth political style mr lebed is rougheredged but trying hard his aides are discussing political and economic cramming sessions with officials at harvard university neither would be a president even remotely like the mercurial but steadfastly westernoriented mr yeltsin nor would the other major contender , gennadi a zyuganov , the communist who ran second behind mr yeltsin two years ago two other assumed candidates , viktor s chernomyrdin and grigory a yavlinsky , are more reformminded , but neither has a large following mr chernomyrdin also suffers because he was mr yeltsin s prime minister during the birth of the policies that led to this month s economic catastrophe today , at the start of an emergency session on the fiscal crisis , duma members put aside mr yeltsin s demands to overhaul the country s gordian tax system and spent several hours flaying him and his advisers i think it would be a blessing if yeltsin and his entourage resigned voluntarily , mr zyuganov said prime minister sergei v kiriyenko gave no quarter warning that the nation s financial crisis has just begun , he said mr yeltsin s team cannot afford the luxury of being a popular government i am criticized on the ground that the government has no political support that is true , he said but let us honestly admit that there is no political force in the country which is prepared to assume the responsibility for the economy with elections not far off mr kiriyenko explicitly included the duma among those forces , noting that parliament had refused mr yeltsin s pleas to raise taxes or reorder spending this summer , even though the government s debt payments alone were running 11 billion rubles a month above its income mr yeltsin , on vacation for five weeks now , has struck a strange pose through all this almost a week ago , in the town of novgorod , he thundered that the ruble would not be devalued and that he would not cut short his rest to return to moscow because that would be viewed as evidence of a disaster within hours , both events came to pass one newspaper account of his visit to a novgorod factory described mr yeltsin as confused , tempestuous and , at one point , gasping for air atop other reports , including his seeming infirmity at last month s funeral for the longdead czar nicholas and a visit to sweden notable for his misstatements , the weekend appearance raised new questions about his health and command of events the president seemed generally serene today in his only other recent public appearance , to oversee naval maneuvers off the arctic circle town of severomorsk he literally waved away the duma s request that he quit , saying the legislators did not appear to understand that russia needs a president some outsiders say that while mr yeltsin still holds the reins , able to veto his aides , he obviously has lost steam it seems clear that yeltsin has never been weaker , said rory macfarquhar , a political scientist at the russian european center for economic policy in moscow it s clear he s confused he s not in a position to throw his weight around for reformers , the problem is that mr yeltsin , for all his problems , remains the weightiest force they have without his active support , it s hard to imagine the reformers' making any serious changes , mr macfarquhar said change is what they now need besides pushing the duma into approving tax increases , the yeltsin government needs , in western economists' view , to rein in a banking system controlled by some of the country s most powerful figures and supported by parts of the bureaucracy both moves could be crucial to the economic course now and crucial to public opinion in the next election the question is whether a weakened mr yeltsin can or will push them photos president boris n yeltsin , little seen in public lately , posed for a snapshot with sailors at the arctic circle port of severomorsk yesterday \( reuters \) president boris n yeltsin yesterday as he left the nuclear cruiser

houston when i was in college i helped found a literary magazine that had no editors actually , two of us were given that title , but it was purely honorific we held no more sway than anyone else on the staff as for naming an editor in chief we were having none of that it was hierarchical and patriarchal twenty years later , our militant egalitarianism seems not only dated but also quaint , like a typewritten letter college students in today s boom economy show little interest in sharing the glory instead , like their elders in business , government and academia , they have embraced the cult of leadership the internet currently lists nearly 5 , 000 matches for leadership programs they range from the university of minnesota s leaderquest , which strives to develop student understanding and application of leadership theory and practice , to the programs offered at the banff center for management in canada , where senior leaders explore their leadership styles and requisite competencies , focusing on managing change and reengineering processes the skills are described so nebulously that they could apply to working the cash register , but never mind soggy , directionless prose is a hallmark of leadership mania your 1990 s big shot would never do anything so pointatopointb as , say , cross the rubicon she is much more likely to create value in an increasingly technoglobal society through outcomesbased decision making the most depressing aspect of this woolly hierarchyspeak is how it has seeped out of the world of business and management where you might expect it and into daily life parents who agree to organize the pta carnival are no longer goodnatured helpers , but volunteer leadership youngsters seeking summer jobs at the pool prepare themselves through courses in lifeguarding and leadership their athletic peers don shoulder pads and jog off to football and leadership camp all this attention to life at the top begs a number of questions as garry wills notes in his book , certain trumpets the call of leaders , published in 1994 , the ideal seems to be a world in which everyone is a leader but who would be left for them to be leading \? the assumption that meaningful existence occurs only at the summit , preferably a corporate one , ignores how many endeavors \( writing , painting , software design , among others \) require the ability to work in solitude rather than command a platoon and it undercuts the importance of essential nutsandbolts jobs like teaching , nursing and playing backup at a recording session finally , as mr wills also points out , nobody assumes leadership unless others agree to become followers the truth is that the majority of us end up as members in good standing of the hoi polloi leadership courses notwithstanding , most recent college graduates do n't step right into the corner office many never will , despite the injunction \( repeated this spring by every college president in america \) that they are the leaders of tomorrow , the rulers of all they survey at last the suspicion dawns that leadership is not what it used to be it s no longer crossing the rubicon , or even the street once you read the fine print , some of the university leadership programs boil down to teaching students to get along with other people , to use their time wisely and to try to grow up an acceptance of conformity of going along to get along can be assumed doubtless , the popularity of these programs speaks to the same urge for security that has today s collegians flocking to study subjects that promise a comfortable financial return compared with the playitsafe attitudes of these future leaders , the idealism of my fellow college literati seems admirable , in a confused way we managed to publish our magazine only twice it could have been a lot better , too , especially if somebody had taken charge but our reticence has its own nostalgic value , as a relic of a time when people were willing to act , instead of wanting only to direct drawing \( richard mcguire \)

washington , feb 1 electronic dawn broke in the capital shortly after 8 am today when tim russert , the moderator of meet the press , looked up grinning at the approach of his first guest and posed the burning question about the most ubiquitous talking head in the frenzied sexscandal investigation who \? ginsburg \? who s ginsburg \? of course , william h ginsburg needs no introduction now , two weeks after the california lawyer arrived here as a beltway nobody to defend monica s lewinsky in the criminal inquiry into president clinton s behavior after 11 straight days of national television saturation , he could smile and take his now familiar seat at one of the stageset tables of washington power mr ginsburg s specialty as a medical malpractice litigator might be the ultimate comment on what has been missing all along from the art of capital spin doctoring richvoiced , graybearded and smartly tailored , he proceeded through his opening interview on nbc without a glove being landed on him in fact , he ended by confidently assuring the nation that the president , ms lewinsky who reportedly has told of sex with the president and a white house effort to conceal it all of us , will get out of this just fine it 'll go away , it 'll pass , said the smoothly selfadjusting lawyer who first came to town angrily questioning whether mr clinton was a misogynist today , he spoke as precisely positive toward the president as the american public seems to feel in the booming poll ratings by midday , the 54yearold lawyer was nowhere near winded as he managed to appear on all five major national talk programs in one morning he hopscotched studios , avuncular as a physician making house calls on the body politic , to capture the soundbite pentathlon in the sunday talk games no one s done that , not even during the gulf war , an appreciative mr russert said a car and driver took mr ginsburg about his appointed rounds to anchor people grateful for his authoritative tone in a suddenly factscarce story it s a sedan , not a limousine , and i'm paying for it , he said i 've been offered the use of corporate gulfstreams by every network and major magazine , he said , pleased to be paying his own way the only reported quid pro quo mr ginsburg has won so far , aside from a fortune in free tv time , was some grape nuts and skim milk that the lawyer , hungry and hiding from a media gang , asked barbara walters to bring when she arrived for her interview i'm a poor malpractice lawyer from the country , mr ginsburg said with clear delight silken of sound bite , he works alone where many an incumbent politician fears to tread without speechwriter , cosmetician , pollster and spin platoon he is providing a oneman clinic for the city s hotcombed professionals in the art of wielding television in defense of an untenable position a client who reportedly has contradicted herself in confessing on tapes , then denying by affidavit , a detailed story of sexual liaison with the president \( no one ever lies , the lawyer told one interviewer , amiably waxing existential people often do what they have to do to make their story sound right \) after testing his game , mr russert wondered whether the lawyer s education in the ways of washington might include his seduction , as well but mr ginsburg denies he is in danger from beltway vainglory being in front of a camera to me is like being in front of a jury my only job is conveying information and persuading , mr ginsburg said , describing each of today s tv moderators as separate skeptical witnesses to be worked before the electronic jury , still out far from misogynist , mr clinton was ms lewinsky s colleague , by her lawyer s accounting today mr ginsburg s name has become part of the latenight comedy weave , with jay leno observing that the lawyer might be able to spend only 90 percent of his time on tv now that he must do actual court work for his client but the lawyer is unapologetic in using tv , the foreign press or the tabloids to save his client we do n't pander to the lowest common denominator , he said , summarizing what he has learned as a talking head on the run we pander to everybody mr ginsburg s art , at least up to now , has been to talk in a nearparental tone of my girl , his 24yearold client , and to antagonize none of the principals as the nation waits to see which side draws more cooperation from ms lewinsky the prosecutor s or the president i ca n't get the kind of coverage for my girl that the president and chelsea got in that picture the other day , he lamented mr ginsburg intuitively shifts his points of emphasis according to the latest news cycle he brushed aside one tv question today about ms lewinsky s low standing with the public by alluding to the news media s own low standing and blithely requesting by the way , if there is anyone out there who wants to say something nice about ms lewinsky , and i know there are people because they 've called me to ask when the time is now actually , i could try either side of a case , because it s not about me , mr ginsburg maintains , relishing his clamorous visit here solely as a lawyer , he insisted , and

indianapolis , may 7 this was an awkward moment for the knicks they were watching patrick ewing make a grand , albeit graceless , entrance after five months of grueling rehabilitation and instead of being inspired and moved , the knicks were flat and frozen in the moment they seemed unsure of how the ball should move , how the offense should flow , how game 2 of this fourofsevengame secondround series should be won at market square arena tonight as odd as it was , it was a winded ewing after being more of an albatross than an ally to the knicks for most of the game who actually put his team in position to turn his cumbersome night into a hero s finish he huffed and puffed and had the knicks within 2 points with 459 seconds to go but even at that point , the knicks were not certain what to do their basic instinct , which led them through an adverse season without ewing , failed to surface the pacers' reflex reactions took over they scrambled and scratched and then antonio davis came up with a big offensive rebound after a reggie miller miss and was fouled in the process with uncommon cool and calm , the 46 percent freethrow shooter delivered two in a row with 281 seconds left to help the pacers put distance between themselves and the hoopla over ewing s return and in the end , indiana had an 8577 victory at market square arena with that , the pacers have a twogamestonone lead in this eastern conference semifinal round their star center , rik smits , scored 22 points as he headfaked ewing , while reggie miller had 21 to counter the only player buzzing for the knicks , john starks , who had 20 off the bench the ewing tour makes its next stop in madison square garden on saturday , in game 3 maybe then , with his first game behind him , ewing can deliver a smoother night than this one 10 points , 6 rebounds 2 turnovers , 2 steals , 1 block and a 3of11 shooting night in 27 minutes i thought i was going to go out , have a great game and score 50 , ewing said with a smile , playing again after receiving medical clearance today to come back from wrist surgery no , not really but i thought i would have had a better game than i did ewing was not shy in his return the offense did not run through him most of the time , but he took more shots than larry johnson , who made his return from a twogame suspension tonight with 15 points and ewing took just two fewer shots than allan houston houston scored 7 of his 16 points in the first quarter , when ewing , in early foul trouble , played just three minutes i'm not worried about how many shots we took , or i took , or patrick took , houston said i know people are going to talk about the shots and the flow but to me , the key was the extra effort and the hustle by indiana that we did n't have the knicks did not make the smart plays , either there was no guidance down the stretch , and no one to jerk the knicks into the right direction chris childs was not the answer he had five turnovers on the night , and none was as crucial as the one he delivered with 2 minutes 37 seconds left , and the knicks down by just 4 starks , who had put the knicks ahead for a brief moment early in the fourth quarter , could not believe it he was sprinting down the sideline , about to spring open and perhaps doom the pacers , but the pass never got there miller stepped in front of childs s errant throw and as a result , he came down the court and popped a 16foot jumper to push the pacers ahead by 6 this had nothing to do with ewing , nothing to do with the flow of the ball with the center back in the lineup the knicks had six turnovers in the fourth quarter , and they killed them i have to step up and we have to step up in the fourth quarter , childs said we have to play smart basketball at a key point in the game , i had a turnover i have to do much better than that each misstep left the pacers with an opening they had their own hiccups in this game , but under pressure , they made the shots , grabbed the rebounds and made the plays that mattered they hit six consecutive free throws in the last 28 seconds to seal it and in doing so , stars like miller and smits were able to equal the kind of success that their bench had in bailing them out in game 1 whatever it takes defense won it for us tonight , miller said in game 1 , the starters were embarrassed and we wanted to stake our claim rik went 3 for 19 in game 1 , and he was the first one to practice to work on his shooting that s what our team has been about all year long it was a big win for us the pressure is on new york now this is why ewing returned he was the knicks' hope of fending off the pacers , of preventing miller and company from running away with the series we held our home court , miller said we 're going to the garden where it s going to be tough but we 've had playoff success there before by no means is it going to be easy the crowd s going to be wild the volume will be turned up just a tad more when ewing steps on the floor and yet , you have to wonder how much of an improvement ewing can make after what he did tonight all of the emotions buzzing inside him before his return had to have drained him from the start of game 2 , he was cumbersome , foulprone and winded he looked his worst when he went oneonone with smits , tried to shake him with a crossover move , only to be stripped still , the pridefilled ewing was undeterred i believe in myself , ewing said i have high expectations saturday is going to be hyped it will be a different story in new york this story had an awkward ending on this night , when it seemed the knicks should be moved by ewing s presence , they were planted on the court , unsure of what move to make there has to be some adjustment , johnson said it will take some adjusting in my game , in allan s game , and in patrick s game but there is little time to finetune , little time to figure out how to succeed with their franchise player taking over the floor again we have to play with urgency and desperation , houston said we have to go out and take care of things on our court we have to play more as a unit and as a team we need to play like our lives depend on it rebounds the knicks used the lineup they started their season with for the first time since patrick ewing went down dec 20 to that point , the knicks were uninspired 1511 with ewing the question you have to ask yourself , and i have many times , is why was n't our team playing as well as we should have with him \? , coach jeff van gundy said why did , at times , we do more with less \? guys had a sense of heightened responsibility , not only when we were down without patrick , but without chris dudley the knicks' hardnosed power forward , charles oakley , was voted onto the nba s alldefensive team second team , right \? , oakley said that means you 're decent but i appreciate the coaches voting me on i just go out and try to play hard rik smits on ewing he was a little rusty , but that s to be expected the longer this series lasts , the better he 'll get , obviously reggie miller on ewing we were not going to let him step out here and be a savior we talked about it , rik took it personally and we were n't going to let that happen to us photos last night s starting centers , the pacers' rik smits and the knicks' patrick ewing smits had a gamehigh 22 points patrick

the american home products corporation and the monsanto company scrapped their 344 billion merger yesterday , the third big combination in the pharmaceutical industry to fail this year in a joint statement , the companies said the deal had been abandoned because it was not in the best interests of their shareholders yet , people close to the deal said yesterday that the merger was terminated because of an insurmountable power struggle between the two companies' chairmen , john r stafford at american home products and robert b shapiro at monsanto while a clash between the chief executives of merging companies is common , analysts said yesterday that they were becoming increasingly concerned that these disputes were upending deals that could have benefited shareholders all three of the drug industry s giant mergers this year have failed first between american home products and smithkline beecham in january and one month later between smithkline beecham and glaxo wellcome largely because one of the chief executives refused to yield power or compensation to a former rival there have been mergers that have been scuttled because of people issues , said viren mehta , a partner at mehta partners , a biopharmaceutical investment firm this appears to be one of them the boards have a fiduciary duty to make sure that any individual needs do n't get in the way of the needs that drive companies the botched deal was also painful to wall street , which has been hit by sharp downturns in the financial markets in the last two months with investment banks slicing their payrolls merrill lynch company announced a huge cutback yesterday the industry cannot afford to lose the fees a deal of this size would have generated analysts estimated yesterday that goldman , sachs company , which advised monsanto , and bear , stearns company , which advised american home products , forfeited 50 million in fees between them investors also fled american home products' stock dropped only slightly in midmorning trading , but then fell 5 , or 10 percent , to close at 45 shares of monsanto , the smaller company , plunged 13375 , or 266 percent , to 37 the issues that sank the merger appeared to have been simmering since the deal was announced in june at that time , the headlines could not have been brighter the merger , the largest ever in the pharmaceutical industry and the sixth largest among united states corporations , would have created the nation s largest seller of prescription drugs and the world s largest agricultural company aside from such name brands as advil painkiller , centrum vitamins and nutrasweet sugar substitute , american home products and monsanto would have been one of the world s leading life sciences companies using biotechnology , it could not only develop new agricultural products but also drugs and foods with specially engineered ingredients known as nutraceuticals while the merger appeared promising on paper , none of the bankers calculated the effect the structure of the deal would have on its outcome , or adequately gauged the disparate personalities of the combined company s chairmen both companies described the deal as a merger of equals , but american home products was , in effect , purchasing monsanto under the terms , american home products was to swap 115 of its shares for each monsanto share , giving it 65 percent control of the new company s stock mr shapiro and mr stafford said they would run the company jointly , an arrangement that raised skepticism in europe and in the united states six months earlier , mr stafford had refused to yield power to jan leschly , smithkline beecham s chief executive , a point that ultimately sank that merger though both are lawyers , mr stafford had little in common with mr shapiro mr shapiro , 60 , worked his way through searle before monsanto bought it in 1985 but refused to move to monsanto s headquarters city of st louis from his home in chicago when he became chairman of the company instead , he has kept in touch with monsanto executives largely through email not only is mr stafford , who is also 60 , a constant presence at american home products headquarters in madison , nj , he sometimes goes to the company gym at his lunch hour to play pickup basketball games there , some colleagues say , he is not above using his elbows to get a better position the trouble between the two chiefs began in the summer analysts said that mr stafford became concerned about mr shapiro s role in the proposed company and his anticipated level of compensation even though mr stafford drew a higher salary at american home products than mr shapiro at monsanto , he made considerably less after stock options were included mr stafford was also said to have become increasingly annoyed when mr shapiro made decisions without consulting him according to one source familiar with monsanto , mr stafford was angry that mr shapiro had named gary crittenden as monsanto s chief financial officer in august mr stafford was so irritated that he circulated an internal memo that assured his staff mr crittenden would not hold an important role in the merged company an american home products spokesman declined to comment about the memo
garden city use of the garden city address by postal customers not within its incorporated 53 square miles is touching an economic nerve and heating conversations along the wide avenues and treeshaded lawns of this 129yearold village the conflict arises because the garden city post office delivers mail for all those in zip code 11530 , including an eastern corridor beyond village limits , ranging up to the meadowbrook parkway on stewart avenue and to four blocks beyond the parkway on old country road the area includes roosevelt field shopping mall parts of mitchel field , including the cradle of aviation museum avis world headquarters chase manhattan bank du pont pharmaceuticals nassau community college , and the long island gynecological services clinic on stewart avenue , scene of numerous antiabortion protests residents have watched the decline of the village s main commercial district along franklin avenue , which still has lord taylor and saks but is a far cry from what the street signs still proclaim as the fifth avenue of long island many of them are irritated that the commercial center of gravity in the area has sprawled eastward , beyond their control or taxation power that and the negative publicity generated by some of the businesses there among them a sexual harassment suit involving a brokerage firm and a lawyer s suit linked to the use of viagra is prompting the campaign to change the addresses within this zone , identified on the long island regional planning board map as east garden city they often forget the east , said the garden city deputy historian , john ellis kordes a task force formed by the village s chamber of commerce met recently with postal and congressional representatives to ask for two changes to reduce the area covered by its zip code , 11530 , and to restrict the use of the name garden city to the village itself the best reason for that area out there to have a different zip code and a different name is because it is diluting our identity , said bruce torino , a garden city village trustee i believe the garden city name is as valuable to the community as any asset and goodwill is to any company how valuable would tiffany s be if everybody made a tiffany \? the village deputy mayor , hal hecken , agreed we get all of the noise and complaints about what s happening in the east , but none of the revenue , he said we do n't get taxes of any kind from that area we do get the traffic and other pollutions bertram j donley , executive vice president of the village chamber of commerce , said the people businesses and residents of garden city have a welldeveloped sense of place they are proud of the community and treasure its identity so it is a particularly sensitive issue with the villagers that the commercial districts to our east profit from our reputation yet do not conform to our architectural and building regulations and do not contribute to our tax base but peter o'neill , a local banker and former head of the chamber and a task force member , urged caution we want to pursue this but we must be careful not to disenfranchise half the people who think they are in garden city with a lot of valuable property who want to be part of our business community mr o'neill s office was moved recently out of the village and across the invisible line , as he put it , on stewart avenue i honestly thought we were still in garden city when we moved , he said and it s true that people outside the line here are not paying village taxes but they 're not getting any village services either mr o'neill added that a change of zip code could backfire on franklin avenue if a guy in chicago is thinking of relocating a store there , he 'll probably check his computer zip code file to see where the retail centers are if 11530 no longer has all those retail addresses from roosevelt field , he may decide to go instead to east garden city or whatever it s going to be called , where those retail addresses will be annexation of the disputed area has been discussed and rejected by village and chamber of commerce officials it s highly doubtful that the town of hempstead or the uniondale school district would want to give up those taxes , said gary fishberg , village counsel one of the country s first planned communities , garden city was once the business and commercial center for central nassau county but while its stately homes remain , much of the village s commerce has been diverted to the newer large retailers and office complexes in nassau s hub homeowners are bearing the weight of a heavier tax tab because the amount paid to the village by the commercial sector has dropped 8 percent over the last 10 years , according to jim oliva , the village auditor we had a situation here where office buildings charged 40 a square foot , mr donley said by 1992 that was down to 22 a square foot that translates directly to the tax base , since commercial buildings are assessed on their income
berlin , aug 19 you know that chancellor helmut kohl must be in trouble when even european intellectuals who say they admire him come to berlin for an opposition campaign rally proclaiming the end of an era we need a kind of european new deal in all of europe , said jack lang , a french socialist and former culture minister who saw no contradiction between his admiration for the chancellor and the prevailing opinion at today s proceedings the opinion was that mr kohl and his conservative government were thoroughly burned out after 16 years in office and that it was past time for a change an opinion shared , needless to say , by the social democratic candidate running against the chancellor in the sept 27 elections , gerhard schroder , who listened quietly and applauded from time to time i have the greatest respect for chancellor kohl and for his historic accomplishment in the unification of germany and the construction of europe , mr lang said , and i have not forgotten that he was a loyal and affectionate friend of the late president francois mitterrand , to whom i was very close but he added , we feel the moment has come , now or never , and not only in germany , to give new vitality to this europe that was born after world war ii mr kohl has never counted the german intellectual community among his most fervent supporters , but one of his aides , the minister of state , anton pfeifer , publicly protested the plans for today s opposition rally and accused mr schroder , whose lead in public opinion polls has narrowed in recent weeks , of trying to grab power through culture not everybody saw their presence as a campaign endorsement i'm not taking sides in this election i could n't , said elie wiesel , the writer and nobel laureate , who came with a prepared speech titled to a young german friend just being here , of course , has some implications , he said , before the company moved from willy brandt house , a social democratic headquarters in the western part of berlin , to bertolt brecht s old theater , the berliner ensemble , in the eastern part , for the evening like many of us , i came here carried by hope , mr wiesel , a survivor of the nazi concentration camps who has written and spoken eloquently about the holocaust , said in his prepared remarks his hope , he said , was rooted in a desire to act on history so that the next century be placed under the sign of human solidarity instead of violence , a sentiment that mr kohl has often expressed himself with a few exceptions like the writer gunter grass , who was not here today , neither german nor european intellectuals mobilized very visibly for mr kohl s opponent in the last elections four years ago what is different , some said today , is the sense that mr kohl s ideas about building europe by building a common market and laying the foundations for a common currency , the euro , to be introduced on jan 1 , have taken germany about as far as they can now , in the view of many here , it is time for something else we ca n't just talk about the euro or an economic europe , said klaus stack , a well known poster artist whose action for more democracy group organized the gathering one era is ending , and a new one is about to begin michael naumann , the publisher mr schroder said he would name as germany s first federal culture minister if the social democrats win next month , quoted aristotle in support of change one person ca n't rule forever there has to be change if the election were held this week , according to a poll by the allensbach institute published today in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the social democrats and the green party together , with 436 and 75 percent , would have enough votes in parliament to form a government and relegate mr kohl s christian democrats and the free democrats to opposition status mr kohl s party was favored by 364 percent of those surveyed not all polls show the christian democrats so far behind but none so far have given mr kohl much chance of pulling them ahead in the month remaining before the election some intellectuals warned today against seeing the vote as an ideological choice if we want to build europe , we will need to try to separate the left from socialism , said bernardhenri levy , a french writer and philosopher who warned the social democrats not to be tempted by pacifism in the face of aggression in the province of kosovo in serbia , for example but with centerleft governments now in power under tony blair in britain and lionel jospin in france , others saw a chance for making europe into something more humane and civilized than a globalized market currently ridden by doubledigit unemployment in many countries it s the role of leftist governments nowadays to fight against the kind of propaganda that tells millions of people they are not needed and have no use , said viviane forrester , whose writings about the evils of globalization have made her a bestselling author in france we need conservative intellectuals too , pleaded peter schneider , a german author , before the gathering agreed that a change in government here would help build a democratic , social and culturally vital europe
edward siegmann , an advocate for the elderly who lives in mattituck , went to the telephone after rates for basic cable television service more than doubled last winter for weeks after the increase , mr siegmann said , he was taking calls from seniors who only have basic service because it s all they can afford and who were worried the new rate was beyond their means a lot of seniors do n't drive at night , mr siegmann said their main entertainment is turning on the television long island s cable company , cablevision systems of woodbury , has since rolled back part of the increase , which would have raised the cost of the basic service from 756 to 1320 a month in the five east end towns of suffolk county we listened to the concerns of our customers and agreed to reduce that rate to 983 , said charles r schueler , a spokesman for cablevision he said the cost for basic service , which supplies local broadcast stations and some shopping channels by cable , was deeply discounted below what federal communications commission regulations allow cablevision to charge but with cable rates for basic service and expanded programming packages rising faster than inflation as the federal government continues to deregulate the industry , concerns about the rates cablevision charges and will charge in the future are coming to the fore some critics say that the company holds a monopoly on long island it holds all 108 franchises there and is taking full advantage of federal deregulation that gives it greater power than ever over rates and the content of program packages how to regulate monopolies has been a question in this country for a long time , said neal m lewis , the executive director of the long island neighborhood network , a 30 , 000member civic organization cable television is the modern version of this , he said , adding , competition is breaking out all over in other fields , but they are immune from it mr schueler said that cable television was in fact among the most highly regulated industries that exists he said cablevision already faced stiff competition from satellite program providers such as directv , as well as future competition from a variety of sources cablevision said its strategy was to build a fiber optic cable system that would offer not only everincreasing television programming but also phone service and highspeed internet connections subscribers to the full array of services , which are not yet available , could receive television programming at a discount , the company said current rates and services are the more immediate issues in suffolk , the county legislature has scheduled hearings for next month and september to examine cablevision charges and programming in the five east end towns , officials have vowed that none will agree to a new cable contract unless all do in nassau , details of proposed service agreements between cablevision and municipalities , including rates and services , will be revealed in hearings in coming months in hempstead , negotiations on a new contract were nearing an end , and in north hempstead , town supervisor may w newberger said that every resident was lobbying for a decent contract , which could be expected soon but with the federal government preempting states and localities in cable ratesetting , municipalities have limited ability to influence charges and programming complaints to the state about cable rates are handled by the new york state public service commission , which is confined to reviewing the rates for basic cable service to see if they comply with fcc guidelines unless congress intervenes , federal regulation of what cable companies can charge for expanded programming far more popular and widely subscribed to than basic service will end early next year companies including cablevision are already expanding program packages , adding programming , shifting channel assignments and raising rates in much of nassau county , for example , the program package one step above basic service , family cable , included 30 channels for a monthly charge of 2090 in 1992 the family cable package now includes 56 channels and costs 2995 a month mr schueler said the greater number of channels meant the perchannel cost to subscribers had decreased in nassau and elsewhere on long island but critics questioned the value of some new channels , such as shopping channels , and complained about the shifting of some premium channels , such as movie channels the company also shows sexually explicit movies the critics said the federal regulatory scheme had envisioned greater competition for cable companies from telephone companies , which were expected to start offering television packaging over phone lines they thought the telephone companies were going to compete , and that has n't happened , said c stephen hackeling , the republican presiding officer of the suffolk county legislature cablevision has consistently been pushing up their rates much quicker than is justifiable , and the last regulatory strings are coming off them a spokesman for the fcc , morgan a broman , said the commission was also concerned about the failure of telephone companies to enter the cable field the big thing that did n't happen was that the regional bell companies did not jump into video programming the way we thought they would , mr broman said and the consumers in many areas continue to have only one choice steve levy , a democratic member of the suffolk legislature , said , what is ironic is that federal deregulation was supposed to decrease rates , and the opposite has occurred he added , even the long island lighting company , as horrendous as it was , had to get a rubber stamp from the public service commission a spokesman for bell atlantic , which provides local phone service in nassau and suffolk , said it was doing nothing specific on long island to provide television programming , but intends to in the future the spokesman , john j bonomo , said he did not know when , however a spokesman for directv in los angeles , robert a marsocci , said service was available to customers who paid around 300 for the purchase and installation of a satellite dish a direct line of sight to the south is necessary , he said programming available to its customers includes a 2999amonth package of 55 video channels and 31 commercialfree audio channels , he said federal regulations bar satellite companies from delivering local broadcast signals , which on long island includes the new york city stations included in cablevision s basic service cablevision has 26 million customers in the metropolitan area while cablevision spoke of expanding channel offerings in existing program packages , mr siegmann was unimpressed they keep charging more money for channels we do n't want , he said
the great experiment the term is frequently applied to the modern art of russia in the years between 1919 and 1927 , when russian constructivism , one of the most radical manifestations of early 20thcentury art , was , for all intents and purposes , the official style of the newly formed communist government it was a time when a handful of contentious avantgarde artists , under the slogan art into life ! , cast themselves as fullfledged participants in the russian revolution subjugating personal expression to the state s utilitarian needs in the belief that art could help form a new society , they designed everything from stationery to household objects to public monuments , made films and took photographs , some of which are modernist landmarks radical political thought and radical art seemed to be in step with each other as never before , or since but like most experiments , this one was shortlived and was soon ground beneath the heel of an increasingly totalitarian state by 1932 stalin s brutal regime had imposed socialist realism as the official style , ordered the destruction of modernist works in state museums , imprisoned and even executed some artists , dismissed others and forced still others into the humiliating posture of reconstruction to exorcise tendencies deemed formalist , imperialist or elitist to know this history intellectually is not the same as seeing it played out in visual form , as it is in the museum of modern art s survey of the career of aleksandr rodchenko , russian constructivism s most politically adept protagonist this is the largest survey of rodchenko s work mounted in the united states , and represents a curatorial collaboration between magdalena dabrowski , senior curator , department of drawings at the modern peter galassi , chief curator of the museum s department of photography , and leah dickerman , an assistant professor of art history at stanford university it includes 300 paintings , sculptures , drawings , linocuts , photographs and examples of graphic design , among them posters , book covers , candy wrappers , magazine spreads many involving ingenious uses of photomontage the exhibition s reading room is a meticulous recreation of the workers' reading room designed by rodchenko for the 1925 exposition of decorative arts in paris , complete with stark gray chairs that are about as comfortable as pilgrim stocks most impressive are the graphic designs , especially the nearly three dozen covers for the magazine of leftist esthetics lef and its successor , novyi lef , which exploit the bold geometry of cyrillic lettering , and many of the photographs from the mid1920 s , after rodchenko made some of art history s first monochrome paintings and announced the death of the medium as a whole , the show is by turns illuminating , tragic and chilling , in general more interesting historically than thrilling visually it portrays a fiercely cerebral , problemsolving artist , bent on progress , who may have been so successful at expunging the personal from his art that it sometimes seems hollow , or to possess little more than a period look but if rodchenko s art is short on psychological insight or the pleasures of the eye for that , there s the bonnard exhibition on the floor below he is so versatile and diversely innovative that simply presenting the first two busy decades of his career sums up a great deal about constructivism and its time in many ways , he was the great experiment s greatest utility player rodchenko arrived in moscow in 1915 at the age of 24 , having already absorbed most of the innovations of cubism and futurism and made some abstract art of his own these geometric ink drawings , hanging near the show s entrance , were included in an exhibition in 1916 organized by vladimir tatlin , whose designs for the cafe pittoresque , of 1917 , are generally viewed as the beginning of constructivism by 1920 , rodchenko was part of a rare phenomenon an institutionally supported avantgarde that included the filmmakers dziga vertov and sergei eisenstein , and the poet vladimir mayakovsky , as well as malevich , kandinsky and varvara stepanova , rodchenko s lifelong companion with others they established and taught at art schools , organized state exhibitions and new museums , hammered out esthetic programs and founded magazines , like lef and they fought over turf as rodchenko s materialist , objectivist approach gained ground over kandinsky s more subjective process , rodchenko was prominent in a group that ousted kandinsky from his teaching position , prompting him to leave the soviet union for the friendlier waters of the bauhaus rodchenko s sensibility should be familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of minimal and conceptual art , and it makes sense that interest in his art began to revive in the early 1970 s , when those styles held sway \( in 1971 , the museum of modern art mounted a small show of works from its collection , the first outside the soviet union \) in the opening galleries of the exhibition , where rodchenko rapidly pursues formalist reduction to its logical conclusion , one catches intimations of the work of dan flavin , mel bochner and sol lewitt his black on black paintings , made in response to malevich s whiteonwhite works , presage the subtleties of ad reinhardt s shadowy

salt lake city chicago had finished shooting around yesterday morning and now the news media followed michael jordan and finally surrounded him , listening for gems regarding game 2 of the nba finals in the end , there were no gems , but there were a few darts the great one seemed unusually irritable , perhaps because the bulls trailed the utah jazz , one game to none although what seemed to really irk him was how innuendo had given way to outright suggestions that jordan , the greatest player of all time , was in decline one reporter asked whether jordan was confident going into game 2 , given the fact that chicago was extended to a seventh game by indiana in the eastern conference finals and was beaten on wednesday by the jazz jordan rolled his eyes stupid question , he said the question might actually be more relevant than jordan would care to admit jordan is lethal as ever in spots , even for stretches last night , in game 2 , jordan scored 7 consecutive points late in the fourth quarter , and 37 for the game , to help give chicago a 9388 victory that evened the series at one game apiece but what has become apparent , at least from the outside , is that jordan is finding it harder to singlehandedly take over a game no more telling his supporting cast to move away , no more attaching the franchise to his back , carrying it up the steep mountain not anymore after years of living alone at a lofty level all his own , jordan has gone as far as his extraordinary skills can take him if chicago is to add a sixth , and defining , championship to its legacy , jordan will have to get help , and not just from scottie pippen the challenge for jordan is to accept that help and that is not as simple as it sounds jordan is the classic hero he responds to impending doom not by deferring , but by assuming an even greater responsibility he forever threatens to cross the line between heroic action and selfishness for instance , on his first basket in the second half last night , jordan curled around a screen , took a pass intended for luc longley , and knocked down a jumper coach phil jackson tried to get jordan out of the game at a crucial juncture on wednesday night , but jordan talked his way back in but the most telling incident occurred after pippen culminated a great rally in game 1 by nailing a 3pointer that tied the score with 2 minutes 34 seconds left in regulation jordan had scored on the bulls' two previous possessions on the way back to the bench , jordan could be seen yelling at pippen for failing to recognize that jordan had a mismatch in the post on hornacek in previous championship runs , such combustion has served as octane for the bulls this time , the bulls lost in overtime but who can criticize michael jordan \? jordan has saved the day , carried the load , so many times he helped bring five national basketball association championships to a city that a decade ago felt it might never win one now , driven by his mission , jordan may be the last to grasp his barely discernible slide from deity to mortal last night , jordan and pippen scored all but 2 of chicago s points in the fourth quarter but the issue is not one game but an accumulation of games and years of improbable expectations met and exceeded utah s bench is heralded chicago s bench is scorned yet without consistent contributions from players like steve kerr and scott burrell , it s possible jordan wo n't prevail this time as great as oscar robertson was , one lingering scene from the end of his career was jo jo white and don chaney running him into the ground in the nba finals there are similar memories of other athletes muhammad ali being punished by larry holmes , willie mays falling down in the field as a met jordan is seasons away from that sort of dramatic decline , though in an ideal world he would retire after this season and leave memories of triumphant heroism bulls management , of course , would love for jordan to return so would the nba but for jordan , the work environment would very likely be dramatically altered no pippen , no dennis rodman , no jackson jordan might be reduced to a novelty act with no hope of winning a championship just playing to be playing so this quest represents the last great challenge of jordan s career the nature of it is unlike anything jordan has faced what makes it so daunting is that the force jordan must overcome is jordan the pride , the ego , the vanity of the hero giving way ever so slightly to a supporting cast that may well be a life raft photo michael jordan \( reuters \)
just my soul responding rhythm and blues , black consciousness , and race relations by brian ward illustrated 600 pp berkeley university of california press cloth , 60 paper , 2495 the true subject of just my soul responding is not soul music or even rhythm and blues unless that postworld war ii catchall category is retrofitted to encompass soul and a little funk and disco but not hiphop or recent black pop rather , brian ward sets himself to tracing the evolution of black pop from the dawn of rockandroll \( a misty moment here signaled by the chords' shboom in 1954 \) until his material peters out in the mid1970 s even though he would have been better off plodding on for another 250 pages , into the 90 s , the book deserves a place alongside charles keil s urban blues , arnold shaw s honkers and shouters , peter guralnick s sweet soul music and nelson george s death of rhythm and blues and where did our love go \? by no means does just my soul responding rank above them , however ward , who teaches american history at the university of newcastleupontyne in england , blusters a great deal about superseding the competition ultimately , he claims , the story of rhythm and blues reveals the inadequacy of both excessive romanticizations of the counterhegemonic power of black popular culture , and of frankfurt schoolstyle critiques of mass culture yet none of the books cited above indulge in either fallacy when he gets down to cases , ward either attacks commentators of little standing or snipes at the decontextualized ideas of more skillful writers whose discoveries , as the footnotes establish , he is not above appropriating especially since ward is no theoretical innovator himself his brightest insight is the culturalstudies commonplace identifying black pop as an arena where entertainers are dramatizing and celebrating the black community s refusal to succumb to the mental and spiritual ravages of racism and poverty this academic chest beating is a counterproductive distraction instead , ward should rely more confidently on his strength the rare combination he achieves of diligent professional historian \( he is one of the editors of the making of martin luther king and the civil rights movement \) and passionate fan with scant firsthand experience of the music in situ , he has scoured liner notes , collector magazines , newspaper archives , academic journals and documents of the civil rights movement and has produced an account that is evenhanded and commonsensical but also committed and felt ward s method is to argue his thesis by linking rhythm and blues to mass black consciousness an ardent integrationist at heart , he posits a plausible connection between the racial openness and relative gentility of black pop in the 50 s and the middleclass ambitions many poor black americans nurtured during the postwar economic boom , especially after the supreme court s school desegregation decision in 1954 as he explains it mechanistically , but reasonably the more raceconscious soul and funk genres reflect the increasing militancy that produced the black power movement this ward sees as an understandable but unfortunate reaction that ensued when racial progress slowed to a crawl \( or went into reverse \) because whites had realized that to open up the american dream to everyone would require the wholesale restructuring of american society , government and economy ward is enthusiastic about the cultural heat of black consciousness he knows soul s elaborated callandresponse and funk s improvisational rhythmic complexity would never have developed among artists who were courting whites but in the end he seems to regret it anyway politically , he doubts separatism can work in a predominantly white nation and musically , he is put off by the machismo of these styles far more so , it must be said , than most black women seem to be ward overplays an unrepresentative smattering of personal interviews and commits other gaffes ascribing too much significance to a racist attack on nat \( king \) cole in 1956 and , comically , identifying a white polygram executive as the bass singer of the platters but he offers much that is fresh there is sharp critical writing about the clovers at the beginning of his story and parliamentfunkadelic at its end , and a surprisingly persuasive reading of chuck berry s promised land as a shadow history of the first freedom rides and although others have made the point , he is properly emphatic about the refusal of black fans and entrepreneurs to go along with the taste makers who feel slickness and sophistication are not black in a paradigmatic instance that cannot be cited too often , the southern funk of memphis and muscle shoals was the product of whiteowned companies and whitedominated house bands , while the supposed sellout pop of motown was created and marketed by blacks best of all , ward provides some eyeopening revelations about the civil rights movement a young martin luther king jr warns against the evils of rockandroll a young julian bond sends up the notion of natural rhythm the black panther party lays out the revolutionary limitations of song most memorably , having reminded us that the crucial musical supporters of the civil rights movement were nonr b artists like lena horne , sammy davis jr and joan baez , ward establishes harry belafonte who was a leftwing activist well before he became a folkpop superstar as the angel of the southern christian leadership conference so until we get a survey that combines ward s exhaustive research with guralnick s literary sweep , keil s social vision and george s easy authority , just my soul responding will remain an uncommonly comprehensive introduction to the formative decades of black rockandroll , which ward situates more singlemindedly than most in black history ultimately , his quirks and personal preferences only add flavor , and to his credit , he does not let them hogtie him if his theorizing about mass black consciousness is tendentious by definition , it remains credible , not least because he never forgets how varied the individuals , interest groups and casual social associations that underlie such intellectual conceits always turn out to be when you look them in the eye
stony brook soon after arriving at the museums at stony brook about five years ago to become chief curator , william ayres led members of the new york metropolitan chapter of the victorian society on a little tour of neighboring st james struck by the number of houses there attributed to stanford white , mr ayres decided that the museum complex should mount an exhibition about the architect and the role he played in shaping long island s visual landscape he tucked the notion away in his futures file , bringing it out periodically over the years without getting the project further than a very tentative planning board i knew he wanted to do the show he approached me about it several times but until last year i never had the time , recalled samuel g white , a greatgrandson of stanford white , who is also an architect i 'd started to work on a book , and i realized that it the exhibition would have to be now or never the timing turned out to be fortuitous a year in the making , stanford white on long island , organized by mr ayres , mr white and his wife , elizabeth , is on view in the complex s history museum , and mr white s book , the houses of mckim , mead white , is to be published next month by rizzoli the exhibition includes photographs , architectural drawings and plans , paintings , home furnishings , clothing and other memorabilia dealing with 22 buildings on the island designed by white and his firm , the bestknown american architects of the late 19th century fifteen of the private residences including box hill , stanford white s home in st james , where samuel white s father , peter , lives still stand , as do three churches , a schoolhouse that is now a private home and the shinnecock hills golf club just how many long island buildings were designed by white , the firm s partner in charge of most of the residential commissions , will never be known , said samuel white the firm kept good records bill books they were called and in 1978 leland roth published a book based on those office records but these bill books never listed commissions under 50 , and there were a number of simple house designs that were not documented mr white said his greatgrandfather was known to jot down drawings of houses for friends on anything at hand envelopes , for example and how do you count projects \? mr white said for instance , there was a development in garden city with seven houses is that considered one or seven \? or how about accessory buildings \? the wetherill house has a gardener s cottage should that be one or two \? mr white was particularly fascinated by one undocumented project the house and studio in southampton that belonged to the artist william merritt chase there was no mention of it in the bill books , he said , but there was mention of a house built for c l atterbury , a banker who was a founder of the shinnecock hills golf club , and roth surmised that chase s house was originally atterbury s and was just altered to add on a studio to solve the mystery , mr white went beneath the house , crawling through sand and cobwebs under the foundation to look for seams that would indicate the studio had been added on he found none and concluded that the house was indeed built , off the bill books , for chase and could very well be the first home with an attached artist s studio ever designed given the complexity of arriving at a complete inventory of white buildings , the curators decided to concentrate on existing houses only two homes that no longer exist , the palatial gilded age mansions designed for clarence mackay in roslyn and for edwin dennison morgan 3d in wheatley hills , are included in the exhibition one of the four st james houses , all designed for relatives , is still occupied by white family members \( bessie smith white , stanford white s wife , was one of four smith sisters descended from the founder of smithtown \) the involvement of the subject s family made assembling the show much easier in addition to what mr ayres called an embarrassment of riches found at the newyork historical society and the avery architectural library at columbia university , where the curators sifted through thousands of blueprints , photographs and other documents , they also had family artifacts the whites were just wonderful in lending us objects of a personal nature , mr ayres said , that not only gave us some insight into white but showed just how remarkable he was as a decorator , how ingenious he was in putting together disparate things into the interiors of the homes he designed he was a gifted designer as well as an architect these artifacts , attributed to private collectors , include personal items like a worth gown that belonged to bessie smith white and stanford s hunting outfit , which came to us complete with spats and gaiters , mr ayres said but when we noticed that the spats and gaiters were a different shade of green , indicating they were never worn , we left them off to be authentic

tel hashomer , israel , feb 9 fighting a losing battle against sobs alongside the coffin of her fallen brother , olga rappaport addressed his comrades in russian he was very happy to serve in your army i want all of you to make it home alive do n't kill your parents , your brothers and sisters the slight , 22yearold woman stopped there , unable to go on when her words returned in hebrew , many of the purplebereted combat soldiers , some of them fresh from the combat zone of southern lebanon , swallowed hard and looked away until sgt nikolai rappaport was killed by a blast of hezbollah shrapnel in the neck on saturday , none of them knew that the 23yearold recent russian immigrant had this sister , or that his father , ilya , 62 , had been unemployed for months , or that they lived in poverty in a tiny room in a tinroofed storehouse in the seedy shapira district of tel aviv the story of the quiet immigrant from russia who found a home in an israeli combat unit and volunteered for every patrol including the one that killed him while his small family wrestled with privation and misery , sent a wave of shame through the army and the society that was especially so when mr rappaport said he would take nikolai s body back to his native krasnodar , in the northern caucasus , so his mother could be at the burial though neither the father nor the sister uttered a word of complaint , there was a sense , captured in eulogies and press commentaries , that israel had somehow failed these people now , after his death , everyone in israel has seen the single room where he , his father and his sister lived and we are ashamed , the jerusalem post said in an editorial the situation of this one grieving family shines a spotlight on the difficulties that remain for many new immigrants from the former soviet union two foreigners stood there , isolated , in a sea of purple army berets of the givati unit , sima kadmon wrote in maariv , another daily even his death failed to incorporate them in our society even before they could learn how to adapt here , they learned what it means to die here unspoken at the funeral , but understood by all present , was the fact that had mr rappaport decided to have the funeral in israel , his son would have been buried outside the cemetery walls , because by the orthodox jewish law in force , he was not even jewish , since his mother was not the law of return grants automatic citizenship to anyone who has a jewish grandparent , but religious law recognizes only those whose mothers were jewish the story of the rappaports seemed to remind israelis how little they really know about the travails and lives of the hundreds of thousands of russian jews who have immigrated to israel in the last decade , and especially those like ilya rappaport who have been too old or too limited in their training to integrate themselves into the brash , fastpaced israeli life we stand here embarrassed that we did not see , did not hear , did not ask and did not know how difficult it was for your family , said sergeant rappaport s hebrew teacher , tova nayberg , one of the few people from outside the givati brigade who went to the ceremony the slight mr rappaport , unshaven and dressed in a thin brown jacket that seemed to offer little protection against the cold , was unable to read the kaddish , the jewish mourner s prayer , and let the chaplain do it when asked to say a word , he was hesitant i 'll try , he said in russian i 'll see if i can i want to tell all you soldiers fulfill your duty , of course , but do return home please excuse me the plight of the rappaports first came to light when president ezer weizman went to their hovel to pay a call on sunday he and the officers who went with him were horrified it is a pity we have come to this point , in which the family of a fighter in the israel defense force is living in such disgraceful conditions , mr weizman declared if the idf did not know about this , that is terrible at the brief military memorial service at the military induction base here , the guilt was as tangible as the grief forgive us for our deeds , the army cantor intoned everything we did was for you , according to the traditions of israel and the practices of our holy land and in interviews after sergeant rappaport s coffin was driven off in an army truck for the el al flight to russia , his commanders and comrades tried to explain why they had known so little we never suspected his situation , said pvt vadim kutsik , a russianspeaking member of sergeant rappaport s unit who was wounded in the same ambush he was very quiet he never told anyone i only learned about it from tv it turned out that sergeant rappaport had applied for financial assistance but apparently concealed the fact that his father lost his job as a welder last summer , possibly because he might have been reassigned to a noncombat unit nearer home at the same time , he never told his father that he was serving in a unit assigned to the israelicontrolled buffer zone in southern lebanon as a combat soldier , sergeant rappaport earned about 170 a month ilya and nikolai rappaport immigrated to israel three years ago to seek a better life ilya rappaport s wife , klavdiya , who is not jewish , stayed behind , reportedly because she was very sick olga rappaport arrived in israel two months ago , saying she missed her brother it is not an unusual story among recent immigrants , except for the way nikolai found his home in the army he first tried to join the paratroopers , private kutsik said , and when he failed , he chose a unit in which he could see action older than most other recruits , who are drafted at 18 in israel , sergeant rappaport was known as a quiet soldier who was always ready to do more it did n't matter how many hours he worked during the day , or how many hours he spent on guard duty , said his platoon commander , second lieut assaf rosenfeld , or even if his comrades did less he never complained i heard that he is not going to be buried in israel in my opinion , this is not what he would have wanted , if he could have asked photo flanked by members of his brigade , the father and sister of sgt nikolai rappaport , ilya and olga rappaport , watched as the israeli soldier s coffin was lifted into a car before a flight to their native russia for burial \(

few eyebrows should have been raised , and most likely few were , when a recent survey showed that new york business leaders have meager faith in the city s public schools even so , it was hard to keep shoulders from sagging after the lateaugust release of the study , commissioned by the new york city partnership and chamber of commerce by 3 to 1 , employers found public school graduates lacking in essential skills they complained about young workers speaking poorly , writing poorly , performing basic arithmetic poorly and in general behaving poorly , because no one ever showed them the virtues of being polite , dressing appropriately and showing up on time true , nearly half those surveyed also said that the situation had improved a bit in the last few years but over all , minuses outweighed pluses a senior executive of an advertising agency filled out his questionnaire this way it is almost impossible to hire competent clerical and or entry help for administrative work from the new york city schools our recent successful hires were from illinois , toronto , ireland etc again , none of this will come as a shock to many new yorkers they have long grown inured to cashiers who have trouble giving correct change , to receptionists who need five minutes to take a simple message because they can barely spell , to file clerks who have to think hard about whether g comes before h or the other way around but even if not breathtakingly new , the business study hovered like a chilling specter over a symposium in chelsea yesterday on how to make the city s young people more competitive in today s labor market about 200 people representing various city offices , business groups and nonprofit providers of social services turned out for the conference , which was held at covenant house , the youth shelter and counseling agency on west 17th street if there was a recurring theme in the wideranging discussions , it was that programs are sorely needed to prepare young people for the real world you 've got to connect people to the world of work , said john rakis , who runs the south forty corporation , a nonprofit group that helps former prison inmates find jobs it is n't as though jobs are not there , everyone agreed and it is n't , many also agreed , as though you can get away with glibly blaming racism for every problem facing the city s hundreds of thousands of jobseeking black and hispanic youths with unemployment lower than it has been in a long time , many employers are ready to gobble up anyone willing and able to work just stroll through manhattan and try counting all the stores and restaurants with help wanted signs hanging in their front windows steven feldman , a senior official at the board of education , agreed that the schools must do more to make sure that their graduates can function in a modern service economy the higher standards that schools chancellor rudy crew has set for both students and teachers are part of the answer , mr feldman said but he added , we 've also got to motivate business to get involved in the public school system in a sense , we 've redefined education , he said we 've redefined the school as a workplace what they learn in the classroom will carry young people just so far , argued edward dejesus , an official of a washingtonbased group called the national youth employment coalition they do n't just need a job , he said they need new rules for living in other words , it must be made obvious to them that nobody , whether a store customer or a bank officer , is going to turn over his money to someone who has three rings in his nose or who insists on talking and dressing as though he were a gangster even if he spells it gangsta how , mr dejesus asked , can someone expect to be trusted if he insists on mean mugging , forever scowling in an attempt to intimidate the world \? young people are committing economic suicide when they 're out there engaged in the street life , he said we ca n't be afraid to tell them that if parents fail to shoulder that burden , he said , programs must be created to pick up the slack things will improve , mr feldman predicted , but it will take time the problem is that changing the schools is like knitting a sweater while you 're wearing it , he said but then , he added , no one thought the task would be easy just critical

and without the conviction of certainty , total and absolute , how can we ever hang anyone with an easy conscience \? the moral component of bacon s admonition is the heart of mr pears s novel for the simple reason that a murder has been committed and a suspect is indeed to be hanged for it as he presents his four versions of the story , mr pears is not above salting his tale with fraudulent clues , intentionally leading the reader into the very kind of false certainty that bacon warned against in one important instance , however , involving what would appear to be a damning confession , mr pears fails to come up with a persuasive explanation , and that stands as a rare logical flaw in a story that is otherwise a marvel of syllogistic precision there is one way , bacon said , in which scientists and lawyers can avoid the duplicity of appearances , and an instance of the fingerpost does show that way , but only after first showing far more instances of honest error and intentional falsehood when the denouement comes , it is with a new and final twist , one whose quality of surprise is the final proof of this talented author s almost infinite capacity to replace one understanding of things with another photo iain pears \( jonathan player for the new york times \)
stdenis , france emmanuel petit saw it on the television , so he knew it must be true i saw people celebrating on the champselysees , he said i saw people celebrating in marseilles this vision confirmed his own empirical evidence , gained in the stade de france late last night , that france was indeed the world cup champion , the first new one in 20 years seconds after scoring the goal that wrapped up the 30 victory over weak and wobbly brazil , petit had seen more than 80 , 000 customers \( to say nothing of the volunteers and more than a few journalists \) cheering the home team for a victory that seemed twice as lopsided as the score the french people love to debate the fine points of anything , and their team represents them perfectly tonight was good , but most of the people were here because of the big corporations , said frank leboeuf , the shavenheaded defender who actually writes his own stuff for the times of london , where he plays for the chelsea club it was easy to support us because we were so good , but they are not the real fans there were moments after the game when the players seemed to be revvedup aerobics instructors , jumping up and down and clapping and doing the jane fonda , exhorting their fans to get the old heart muscle pumping but the people in the grandstands were surely on their feet , singing and moving in place i cannot wait to see the parade tomorrow , leboeuf said there was certainly a preview of today s parade in the clogged streets of this city , at the northern edge of paris the man who scored the first two goals , zinedine zidane , is of algerian heritage , and many immigrants from the third world who live in stdenis already regarded zidane as their surrogate brother or son the only thing i know is that the cup will stay in france for the next four years , zidane said we will be celebrating tomorrow , and i 'll be thinking about everyone tonight the residents of stdenis have seen this glorious stadium rise over them , when what they really need are jobs and housing and education , but last night zidane brought french people together in the street , making noise , sounding very much like fans everywhere and the name you heard most was zidane there has not been such a joyous world cup celebration outside a world cup stadium since 1978 , when argentina won on its home grounds argentina was also the sixth and most recent nation to win its first world cup now there are seven champions the world is getting a little bigger the powers in the world soccer body , known as fifa , have expanded the world cup from 24 to 32 teams , partially for political and financial reasons , but also to give representation to the marginal nations from regions other than europe and latin america so far , african and other nations have not been a factor late in the tournament , but equity comes in different forms france was playing a polyglot lineup that truly represented this nation men born in africa , men born in the caribbean , men of other european ancestry the racists and conservatives in france may hate this , but there is no denying that france was cheering all these men last night when marcel desailly , who was born in ghana , was sent off with his second yellow card with 22 minutes left , the military band , seated in the upper stands , began an informal rendition of marseillaise , a martial anthem that was first sung during a revolution if the din did not equal the denizens of the upper deck of madison square garden howling during the rangers' stanley cup championship of 1994 , it was lovely and moving in its own sweet nationalistic way , and maybe petit and leboeuf will see it that way down the road the national team of france accomplished so much in this tournament even scoring the first goal from the field during a world cup final since 1986 in 1990 , everybody settled for a late penalty kick because nobody wanted to see argentina and west germany bearwrestle each other anymore in 1994 , italy and brazil could manage nothing for 120 minutes before penalty kicks gave it to brazil in 1994 , brazil was lucky , said bebeto , the tiny brazilian forward in 1998 , france was lucky that depends on how you define luck france was the home team , but the players did not feel they were pushed by any outpouring of emotion and the french players did not feel there was anything lucky about ronaldo not being in the original starting lineup , then being restored shortly before game time brazilian team officials said tersely that ronaldo had not felt well in midday but was fine by game time some players suggested he had suffered more from nerves than indigestion the player who has been pumped up by his sportinggoods sponsor looked distant and weak , particularly on the two headers by zidane , but the french were having none of it whenever you play brazil , they can beat you so many ways , petit said maybe they were just playing with our minds brazil was n't playing much of anything , particularly soccer then the speaker system played that old french favorite , we are the champions , by queen outside on the highways , drivers honked their horns the people were making noise maybe the players will get into it soon photos zinedine zidane set france on the road to world cup victory 27 minutes into last night s game against brazil , heading in the first goal he repeated the maneuver 19 minutes later the goals were his first of the tournament the loss deflated the brazilians bebeto tried to console ronaldo \( associated press \) after zidane s second

the eastman kodak company will buy the imation corporation s medical imaging business for 520 million in cash , the companies announced yesterday the deal takes imation , a potpourri of imaging businesses spun off from the minnesota mining and manufacturing company in 1996 , out of a 535 million business that was strategically superfluous , even though it accounted for much of imation s recent growth and nearly a quarter of its 22 billion of revenues in 1997 this deal lets us focus more sharply on data storage and other workflow solutions , said william monahan , imation s chairman for kodak , the deal has symbolic as well as strategic value the photography giant has been shrinking this year , lopping employees and ancillary products as it labors to cut costs , fight erosion in consumer films and stanch its bleeding digital portfolio last month kodak burst out of its earnings doldrums , announcing a 35 percent gain in secondquarter earnings despite widespread applause on wall street kodak s stock rose 12 percent the day it released its earnings analysts cautioned that kodak still had to prove it could increase revenues they see the imation deal as providing such proof kodak is no longer on the defensive , but is buying more sales , said ulysses yannas , an analyst with mercer , bokert , buckman reid that is , in fact , how kodak executives characterized the deal this is another piece of the new kodak , one that is central to accelerating our growth , said daniel a carp , kodak s president jesse greene , kodak s vice president for finance , said , this demonstrates our willingness to enter transactions that have strategic value and are sound although few wall street naysayers emerged on the deal , positive reaction could not save kodak s stock from sliding in reaction to jitters about shaky economies in asia kodak shares closed at 8150 , down 2375 , yesterday shares of imation , which said it would use some of the 520 million to buy back stock , closed at 17375 , up 15625 for kodak , the acquisition comes none too soon although kodak commands about 30 percent of the global medical imaging market , most of its products are commoditytype xrays based on conventional film technology imation , in contrast , is a leader in the fastergrowing market for socalled dry laser imaging , a hybrid film and digital technology that translates digital readouts from magnetic resonance imaging machines and other diagnostic equipment directly onto film , without chemical processing kodak will introduce its own dry product in november , but as michael w ellmann , an analyst with schroder company , said , it would take a really superior mousetrap to displace imation in the dryprocess market all medical imaging companies are facing squeezed margins , as hospitals and managed care groups band together into huge purchasing cooperatives to force prices down kodak is no exception although health imaging provided 16 billion , or about 10 percent , of kodak s revenues last year , analysts say it provided a lower percentage of profits imation lost money in medical imaging last year , and barely broke even in the first quarter of 1998 kodak says the acquisition will not dilute its earnings , and will probably add to them after a year while kodak will not discuss jobparing plans , analysts say that job cuts will be made to keep imation from dragging down kodak s earnings it would take a really sharp increase in revenues for kodak to break even without cutting at least 10 percent of the combined staff , said jack l kelly , an analyst with goldman , sachs company as part of the deal , kodak will buy xray film from imation s plant in ferrania , italy , for two years the companies also settled a lawsuit in which kodak accused imation and 3m of buying trade secrets from a kodak employee in 1992 the settlement terms were undisclosed
washington , oct 8 following are excerpts from comments by members of the house today during its debate on a resolution to begin an impeachment inquiry against president clinton , as recorded by the federal news service , a private transcription service , and the new york times representative rick boucher democrat of virginia at the conclusion of this debate , i will offer a motion to recommit the resolution offered by the gentleman from illinois to the committee on the judiciary with the instruction that the committee immediately report back that resolution to the house with instructions that it contain our democratic alternative the democratic amendment is a resolution for a full and complete review by the judiciary committee of the material that has been presented to the house by the office of independent counsel the republican resolution also provides for that full and complete review the difference between the democratic and the republican approaches is only over the scope of the review , only over the time that the review will take and only over our insistence that the judiciary committee in conducting its process pay deference and become aware of the historical constitutional standard for impeachment that has evolved to us over the centuries and was recognized most recently by the judiciary committee in 1974 and then recognized by the full house of representatives the public interest requires a fair and deliberate inquiry in this matter our resolution provides for that fair and deliberate inquiry but the public interest also requires an appropriate boundary on the scope of the inquiry it should not become an invitation for a freeranging fishing expedition subjecting to a formal impeachment inquiry matters that are not before the congress today the potential for such a venture should be strictly limited by the resolution adopted today by the house and our democratic proposal contains those appropriate limits it would subject to the inquiry the material presented to us by the office of independent counsel , which is the only material before the house today the public interest also requires that the matter be brought to conclusion at the earliest possible time that is consistent with a thorough and a complete review the country has already undergone substantial trauma if the committee carries this work beyond the time that is reasonably needed to conduct its complete and thorough review , that injury to the nation will only deepen we should be thorough , but we should also be prompt given that the facts of this matter are generally wellknown , given that there are only a handful of witnesses who have relevant information that can be addressed in this inquiry , and given the further fact that all of those witnesses have already been the subject of extensive review by the grand jury and their testimony is available , this inquiry can , in fact , be prompt the committee s work should not extend into next year a careful and a thorough review can be accomplished between now and the end of this year , and our democratic resolution provides that appropriate limitation on time the resolution requires that the committee hold hearings on the constitutional standard for impeachment which was clearly stated in the conclusion of the committee s report in the watergate years of 1974 our substitute then directs that the committee compare the facts that are stated in the referral of the independent counsel to that historical constitutional standard and if any facts rise to the level of impeachable conduct , that material would then be subjected to the thorough inquiry and review process under the resolution that we are putting forth , the committee will begin its work on the 12th day of october that s next monday and will conclude all proceedings , including the consideration of recommendations during the month of december there would then be ample time for the house of representatives to consider those recommendations and conclude its work by the end of this year the procedure we 're recommending is fair it is thorough it is prompt it is a recommendation for an inquiry it would assure an appropriate scope it would give deference to the historical constitutional standard for impeachment and it would assure that this matter is put behind us so the nation can proceed with its very important business by the end of this year representative charles e schumer democrat of brooklyn mr speaker , this is a serious and solemn day and after a careful reading of the starr report and other materials submitted by the office of the independent counsel , as well as a study of the origins and history of the impeachment clause of the constitution , i have come to the conclusion that given the evidence before us , while the president deserves significant punishment , there is no basis for impeachment of the president and it is time to move on and solve the problems facing the american people like health care , education and protecting seniors' retirement
the federal communications commission will reject the bellsouth corporation s latest application to offer longdistance service in louisiana , people close to the process said yesterday the rejection , expected to be announced today , will surprise few in washington or in the telecommunications industry this latest petition , bellsouth s third , was generally given little chance to succeed even so , bellsouth came surprisingly closer to winning approval this time than it did in its earlier attempts the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits a bell company from selling longdistance phone services until it can convince the fcc that it has opened its local network to potential competitors the act contains a highly technical 14point checklist for the bells to meet before they win that approval in none of the first four applications two from bellsouth , one each from the ameritech corporation and sbc communications inc did the commission reach all 14 points , deeming each of the petitions so deficient in one or more of the areas that there was no need to consider all 14 this time , people close to the application process said that the commission did weigh the application against all 14 points , though it was fully satisfied that bellsouth had met only six the broad consensus in washington and in the telecommunications industry is that the only company with a serious chance of breaking the bells' 0for5 slump on longdistance petitions is the bell atlantic corporation in april , bell atlantic announced a tentative agreement with the justice department and with new york state regulators that would have them lend their support to a bell atlantic longdistance application for new york after the company passed a special networkopening test but that test , which is being coordinated by the consulting firm of kpmg peat marwick , is not going as smoothly as bell atlantic had anticipated the company originally said it would file its longdistance application for new york in october , but people close to the company now say that no such filing should be expected before midnovember a person close to the test said that part of the problem was that bell atlantic was having difficulty designing a system for letting competitors access its network that would work seamlessly across its original territory and that of the nynex corporation , which bell atlantic acquired last year
facing growing claims that they are displaying wartime plunder , the directors of the nation s top art museums are calling for the creation of a system to resolve potential ownership disputes none of us wants to have demonstrably stigmatized works of art hanging on our walls , said philippe de montebello , the director of the metropolitan museum of art , who is leading a 13member task force formed by the association of art museum directors , which includes the heads of the 170 largest art museums in north america the group will develop guidelines to resolve individual ownership claims arising from the seizure of artworks before , during and immediately after world war ii in washington , some members of congress are also growing concerned about the difficulties posed by potential claims the house banking committee has scheduled a hearing on looted art for feb 12 the museum association s position , described in a statement yesterday , promises no solution to the thicket of potential claims , but it was welcomed as a step forward they are admitting that there may be problems and that they want to try to solve them , said hector feliciano , the author of the lost museum the nazi conspiracy to steal the world s greatest works of art it s extremely positive mr feliciano , a parisbased journalist , contrasted the museum association s statement with the reaction of european museums to claims of looting made by former art owners or their heirs , and to publication of books like his in europe , such charges were seen as an insult , he said , and museums in france , in holland , in spain have not admitted publicly that they have looted art , even though they 've given some back yet the problem is complex , not simply a matter of restitution for nazi looting , mr de montebello said museums also have legal obligations and responsibilities to the public as well as to individuals who unwittingly donated the artworks in recent months , claims have been made for paintings in the seattle art museum and the metropolitan and for a monotype borrowed for study by the art institute of chicago from a trustee questions also surfaced recently about an artwork in the collection of the museum of fine arts in boston and two paintings by egon schiele that were on loan at the museum of modern art from the leopold museum in vienna have been kept in new york by a grand jury subpoena , pending the outcome of a criminal investigation of their ownership the modern , citing contractual obligations to return the paintings , has moved to quash the subpoena , and the manhattan district attorney s office is scheduled to respond to the modern s motion on monday some experts believe that hundreds , if not thousands , of looted works hang in american museums or in the homes of collectors but mr de montebello said , we simply do n't know how big the problem is , adding that he did not think it was huge claims are expected to increase , however , partly because of two new organizations last fall , the world jewish congress established the commission for art recovery , overseen by ronald s lauder , the cosmetics heir and chairman of the modern , to help people recover art seized in wartime the b'nai b'rith klutznick national jewish museum in washington , meanwhile , set up the holocaust art restitution project to create a database of jewish cultural losses the museum directors' proposed solution would likely involve a mediation or arbitration panel or some other forum for resolving disputes there is a need for an independent panel , said ned rifkin , the director of the high museum of art in atlanta , who as chairman of the association s art issues committee appointed the task force we ca n't do this ourselves it has to come from a larger context than museum directors we 're doing what we can to initiate something neither mr rifkin nor mr de montebello would speculate on an appropriate sponsor of the panel mr rifkin said the issue would be taken up by the task force , whose members include the directors of the largest museums in new york , boston , chicago , cleveland , philadelphia and seattle it expects to have initial recommendations in june we will discuss and arrive at a set of guidelines to let members deal with this in the same way , within a range , mr de montebello said looking ahead , mr feliciano said , i hope the task force will help create an international independent arbitration commission to help solve these problems it should be composed of international experts , both european and american this could avoid astronomical legal fees and a witch hunt while the specter of looted art has loomed over museums for a few years , at least , the dimensions of the problem are just sinking in this has ramifications potentially for all museums , not only those that may have stolen art , mr rifkin said because of the loan situation , the case at the modern has ramifications for all of us the house banking committee is also sizing up the problem but not considering legislation , for now the hearing is informational , to give a sense of what the problem looks like from the museum directors' standpoint , said one committee staff member who insisted on anonymity we want to know how much art is out there , what precautions do museums take , does the incident at the museum of modern art place a chill on art exchanges , the difficulties in establishing provenance and the moralversusthelegal responsibilities and , he added , we 'll ask them to tell us if they see a role for government in this in addition to mr de montebello and mr lauder , others testifying at the hearing include glenn d lowry , the director of the modern earl a powell 3d , the director of the national gallery of art james n wood , the director of the art institute of chicago gilbert s edelson , the administrative vice president of the art dealers association of america , and stephen e weil , an emeritus senior scholar at

buxton , nc when children dream their candycane dreams of spiralstriped lighthouses standing sentry above a sinister sea , the cape hatteras lighthouse is the one they imagine at 208 feet , it is the tallest and most majestic of an estimated 850 lighthouses in the united states although it serves little navigational purpose for today s electronically equipped mariners , its flashing beacon a pair of 1 , 000watt lamps that rotate every 15 seconds can still be detected for 24 nautical miles on a starry night no one appreciates the sentimental tug of the lighthouse more than the residents of north carolina s outer banks just as their seafaring ancestors depended on the beacon to guide them through the treacherous shallows of diamond shoals , so today s outer bankers rely on the light to lure the tourists that fill their crab shacks and clapboard motels and so it is understandable that this area is uneasy about a daring plan by the national park service to protect the 2 , 800ton lighthouse from the encroaching sea by lifting it in one piece with hydraulic jacks and moving it slowly on dollies along a track into the brush 2 , 900 feet away in congress , the 98 million needed to move the lighthouse , a project slated to begin as soon as next spring , is the subject of a battle between two conservative republican lawmakers who rarely disagree in june , senator lauch faircloth of north carolina secured approval from the appropriations committee for the financing , which had been recommended by president clinton but in the house , representative walter b jones jr , who represents the outer banks , has responded to overwhelming sentiment on the barrier islands against the move mr jones has kept money for the move out of the house bill , but he also failed to win financing for a lessexpensive alternative plan to build a jetty that would temporarily protect the lighthouse where it is the difference between the bills leaves the fate of the lighthouse to a housesenate conference committee that is expected to meet in september here in buxton , where the beacon attracts 250 , 000 visitors a year , locals worry that the lighthouse will crumble if it is moved , leaving their tourist trade in a heap of a million bricks to emphasize the meaning of the sentinel to their community , they relate childhood memories of drifting to sleep to the soothing blink of the lamp through their bedroom windows middleage men reminisce about romancing tourist girls from atop the lighthouse , where the corkscrew ascent up 248 steps is rewarded with a pelican s view of the impressionist seascape below even if the lighthouse survives a move , islanders like daniel c couch , a buxton servicestation owner and cochairman of the dare county lighthouse committee , argue that its integrity will be lost the men who kept this light were required to stay in the lighthouse in hurricanes , in nor'easters , in all conditions , he said now 100 years later we 're going to turn tail and run \? each year , churning currents and violent storms erode the hatteras island shoreline by an average of 10 feet when the lighthouse was built in 1870 , it stood 1 , 500 feet from the sea today , fewer than 120 feet of sand and dunes separate the light from the waves without action , scientists believe , seawater will soon invade the freshwater pocket that protects the yellow pine timbers beneath the granite base , exposing the foundation to dry rot and worms few here question that the lighthouse should be saved , although some believe it would be more dignified for it to be taken by the sea than by an engineer s miscalculation certainly the image of the lighthouse is one that tugs on everyone s heartstrings , said jan deblieu , an outer banks writer whose book wind \( houghton mifflin , 1998 \) discusses the impact of climate on the islands but it s like everything else that s built along this coast it s ultimately doomed to fall in even the plan to move the lighthouse 1 , 600 feet from the sea is considered a temporary fix officials with the national park service , which owns the lighthouse as part of the cape hatteras national seashore , predict it would preserve the building for 100 years , an estimate that critics call optimistic the alternative plan , which calls for a steel jetty , or groin , that would extend 500 feet into the ocean , would save the lighthouse for 15 to 30 years , experts say but that proposal , with an estimated cost of 5 million to 6 million , has run afoul of a state regulation that prohibits the construction of seawalls , jetties and other beachhardening structures on the outer banks , where ocean currents run north to south , such structures may build up sand deposits temporarily on the north side of a groin but they also eat away coastline on the south side and ultimately cause erosion of the entire beach , environmental advocates say although the state can grant exemptions to its coastal protection rules , it has done so only in rare instances where there is no clear alternative for protecting historic sites or bridges the state has shown no interest in granting an exemption in this case like other environmentalists , todd l miller , the executive director of the north carolina coastal federation , believes that an exemption would undermine north carolina s coastal area management act , a national model he said it would soon encourage people up and down the coast to seek exemptions to protect their houses and vital roads two studies , one by the national academy of sciences in 1988 and one by a faculty committee at north carolina state university in 1997 , concluded that moving the lighthouse was the best option for saving it the company selected to engineer the move , the international chimney corporation of williamsville , ny , has moved three lighthouses in the last five years , but none compare in height or weight to the tower at cape hatteras the largest , the block island lighthouse in rhode island , is less than a third as tall nonetheless , international chimney and the national park service express complete confidence such reassurances do little to assuage the fears of tourists like jesse l davis jr , a 45yearold engineer from cary , ill , who has been visiting the lighthouse for 20 years it 'll crumble , he predicted while visiting on a brilliant day you know , man is very arrogant and he thinks he can do anything and sometimes he just gets slapped in the face he paused boy , he said , it would break my heart not to be able to bring my daughter back here and climb to the top photos stay or retreat \?

moscow , sept 13 vladislav bulakhov and his young 16piece chamber orchestra were a big hit when they performed at the prestigious moscow conservatory this month the seats were sold out the concert hall reverberated with ovations yet the seasons , as the orchestra is known , walked away without a kopeck to show for its polished performance all the ticket sales went to pay the rent for the concert hall russia s artists have never had it easy with the ruble gyrating like a yoyo , their already difficult existence has become even more tenuous corporate sponsors have vanished wellpaid gigs for business have dried up prices have soared but russians are still flocking to concerts , and mr bulakhov s orchestra is determined to survive this is how it gets by dmitri dolganov , a slender 25yearold cellist who sports a ponytail , earns about 150 to 250 a month from the his work in the orchestra barely enough to cover his rent so he plays his cello for handouts in an underground passage near the metro stop for the lenin library , a stone s throw from the kremlin , sometimes earning as little as 30 rubles a day 2 to 3 at current exchange rates aleksandr balashov , who plays the viola , lives with his parents and younger brother in a threeroom apartment , and works afterhours at recording studios for 10 to 15 a session mr balashov , 25 , uses his modest income to help support the family lyudmila ryzhova , 45 , the first violinist , gives music lessons for paltry sums the success of this orchestra is the main goal in my life , she said matteroffactly i will do everything so that it can survive none of them find anything extraordinary about the daily struggle to get by this is not just how many of russia s superbly trained music students live it is also how many performers make it after they arrive people who are driven by music have a way to deal with these difficult times , said mark algalbiyants , a bearded 37yearold from yerevan , armenia , who plays the double bass when we play , we are carried away from these problems we live beyond our problems four hours a day russia s economic and political convulsions have not shaken its position as a cultural superpower moscow has worldclass operas its theaters are packed russian parents still send their children to music schools , where they attack their instrument with iron discipline when moscow s stock market was soaring and russian companies were competing to buy stateowned enterprises , the miniboom helped buoy performing artists now that the bubble has burst , life is tougher than ever this is not to say things have ever been easy for the seasons when mr bulakhov founded his orchestra in 1994 , he knew he would have to improvise to get by the orchestra practices in a weatherbeaten house of culture at a moscow factory a building used in soviet times for cultural activities it repays the factory by giving free performances to perform in moscow s prestigious tchaikovsky conservatory , the orchestra must pay the rent in advance 2 , 000 for an evening at the small auditorium and 5 , 000 in the large , ornate concert hall , dominated by portraits of the great composers a soldout performance barely covers the rent the orchestra makes money only when banks and other sponsors help pick up the tab it plays even when sponsors cannot be found , however , for prestige raising ticket prices is not an option some of the best seats in the house can be had for about 2 to 3 our fans are from the middle class and intelligentsia , mr bulakhov said to spend 30 rubles a ticket is quite a lot for a family to get by , the orchestra has occasionally secured credits from mosconcert and persuaded russian companies to help underwrite its cd recordings sometimes the orchestra backs up a celebrated russian or foreign soloist , earning about 100 for effort occasionally , it has played at receptions or concerts for russian banks few members of the 16member orchestra try to live on their small orchestra proceeds some play in several orchestras at a time , hoping to join foreign tours , where they can receive 30 to 40 a day kirill anisimov , 28 , who plays the viola , came to moscow from petrozavodsk , northwest of the capital he used to make 200 a month playing for business groups since the ruble collapsed last month , however , he has not received any offers people sometimes say that real artists should be hungry , he said i guess the permanent crisis in russia breeds good artists still , a musician should have clothes and be fed the 30yearold mr bulakhov is married to a musician and has two young daughters after he graduated from one of russia s best music schools , his father taught him how to be a conductor his family , however , has never been rich and he is not panicked by the latest crisis now that the ruble is over , there is nothing left to buy , he quips his major problem now is arranging a performance in late october to inaugurate the new concert season it will feature beethoven , tchaikovsky and one of the city s most promising young pianists that is , if mr bulakhov can raise the 5 , 000 for the the concert hall he is persuaded , however , that one way or another the concert will proceed it will take place anyway , he said there is such a thing as trust in russia they may allow us to pay them back later photo a cellist and a violist of the

south bend , ind , aug 13 the university of notre dame has made cultural icons of the four horsemen , knute rockne and the gipper over 110 years its football teams have captured 11 national titles and produced 77 allamericans , all while maintaining a nearperfect graduation rate in short , notre dame football has become the touchstone for all that is good and right about collegiate athletics , and it has served as the very public soul for the 156yearold university revered as the pinnacle of higher learning for catholic america but as the team began practicing today for this season , which begins on sept 5 against defending national champion michigan , notre dame holds a tenuous grip on its hallowed place in the american sports consciousness its oncepristine reputation has been battered by an agediscrimination lawsuit filed by a former assistant coach that featured sordid testimony about the program , and an ncaa review of violations involving gifts to players while no one is accusing the fighting irish of being what s bad and wrong about college football , the developments have led many to wonder whether the team with the best winning percentage in college football history is really any different from any other program trying to compete at a multimilliondollar industry s highest level it seems to me that the people in charge did n't understand that one of their duties was to protect the name of their institution , said richard lieberman , the lawyer who successfully represented the former coach , joe moore , in the agediscrimination suit they decided to put at risk the whole public perception of who they are was notre dame any different than any other football team in the 90 s \? probably not the names of coaches and players change , but it s the name notre dame that provides the mystique in my view , they have taken a hit they may never recover from moore s suit was indeed a blow to the school s image in depositions and testimony , witnesses detailed bitter fighting and backstabbing among the staff of the former head coach lou holtz , as well as physical abuse by coaches against players earlier this month the national collegiate athletic association found that notre dame committed two violations involving trips and gifts given to five former and five current players by a 28yearold south bend woman today the woman , kimberly dunbar , pleaded guilty to two counts of embezzling more than 1 million from her south bend employer none of the players have been implicated in the criminal proceeding but along with dunbar , five former team members , including one who has a 2yearold child with her , have been named as defendants in a civil suit besides demoralizing many of the school s 100 , 000 alumni , the revelations have been greeted with glee by critics who were put off by the sometimes holierthanthou nature of the team s zealous national following their satisfaction is no doubt enhanced by the school s failing football fortunes , which included a 76 record last season under the firstyear coach bob davie notre dame coaches , players and administrators find themselves in an uncomfortable and contradictory position while insisting that they are no different from other programs , they are trying not to distance themselves too much from the notre dame mystique , a phenomenon worth a fiveyear , 45 million nbc television deal , the only one of its kind , and a rabid national following i get concerned when people hold notre dame up as if we operate at a different standard , said the rev e william beauchamp , the university s executive vice president , who oversees athletics if everybody says notre dame s standard is different from everyone else s , then i do n't like what that has to say about intercollegiate athletics but athletic director michael wadsworth concedes that the extraordinary media attention notre dame receives , combined with its strong academic reputation and rich football heritage , have fostered higher expectations in both performance and conduct it s a mixed blessing , he said i 'd rather have it than not it s what makes us unique it also sets us up to be knocked down what prompted this internal dialogue about notre dame s responsibility and opened the program up to national ridicule was the 13 million lawsuit filed by moore , a 66yearold offensive line coach whom davie fired after the 1996 season moore contended he was let go because of his age , and a united states district court jury in lafayette , ind , agreed , awarding him more than 86 , 000 on friday , moore s lawyers will file for their costs 500 , 000 in fees and 100 , 000 in expenses and further compensation for moore of up to 350 , 000 and will ask to have him reinstated a judge will decide on the issues as early as october the case has been costly to the fighting irish s reputation the university countered moore s suit by claiming he was physically abusive to players and confrontational with fellow coaches stacks of wellpublicized depositions and trial testimony provided a look at the rancor
the colonial theater in canaan was the center of the town s social life when it opened in 1923 there were silent movies , vaudeville , dances in the upstairs ballroom and civic events on stage , including local high school graduations the plush decorations and silk damask wall coverings led to it being called little radio city only traces of that grandeur are still in evidence when the owner and operator of the theater , shirley boscardin , died in january of 1997 , movies were shown for two more nights , then the colonial closed since then the structure has been on the market , out of reach for most investors , not because of the price , but because of the expense of renovating and bringing the building up to code that s when a group of local people got involved nick stuller , a businessman , had read about the plight of the theater in the newspapers he held a preliminary meeting with jason sheckley , former projectionist at the colonial a group of 75 citizens , calling themselves the colonial community theater group inc , placed a binder on the property on april 25 , 1998 since then the numbers have grown to 140 , the group has gotten nonprofit status , and their plans have begun to take shape the berkshire taconic community foundation is the parent nonprofit , explained mr stuller , who is director of national sales with national regulatory services in lakeville they 'll be a guiding light and give us fundraising ideas the longterm plan is to bring back the theater and the ballroom and make use of the two adjacent retail locations the group s binder is on the theater only , and not on the adjacent parking lot the total price for both is 249 , 000 we need 156 , 000 total , 140 , 000 for the theater and 16 , 000 to cover operating expenses during the first year , mr stuller said six to 12 months later we 'll buy the parking lot but first we probably need about 1 million to totally renovate the theater the group intends to restore both theater and ballroom to their original grandeur once they have purchased the parking lot they will build a new theater with two screens the colonial s architectural integrity wo n't be touched , mr stuller said the two storefronts that sit on either side of the grand entrance might be used for a food concession and or retail purposes the colonial was built as the casino in 1923 , a birthday present from seth mosely for his young wife movies had become increasingly popular in larger cities and the casino was an immediate success doublewide doors lead into the foyer a carpeted stairway lured visitors up to the ballroom with its rows of windows looking out over the marquee and the street the theater itself , filled today with 400 tattered seats , still has what is probably the biggest curved screen in northwest connecticut and the projection room , equipped with carbon arc projectors , delivers the quality that more modern theaters do , only on manual equipment purchased decades ago according to a brief history written by mr sheckley , the casino featured vaudeville shows and silent movies , with musical accompaniment by miss kegler , the local piano teacher one canaan resident , vivian strekas , recounted going to see the 1924 version of peter pan , starring betty bronson , ernest torrence and anna may wong , with 15 pennies to buy her ticket although the colonial , as it has been known since 1932 , continued in business until 1997 , business gradually declined a flood damaged the basement in 1955 in the mid 1970 s , the theater was forced to switch from firstrun movies to secondrun films more repairs were deferred still the colonial retains the spacious auditorium so unusual in movie theaters today , the 32foot screen compares with a more usual 15 to 20 feet , and the equipment , stateoftheart in its time , delivers highquality sound and picture , without automation mr sheckley , who works as a photographer writer at the wassaic development center , in wassaic , ny , has spent his spare time as a projectionist in various theaters since the early 1970 s his history of the colonial , photographs of the building , and interviews in local papers were largely responsible for gathering support for the project although the 140 participants in the colonial theater plan do n't actually expect to make money , they do hope to provide area residents with interesting leisuretime activities our business plan will help us know what the communities will bear , just like any other business we will hire consultants for market surveys , mr stuller explained there s not a lot to do around here , and to be able to sit in a big screen theater with a plush environment that used to be known as 'little radio city , ' is great this becomes more of an experience , explained mr sheckley it s not just like going to a movie canaan , he added , has 2 , 500 residents , but within a 15mile radius there are 45 , 000 people , probably just enough to support three screens with firstrun movies you have to commit to six weeks , mr sheckley added with three screens you have the potential to have first runs , plus a couple other films both men see the project as revitalizing canaan , a town that economic development passed by if we do this it 'll build up the rest of the town , said mr stuller canaan is a blighted downtown , added mr sheckley i 'd like to see the theater open lots of hours to get people used to being here right now , mr stuller and mr sheckley are busying themselves with raising funds and gathering information about necessary renovations we 've already hired a structural engineer , and the building is in good shape , mr stuller said but it needs a 50 , 000 repair job for footings once the building is purchased they will use one of the storefronts for a business office as they embark on renovations and additional fund raising a model of the renovated theater has been built for a display other than structural repairs , initial efforts will focus on the marquee and greek revival facade in three to four months we should identify the numbers , get the studies done and start the work , mr stuller said our biggest concern is to come up to code and get it open right away , mr sheckley said there is no zoning in canaan , and this building could become anything , but it means more to people as a theater so many old buildings have been lost to development it was important to save this the colonial community theater group inc is owned by the 140 community members who have volunteered funds or sweat equity we benchmarked this off about a dozen other projects around the country , mr stuller said the revitalization of the warner theater in torrington has been the result of a similar community effort , but features live performances rather than movies in canaan , members of the colonial group include weekend residents , tradespeople , even people who used to work at the colonial in the 1940 s , mr sheckley explained none of us are in it for the money , but for the community , added mr stuller it needs to be done people do n't have enough to do around here this project will benefit the people doing it , plus so

beryozovsky , russia , sept 12 the soviet union leveled the conifers and birches of the west siberian taiga and threw up this town 34 years ago for one reason only the redandwhite sign at the outskirts , under the drawing of a coalcutting tool emblazoned on a birch leaf , sums it up city of miners' glory the sign is a lie there is no glory here , just unrelieved bleakness bleakness , and talk of revolt beryozovsky s coal mines are a shambles two are closed the remaining three are halfdead , ravaged by bungling or thievery or economic malaise some miners have not been paid for three years unable to get meat or butter , the city welfare office hands out cookies and candy to throngs of desperate mothers winter , when brown bears roam the streets and the mercury sinks to 55 degrees below zero fahrenheit , begins in a month many dread its approach if the situation does n't stabilize , anything may happen , said tatyana a maslova , who lives with her husband , 16yearold daughter and 12yearold son in one of the many faceless concreteslab tenements so far , there are food and produce in the shops but without salaries , we may not be able to buy them ms maslova s surreal job 12 hours a day , three days a week is to answer the telephone at the biryulinskaya deepshaft mine the mine has been closed for eight months now she has not been paid since 1996 this way of life does n't have a name , she said actually , it does people here call it capitalism , and most of them long openly for something else anything that will make their existence bearable again president boris n yeltsin , who rode to power in 1991 on a promise to improve the coal miners' lot , is reviled now as the architect of their ruin but in truth , politics is not much discussed in beryozovsky survival , by any and all means , is the great obsession life is not like this everywhere in russia , or even in most places coal miners have suffered economic hardship more than most , and this swath of central russia just a few hundred miles north of mongolia , known as the kuzbas , is among the hardest hit of all the mining regions still , a few days in beryozovsky make it depressingly clear how little the nation s lurch toward a market economy has progressed , and how close it has moved instead to the ragged edge of political upheaval it s truly a human disaster on a major scale , said one official of the world bank , which has poured 900 million in loans into efforts to help close outdated mines and assist laidoff workers indeed , by now russia s coal mines were supposed to be mr yeltsin s shining example of capitalist reform at work under the old soviet union , russia s 250 or so coal mines resembled the american coal industry of the 1940 s or 50 s huge and politically potent but atrophied by old methods , makework jobs and outdated machinery mines worked with little concern for cost and none for profit , simply extracting and shipping whatever tonnage moscow ordered by some calculations , it could cost two and three times as much to mine a ton of coal as it might have sold for in a free market mr yeltsin s ascendancy ushered in that free market forced either to make the industry competitive or to dismantle it , the government chose both mr yeltsin ordered up plans to slash the number of mines from 250 to 60 , lay off up to twothirds of the 900 , 000 workers and transfer the remaining mines to private owners the blow was cushioned by a safety net up to 2 billion a year in government aid for wages , pensions and subsidies to moneylosing mines the world bank lent 500 million in 1996 for the safety net , and has since agreed to lend 800 million more in keeping with mr yeltsin s political debt to the miners , no industry except perhaps farming has gotten more attention and money the hope was that a slimmer , profithungry coal sector would mine and sell russia s almost bottomless coal reserves at worldbeating prices and create more jobs for everyone the reality is seen here in the kuzbas , a rolling , thickly forested basin in southwestern siberia that is home to moose , boar , bear from a river valley less than half the size of west virginia , russia extracts more than 36 percent of its coal and , perhaps , an equally large share of its labor unrest the kuzbas was the wellspring of miners' strikes in 1989 and 1991 that eventually toppled mikhail s gorbachev and brought mr yeltsin to the presidency it has been the center of strikes this summer by miners who blocked the transsiberian railroad to protest the lack of wages and eventually to call for mr yeltsin s resignation russians found coal here along the banks of the tom river in the early 1700 s , and the french began largescale mining in the early 1900 s but it was soviet economists who built the entire region s economy around coal , erecting a huge aluminum smelter and two steel mills to soak up production and setting up scores of satellite businesses , from miners' lamps to bulldozers , in kuzbas towns
berlin for 10 years or so , dietmar arnold has been seriously , heavily into the underground not the political or musical underground , but the physical underground the tunnels , caverns , bunkers , sewers and cavities that , he says , provide a subterranean history of berlin that may soon be lost under the city s gargantuan rebuilding here , mr arnold , a 33yearold city planner , says as he prods at the charts and diagrams that adorn a recently published book on the subject , are the places where hitler and eva braun took refuge here are the underground postal tubes that moved mail at a brisk 100 yards per minute the forerunner of the fax and here are places where spies dwelt and wouldbe escapees from communism found molelike routes to freedom the latest discovery mr arnold has chronicled , photographed and measured , though , raised other issues the city authorities recently discovered the bunker that ran underneath the villa built for josef goebbels , hitler s propaganda supremo and , embarrassingly enough , they also discovered that it ran perilously close to another site the projected location of berlin s contentious memorial to the jews of europe slain in the holocaust the newest discovery of goebbels s bunker has opened a new argument that mr arnold puts like this if the dreadful results of nazi genocide are to be eternalized in stone , then should not the sites of nazi planning also be preserved \? it is one of berlin s quirks that while other cities like paris and moscow have more extensive subterranean networks , and while yet others , like new york , boast deeper tunnels , none of those cities is being rebuilt as berlin is and given berlin s history bombed and battered in world war ii , and divided by a sterile death strip and later a wall it is no surprise that the metropolis is rising atop what hitler had planned as a 1 , 000year reich what is amazing enough is that no one had previously thought of exploring the earth underneath the former governmental quarter of the onetime imperial capital , wrote a journalist , wilfried mommert it is also true that berlin is already freckled with monuments to that era among them the wannsee villa on the city s outskirts where the planning for holocaust was finalized in january 1942 , and the sachsenhausen concentration camp yet the location of goebbels s bunker provides almost a metaphor for postwar germany even as the nation craves a future in which it can come to terms with its modern history , it is undermined by the past thus , mr arnold said , historical records show that berlin once boasted some 600 bunkers used for a variety of purposes , particularly to protect against allied air raids during the war so far , only 480 have been opened , measured and chronicled , he said there are some bunkers that are important for the history of the city , and it s important that they should n't disappear because they reflect the entire epoch , he said in the area near the projected holocaust memorial , he counted off a series of underground installations hitler s personal bunker , now covered by a parking lot the bunker beneath hitler s new chancellery building , now covered by a grassy knoll , and the bunker used by official drivers building the holocaust memorial is not enough , mr arnold said around here were all the people who organized the holocaust but people just want to destroy the bunkers and sweep the whole thing under the carpet some would argue , by contrast , that the authorities do not really know what to do with these embarrassments from the past in 1992 , journalists but not the general public were allowed to enter some bunkers , which were then sealed according to mr arnold , the bunker where hitler and his mistress spent the final days of the war before their suicide was filled in by the east german authorities on exactly the spot where a distinctive ventilation tower once stood over hitler s personal concrete lair , mr arnold said , there now stands a portable toilet used by construction workers photo dietmar arnold in one of the berlin bunkers that include the newly discovered bunker of josef goebbels the sign says , no smoking \( frieder salm for the new york times \)

poughkeepsie , ny , july 10 the jurors in the tawana brawley defamation case deliberated for a second full day without reaching a verdict , but sent signals today that they were working hard to find answers to the 11yearold questions posed by the case in three notes to the judge , s barrett hickman of state supreme court , the jurors asked questions that showed they were grappling with some of the complex legal issues presented by the suit the plaintiff , steven a pagones , a former assistant district attorney , is seeking 400 million in damages because he was accused of rape in 1987 by three advisers to ms brawley the rev al sharpton , c vernon mason and alton h maddox jr mr pagones was exonerated by a grand jury and filed the suit in 1988 one juror s note asked whether they must find for the defense if an adviser s statement included some sentences that the jurors deemed defamatory but one that they did not justice hickman answered that the legal requirement that the jurors find a statement was defamatory by a preponderance of the evidence meant the jurors should look at the language of each statement as a whole in context and determine whether it was defamatory the decision , justice hickman said , did not focus on how many sentences in each statement were defamatory the jurors also asked for a repeat of the legal definition of preponderance of the evidence , the legal standard they must apply to answer some of the more than 100 questions on a 37page verdict sheet for mr pagones to prevail on each of 22 separate statements by the advisers that he asserts were defamatory , five or six questions concerning each statement must be answered in the affirmative by five of the six jurors the jurors could decide that none or all of the statements were defamatory , or could find that some statements by some of the advisers were defamatory and others were not the third of the substantive questions the jurors asked today showed an attention to detail that both sides in the case obviously found impressive although the lawyers and the judge had spent days preparing the verdict form , the jury foreman wrote the judge suggesting that in the 92d and 97th questions on the verdict sheet the court had referred to mr maddox when it meant mr sharpton the judge made the correction although jurors have gone home each night and on weekends during the seven months of the trial , they are scheduled to deliberate saturday after the jurors were sequestered thursday , court officials said the jury would deliberate through the weekend but at the request of the defense today , justice hickman ruled that if there is no verdict saturday , deliberations will not take place on sunday because of religious observances , though the jury will remain sequestered

a week after convicting a former jail guard of firstdegree murder for killing three people during a robbery , a brooklyn jury is to return to court tuesday to begin deciding whether he should live or die in the next stage of the first death penalty trial under new york state s threeyearold capital punishment law , the jury that convicted darrel k harris , 40 , in the 1996 killings at an illegal social club in bedfordstuyvesant , brooklyn , will now hear what one of his lawyers called the more positive things about him the additional testimony about socalled mitigating factors will be an attempt to show that mr harris s life is a life worth saving , the lawyer , russell neufeld , said friday the last execution in new york state was carried out in 1963 in 1984 , the state s highest court , the court of appeals , declared the remaining provision of the state s previous capital punishment law unconstitutional among the arguments the defense is expected to make in the trial s penalty stage , which is expected to take about a week , are that mr harris s outburst of violence was out of character , and the act of a deeply disturbed drug abuser who snapped mitigating factors under the law can include mr harris s state of mind at the time of the killings , as well as any positive aspects of his background and character they are to be weighed against the aggravating factors that the killings were multiple and were committed during a robbery the defense conceded in the first part of the trial that mr harris had shot two of the victims in the head after ordering them to lie on the floor , and fatally stabbed the third but they also stressed that he had no previous criminal record and in the 1980 s was publicly honored as a hero for saving a fellow new york city correction officer during an inmate riot at a brooklyn jail the lawyers argued that mr harris , who was forced to resign from the correction department in 1991 because of his drug use , killed his victims while in a state of extreme emotional disturbance , making his acts manslaughter , which does not carry a possible death sentence the defense lawyers held that the emotional disturbance stemmed from a deeply troubled life that included beatings by mr harris s mother in childhood , as well as job losses , drug and alcohol abuse and the traumatic effects of the 1986 jail riot while the jurors one of whom said her first husband had been killed in a shooting did not accept these arguments for the purpose of convicting mr harris of the lesser crime of manslaughter , his lawyers say they hope that the arguments bolstered by new testimony about his positive attributes will persuade the jury to spare his life mr neufeld said that in addition to a psychologist who had not testified earlier in the trial , the witnesses would include mr harris s relatives and former coworkers , including the jail guard he saved , thomas cinquemani mr cinquemani is expected to describe how mr harris used his own body to absorb the blows of inmates who knocked down mr cinquemani and beat and kicked him but most of the character testimony will be far less dramatic , mr neufeld said , and will deal with such matters as how mr harris was a considerate human being and helped people with their needs in more daytoday kind of stuff mr neufeld declined to provide further details , but said , we 'll be making an effort to humanize him to the jury another defense witness will be a social worker who is a socalled mitigation specialist , one of the corps of professionals that has arisen in many of the 38 states with capital punishment laws they collect a defendant s school and other records , interview his family and friends and put together what another lawyer for mr harris , colleen brady , called a kind of psychosocial assessment and portrayal of a client s life history the presentation planned by mr harris s lawyers is typical of what should be done and certainly is not always done in offering mitigating evidence in capital cases across the country , said deborah denno , a death penalty expert at fordham university law school while mitigating evidence is supposed to be considered in the penalty phases of capital cases , defense lawyers in many of these cases do n't put forth enough mitigating evidence and in some cases offer none at all , incredible as it seems , professor denno said the great majority of death penalty cases do n't have these resources going into them , she said of mr harris s team of lawyers from the legal aid society and the specialists aiding them another death penalty expert , james r acker , a professor of criminal justice at the state university of new york at albany , said that research on death sentences that have been imposed in other states suggested that mr harris had points on his side that could somewhat offset the brutal images of the killings as the jurors weighed a penalty the testimony in the first stage of the trial showed that in addition to putting bullets into the heads of two of the victims after ordering them to lie on the floor as well as into the head of another man who survived mr harris stabbed his third victim , a woman who begged in vain for him to spare her because i have five babies to take care of in the absence of other explanations for such brutal acts , mr acker said , jurors believe a defendant did it out of pure evil the evidence to be offered in mitigation could make mr harris seem to the jury less of an individual who has no semblance of humanity , the professor said whether the jurors will accept this evidence as mitigating factors remains to be seen the prosecutors , jonathan frank and heide mason , can not only crossexamine the defense witnesses , but can also present their own witnesses to rebut them in order to sentence mr harris to death by lethal injection , the jurors must unanimously agree beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors if the jury does prescribe execution , years of appeals are expected
san juan , dec 14 puerto rico s prostatehood governor said today that he would continue pressing congress to address what he termed puerto rico s colonial situation despite a referendum in which most voters seemed to indicate they did not want change gov pedro j rossello had hoped to use a statehood victory to prod congress into authorizing a binding vote on statehood , but that effort was set back on sunday when voters faced with five alternatives chose none of the above that option was promoted by supporters of the current commonwealth relationship with the united states as a protest against ballot language that they said unfairly portrayed the status quo in order to erode its support but while both anger at an election process designed by the ruling prostatehood new progressive party and support for commonwealth helped pushed the vote for none of the above to a 502 percent majority , political analysts here say that option also sheltered those who feared statehood as too drastic a change and those resentful of governor rossello s style of governing the governor himself said he thought voters rejected him more than the statehood option for such decisions as the sale of a majority stake of the governmentowned telephone company to a private consortium this year , which led to a bitter strike by telephone workers whatever the interpretation , the vote left clear only that puerto ricans remain sharply split on whether to change their island s centuryold relationship with the united states and that more than half the electorate does not yet want statehood to members of congress like senator bob graham , a democrat from florida who regards commonwealth as a transitional status , sunday s referendum underscored the necessity of having a congressionally approved referendum based on a series of choices congress is prepared to implement a bill that set the terms for such a vote was approved by the house this year but stalled in the senate , where mr graham was among the cosponsors putting the best spin possible on the outcome of sunday s vote , governor rossello and leaders of his new progressive party have claimed victory for statehood because none of the above specified no status preference statehood lost to none of the above 465 percent to 502 percent but won over three other status options independence , which received 25 percent of the vote , and the boycotted commonwealth and free association , which each got less than 1 percent free association was defined on the ballot as a form of independence that delegates certain powers , such as defense , to the united states under treaties governor rossello said that only statehood , independence and free association can be considered permanent solutions to a status quo he and other statehood supporters say deny puerto rico s 38 million residents the same rights and obligations of american citizens on the mainland i'm going to say congress and president , respond to these results , governor rossello , speaking at a news conference , said of his next step we have to push for a final definition , a solution that is not colonial a solution that has to ultimately be either independence or statehood but that urgency is not shared by leaders of the procommonwealth popular democratic party , who called sunday s vote a rejection of statehood and of the governor s efforts in washington to promote the perception that most puerto ricans are unhappy with the fundamentals of their status the mayor of san juan , sila m calderon , the popular democrats' possible gubernatorial candidate for 2000 , said today that another status referendum was not a priority for her party at this time the impression that has been given outside puerto rico is that we live in crisis or that we feel like secondclass citizens and that is not so , ms calderon said at her own news conference today ms calderon said the party leadership is not against another vote on selfdetermination as long as it is just and three conditions are met the sponsorship of congress , the participation in the vote of puerto ricans on the mainland and definitions of status options that emerge from a consensus among their proponents the definition popular democrats prefer for their status , however , has been deemed unrealistic by some in congress the party , for instance , has proposed more selfgoverning powers for puerto rico to foster economic development puerto ricans are american citizens who are governed by federal law , including the military draft but they do not pay federal taxes , cannot vote on federal elections or elect congressional delegations and do not receive federal benefits comparable to the states some voters said that was good enough for them i think we 're doing very well and will continue to do very well with what we 've got , said josi m millan , 64 , a retiree who voted for none of the above to support the status quo i voted to stay the way we are , to keep our language , our culture , the latinismo , and the ability to participate in all the pageants and sporting events statehood proponents , however , vowed to continue their efforts we have shed bloodshed for the country , charles a rodriguez , president of puerto rico s senate , said , referring to puerto rican participation in american wars we 'll keep on fighting until we get equality for puerto rico
in most industries , if a company s sales dropped 40 percent from one year to the next , not only would the chief executive be dismissed , but the company might very well go out of business not necessarily so in broadcast television today for evidence , consider upn the network s average audience has shrunk 40 percent this fall from last fall one new show , reunited , has twice scored one of the lowest nielsen ratings in history , an 09 \( about 895 , 000 homes , of the 84 million upn can reach \) to make up for the low ratings , upn has had to give most advertisers two commercials for every one purchased and it looks as if the network will lose close to 200 million this year , after losing about 180 million last year still , upn s owners sound almost cheery top executives at viacom and chriscraft , whose respective subsidiaries , paramount television and the broadcast holdings corporation , jointly own upn , insist that they are committed to the network for the long haul and that they are braced for substantial losses until it improves they also expressed faith in dean valentine , upn s third chief executive in its almost four years of existence despite what would be called failure by most measures of business success , the one thing upn says it will not do is go out of the network business there is no such scenario possible , unless the stations they own get shut down , said a upn executive , speaking on condition of anonymity how can that be \? in today s vertically integrated entertainment world , giant parent companies own networks , production studios and the shows produced and local stations , but the stations are among the most dependable profit makers and to be competitive , stations need a national network s highprofile programs in prime time some stations are stuck with upn , because they are family viacom s paramount television owns 19 television stations and chriscraft owns 8 but nearly 200 others chose to sign on with upn , which went on the air in january 1995 , with two nights of programming a week and a promise to grow most affiliates were small , lowprofile independent stations that had been buying and scheduling programs on their own syndicated shows , old movies and the games of local sports teams as networks grew time warner s wb network started the same year as upn , both added a third night the next year , and now offer five nights a week the business changed primetime syndication producers have narrowed their aim , making mostly maleoriented actionadventure dramas , which stations buy for weekend use or to fill programming gaps most local sports teams have gone to cable networks cable networks compete with stations to buy movie packages , too these days , stations would be hard pressed to survive financially by cobbling together their own lineups , as was once the norm they need a network s brand name , its programs and its national promotional and advertising power yet the upn stations are getting lower ratings , and thus lower ad revenue , in many cases than they got before affiliating with upn and they must give twothirds of their primetime commercial minutes to the network certainly , they are upset a 40 percent drop in viewers diminishes the audience for their 10 pm news programs , and hurts whatever syndicated shows they have bought to run later in the evening it means promotional spots for the stations' other shows are seen by fewer people but there is precious little they can do the only recourse would be to drop upn when their affiliation contracts expire , in most cases several years from now , and join another network wb is the only broadcast network to show growth this year it forged success with a heavily marketed appeal to teenagers and young women , the primary audience attracted by its first two big hits , buffy the vampire slayer and seventh heaven that is , of course , what upn needs desperately some hit shows and there looms another worry like upn s stations , the major hollywood production studios are also grumbling about those paltry nielsen ratings it costs studios hundreds of thousands of dollars each episode , and often more , to produce shows they recoup some of that in the license fee paid by the network , but they share no advertising earnings to make money , they depend on a show succeeding and accumulating enough episodes to sell into syndication or to cable networks that does not happen if people do not watch , and this fall , few people have been watching upn one or two major studios have begun thinking twice about development deals with upn for now , according to some show producers and some studio executives , none of whom would speak for the record others have asked for a contractual clause stipulating that if upn goes out of business in less than four years the typical time needed to accumulate enough episodes for syndication upn would reimburse the supplier for deficits incurred in producing the show but upn still has an active development slate if nothing else , paramount , spelling television and viacom productions are sister viacom companies , and would find it difficult to turn away also , upn executives are trolling for new , offthebeatenpath producers , noting that the five major studios have produced few hits recently for any network even nbc , abc and cbs upn has a development deal with tom fontana and barry levinson \( independent producers who created homicide life on the streets for nbc \) , and with the film writers ted elliott and terry rossio \( the mask of zorro , \) among others upn s one modestly successful night wednesday may suggest a path to take , since it draws more male viewers than most network tv , with seven days , a military spy drama , and star trek voyager , the lostinspace series upn s future may lie in becoming a fraternal twin to wb focusing on male teenagers and young men photo star trek voyager , the sciencefiction drama , is one of the few bright spots for upn so far this season , the average audience for the network has shrunk by 40 percent \( upn \) graph not holding its own this television season , the upn network has lost a large portion of its

chicago hang around bill parcells long enough and you will hear him grumble and grunt , i go by what i see he says that meaning others see this , i see that you see a pro bowl player , i see a stiff you see a quarterback , i see a quitter you see a defense , i see jokers you see a leader , i see a louse you see a dynamic back , i see a fat , lazy cat you see heart , i see fear you see losers , i see champions well , let s see parcells had that initial 97 season as the jets' head coach , and now he has had this spring and summer the draft , minicamps , training camp and the preseason to continue fashioning the jets in his image the preseason is over now , after a solid jets showing last night in a 247 victory against a very shaky chicago team the bears are no longer monsters , but they are scary they fell behind the jets by 100 in the first quarter and looked out of step , out of this league and headed for big trouble the bears looked like the jets did only two seasons ago when they were 115 last season the bears were 412 this year they wo n't even win four thus , it is tough to gauge where the jets stand as they prepare for the opener next sunday in san francisco going from the bears to the 49ers is like trying to put a leash on a cat and then one on an alligator the 49ers are not easily collared especially at home parcells always talks about what he does not have and rarely about what he does have he picks favorites fullback jerald sowell \( i'm rooting for him \) is one of his guys cornerback aaron glenn \( he has n't been playing well and he knows it \) is a player parcells rides parcells plays these mind games , and sometimes they are ridiculous and other times they are so effective and convincing that even parcells is duped his games become reality and then fiction does , too some players overachieve others fall apart it s a crash and burn , a mix and match that have served him well , and he has two super bowl rings to prove that mix and match this is the jets it is a team with so many elements , but none of them are overwhelming a team that can move the ball on offense and give it right back on defense a team with special teams that can make plays a team with size and with apparent staying power a team needing more speed a team that has enough onfield leaders three players are key to the jets' season and i'm going by what i see glenn foley he has survived his identity crisis he survived vinny testaverde s making one start and the controversy that swirled around that foley sometimes throws it long when he should be dumping it short and vice versa what young quarterback does not \? the more he plays , the better he gets parcells has called him a fireman the jets need him to fan the flames he is a better quarterback on the move the jets must develop that part of his game with proper playcalling jerald sowell everyone makes a big deal out of the newcomer curtis martin it is a big deal but sowell could also prove to be a big a deal he is certainly bigger much bigger martin is 5 feet 11 inches , 210 pounds sowell is 6 feet , 248 pounds of course , martin is the tailback and sowell is the fullback but what is exciting about sowell is that he shows wonderful nimbleness for his size and he can catch the ball he caught one over his shoulder against the bears , a lob job that showed concentration and agility , that gained 28 yards and helped set up a touchdown a fullback who can catch the ball downfield \? that is a weapon tough for anyone to defend aaron glenn he has been a pro bowl cornerback and a terrific kick returner , but his performance in camp has been spotty , and now he must enter the season a bit unsure talented , no doubt , once wonderfully spirited , but the question is if parcells is pushing the right buttons to help the guy reach his peak glenn was not happy with the grind of training camp few veterans are but his spark is missing and the jets need it in today s national football league , your top cornerback matches up with the marquee receiver and travels with him all day when you have a corner who can do this , your entire defense is versatile maybe all glenn needs to get motivated is for the regular season to start the real games let s see the last time we saw something like this , it was running back adrian murrell he hit a slump parcells tried to mix praise with punches to get him back murrell fumbled more he cried over it he is gone mix and match , all around the jets the placekicking battle is curious john hall is the incumbent with so much talent , but parcells sees holes brett conway is the new guy , and he looked decent against the bears he even made a touchdownsaving tackle on a kickoff return the jets look ready for an interesting game with the 49ers , but they are not ready for a victory no matter they will win enough if parcells pushes the right buttons , they will win 11 games this season i wonder if parcells sees that \? i do

on the fourth floor of a factory in long island city , queens , clifton harrell deftly handles heavy machinery to trim , bend and assemble toilet bowl brushes , 150 dozen a day his hands are a blur his body , a study in efficient motion it s a lot of work , but once you get used to it , it s like clockwork , said mr harrell , wiping a bead of sweat from his forehead then , cocking his head toward the ground , he added , and i got austin here austin is mr harrell s seeingeye dog mr harrell is an employee at the only factory in new york city that , with the exception of some supervisors , hires only people who are legally blind the factory , run by a nonprofit organization called new york city industries for the blind , produces mops , brooms and reflector vests for numerous clients , including the city s housing authority and police department inside the factory , there are the same monotonous sounds associated with any production line but there is also a clearly marked path snaking around the factory floor , a path painted in bright black and yellow stripes , showing workers who can distinguish bright colors how to proceed over the path is a clothesline on which people can hook their canes as they walk and scattered about the workplace are seeingeye dogs who stay next to their owners the factory has grown since its founding in march 1996 , with revenue of 75 million in its first year and an expected 85 million in its second it has grown from 30 blind employees to more than 50 today but with that expansion has come some protest , from other organizations serving the blind i think that segregated facilities of any sort , be they schools for minorities or work environments for people with disabilities , are detrimental to the participants , said betty bird , senior vice president for rehabilitation programs and services at the lighthouse inc , a nonprofit organization in new york city it sets up reverberations in people s minds that the only place blind people can work is in a blind environment , and it s an archaic message from the 19th century those who support what are sometimes called sheltered workshops say that however noble the idea of blind and sighted people working side by side , the reality is that mainstream jobs are hard for the blind to obtain i applaud those organizations for wanting to aim as high as we can , said carl augusto , president of the american foundation for the blind , alluding to the lighthouse and other groups but the reality is that there are too many blind people who are unemployed who want to be employed the debate over how to help the blind find work without seeming patronizing or hardhearted is important to the estimated 11 million people in the united states who are classified as legally blind people with vision of 20 200 or less of the 115 , 000 people in new york state registered as legally blind with the new york commission for the blind and visually handicapped , about 50 , 000 live in new york city the city , with its intricate subway and bus routes , has a comprehensive transportation system accessible to the blind and it is home to several national organizations serving the blind clearly and quite obviously , new york city is a major population center , with the largest organizations serving the blind in the country , said thomas robertson , associate commissioner of the commission for the blind and visually handicapped do they lead the parade on many of these issues \? i suspect that they do sheltered workshops began appearing in 1938 after congress passed the javitswagnero 'day act to assist blind people who wanted to work some organizations for the blind then opened factories that produced brooms , mops and other products using simple , repetitive methods and for years , new york city was home to several such workshops , run by organizations such as the jewish guild for the blind , helen keller services for the blind and the lighthouse but by the early 1990 s , with the widespread use of walking canes and voiceactivated computers , most organizations had phased out the workshops , feeling that the blind had become better equipped to get mainstream jobs now , marc maurer , president of the national federation of the blind , a nonprofit organization , believes that jobtraining programs and increasing understanding of the blind are more effective tools in integrating blind workers into these jobs some blind people agree if you 're all segregated , no one gets an impression that we 're people just like anyone else , said john kolnsberg , 32 , who lost his vision after he was shot in 1995 now he works as a radio dispatcher for consolidated edison , in an office with about 30 people , none of them blind of course they know i'm blind , but we work well together , and it s an education for everyone but richard c bland , president and chief executive of the new york city industries for the blind , described that approach as the function of a social worker mentality and said he believes that his organization s approach is more realistic only 456 percent of people between the ages of 21 to 64 who are visually impaired , or about 21 million people , are employed so to give the blind more opportunities , mr bland founded the long island city factory this is not a charity , said mr bland , a businessman who had worked as a marketing executive for packaged goods and liquor companies it s not , 'oh my , let s help them out' this is a business they come they work they grumble like everyone else the average wage is 625 an hour , with a high of 950 an hour above minimum , but well below what unionized workers would make the 50 or so blind employees also get disability , life and health insurance as a nonprofit organization , new york city industries for the blind benefits from a federal law that designates such organizations as preferred providers when seeking contracts at the same time , these organizations must provide products of equal or better quality for a competitive price or lose the contract workplace conditions are also inspected by the united states general services administration and the new york state labor department phyllis callender , a seamstress at the long island city factory , said , it beats sitting home and doing nothing and mr harrell says he gets to work early , at 7 am , to have coffee and chat with his coworkers we share a bond because we 're in the same position and we need help here and there , he said but to tell you the truth , i do n't miss my eyes that much because i can handle myself in the dark and some of the things that s happening out there frankly , i do n't want to see photo advocates differ on whether the blind are better served by jobs that are tailored for them or by mainstream employment ricky lopez , 34 , works in a queens factory run by the new york city industries for the blind \( john sotomayor the new york times \)
chicago , sept 28 sammy sosa did not hit four home runs to share the record with mark mcgwire steve trachsel did not pitch a nohitter but the chicago cubs did gain a chance to win their first postseason series since 1908 the cubs , who last won the world series in that postseason 90 years ago , advanced to the first round of this year s playoffs by defeating the san francisco giants , 53 , tonight and winning the first playoff for the national league wildcard spot in the fouryear history of the wildcard format the cubs , who last played postseason games in 1989 , will play the braves in atlanta on wednesday afternoon they were put on the plane to atlanta chiefly by trachsel , who did not allow a hit until he had one out in the seventh inning by felix heredia , who retired barry bonds on an inningending grounder with the bases loaded in the seventh by terry mulholland , who held bonds to a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded and none out in the ninth , and by gary gaetti and matt mieske , 1998 newcomers to the cubs , who each drove in two runs sosa did not hit a home run , leaving him with 66 and officially putting mcgwire into the record book as the singleseason recordholder with 70 home runs sosa batted 15 times without hitting a home run since he hit no 66 last friday night and slipped ahead of mcgwire for all of 45 minutes sosa , however , continued his most valuable player contribution to the cubs , stroking a pair of singles and scoring the final two runs , which became critical when the dormant giants rallied for three runs in the ninth inning we 've been working hard all year , said sosa , who had said all along that his no 1 priority was not home runs but the playoffs it s been an unbelievable 1998 i 'll never forget it unlike many other seasons when the cubs disappointed themselves and their fans , pregame preparations did not become washed away in the tears of another failure clubhouse workers had rolled up heavy plastic covers on the tops of the players' lockers , waiting there to be dropped over the fronts of the lockers to spare their contents from a champagne celebration jimmy bank , the traveling secretary , had prepared travel itineraries we leave tomorrow afternoon for atlanta , bank said before the game to one player who had asked i'm going to give out the itinerary after the game tonight and he was able to do that trachsel s was perhaps the most important contribution to keeping failure away the 27yearold righthander had labored recently in fact , since he threw the pitch that became the mcgwire home run that broke roger maris s record of 61 in four starts beginning with that game on sept 8 , trachsel had been battered for 19 earned runs in 21 2 3 innings but the giants did not hit him tonight trachsel walked six of them , but permitted none to score he walked two batters and hit another batter in the fourth , loading the bases with two out , then threw a third strike past brian johnson he held the giants hitless until brent mayne lined a oneout pinchhit single to right field in the seventh after trachsel followed the hit by walking armando rios , another pinchhitter , manager jim riggleman changed pitchers it was awesome , trachsel said of his playoff experience , the first in his six seasons the way the fans were going , the adrenaline was flowing i threw 120 pitches and it felt like i threw 40 trachsel , bonds said , was the best he had ever seen him trachsel pitched great , bonds said we never got any momentum going with less than two outs you tip your hat when a guy can pitch like that riggleman used six pitchers , including two starters as relievers kevin tapani in the eighth inning plus two batters in the ninth , and terry mulholland , who as the starter sunday pitched eight innings , for three batters in the ninth rod beck had pitched the previous two games , going two and twothirds innings on sunday in a vain effort to put the cubs in the playoffs without the extra game he entered tonight with two runs in , one out and runners at first and third first , he induced jeff kent , who led the giants with 127 runs batted in , to ground into a force play at second on which the third run scored , then retired joe carter , batting most likely for the last time in his 16year career , on a foul pop to first the cubs and their fans inside wrigley field and on surrounding streets went into a frenzy it s a lot of fun playing in chicago for the cubs , but it s a lot more fun winning for the cubs , said mark grace , their 11thyear first baseman gaetti has been playing for the cubs only since they signed him on his 40th birthday , aug 19 , after st louis had released him after henry rodriguez led off the fifth inning with a single , gaetti drove a mark gardner pitch into the leftfield bleachers gardner , who had not lost any of his 10 starts since july 30 , retired the next three batters , but lance johnson and sosa singled one out apart in the sixth manager dusty baker replaced gardner with rich rodriguez , who walked grace riggleman then pulled henry rodriguez , a lefthanded hitter , and used a righthander , mieske , who had batted only 110 times this season but mieske lined a single to right , and johnson and sosa raced home in the eighth sosa singled with one out , raced to third as grace lined a double to right and scored on jose mesa s wild pitch the giants finally scored in the ninth , and even threatened to catch the cubs singles by mayne and bill mueller brought mulholland in for tapani , and stan javier singled mayne home ellis burks drew a walk as a pinchhitter , loading the bases again for bonds this time he hit a sacrifice fly to right field for the second run and the first out beck relieved mulholland , and carter , after the force play , was unable to duplicate the home run he hit to win the 1993 world series for toronto over philadelphia did someone say world series \? the cubs are one of only eight teams

there is hardly a jazz singer alive who does n't pay lip service to the greatness of ella fitzgerald yet few of her descendants have much grasp of a style whose essence was an easygoing fluency , a dialogue between flowing lyricism and dynamic improvisation that made these distinct two elements of jazz singing seem indivisible one who does is carol sloane , the bostonbased jazz singer who opened a twoweek engagement on tuesday evening at rainbow and stars , where she is accompanied by a superb jazz trio led by the pianist bill mays ms sloane , who is 60 , may in fact be fitzgerald s truest heir in the seamlessness of her style , which is at once swinging and insistently melodic she never loses sight of a song s overall musical shape modest almost to a fault , ms sloane also never shows off she never indulges in fancy virtuosic display and rarely pushes her voice above an intimate conversational level the voice itself is a warm , slightly husky alto \( reminiscent of a smoother sylvia syms \) that is invitingly friendly and without affectation much of ms sloane s show is a tribute to the two singers she says formed her style when she was growing up in rhode island and listening to the radio fitzgerald and frank sinatra the most valuable thing she took from both is the ability to project an utter naturalness and sense of comfort if there s anything missing , it s a sense of high drama where mr sinatra could turn songs into a emotioncharged stateoftheworld messages , ms sloane has none of that ego she is still a fine , sensitive interpreter whose blend of wistfulness and warmth amounts to personal signature high points of her opening night show included a quiet , beautifully measured i'm getting sentimental over you and looking back , jimmy rowles s and cheryl ernst s dreamy reminiscence of a country childhood singing the sinatra classic young at heart , ms sloane made a tiny lyrical alteration that made it hers in her version , the key to feeling youthful is n't being given a head start but having a jazz heart photo carol sloane on tuesday evening \( rahav segev \)

east rutherford , nj , dec 23 in the world of the devils , where defense is often top banana , a hat trick is a rarity there was only one for new jersey last season and none in the first 30 games this season bobby holik ended that spell tonight by scoring the devils' last three goals and leading them to a 42 victory over the st louis blues at continental arena holik s hat trick gave him 15 goals for the season and helped the devils to their first victory in three games scott niedermayer scored the other goal for the devils , who regained the top spot in the eastern conference with a record of 1984 i felt more responsible how the team did tonight , said holik , who was made alternate captain for the game because the captain scott stevens missed the game with back spasms when you 're wearing the a , it s an honor ken daneyko and denis pederson are the two regular alternate captains holik has been playing noticeably better since his twogame suspension by the league last month during the ban , holik took the time to work with the assistant coach slava fetisov on his shot release and accuracy i had almost a week to relax and practice hard with no pressure of being ready for the game , holik said i just regrouped myself it may be a coincidence to the outsider but not for me i looked at the suspension as a time to get myself together his three goals tonight gave him a total of 15 , tops on the team and five more than the next players , petr sykora and dave andreychuk every time you step on the ice and you work hard , things happen , holik said it s the result of hard work and effort this was the third career hat trick for holik and his first since 1992 holik , who had 29 goals last season , had no hat tricks in jacques lemaire s fiveyear tenure as coach of the devils there will be a few more , sykora said we have a lot of guys who are capable to get a hat trick martin brodeur played goal after missing practice with pain in his ribs and improved his record to 1574 with 23 saves the only blues players to beat him were pavol demitra and todd gill , both in the first period stevens practiced the last two days and took part in the morning skate before tonight s game , but his back stiffened up before the game and he was a late scratch , forcing him to miss his first game this season stevens injured his back after being hit with a shot by montreal s jason dawes in saturday s tie in montreal with stevens out , coach robbie ftorek was forced to shuffle his defensive pairings dean , who usually plays with stevens , was teamed with lyle odelein the other defensive pairings were niedermayer with brad bombardir and daneyko with sheldon souray niedermayer opened the scoring for the devils with his third goal of the season and it came the devils' first manpower advantage taking a pass from patrik elias , niedermayer beat grant fuhr 6 minutes 30 seconds after the opening faceoff after demitra matched niedermayer s goal and gill brought the blues back following holik s first goal of the night , holik gave the devils the lead again at 32 with his second goal of the night , 8 09 into the second period he completed his hat trick with 9 50 left in the third period , when he beat fuhr with a rising shot from the right circle photo the devils' scott niedermayer \( 27 \) stumbling out of a crowd after scoring against blues goalie grant fuhr \( chang w lee the new york times \)

washington , june 14 at the core of the bitter dispute over whether kenneth w starr improperly disclosed information about the investigation of president clinton are justice department regulations and court decisions involving how much prosecutors may tell the public and the media about their work mr starr , the whitewater independent counsel , said in an interview with brill s content , a new magazine , that he and his aides had given information about the monica s lewinsky matter to reporters the white house immediately responded that the article buttressed its complaints that the independent counsel s office has improperly leaked information to the media but mr starr said that he and his prosecutors had not violated rules about grand jury secrecy , and said that the actions were permissible because they were done to protect his office from attacks that undermined public confidence in his work he was apparently referring to justice department regulations that prohibit prosecutors from disclosing any information about a grand jury investigation , but include an exception for instances in which there is a need to reassure the public that an investigation is being conducted properly interviews with former and current justice department officials suggest that it remains unclear whether the exception in the guidelines applies to mr starr s actions the battle between president clinton and mr starr has become not just a legal but a political one , in which both sides have sought to win the public s support different federal appeals courts have disagreed over the scope and limits of the law that prohibits grand jury disclosures by prosecutors the supreme court has never directly addressed the issue mr starr told the magazine that he and his deputies talked to reporters on background on some occasions , that is , they spoke on the condition that the resulting news articles not mention that the information came from the prosecutors in a statement , mr starr said that those contacts were legal , appropriate and consistent with department of justice policy , which provides for informing the public about the activities of lawenforcement officers the justice department policy to which mr starr apparently referred is in a manual that is given to federal prosecutors and contains a wide variety of rules covering such divergent topics as how to handle an arson case and what is an acceptable plea bargain the manual forbids a prosecutor from discussing many grand jury matters , but offers three general exceptions the one on which mr starr appears to rely , included in section 17530 , allows for disclosure about matters about which the community needs to be reassured that an appropriate lawenforcement agency is investigating the incident the other exceptions are for the public safety , that is to save a life , or when there has already been substantial disclosure senior justice department officials said it was unclear whether mr starr s reasoning that he made clarifications to reporters to protect the reputation of his office from unrelenting attacks qualified under the guidelines as a permissible exception to rules against disclosing grand jury material he might well be able to make that argument , said one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity federal prosecutors are occasionally disciplined or even dismissed when they are found to have improperly leaked material to reporters yet even in such cases , the underlying indictments are never dismissed ordinarily , a prosecutor who wants to speak publicly or to a reporter about an investigation must seek permission from highlevel justice department officials as an independent counsel , mr starr does not report directly to the justice department and is , in the first instance , the judge of his own behavior attorney general janet reno may remove mr starr if he has behaved improperly , but she has resisted all calls to criticize him she had no comment through a spokesman today on the issue of the magazine interview david e kendall , who is mr clinton s personal lawyer and who has already asked a federal judge to hold mr starr in contempt for allegedly leaking grand jury material , reacted sharply today to the magazine article we are studying it carefully , he said it contains astonishing admissions , and it has very serious implications mr starr is quoted in the magazine as saying that none of the comments to reporters on background involved grand jury information , describing the material as relating to what witnesses told agents from the federal bureau of investigation before they testified before the grand jury the magazine notes , however , that the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued an opinion just last month disputing that view as it offered a wide definition of what constitutes grand jury material but other courts , like the court of appeals for the third circuit , ruled in 1990 that the secrecy policy is designed to protect only what takes place in the grand jury room senior justice department officials also disputed one element of the article , that mr starr had maneuvered ms reno into expanding his jurisdiction to investigate whether mr clinton lied about having had an affair with ms lewinsky and then encouraged ms lewinsky to lie about it the officials said that it was abundantly clear that the matter had to be investigated by mr starr
highland , calif , oct 8 more than a century after indian wars roiled the west , another battle is raging here over a ballot measure that would expand the state s 14 billion indian gambling industry it pits california s gaming tribes against an unlikely coalition of nevada casinos , unions , church groups and other businesses in what may become the most expensive fight in california political history a visit to the san manuel indian bingo and casino on a patch of tribal land 60 miles east of los angeles makes the stakes clear the afternoon sun is still high but the parking lot is filling fast , and inside the smoky 90 , 000squarefoot gambling hall , the hopeful already sit glued to most of the 1 , 000 video slot machines and to row after row of bingo tables this 24hour nofrills casino is an economic miracle for the tiny san manuel tribe , which once scratched out an income raising apricots and lived in shacks and trailers on a dusty 648acre reservation now , 40 landscaped houses dot the hillsides behind the casino s walls , and security officers on bicycles patrol newly paved roads but the san manuel indians have a problem they and about 40 other california tribes began installing slot machines over the last decade without first reaching compacts with the state , as required by federal law so gov pete wilson and federal prosecutors consider their casinos illegal and have moved to shut them down in response , the gaming tribes are sponsoring a hotly contested ballot measure in the nov 3 election that would allow broad expansion of casinostyle gaming on indian lands statewide already , the two sides have raised about 60 million and spent about 53 million , mostly for a barrage of competing television commercials about 43 million has been raised by tribes , 22 million of it from the san manuel tribe alone , while opponents , led by the casino operators at the hilton hotels corporation and mirage resorts inc , who fear untaxed indian competition , have raised 155 million and spent 1 million more the previous spending record for a single measure was 575 million on a securities fraud proposal two years ago public polls have shown the gambling measure , proposition 5 , winning majority support among voters , many of whom are sympathetic to decades of indian privation in a state that paid bounties for indian body parts in the 1850 s the gaming tribes contend that nothing less than their sovereignty and economic survival is at stake , and their advertisements feature members attesting that indian gaming has broken the cycle of poverty this is our livelihood , said ken ramirez , 38 , vicechairman of the san manuel tribe , who grew up on the reservation when it held only a few families , with water too fetid to drink mr ramirez declined to disclose the tribe s revenues from gaming , but noted that about 110 people now live on the reservation , where , with gambling proceeds , the tribe has drilled 16 deep wells and plans to market bottled water commercially opponents of proposition 5 accuse the gaming tribes of scare tactics they say the tribes' campaign exaggerates the threat to indian welfare and obscures the real menace of a measure that would allow the spread of gambling throughout the state , something many church groups oppose privately operated theme parks , race tracks and card rooms say indian casinos would divert business from them yet provide few economic benefits over all because indian casinos pay no taxes on their profits , though gamblers pay income taxes on their winnings frankly , i think it s an incredible con game , said frank schubert , who is managing the no on 5 campaign for the coalition against unregulated gambling we 've had millions and millions in tv ads bombarding the state for months now about reservations getting electricity and being able to have linoleum on a dirt floor , when in fact it s a handful of tribes spending a fortune to keep a special deal about onethird of the 557 indian tribes around the nation , including tribes in connecticut , minnesota and wisconsin , now offer some form of gambling the 1988 federal indian gaming regulatory act affirmed tribes' rights to offer bingo , and , subject to negotiated compacts with individual states , slot machine games but some governors have complained about vagaries in the law and congress has debated clarifying it from a national perspective , many states and tribes have already resolved this , said john dossett , general counsel of the national congress of american indians in washington , which represents 250 tribes if this issue were to be resolved in california , there 'd be less pressure in congress but resolution here seems unlikely any time soon opponents of proposition 5 warn that if it passes , it will be tied up in years of litigation , and could well violate the california constitution s ban on nevada or new jerseytype casinos we 're in for a long battle here instead of a politically negotiated solution in which both sides say , 'let s make this work , ' said cathy christian , counsel to the coalition against unregulated gambling
washington , aug 8 in 1994 , when president clinton s effort to reshape the american health care system collapsed , a political consensus emerged from the rubble in the future , any such changes should be made piecemeal , one step at a time but four years later , the limits of that incremental approach are becoming clear , in the view of many experts most immediately , congress is confronting demands to provide broad new consumer protections for patients fed up with the restrictions of managed care lawmakers also face a deeper , more intractable problem despite the passage of several laws intended to expand coverage step by step , the number of americans without insurance has risen steadily , by an average of one million a year the number of uninsured has increased each year since 1987 and now exceeds 41 million , roughly onesixth of the population moreover , this steady rise has occurred despite a remarkable economic boom the nation has created more than 14 million jobs since 1993 , but most of these are in small businesses , which are far less likely to provide health insurance than are large companies in congress , members of both parties keep returning to the problems of the uninsured , but the cost and complexity of the issue pose extraordinary hurdles lawmakers say they are determined not to repeat the mistakes that killed mr clinton s plan , but beyond that , there is little agreement congress has enacted two significant health care laws since the collapse of the clinton plan it created a new program to finance health care for lowincome children last year and in 1996 it passed the kassebaumkennedy law , to make insurance more readily available to millions of people who change their jobs or lose them these efforts , along with previous expansions of the medicaid program , have made a difference without them , experts say , the number of uninsured would be even higher but there have been problems federal and state officials say that insurance companies have found ways to skirt the kassebaumkennedy law by shunning people with medical problems or by charging them very high premiums the law does not limit what insurers can charge sweeping changes in federal welfare policy may inadvertently increase the number of uninsured children , offsetting some of the expected gains in coverage from the new children s health insurance program the government has struggled to carry out its duties under the new laws federal officials had assumed that states would quickly adopt the standards established by the kassebaumkennedy law , but that has not happened in california and four other states in such states , the federal government is supposed to enforce the law directly , but the clinton administration acknowledges it was unprepared for this immense new responsibility so , while officials grapple with these problems , the number of uninsured keeps growing the workers patchwork system for the uninsured neither the new laws nor the power of a fiercely competitive medical marketplace has delivered health insurance to mildred davis , a custodian and security guard in austin , tex i have no health insurance , no dental plan , ms davis said as she sat at the front desk of the community health center where she works when you walk into a doctor s office , the first thing they say is 'how will you pay \? what insurance do you have \? ' i have to go to the bank before i go to the doctor like many people who are uninsured , she deferred doctors' visits and medical care until she had a serious need as a result , said ms davis , who is 48 , she had an emergency hysterectomy in january after several weeks of uterine bleeding she received a hospital bill for 8 , 000 and a doctor s bill for 2 , 000 i would have gotten care earlier if i had had health insurance , she said instead , she waited until the pain became unbearable i would get up to patrol this area , ms davis said , pointing to the corridors of the health center the pain was so bad that i 'd fall over i lost four and a half pints of blood i was literally bleeding to death ms davis s case highlights the patchwork nature of the current insurance system and illustrates what can happen to uninsured people when they become ill even if parents have coverage through their employers , their children may be uninsured \( many companies have cut back benefits for dependents \) conversely , many children covered by medicaid , the federalstate program for lowincome people , have parents who are uninsured because medicaid s eligibility rules are much more generous for children than they are for adults ms davis said that her 7yearold daughter was covered by medicaid but ms davis herself , like many of the uninsured , was caught in between her income was too high for her to qualify for medicaid , and she could not afford private insurance ms davis says she hopes to get health insurance later this year when she becomes a fulltime city employee the medicaid eligibility rules are devilishly complex they differ from state to state , and family income limits vary with a child s age so a healthy 4yearold boy may be protected by medicaid , while his 8yearold sister , though severely ill , is ineligible for coverage because the income limit for her age group is lower
two small studies have shown that over the course of just a few weeks , one dose of experimental drugs injected directly into the heart can greatly relieve , or even eliminate , the chest pain of coronary artery disease by encouraging the growth of new blood vessels to bypass clogged arteries , according to researchers in the united states and germany the research is at a preliminary stage , and the drugs have yet to be tested in large groups of people even if the results hold up , it may be years before any therapy is available for patients who suffer from such chest pain , or angina one of the treatments under study is gene therapy to produce a protein called vegf , for vascular endothelial growth factor the other entails injection of a protein called fgf1 , for fibroblast growth factor each drug is given in a single injection , through a surgical incision in the chest in effect , both treatments aim to allow patients to grow their own heart bypasses by sprouting thin collateral blood vessels , in a strategy called therapeutic angiogenesis the same gene therapy as is involved in one of these treatments has been shown to be effective in building new blood vessels in the legs , but these reports are the first to assert that gene therapy has produced new vessels in the heart the coronary gene therapy research , led by dr jeffrey m isner of st elizabeth s hospital in brighton , mass , and tufts university , is reported in today s issue of circulation , a journal published by the american heart association the protein therapy is being developed by dr thomasjoseph stegmann of fulda , germany , a leading figure in the field , who discussed his work in interviews so far , tests of both therapies are in the first stage , where research determines whether the treatment is safe to patients ordinarily researchers do not make claims for effectiveness until later stages , involving testing on larger groups of people , are completed but the researchers said in interviews that they were struck by the improvements reported by more than 20 participants in these early trials , even patients whose pain could not be controlled by other drug therapy or bypass surgery and the editor of the journal decided that dr isner s results , though preliminary , were significant enough to warrant publication nearly all the participants reported substantial pain relief , and some who were virtually housebound before receiving the injection have painlessly resumed swimming , working out on exercise bicycles and pursuing other physical activities pain relief usually began about three weeks after the procedure , which , on average , took about an hour in an operating room , with the patient under general anesthesia the hospital stay was about four days pain relief , even elimination of pain , has persisted in all participants who showed improvement , the researchers said how long that will remain effective is anybody s guess , said dr isner , the first of whose patients received the injection only 10 months ago st elizabeth s hospital , with which dr isner is affiliated , has formed a company to test his therapy in larger trials as for dr stegmann , he is a cofounder of cardiovascular genetic engineering inc of irvine , calif , which aims to develop angiogenesis treatment for coronary artery disease dr valentin fuster , head of cardiology at mount sinai medical center in new york city , said , it s exciting , but you should be cautious about what will be the impact of all of this dr fuster , who is president of the american heart association , said he doubted that it will become a panacea for everyone with angina and coronary heart disease he was among experts interviewed who said much more extensive research , taking years , would be needed before these or similar therapies found their way into standard medical practice , if they ever did one important concern was that the two studies involved a small number of patients another was that none could receive a placebo , or dummy substance , as scientific controls to allow more rigorous comparisons for ethical reasons , the food and drug administration and hospital committees whose function is to protect volunteers from harmful research declined to allow researchers to subject a control group to the rigors of sham surgery that offered them no benefit yet another concern was uncertainty about the longterm benefits many doctors remember a number of drug and surgical therapies for angina and other conditions that appeared spectacular initially but that failed in the longer run nevertheless dr isner s report is very compelling , said dr jonathan d marmur , a cardiologist at mount sinai the benefit reported is pretty convincing , dr marmur said , and requires confirmation with control studies dr marmur and some other experts expressed optimism that these or similar treatments might one day be administered through less invasive procedures than chest surgery for example , they might be administered through a tube inserted into a leg or an arm and threaded to the heart , a procedure known as cardiac catheterization
jose francisco pena gomez , a threetime candidate for president of the dominican republic who rose from a childhood of extreme poverty to become one of the most prominent black political figures in latin america , died on sunday night at his home outside santo domingo he was 61 mr pena gomez had been battling pancreatic and stomach cancer for years , but refused to give up his passion for politics at his death , he was running for mayor of santo domingo , the country s capital , in municipal and congressional elections scheduled for saturday , and polls showed him with a comfortable lead president leonel fernandez , who narrowly defeated mr pena gomez in 1996 , yesterday decreed a suspension of all campaigning and declared three days of national mourning in recognition of the contribution pena gomez made to democracy in the dominican republic the campaign will then resume and the election will proceed as scheduled , government officials said no politician openly acknowledging african ancestry has ever been elected president of any spanishspeaking latin american nation in this century , though a few of mixed race have held power but mr pena gomez came extremely close to achieving that feat , and even without occupying his country s highest office came to be known throughout the hemisphere as an eloquent spokesman for and defender of political , social and racial equality and justice he was a great man , one of the very few people i have known who at critical moments put democracy ahead of his own personal interests , robert pastor , the director of the latin american and caribbean program at the carter center in atlanta who knew mr pena gomez well , said yesterday mr pena gomez was born on march 6 , 1937 , in valverde to parents of haitian descent as an infant , he was orphaned when rafael trujillo , the military dictator of the dominican republic , ordered a massacre in which more than 10 , 000 haitians and dominicans of haitian descent in the border area were killed and additional thousands fled across the border a peasant family took in the foundling , raised him as their own child and gave him their name in one of the ironies that marked his public life and illustrated his appeal to the poor , mr pena gomez s running mate in 1996 turned out to be none other than fernando alvarez bogaert , scion of the family that owned the ranch where he was raised i am a human being who has experienced many vicissitudes , mr pena gomez said in an interview in 1996 i was born in an era of conflicts i have two sets of parents and two families one is by blood , and the other is the result of cohabitation but both are dear to me as a result of his upbringing , mr pena gomez relied on his voracious intellectual appetite to supplement a tenuous early education at 8 , he worked in a grocery store and at a bar , and by the time he was a teenager he had taken jobs as a shoemaker s and a barber s apprentice at 15 , he became an instructor in a literacy program for poor children in his native province and later worked as a teacher in rural and night schools by 1960 he had moved to santo domingo , where he enrolled in a broadcasting course and proved so natural a talent that a radio station quickly hired him to announce baseball games and other sports events at the same time mr pena gomez was making his first forays into politics after an interlude when he studied political science at universities in costa rica and puerto rico , he became first the press secretary of the leftist dominican revolutionary party , or prd , and then its secretary general the prd was the party of juan bosch , the radical firebrand who for 20 years had led the opposition to the trujillo dictatorship by the time mr bosch was elected president in 1962 , mr pena gomez had emerged as a protege mr bosch was ousted by a coup in 1963 , however , and that led to a civil war and , in april 1965 , an american invasion of the dominican republic mr pena gomez took his oratorical skills to the streets and the airwaves to head the opposition to that intervention , which led to joaquin balaguer s becoming president and the prd s being cast into the political wilderness for 12 years repression was intense throughout that period , and mr pena gomez eventually had to leave the country taking refuge in france , he studied political science and constitutional and labor law for two years at the university of paris earlier , mr pena gomez had earned a law degree from the autonomous university of santo domingo and had also studied political science in courses at harvard university and michigan state university in exile he also was involved in efforts to obtain international condemnation of human rights violations in the dominican republic , forging relationships with groups that were important for the rest of his life it was also during that period that mr bosch and mr pena gomez had a falling out that resulted in mr bosch s breaking with the party that he had founded and setting up a new one in 1982 , mr pena gomez was elected mayor of santo domingo , which automatically made him a strong contender for the presidency but his party passed him by in 1986 , with some of its leaders arguing that it would be impossible for a black man , especially one of haitian descent , to defeat mr balaguer , who was foreign minister at the time of the 1937 massacre and was notorious for his disdain for blacks the prd lost to mr balaguer anyway , and in 1990 , mr pena gomez finally won the nomination he finished third in a vote marred by widespread accusations of electoral fraud after a campaign that was full of racial innuendo , but he vowed to try again in 1994 he won his party s nomination for a second time , but had to contend with what electoral observer groups described as race baiting and vote fraud that was even more blatant the widely questioned final official results showed him losing by 30 , 000 votes , and though many political observers expected mr pena gomez to order his followers into the streets to challenge the tally , he chose restraint and negotiation his first bout with cancer followed soon afterward but the disease went into remission after treatment in the united states , and , with mr balaguer barred from succeeding himself , mr pena gomez finished ahead of two strong competitors in the first round of a special presidential vote in 1996 , receiving 47 percent of the vote but he fell short of the majority that he needed to avoid a runoff , and was narrowly defeated by mr fernandez in the second round shortly thereafter , the cancer reappeared , and mr pena gomez spent most of the rest of his life shuttling back and forth between santo domingo and new york , where he underwent medical treatment in january , a factional dispute led him to jump back into the political arena in hopes that his personal popularity and fiery oratory would enable his party to make gains in the voting on may 16 surviving are his wife , peggy cabral , and eight children and stepchildren with his admirers converging on santo domingo from all corners of the country yesterday , the dominican government agreed that his body would be displayed at the national baseball stadium to accommodate the huge crowds that are expected photo jose francisco pena gomez , threetime presidential candidate in the dominican republic he rose from poverty to be a prominent politician \( associated press , 1996 \)

remedy but after falling down on a sidewalk in queens , she sought help she saw several doctors , but none could explain how ms olivere , who had exercised regularly and played on her college basketball team , was suddenly too weak to hold herself upright for months , they told her she had arthritis then hepatitis they prescribed steroids that caused her 130pound body to balloon to 200 finally , doctors at long island jewish medical center diagnosed polymyositis , a rare condition akin to lou gehrig s disease that weakens the immune system and inflames muscles , destroying and converting them into scar tissue ms olivere s disease has advanced in the last eight years , and now she cannot get out of bed without assistance she is not strong enough to lift a telephone receiver or raise her head off the pillow even coughing is difficult , because her diaphragm is impaired it s the worst case i 've ever seen , said dr bruce cronstein , her rheumatologist yet her spirit is as strong as her muscles are weak as ms olivere , 37 , lies in an adjustable bed in her brooklyn apartment , her long , slender fingers folded in her lap and her coiffed hair accenting regal cheekbones , she exudes an air of tranquillity she works hard to maintain that dignity even in the hospital , i did n't want to see the long faces , or hear the 'poor babies , ' said ms olivere , who emigrated from trinidad in the late 1980 s i have too much to live for i have my children in addition to 8yearold darnell , she has a 13yearold son , darcus , who lives in trinidad ms olivere had planned to bring him to the united states as soon as she attained legal resident status in 1994 , but because she is sick , immigration officials will not grant him a resident visa over the years , doctors have urged ms olivere to move into a nursing home rather than rely a nurse s aide for her medical needs but she has refused , because leaving home would mean giving up darnell to foster care while she can give him guidance , instruction and love , ms olivere knows she cannot raise darnell alone the brooklyn bureau of community service , one of seven charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund , provides a home attendant who helps out seven days a week the attendant , mojisola ikotun , performs duties like picking up darnell from school and helping with his homework , but the two also have a close relationship that includes teasing , hugging and horseplay darnell , a rambunctious third grader with a winsome smile , has an ambitious schedule that makes his mother proud he is an honor student at holy name of jesus school in brooklyn , captain of his basketball team , an aspiring guitarist and a white belt in karate just because i ca n't move does n't mean he ca n't be a child , his mother said still , darnell said he wishes she could accompany him more often it was ms ikotun who took him to see the christmas tree at rockefeller center , and the last time the oliveres went to the movies , hazel fell forward , lost control of her wheelchair and accidentally rolled to the base of the screen in their apartment , darnell constantly stretches his legs and pretends to climb the walls with a hookandstring contraption he made , but he is also learning to appreciate quiet moments at his mother s bedside he sometimes sits beside her , asks questions , and when she is sick , he helps suction fluids from her throat and lungs he says he is glad to do it , because it makes her feel better the experience has also given him a new ambition , to be a doctor to help people like i did for my mom ms olivere , who has survived bleeding ulcers , a collapsed lung , surgery on her throat and cardiac arrest , has continued to earn money even as her condition worsens from her bed she helps her niece , a disk jockey at private parties , by scheduling appointments and keeping up with the latest hit songs to include in dance mixes from her bed , she is also waging a legal battle to obtain a visa for her son darcus these brothers need the connection , she said sure , you can give a kiss over the phone , but it s not the same you try to hug him , but you ca n't really hug him that

a new jersey commission is expected today to recommend a series of changes intended to speed up the pace of executions the changes include cutting out an entire level of state appeals and limiting other appeals , designating specially trained judges to hear death penalty cases and permitting the retrying of the penalty phase of a trial if a jury cannot agree on imposing the death penalty but even if the changes are passed by the legislature and signed into law by gov christine todd whitman , they are likely to face a series of legal challenges by opponents of the death penalty the study commission on the implementation of the death penalty is scheduled to hold its sixth and final hearing today in trenton to put the finishing touches on the recommendations its final report will be sent to governor whitman next month , almost a year to the day after she called for a study to explain why the state had not carried out the will of juries in even one instance where the death penalty was voted richard a zimmer , the former republican congressman from lawrenceville and chairman of the commission , said that the governor s concerns were quite clear when she appointed the group last december our mandate was to make sure that those who merit the death penalty get the death penalty , he said we have tried to be practical and base our recommendations on actual experience in the 16 years since the state enacted a death penalty today , the commission members will consider more recommendations , including equalizing the number of peremptory challenges to prospective jurors that prosecutors and defense lawyers get currently , defense attorneys get 20 challenges to prosecutors' 12 mr zimmer said the group would also decide whether to suggest that the legislature pass laws allowing convicted murderers who are found to be competent to choose to halt their appeals and elect immediate execution death penalty opponents and critics of the 16member commission accused the panelists of going beyond their mandate of devising measures to expedite executions they said that the commission had actually sought to change the conduct of capital trials in order to increase the number of death sentences imposed in my opinion , this was a politically motivated commission that will not insure anything , said cathy waldor , a lawyer and the only member of the commission who has said she is opposed to the death penalty i do n't know why we are so obsessed with killing people quickly all this commission has done is proposed changes in set procedures and guaranteed that we will have to relitigate these things all over again causing even more delays opponents of the death penalty like bryan stevenson , director of the equal justice initiative , a nonprofit group in montgomery , ala , that provides legal representation for deathrow inmates , had similar criticisms of the recommendations it sounds as if some politicians are unhappy about what juries are saying about who should get the death penalty , mr stevenson said they seem less concerned about improved procedures than different results the state enacted its death penalty in 1982 , 10 years after the united states supreme court laid out the parameters for constitutional death penalty statutes it was not until 1987 that new jersey s highest court also upheld the state s death penalty law but none of the 13 men and 1 woman sent to death row since then have been executed there are 38 states with death penalty laws , but in recent years only 17 of them have had executions , according to mr stevenson those states are the ones , he said , that quickly passed their own statutes shortly after the supreme court ruling and have had time for cases to work their way through appeals processes that can take from 14 to 18 years to complete the new jersey panel is likely to recommend the elimination of the statemandated proportionality review it is one of three levels of appeals available to death row inmates in which the courts evaluate whether the sentence is consistent with sentences for similar crimes and whether it is being applied fairly on the basis of race and sex mr zimmer said the courts' work was often very subjective in comparing cases and he suggested that many of these considerations could be dealt with in the other two appeal phases the designation of specific judges to hear capital cases , he said , was a recognition of the complexity of such cases the judges' manual devotes 300 pages to the proper conduct of death penalty cases , said mr zimmer , adding that special judges who were more conversant with the rules could move them along more swiftly however , ms waldor suggested that the motive for this change was to reduce the errors trial judges often make in such cases , which defense lawyers exploit on appeal
a skyscraper in midtown manhattan rains debris on the buildings and streets below emergency workers evacuate residents and divert traffic as public officials promise action and the news media switch into high gear construction crews wrap the building with protective netting this , of course , is a summary of recent events at the conde nast building in times square , in which a temporary elevator tower collapsed , dumping tons of steel and killing one person it is also what occurred in december at 540 madison avenue , near 55th street , when a ton of bricks peeled off the building s facade , injuring two people and bringing life on the block to a screeching halt the difference , however , is that while city officials are still trying to restore times square to normal , 540 madison has essentially become old news , the first of several building accidents to dog the city since december yet if 540 madison offers a lesson for those displaced by recent , current and future mishaps , it is that reassembling one s life after such a calamity can be much more difficult than first imagined , well after the initial surge of publicity and sympathy has petered out although you might get promises , my advice is do not count on anyone , said andrew terzis , who is still reeling financially after being forced from his business , the persian shop , and his apartment , both at 534 madison , for a month save your energy , because you do n't know how long it s going to last though it has been eight months since the bricks fell and five months since the last of those displaced returned to their apartments , most of the dozen or so residents of madison s west side between east 54th and 55th streets have only been reimbursed a fraction of their outofpocket expenses many are deeply in debt at least two businesses have closed for good and three others have yet to reopen the impact has been more than financial those who were displaced have lost time and energy , while scrambling to rebuild the architecture of their lives a couple postponed plans to adopt a child a businessman who had reveled as his new restaurant earned rave reviews last winter recoiled as falling bricks forced him to close temporarily the vermont teddy bear store , where stuffed animals floated face down in rainwater that had trickled down from the shattered roof , called it quits , its momentum destroyed by the uncertainty the victims felt their loss in small ways , too like canceling plans for a share in a summer vacation house or declining , repeatedly , to join friends for a night on the town losing the will , in other words , to do anything spontaneous in a city that breeds spontaneity psychologically , it s been devastating on us , said wendy gering , a real estate agent she and her husband , eric , an architect , could not return to their home and office at 536 madison for two months it s taken an emotional and physical toll the financial hardships , at least , were supposed to be erased quickly , but it has n't turned out that way while affected business owners have sought relief from their own insurance companies , few of the residential tenants were insured in december , harry macklowe , the developer who has owned 540 madison since 1996 , promised residents that he would pick up all the expenses they are incurring jerome m hauer , the director of the mayor s office of emergency management , vowed that he would hold mr macklowe to his word by the time the residents returned in january and february to their apartments in the fivestory brownstones at 534 and 536 madison , they had accumulated debts of 1 , 000 to 40 , 000 , for a total of about 162 , 000 a few expenses raised eyebrows designer clothing , expensive meals and other items that did not seem to qualify as emergency provisions but in any case , the residents have received only about 36 , 000 in emergency advances , in lieu of actual reimbursements the explanation , mr macklowe s representatives say , is that interreco of jericho , ny , mr macklowe s insurer , has determined that mr macklowe is not responsible for the shoddily constructed brick facade as a result , interreco has solicited other companies involved with the 28yearold building it s an unpleasant situation for everyone , said gerald mckelvey , a spokesman for the macklowe organization unfortunately for the people who are displaced , this takes time when that time comes , each claim will be processed judiciously , mr mckelvey said , with the understanding that any advance from the macklowe organization is an admission of nothing other than , 'here s an advance on your claim' for many new yorkers , the amounts involved may not seem like much but most of the madison avenue residents are young professionals in their 20 s and early 30 s , worker bees on wall street or in midtown with little in savings and no concept of renter s insurance to mr macklowe , it s chump change , said richard kennedy of 536 madison , a buyer for an industrial corporation , who has been the residents' liaison with officialdom to us , it s our credit history
baltimore , july 23 passion for lacrosse runs deep through rex lyons , a member of the onondaga tribe in upstate new york and an attackman for the iroquois national team in the lacrosse world championship long before columbus set foot in the americas , lyons s american indian ancestors invented the game lyons s father , oren lyons , played lacrosse at syracuse university with jim brown and roy simmons jr , and is in the sport s hall of fame but all of rex lyons s skill and heritage were no match for the united states squad , which scored 12 goals in the first period and went on to beat the iroquois , 244 , in a semifinal game wednesday at homewood field on the campus of johns hopkins university none of the 10 other teams in this tournament can match the proficiency of the united states , which has dominated the sport of field lacrosse over the last 20 years the united states will play canada , a 1511 winner over australia in the other semifinal , for the championship here on friday night it will be the fourth time that the united states and canada have met in the final of the world championship , which is held every four years canada is the only team other than the united states to win the title , beating the americans in the 1978 final , the only game the united states has lost in world championship play the american dominance of the sport arises from the fact that most of its players play field lacrosse from an early age and advance through collegiate or club level play i got a stick when i was 10 or 11 , said jesse hubbard , an american attackman who played on three straight national collegiate athletic association national championship teams at princeton i played in rec leagues , played in college and i play on a club team most of the guys who play in college came along the same way that has given us a lot of depth this year , the united states has one of its strongest teams ever coached by bill tierney , who has led princeton to five ncaa titles , the united states squad is loaded with players like hubbard and casey powell , the national collegiate player of the year the last two years and the leading career goal scorer at syracuse university in a tournament like this , the hardest thing for me is telling three guys they have to sit out a game , tierney said tournament rules allow 23 of the 26 players on each team to dress for each game equally difficult is fielding a worthy opponent for the americans that is a sore point for the other teams in the tournament the united states squad was culled from the best 120 players in the country , and all of them are in their prime by contrast , scotland s goalkeeper , john marr , is 49 , and his team did not get much of a chance to prepare for the world tournament we did n't have a full squad of players until we got here for the tournament , marr said the only experience we had playing together was two tournaments in england and a scrimmage in order to make the world championship more competitive , the international lacrosse federation , which governs the sport , has allowed american players with ancestral roots in other countries to compete for those countries the other teams in this year s championship are from the czech republic , england , germany , japan , sweden and wales the canadian and the iroquois teams , the other north american teams in the world championship , are experienced lacrosse teams , but they primarily play box lacrosse , an indoor version of the game played on a smaller scale in hockey rinks with shorter sticks we 're still learning the game of field lacrosse , said frank nielsen , the canadian coach over all , we 're better stick handlers than the americans , but they 're better finishers they bury their chances better than we do after 20 years of playing mainly box lacrosse , we 're adapting i think we 're getting better it s a different game asked what it would take to close the gap with the americans , nielsen smiled and said , about 1 million and two years the iroquois nation was a force in the game during the early part of the 20th century , but was banned from international competition in 1932 because its players' participation in various box lacrosse games was deemed to be on a professional level after the ban , the iroquois teams began primarily playing the box version of the game , although sometimes they played it outside on dusty fields enclosed by planks and plywood even so , field lacrosse did not become completely unfamiliar to american indians several indian players compete in field lacrosse for collegiate teams it was not until 1990 , when the iroquois team played in the world championships in australia , that american indians returned to international competition this is their version of the game , lyons said , referring to field lacrosse the size of the sticks , the rules , the size of the goal we do n't have any grudges against them because of what happened with the ban several years ago we 're back in international competition , and i think we have a bright future the iroquois once used the game for spiritual purposes and to settle conflicts and train young warriors lyons said there is still a spiritual quality to the way that american indians play the game whenever we go out and play we feel like our ancestors are on the field with us , lyons said that s why we play fair and play our hardest photos casey powell , formerly with syracuse , is a star of the us team the top team in international lacrosse is the united states , which celebrated a semifinal victory

paris , july 13 as if on cue , a soaking rain gave way to breezy sunshine today as the victorious french soccer team paraded down the champselysees in an openair bus , carrying the world cup championship trophy and the well wishes of an entire nation today s celebration , which followed wild jubilation after sunday s 30 victory over brazil , was further confirmation of how completely a onceindifferent country had become smitten with its soccer team when the tournament began on june 10 , there was more than bigcity indifference in paris there was hostile antisoccer feeling in some quarters bartok , a bar in the bastille section , began the world cup with a party to puncture soccer balls women were said to be largely uninterested but , by sunday night , france had become so consumed that the celebrations on the champselysees were being compared to the liberation of paris during world war ii as the french players , black and white , natives and immigrants , celebrated a victory symbolizing france s ethnic diversity , united states soccer officials presumably received a message that america will never reach soccer s upper reaches until it gets serious about developing black and hispanic players sunday s championship and today s victory parade must have provided a poignant moment for david regis , a defender who became a united states citizen in may after declining earlier to take a chance with his native france while france finished first , his adopted team finished dead last the americans , along with the spanish , were the biggest disappointments of this monthlong 32team tournament coach steve sampson lost his job and american players such as tab ramos , eric wynalda and alexi lalas blamed sampson for the collapse without assuming any personal responsibility it was the failure of experienced players , not sampson s dereliction , that contributed most significantly to the american embarrassment over all , the 1998 world cup was a qualified success the matches were largely competitive and entertaining all but three games between the end of the first round and the final were decided by one goal or penalty kicks and scoring was up over the 1994 world cup in the united states \( 267 goals per game compared with 22 a game in '94 \) the weather was cooler , and because there was no dominant nation , more teams thought they had a chance to win and were willing to take more chances in attack michael owen , the english teenager who played with stunning directness and speed , confirmed that a new generation of stars is blossoming and will be in full bloom in the next world cup exposed was italy , which played not to lose , instead of to win the tournament s leading scorer turned out to be davor suker of croatia , which shocked germany in the quarterfinals and finished third ahead of the netherlands in its first world cup it s not always the big guys who win , suker said the world cup also had its moments of endearing goofiness glenn hoddle , the england coach , hired a faith healer the romanian players dyed their hair gold miroslav blazevic , the eccentric croatian coach , got through the tournament on cigarettes , chocolates and faxes from his astrologer french policemen and policewomen painted their faces blue , white and red on sunday night , while others painted their hair and even their roosters in the colors of the french flag the week of the united statesiran match , sports played a broader political role as the clinton administration called for steps toward a reconciliation between the two countries , which have experienced two decades of enmity during the match , thousands of iranian spectators displayed tshirts honoring exiled leaders in a protest that had to embarrass the islamic regime in teheran but the stereotype of the match , with its great satan and deathtoamerica hyperbole , was severely undercut when it turned out that iran s coach , jalil talebi , had lived for 17 years in northern california and had been affiliated with the same junior college as sampson , the american coach in several areas , this world cup got out of control the celebration was marred when a car swerved into revelers on the champselysees and injured about 80 people early today english and german hooligans blighted a tournament in which most people were otherwise friendly and well behaved the ticket scandal affecting tens of thousands of spectators was an embarrassment that neither fifa , soccer s world governing body , nor french organizers went about trying to correct with the proper urgency brazilian reporters said that as many as 10 , 000 brazilian fans were left without tickets for sunday s final on the field , the quality of refereeing was interfered with by a directive issued in the middle of the tournament by sepp blatter , the newly elected president of fifa , and michel platini , the chief french organizer they called for more players to be penalized for tackling from behind , and in one day alone , five red cards were handed out this confusion and erratic refereeing was inevitable when an attempt was made to change the rules after the competition was under way it was the low point of the world cup , said pele , the former brazilian star now fifa is faced with the unwieldy task of organizing a world cup for 2002 with japan and south korea as joint hosts the logistics would be challenging enough under normal circumstances , but both nations are attempting to build and refurbish stadiums while suffering from the asian financial downturn and there is the unresolved question of whether north korea will also be a host for matches while blatter gave no indication that fifa would move the world cup elsewhere , he is sending a factfinding team to japan and south korea in september the governments and football authorities must guarantee to fifa the stadiums , infrastructure , technical resources and other logistics , including hotels , blatter said at a recent news conference so far , none of these areas have become a problem photo the french goalkeeper fabien barthez hoisted the world cup trophy yesterday on a trip down the champselysees with his

boston at 1 pm on friday , jan 16 , monica lewinsky arrived at the ritz carlton hotel in pentagon city to meet linda tripp what happened then is well known but its significance its crucial significance is not generally understood ms lewinsky was confronted by fbi agents and kenneth starr s assistant prosecutors she immediately told them , as she testified later , that i was n't speaking to them without my attorney her attorney was francis d carter when she was subpoenaed by paula jones s lawyers , she told him that she had not had sexual relations with president clinton mr carter prepared , and she signed , an affidavit to that effect mr starr s agents did everything they could , short of physical force , to keep ms lewinsky from calling frank carter they told her that he was a civil rather than a criminal lawyer so he really could n't help me \( that was a lie mr carter is a highly regarded criminal lawyer who for six years headed washington s public defender service \) they gave her the number of another lawyer and suggested she call him they told her she had signed a false affidavit and could go to prison for 27 years they offered to give her immunity if she would cooperate but said there would be no deal if mr carter were called in \( a federal regulation forbids immunity negotiations in the absence of a suspect s lawyer \) why were mr starr s deputies so anxious that ms lewinsky not telephone mr carter \? on that friday afternoon mr carter had not yet filed ms lewinsky s affidavit until it was filed , it could be changed without legal consequences federal law makes it a crime only to file a false affidavit in a civil case you can swear one , keep it , then change it or tear it up without violating the law mr starr knew about the affidavit from linda tripp s last taped conversation with ms lewinsky , and knew from paula jones s lawyers that it might not yet have been filed that is why his deputies worked so hard to keep ms lewinsky from calling frank carter if he knew what was happening , they realized , he would not file it and they wanted a crime they wanted perjury to be committed by ms lewinsky so they would have leverage over her , and by the president when he was deposed in the jones case the next day if ms lewinsky had called that afternoon , mr carter told me , the affidavit would not have been sent but there was no call at the end of the business day it was sent to the court in little rock by federal express under the rules , that was a filing mr carter had shown the affidavit to the jones lawyers and to robert bennett , president clinton s lawyer if he had not filed it , he said , i would have told them so mr bennett would have known of mr starr s interest in monica lewinsky the president s deposition on saturday would have taken another course or been canceled and the history of the last 10 months would have been very different \( did the president or ms lewinsky in fact commit perjury when they swore they had not had sexual relations \? perjury , a complicated legal concept , requires among other things proof of deliberate falsehood in a conversation with linda tripp unrelated to any threat of prosecution , ms lewinsky had said emphatically that having sex meant having intercourse not oral sex \) the right to a lawyer is fundamental in our constitutional system a person accused of crime , the supreme court said in the scottsboro case in 1932 , requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step without it , the innocent person may be overborne by what she does not understand police officers occasionally break the rules it is another matter when prosecutors , who are officers of the court , overbear a young woman to keep her from calling her lawyer the starr deputies who were there on jan 16 michael emmick , jackie bennett jr and bruce udolf should surely face questions by the appropriate legal authorities on their fitness to practice law and mr starr condoned what they did none of this excuses president clinton s moral folly but it makes powerfully clear that kenneth starr is a far more serious menace to our constitutional order than bill clinton is
nairobi , kenya , aug 11 fbi agents began reconstructing hundreds of pieces of vehicles blown apart by a powerful bomb at the american embassy here last friday , in a painstaking attempt to identify the pickup truck that apparently carried the explosives working on the grounds of a railroad company headquarters across the street from the site , dozens of agents tagged parts and arranged them in a circle kenyan police technicians in white lab coats carried more canisters of debris from the site , which the american experts sifted with rakes for metal parts the federal bureau of investigation declined to comment on its investigation the agents here said they had received orders from washington not to talk to reporters we are not an official presence here , an fbi supervisor said but it was clear that the american agents had in large part taken over the investigation from the kenyan police the local criminal investigations division headquarters was swarming with american lawenforcement officials , who carried computers and other sophisticated equipment into the building at the blast site , the toll continued to rise as workers from israel , france , the united states and kenya continued to pull bodies from the rubble of the sevenstory ufundi cooperative building the building bore the brunt of the explosion , which was aimed at the american mission next door , and collapsed by nightfall , more than 18 mangled bodies had been extracted from the tons of concrete , bringing the death toll here to 217 , kenyan authorities said many of the bodies were found in groups of two or three some were too disfigured to be easily identified another 10 died in the bombing in tanzania as cranes and backhoes ate away at the mountain of rubble , rescue workers said no one was believed to be left alive in either the embassy or the ufundi structure we are getting down to the area now where we have uncovered most of empty spaces and we are getting to compact rubble , capt james chinn of the fairfax county , va , fire department said chances are getting very slim of finding someone alive at this point under a contract with the federal government , a special county team is deployed in cases of disaster , including the oklahoma city bombing the bomb detonated about 10 35 on friday morning in a parking lot behind the embassy the lot is sandwiched between the fivestory mission , the sevenstory ufundi cooperative building and the 22story cooperative house the accounts of witnesses interviewed by news organizations and investigators so far vary wildly in many details , but they agree on a few key points most witnesses say a pickup truck with a covered flatbed made its way past a flimsy crossing gate manned by the cooperative bank s security guards then , according to most accounts , the pickup approached the entrance ramp to the embassy s underground garage , which was staffed by a kenyan guard , and at least one man got out of the truck what happened next is unclear some witnesses recall gunfire others say the attacker hurled an explosive device at the embassy , perhaps a grenade or some other small explosive intended to stun the guards a few seconds later a devastating explosion gutted the rear of the embassy , leveled the ufundi house and damaged buildings in a 200yard radius , united states officials and witnesses said another witness surfaced today at kenyatta hospital douglas sidialo , a 27yearold car salesman who was blinded in the blast , said he saw the pickup enter the parking lot through a gate normally used as an exit to mr sidialo , who was sitting in his car in traffic , it appeared that the truck was trying to force its way through the gate into the embassy parking garage i think the security officers at the american embassy retaliated , he said from his bed i did n't exactly see the retaliation , but i heard the gunshots mr sidialo said he saw a man in a blue uniform with a handheld radio walking calmly away from the pickup just before the explosion then he lost consciousness capt rhyl jones , a british army engineer and explosives expert who was one of the first to arrive on the scene , said the truck carried between 400 and 500 pounds of explosive , judging from the destruction the explosive appeared to be a commercial substance dynamite or a plastic explosive , for instance captain jones said most of the blast went upward but was bounced back toward the embassy by the towering wall of the cooperative house building , whose structure withstood the shock wave if the cooperative building had n't been there , there would have been a bigger space for the blast to dissipate , he said had the bombers managed to gain entrance to the underground parking garage , he said , it would have devastated the embassy building , killing most of the people inside it fbi agents would not comment on what their preliminary analysis of forensic evidence has told them about the bomb but many of the bomb experts working here were also involved in the investigation of the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 , in which 168 people died in that case , investigators discovered the axle of the rented van that carried the bomb the axle bore an identification number that ended up being the crucial piece of information that led to an arrest the search for such evidence can take weeks or months , and none of the lawenforcement officials on site are predicting a quick solution for kenyans , the scale of the tragedy is beginning to sink in some families have begun burying their dead , but there are scores of bodies still lying unidentified in the morgue and the authorities are inundated with requests from frantic people looking for missing relatives , red cross officials said hospitals have issued appeals for blood for the wounded , and have collected thousands of pints , which they say they are screening for the aids virus a sense of hopelessness surrounded the ufundi building today as firefighters brought down body after body on canvas stretchers at 5 pm , the people working on the top of the rubble called for silence and used listening devices and a special television camera on a long pole to check for signs of life inside the mound an expectant hush came over the site after 20 minutes , the people operating the listening equipment slumped in disappointment someone shouted , back to work ! and the

tampa , fla , march 23 the knockdown pitch is as ingrained in the tradition of baseball as the glove or the bat , but actual deployment carries certain responsibilities when cleveland s jaret wright whipped a fastball near the head of second baseman luis sojo in an exhibition game on march 2 , none of the yankees contested the pitcher s right his duty , to some to retaliate for earlier pitches that had hit his teammates but they were angry at what they perceived as wright s inability to throw his brushback pitch appropriately in the eyes of many yankees , wright violated a code by throwing so high sojo threw up his left hand to protect himself , and wright s fastball broke a bone in sojo s third finger , an injury that will sideline him until late april the yankees and the indians will play here tuesday for the first time since that incident it remains to be seen whether the yankees will feel the need to honor the code of retaliation the cycle of brushback pitches and responses can extend not just over innings and games , but over whole seasons as well pitchers can respond in august for a knockdown pitch thrown in may it has become an incendiary tactic that can lead to fights , benchclearing brawls , suspensions and fines , often because players earning millions of dollars believe that someone throwing at them is endangering their livelihood even so , its practitioners have included some of the game s top pitchers , including nolan ryan , bob gibson and don drysdale and there is no doubt that knocking down batters is an accepted and necessary part of the game in the eyes of most major leaguers you do it to protect your players , said jeff nelson , the yankee reliever and you do it to get respect from your players catcher joe girardi said it s important if there are pitchers on the other team coming inside and do n't know how to do it , you ca n't let them take liberties nelson , 31 , acknowledges his reputation for retaliating by throwing at opponents intentionally tino martinez , a teammate of nelson for years , said , jeff is definitely one guy who , if you need to send a message to another team , he s going to do it nelson was suspended in 1996 for throwing at seattle s joey cora , after the mariners' tim davis knocked down paul o'neill nelson knew davis and says he was sure davis did not throw at o'neill intentionally but o'neill was certain that lou piniella , the seattle manager , had instigated the incident , and nelson must defer to the hitters if they get hit , you ask them , nelson said at times i 've said 'hey , i'm going to go out there and drill someone do you want me to hit this guy \? ' nelson s thinking is that the core hitters , like o'neill , martinez and bernie williams , could get thrown at in response to his retaliation if they say , no , no , no , i say fine , nelson said if they say , 'go drill someone , ' i'm going to go drill someone i do n't care about the manager i do n't care about the coach even if they told me not to , i'm going to go out there and do it i'm going to protect my teammates some managers have active roles in retaliation others do not want anything to do with it it is accepted within baseball that tony la russa s teams will respond aggressively , knocking down opponents at a 2to1 ratio and piniella would take matters into his own hands , said nelson , who once played for him in seattle if one of our guys got hit , nelson said , lou would automatically go right to the pitcher , and he would tell you 'hit the first guy that comes up i do n't care if it takes four pitches' don zimmer , a yankee coach whose playing career and cheekbone were shattered by a fastball in 1956 , said that in his 13 years as a major league manager , he never told a pitcher to throw at anybody what happens if i tell you to knock somebody down and you hit him in the head and he does n't wake up \? zimmer asked zimmer , however , believes pitchers should throw inside aggressively , not recklessly but girardi thinks too few pitchers know how to pitch inside , and honoring the code becomes dangerous baseball umpires and officials seem to understand that players police certain situations themselves even so , gene budig , the american league president , said today that the safety of players is a major concern , and the league takes very seriously the threat of injury he added , the game has its tradition , but it will not tolerate irresponsible acts the manner in which a knockdown pitch should be thrown is open to interpretation girardi says below the waist willie banks says ribs and down nelson said i do n't ever try to hit them in the head i just try to hit them nelson s belief is that not enough pitchers know when or how to retaliate , and if they did , there would be few incidents and the code would be better understood by all i do n't think there are very many guys on this team who know that when somebody gets hit , they should go out and hit the next guy , nelson said i do n't think they 're afraid , but i do n't think they know to hit a guy i 'd like to see that change , if it takes the manager to go up to them and say to do it banks said that if pitchers do n't protect their own hitters , their teammates wo n't respect them i 've seen that so many times where guys i 've played with come back to the dugout and say to the pitcher , 'listen , deal with that guy' i always feel when i'm on the mound that it s an eye for an eye inside pitch hideki irabu s sore elbow is feeling better , and he will probably throw off a mound in the next few days if he has no setback , he could pitch in an exhibition game next monday in san diego and start against oakland on april 5 the yankees designated pitcher danny rios for assignment , to make room for pitcher orlando hernandez on the 40man roster darren holmes started for the yankees on monday night against boston and allowed seven hits and six runs \( five earned \) , walking one and striking out three in five innings the red sox won , 87 , ending the yankees' eightgame winning streak photos after being sent to the dirt by a tim davis brushback pitch in august 1996 , the yankees' paul o'neill tangled with seattle mariners catcher john marzano luis sojo , being helped by a trainer , broke a finger when he raised his hand to fend off a jaret wright fastball the yankees say wright threw too high \( photographs by associated press \) chart five steps to a knockdown the generally accepted major league guidelines for throwing a retaliatory knockdown pitch identify the crime a pitcher on the other team throws a series of knockdown pitches or , worse , hits one of your teammates gathering evidence ask the player who was hit and other teammates if they think the knockdown pitch was intentional , if there was a history of antagonism between the pitcher and teammate , or if the opposing pitcher just did it out of spite picking from the lineup determine if there s one particular player who should be targeted for retaliation if your shortstop got hit , do you hit their shortstop \? do you go for the opposing pitcher or do you hit the first batter the next inning \? canvas the jury ask the key position players on your team if they think retaliation is called for because they 're the ones who may get plunked in response dispense justice fairly plunk the targeted opponent with a fastball , preferably from the waist down above the shoulders is considered dangerous and grounds for more retaliation

people think we 're mad for selling it , but i'm getting too old to do the polishing , said joy norton , who is 75 , referring to the lustrous walnut paneling that has changed her life all we want now is a cozy little bungalow fourteen years ago , she and her husband , fred , were shown the apartment in which they now live and were astonished by what they saw there , in the groundfloor flat of an unassuming victorian house in southport , a seaside town in the north of england , was edwardian splendor paneling of satin veneer in the living room , dining room and entrance hall , all ornamented with gold in the louis xvi style we could n't believe our eyes , mrs norton said they bought the apartment and moved in the paneling , they were told , had come off a german battleship but mrs norton s son , glyn samuel , a hairdresser who lives up the road , was curious it looked too ornate to be off a warship , he said his suspicion was confirmed when he found an old photograph at a maritime library in nearby liverpool the paneling , the picture indicated , appeared to be from the firstclass a la carte restaurant of the olympic , the sister ship of the titanic , to which it was nearly identical in design and construction life soon changed for the nortons we 've met so many lovely people only through discovering the a la carte restaurant , mrs norton said among them were ken marschall , a maritime illustrator and adviser on the hit movie titanic , a coachload of americans from the titanic historical society , based in indian orchard , mass , and countless visitors who have turned up unannounced we 're occupied every day showing people the flat , mrs norton said all this commotion will end on may 19 , when sotheby s , sussex , sells the paneling to a buyer willing to remove it from the apartment the estimated price of 135 , 000 to 250 , 000 is , according to the auction house , something of a wild guess it would cost three or four times that to build it today , said james rylands , the auctioneer it is just wonderful quality , as all cruiseship fittings were at that time the olympic and the titanic were built side by side by harland and wolff in belfast , northern ireland the white star line designed the ships to be bigger and more opulent than any that had come before at the start of the olympic s maiden voyage in 1911 , a naval ship accidentally rammed into it and tore a hole in its side above the waterline parts were taken from the titanic to repair the damage , delaying its completion the titanic was trying to beat the olympic s transatlantic time when it struck an iceberg and sank on april 15 , 1912 , killing more than 1 , 500 passengers after the disaster , the olympic was rebuilt to accommodate new safety features and more lifeboats it became a troop ship during world war i and made 500 atlantic crossings before it went to the breaker s yard in 1935 there , some of its fixtures and fittings were sold off , but not all were snapped up mahogany inlaid with motherofpearl , which had come from the firstclass smoking lounge , languished until it was finally sold for firewood while bits of the olympic s elegant woodwork have turned up in hotels and offices all over england , none rival the restaurant paneling it represents most of what lined the dining room , including mirrored doors , a sideboard , ornamental columns and frosted windows with lead panes the ensemble was bought by mae bamber , a former mayor of southport , and installed in her house , which was later divided into apartments it took 12 men a year to do the work all of that information had been lost by the time the nortons moved in i do n't think they realized at first what an important find the paneling was , said eric sauder , a maritime historian he and mr marschall visited the nortons in 1989 to confirm their discoveryour jaws dropped open , mr marschall recalled above the nortons' dining table was a ceiling lamp strung with crystal beads identical to one photographed by robert ballard in his 1986 video exploration of the titanic s wreckage , a clip of which was shown in the movie mr marschall bought it and another lamp and had them reproduced , in plastic , for the film the a la carte restaurant itself , however , was not in the movie i saw the film , mrs norton said the story was good , but i was busy looking at all the sets titanic mementos have been turning up at auction since the success of the film , including a scale model of a lifeboat used in the 1958 film a night to remember we 're now into secondgeneration memorabilia , said mr rylands of sotheby s historians are hoping a museum will acquire the paneling , but mr samuel , mrs norton s son , envisions it as the interior of a posh restaurant on fifth avenue if you ca n't have the titanic , he said , me mum s flat is the secondbest thing photo luxury joy and fred norton in their home , surrounded by walnut paneling from the olympic , sister ship to

washington a renowned letter by thomas jefferson , which is the highlight of a traveling library of congress exhibition intended as a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation , has been seized upon by conservative christian leaders as support for their campaign for classroom prayer , taxpayerfinanced vouchers for religious schools and posting the ten commandments in courtrooms some conservative groups and scholars say the library s analysis of jefferson s letter is authoritative evidence that can be used in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and government at the heart of the exhibition and of the controversy is a famous letter written by jefferson to the danbury baptist association in 1802 in it , the nation s third president coined the phrase wall of separation between church and state the letter has been used in supreme court cases for more than a century to describe the proper relationship between religion and government the library of congress s analysis of the jefferson letter , released at a news conference in may and written by james h hutson , chief of the library s manuscript division , asserted that jefferson never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law , but instead as a way to win political favor with new england constituents mr hutson s analysis said the danbury baptist letter was never conceived by jefferson to be a statement of fundamental principles it was meant to be a political manifesto , nothing more the conservative leaders said this was proof that jefferson s wall metaphor should never have been interpreted as an overarching principle the christian coalition immediately issued a news release headlined library of congress skewers 'wall of separation' myth , and said the library s findings should bolster the campaign for the religious freedom amendment the magazine of focus on the family , a multimedia ministry , called jefferson s wall flimsy gary bauer of the family research council wrote that jefferson s words had been twisted by liberals and last month the controversy ricocheted from christian radio to the ivory tower , when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the jefferson letter was misleading and unbalanced we are concerned for really one fundamental reason , said robert s alley , professor emeritus of humanities at the university of richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the library if you 're going to be the keeper of the precious documents of the nation , you ought not to put them on display with biased analysis , and certainly not with a paper that has not been read by its peers and judged for its qualities , and with as many egregious observations of opinion in an interview at the library of congress in august , mr hutson , caretaker of its manuscripts for 16 years , said he was amazed that a brief paper he wrote as a press primer without footnotes had been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications the last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on constitutional law , mr hutson said mr hutson is 61 , a presbyterian churchgoer , a yale graduate and an expert on benjamin franklin he said he was chagrined that the uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he painstakingly collected for the exhibition he said he would not repudiate the thesis of his paper , but added , maybe i should have been more careful , but i really did try to guard against anything like this happening the tempest began when mr hutson set out to decipher the blottedout lines in the first draft of jefferson s letter to the danbury baptist association the final version says that religion is a matter which lies solely between man his god , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , not opinions jefferson restated the first amendment s religion clause , and followed with thus building a wall of separation between church and state mr hutson asked the federal bureau of investigation to use its computer laboratory to uncover the inkedout words in jefferson s letter , just as the bureau had done with a diary of theodore roosevelt s in doing so , mr hutson was performing excavation on a document that is a touchstone of american history the wall of separation metaphor , though not found in the constitution , is often invoked as shorthand for the religion clause of the first amendment to the constitution , which says that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof the import of the separation language has been argued over by scholars and cited in at least 50 supreme court cases dealing with the relationship between government and religion the supreme court declared in reynolds v united states in 1878 that the wall metaphor was almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the first amendment since then , justices like potter stewart and william h rehnquist have argued that jefferson s words were misused
moscow , sept 9 as president boris n yeltsin pondered for a second day over who would be his next prime minister , the communists threatened today to pursue impeachment if he renominated viktor s chernomyrdin the warning was meant to induce mr yeltsin to abandon mr chernomyrdin in russia s byzantine politics , it was also a defensive maneuver to block the president from dissolving the parliament a vote to impeach would prevent the president from dissolving the parliament for several months , according to the constitution if yeltsin comes up with chernomyrdin for the third time , the duma will raise the issue of impeachment , gennadi a zyuganov , the communists' leader , told reporters today , referring to the lower house of parliament mr yeltsin huddled with mr chernomyrdin and yevgeny m primakov , the foreign minister , as speculation swirled that he might shuffle the deck yet again and pick a new candidate mr primakov has been touted for prime minister by the liberal and communist opposition as the president remained closeted in his residence outside moscow , russia s economy continued its downward spiral the kremlin ended tariffs on medicines today in a belated effort to cope with shortages of drugs in pharmacies and hospitals but the scarcity of goods and oldfashioned profiteering has continued to ratchet prices skyward the state statistics committee reported tonight that prices rose 36 percent the first week of september the only apparent piece of good news was that the ruble rose somewhat in value the central bank set an exchange rate of 15 rubles to the dollar today today , compared with 20 rubles on wednesday even that was deceptive the change , economists said , was largely a result of buying by banks and other customers who need rubles to pay their debts it was not a vote of confidence in the economy the chaos in the marketplace was grist for the communists , who have cast themselves as the champions of russia s downtrodden and dispossessed with mr yeltsin at his residence at gorky9 , a secluded compound outside moscow , the communists took center stage today declaring their willingness to form a government of national unity , they issued a platform echoing soviet themes they promised lowinterest loans to ailing factories and import taxes to protect russian enterprises from foreign competition major industries would be renationalized salaries would be paid and savings protected there would be a crackdown on financial speculation some of russia s most ardent market reformers conceded that the left might succeed at least temporarily in securing a place for themselves in the kremlin in the present situation , of course , i cannot rule out the coming to power of a government with the participation of communists or a government controlled by the communists , said yegor t gaidar , the freemarket reformer and former prime minister i do not have any faith in a lasting communist comeback the escalating crisis has led to a bitter round of fingerpointing anatoly b chubais , the former kremlin aide who led the negotiations with the international monetary fund , insisted that the government had made every effort to stave off the devaluation of the ruble and satisfy the west but he told the newspaper kommersant that mr yeltsin had acted correctly in denying to the very end that the devaluation of the ruble was under consideration , saying anything less would heighten the panic so now the international financial institutions understand , despite the fact that we conned them for 20 billion , that we had no other way , he said the main focus , however , was on the wrangling over the prime ministership yuri m luzhkov , moscow s pugnacious mayor , who met with mr chernomyrdin today , said he believed mr yeltsin would nominate mr chernomyrdin for a third and decisive time nobody could be sure , however , just what mr yeltsin would do aleksandr i lebed , the siberian governor and former general , predicted that mr yeltsin would yield to the demands of the communist opposition and nominate mr primakov or yuri d maslyukov , a communist deputy and former soviet economic planner who served briefly in the yeltsin government before resigning the communistled parliament has often engaged in loose talk about impeachment the impeachment procedures , however , have taken on a new urgency the parliament has twice rejected mr chernomyrdin under the constitution , a third rejection would force the dissolution of parliament and new elections unless the communists come up with their own legislative tactic to block it that is why they are threatening to vote impeachment before mr chernomyrdin s nomination is taken up again to pursue impeachment , the communists need the support of 300 of the 450 members in the lower house of parliament , a margin mr zyuganov insisted was attainable it is much harder to actually remove the president any decision to oust mr yeltsin by the lower house of parliament would have to be approved by a twothirds vote of the upper house of parliament , which has been more supportive of the kremlin , and by the courts the likely result would be a constitutional crisis the communists would insist that the issue was impeachment mr yeltsin could insist on his own reading of the constitution and press for the disbanding of the parliament he could even ask the legislature s upper house to declare a state of emergency the communists are not the only ones working on impeachment the deputy chairman of the parliament s impeachment commission is yelena b mizulina , a member of the liberal yabloko party , which is headed by grigory a yavlinsky , a fierce critic of mr yeltsin she said in an interview that the commission was planning to complete the articles of impeachment this week so the parliament could vote on them as early as monday the main charges will center on mr yeltsin s role in the dissolution of the soviet union , his decision to shell the parliament in october 1993 and the war in chechnya the talk of impeachment was not the only step the parliament took today to protect itself and its perquisites members also voted to pay themselves wages through the end of the year even if the parliament is disbanded some leading officials said none of the maneuvering would stop mr yeltsin asked whom mr yeltsin would nominate , mr luzhkov said you need to know boris yeltsin i think chernomyrdin photos as president boris n yeltsin of russia met yesterday with two of the men in the running to be the next prime minister , members of the lower house of parliament kept abreast of the news at a demonstration outside the kremlin , a communist supporter shouted antigovernment slogans \( reuters associated press \) \( pg a12 \)

washington , april 2 vowing to get tough on criminals and unethical officers , the deputy superintendent of police in chicago , charles h ramsey , was named today as the chief of police in the district of columbia , where high crime rates and police department scandals have plagued the city for years mr ramsey , 48 , who served 29 years on the chicago force , the last three as second in command , replaces larry d soulsby , who abruptly resigned in november after the latest controversy , reports that he was sharing a luxury downtown apartment with a lieutenant who was arrested and charged with embezzling thousands of dollars from the police department in remarks today at a news conference where he was introduced as the next chief , pending the expected confirmation of the city council , mr ramsey said his major goals would be to make washington the safest city in america and its police department the best in the country , bar none and he promised the department s 3 , 600 officers that he would always listen to their ideas and concerns but he also said one of his highest priorities would be dealing with the kind of unethical behavior that has embarrassed and shamed the department misconduct will not be tolerated , he said i do n't believe in second chances the man upstairs gives you a second chance not me i have absolutely no tolerance for that such nononsense sentiments , for which he was known in chicago , helped win the job offer for mr ramsey over a field of 50 applicants that field was narrowed last week to three finalists , including sonya t proctor , who was appointed acting chief when mr soulsby resigned , and richard pennington , the new orleans police superintendent since 1994 and a 20year veteran of the district force before that the field was further winnowed on monday when mr pennington abruptly withdrew after senator lauch faircloth of north carolina , chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on the district , said mr pennington was too much an insider to serve effectively but the final choice of mr ramsey over ms proctor was less a matter of congressional intrusion than of the bewildering process of managing city agencies since congress created a financial control board three years ago , giving it broad powers to solve the district s fiscal and management problems to prevail , mr ramsey had to win the support of a 35member citizens advisory committee that was appointed last year to find a new chief , the 10member panel of experts that oversees the police department for the control board , the control board itself and , implicitly , mr faircloth in a formality , mayor marion s barry jr , who has been left with little power , still called mr ramsey my choice as the next chief and said he would send the nomination to the city council for confirmation as the chief architect of chicago s community policing programs , which were credited with driving down crime rates there , mr ramsey had also been one of three finalists in february to lead the chicago police department and was viewed by many as the leading contender to succeed superintendent matt rodriguez , who retired but mayor richard m daley of chicago , after acknowledging that he vacillated between mr ramsey and terry hillard , the chief of detectives who had once been one of the mayor s bodyguards , chose mr hillard until then , mr ramsey had not even applied for the opening in washington but once mr hillard had been named , stephen d harlan , chairman of the district s police oversight panel and vice chairman of the control board , flew to chicago to urge him to apply at the news conference today , mr ramsey was praised by mr barry and dozens of city leaders , as well as a senior official of the union , the fraternal order of police , who predicted that mr ramsey s goals and his lack of tolerance for misconduct would play well with the rank and file it s refreshing to us to listen to a chief who says he will have an opendoor policy , said detective frank a tracy , executive steward of the police union we have n't had that here before it will help morale , and right now , morale is the lowest it s been in the 26 years i 've been here as in other major american cities , the levels of crime are falling in washington in brief remarks , ms proctor released statistics for the district that showed major crime for the first quarter of the year dropped 22 percent since the first quarter of last year , to the lowest level in 20 years also , the number of homicides for the quarter was the lowest , at 57 , since the first three months of 1987 when 54 were recorded but fighting crime might not be mr ramsey s greatest task police conduct and management might prove to be more problematic this is a department that has suffered through countless scandals in recent years , including overtime abuses , the failure to spend federal grants and the possible improper use of mr barry s security personnel just this week , a memorandum was leaked to a washington television station that reflected concerns of the chief of the mayor s security detail about periodic unscheduled stops by the mayor around town in the day the memorandum , written on jan 27 by lieut ricky r mitchell to assistant chief rodney d monroe , said the appearance of unethical or immoral conduct by public officials is unacceptable mr barry denied

this was n't for publication after all , he did n't need the information being tacked to a rival s bulletin board for added motivation but a member of the chicago bulls , in deep throat mode , whispered recently that the only obstacles standing in the way of them winning yet another national basketball association championship were utah , utah and utah after the game yesterday afternoon , it seemed that the knicks might have been added to the mix , since it took the utah jazz a pair of overtimes to finally put the knicks in their feisty place , 124119 for the knicks are a marvel with patrick ewing relegated to observer with wrist wrap , and larry johnson often observer in baggy shorts , they have virtually no inside game , but they can hit 3point shots and give themselves openings for drives and play a frisky defense thus they can make even the best teams in the league sweat blood for their victories and the jazz is one of the best just check the standings or last season s results , for that matter , in which utah fell to the bulls in the finals in six games with a victory yesterday , the jazz tied seattle for the secondbest record in the nba , 5017 , and is a halfgame behind the 5117 bulls and while the concluding games of the regular season are often dreary affairs , as teams are either looking ahead to the playoffs or looking ahead to a somnolent summer , both the jazz and knicks had a particular inducement for the knicks , it is that they still are n't assured of a playoff spot , though things are looking rather flush as for the jazz , it is no secret that the team with the best record in the league has the homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs , which would be significant if utah from the west and chicago from the east meet in the finals again , as dt , among many others , believes the jazz players , for publication , like to say they are n't looking ahead to anything more than tomorrow s game but when karl malone is asked if he thinks about getting another crack at the bulls , he smiles i try not to think about it , he said , with a pair of ice packs on his 34yearold knees after the knicks game yesterday , in which he scored 30 points and pulled down 14 rebounds but it is in the back of my mind malone , who won the most valuable player award last season , played poorly in the finals it was apparent that he felt the pressure he said he was trying not to think too much this season i'm more relaxed this season , he said if i go 1 for 6 from the field , or 1 for 7 , i do n't panic i think , 'the next one s going in' in fact , malone missed a big jump shot that would have sealed the victory at the end of the first overtime yesterday , but made his brawny presence felt in the second overtime with a jump shot , a block , a rebound , an assist , to name just a few of his contributions none of the jazz players , however , believe the team is as strong at this stage of the season as it was last season they cite injuries to greg ostertag , the massive center , and to antoine carr , and the 18 games john stockton missed with a knee injury but there are pluses for one thing , the younger players coming off the bench , such as howard eisley , stockton s backup shandon anderson , and bryon russell , who hit several key 3point shots yesterday , are playing with more confidence for another , the veteran team has learned how to worm out a victory even on a relatively flat afternoon what the jazz does so well is execute its plays , and it does so even when , as yesterday , it trails by 11 points with four and a half minutes to go in the game the trick \? not to panic , stockton said we 're not just firing up shots without rhyme or reason we pick up defensively that s about it sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't it s a simple game yes , the masters understand how to create order out of chaos which leaves , for the jazz , the bulls we 'll see how much they learned from the league finals last season , chris childs , the knicks' thoughtful guard , said about utah they have to pick up their game , and have to get some big guys like ostertag back to full strength otherwise , malone is vulnerable to getting in foul trouble but they still play with a lot of confidence , and a lot of skill i like their chances meanwhile , the knicks felt yesterday as though they had let a big fish off the hook it was a small margin , but the difference between winning and losing may often be such the knicks have yet to figure out the critical details the jazz has the question , however , at season s end may be whether the jazz has yet figured out the final piece of the puzzle the bulls photo the jazz s karl malone , left , with larry johnson of the knicks \( barton silverman the new york times \)

kfar shmaryahu , israel reminiscing over the drone of planes taking off from an airstrip near this tel aviv suburb , gordon levett , a 77yearold englishman , savored the memories of his days as a volunteer combat pilot at israel s birth half a century ago it was quite fun stuff , he said of the risky missions he had flown i was the only english gentile pilot in the israeli air force a squadron leader in the royal air force in world war ii , mr levett was one of the few nonjews among about 5 , 000 foreign volunteers who came to fight for israel when it was invaded by arab countries after it declared independence on may 14 , 1948 a few hundred of the volunteers , mr levett among them , were back in israel recently to be honored on its 50th anniversary they had enlisted mostly from the united states , canada , britain and south africa , using their world war ii experience to help organize the israeli fighters as a conventional army the volunteers set up israel s air force , manned new armor , artillery and naval units and served in the medical and signal corps their expertise was critical in helping what was previously an underground zionist force win the war against the arab armies not only was he not a jew , but mr levett was particularly notable because he was british to most israelis at that time , the recently lapsed british mandate in palestine had been decidedly proarab , and british government policy was seen as antizionist recruited in march 1948 by emissaries in europe of the haganah , the jewish fighting force in palestine , mr levett was viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion in my last interview i was told , 'we 're quite convinced that you are a british spy , but we 're going to take you to see what you 're up to , ' he recalled mr levett had volunteered for the zionist cause in outrage over british policy in palestine the british government had refused to cooperate with a 1947 united nations plan to partition palestine into jewish and arab states , saying it would withdraw its forces from the country i felt anger and shame , mr levett recalled to continue that policy after the holocaust was a bloody outrage and evil there comes a time when morality overrides politics after 2 , 000 years of persecution of the jews , the establishment of israel was one of the greatest humanitarian causes in all of human history mr levett was sent to czechoslovakia , where american jewish volunteers had assembled a fleet of transport planes bought privately in the united states to ferry arms bought from the czechs to israel the hardware , sold with soviet approval , included 25 germandesigned messerschmitt fighter planes , which were dismantled for the journey they had to take the wings off , and half a messerschmitt was taken per flight , shoehorned into the transport right up to the cockpit , mr levett said the area around the messerschmitt was packed with lots of rifles , bombs and first aid equipment flying at night to avoid detection , mr levett and his colleagues airlifted the supplies to israel in defiance of a united nations arms embargo on the middle east combatants it was hairy , because we were flying with no weather reports and no paperwork , and crews that had to land in greece and rome because of engine trouble were arrested , mr levett recalled none of us had flown that particular aircraft before we were odd sorts from all over , flying illegally , at night , without licenses and with no parachutes later in israel , mr levett flew the same transport planes on bombing missions that ranged from the sinai peninsula to damascus there were no bomb racks , so the bombs were rolled out by a 'bombchucker' who was tied into the plane with rope , he said on other flights , mr levett ferried troops behind egyptian lines in the negev and brought reinforcements to eilat , the red sea port he flew messerschmitt and spitfire fighters against egyptian warplanes , downing one one of his colleagues in the squadron was ezer weizman , now israel s president at our base i saw the messerschmitts not with a swastika but with the star of david , he recalled what a lovely moment this notorious nazi fighter was now serving the jews mr levett was eventually appointed to turn the ragtag transport squadron , manned by american volunteers who refused to put on uniforms , into a disciplined air force unit in may 1949 , after the fighting had ended , mr levett bid a painful farewell to israel and went home , doubtful whether he could find his place as a nonjew in the jewish state he went on to a career as a civilian pilot , ferrying planes for aircraft companies on the streets of israel he and his comrades had been greeted as heroes , and the return to britain was a jolt the day i returned to england it was raining , he recalled it felt like a balloon deflating i had fought a moral war and was associated with a great cause i still feel more at home here walking down bengurion street than i do in england walking down piccadilly i know why in a tiny way , i helped build this country photo gordon levett , right , a british pilot and a nonjew , volunteered to fight against the arabs who threatened the new israeli state in 1948 he visited israel this month , staying with boris senior , an israeli pilot , left \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \)
boston listen up , zoomers and ubbi dubbi linguists of all stripes , childhood pleasures are coming around again pbs is reviving zoom , the daily variety series for 6to12yearolds that was one of the most popular children s shows of the 1970 s considered a coupling of sesame street and laughin , the series was second only to masterpiece theater in its power to attract publicbroadcasting viewers for a culture now gripped with nostalgia for the bellbottoms and tiedyed tshirts of that decade , wgbh , the public television station here , has shot 40 new episodes of the show , replete with the old secret language ubbi dubbi , and scheduled a nationwide premiere for january the 90 s zoom hosts have shorter hair , rounder faces and narrower bellbottoms than their predecessors and no need to ask if hockey can be a girl s game but what the producers of zoom are trying to recreate is not the 1970 s version of youth culture as fashion statement beyond disco music , polyester leisure suits or drugdazed daffiness , they seek to extol the deeper values of the 1970 s peace , love , activism , power to the people and free , creative expression , recurrent themes of the original series it s about empowering children , said kate taylor , the executive producer we want to give kids the power in a safe and supportive way to write down their ideas , guide us and , as a reward for taking the risk of reaching out , give them a tv show and a continuous dialogue with us no puppets or animation here zoom , which focuses on literacy , science and math , did and does again call upon real children from around the country to provide the show s contents for the new series , for instance , patrick of flatwoods , ky , sent in a video depicting the construction of a paddleboat from styrofoam trays and rubber bands the video was made part of one show , showing the final result the vessel was launched and even floated striving for education through participation , zoom urges young viewers to send in ideas for games , puzzles , recipes , poems , skits and conversations the station responds via a newsletter and email viewers are also asked , over the air , to summon up enough confidence in their own creativity to turn off the television and do the activities themselves that s interactive \( among other things \) and that interactive format should position zoom to take advantage of digital television when it introduces realtime twoway communication , said peggy charren , founder of the advocacy group action for children s television the show has positioned itself for the digital future by reviving some of the deeper values of the 70 s past , she said zoom also has a web site \( www pbs org zoom \) and an email address \( zoom wgbhorg \) ms charren believes there s good reason to revive zoom there has n't been anything like it before or since , she said a lot of the 70 s nostalgia is banal , but 'zoom' teaches children what they need to know to function in a democracy and helps busy parents organize creative play for them it s for and by kids it s not based on selling merchandise one recent day at wgbh , on the purple , yellow , orange and acid green zoom set , the new show s hosts , ages 9 to 14 , were hard at work alisa , david , jared , keiko , lynese , pablo and zoe all from the boston area and none of them professional actors are known by first names only to avoid creating a star system , said ms taylor passing out pieces of bubble gum for one segment , the children asked the ageold question who can blow the biggest bubble \? in response , they chewed and puffed as the sticky stuff burst on freckled cheeks , pigtails and noses a pack of gum can be fun for hours , they chanted if you like what you see , turn off the tv and try it next , zoe , unselfconsciously wearing a blue bicycle helmet , presented her flea circus she coaxed the imaginary but nevertheless fabulous fernando to do his deathdefying back flip on a seesaw made of a ruler laid over a cork as the flea soared in the air , the other children did the sound effects off camera barking dog , drum roll and slide whistle after zoe had patiently spent a halfhour trying to perfect the 30second bit , she momentarily deflated and curled onto the carpet for a catnap soon after , the children divided up for a relay race in which each team had a suitcase of old clothes the children pulled the oversize shirts and slacks over their own clothes , ran to their teammates on the other side , then peeled off and repacked the clothes for the next contestants while most children s shows have adult hosts , an educational show with real children as hosts helps build young viewers' selfesteem and interest them in learning , said joanne cantor , a professor of communication arts at the university of wisconsin television has a potentially limitless power to positively affect viewers if the money and effort are put in , she added apparently that was true for zoom the first time around when it was introduced a generation ago , the show was unusual because it received praise from children , parents and television critics wildly popular among children , the show received about 10 , 000 letters a week , but it also received two emmy awards for outstanding children s series early on , john j o'connor of the new york times described the show s success as almost startling and attributed that to firstrate editing and presentational techniques plus the spontaneous creativity of children and their infectious exuberance any young viewer , he said , could believe that he or she would be sensational on the show nevertheless in 1973 , faced with a chronic shortage of funds , the corporation for public broadcasting in washington threatened to cancel zoom in an act of 70 sstyle political activism , zoom hosts asked viewers to press for the show s continuation by sending letters to cpb deluged by about 190 , 000 pieces of mail , cpb found the necessary 700 , 000 today it costs 8 million to produce one season in part , the revival of the show , which ran from 1972 through 1979 , is also a matter of timing as people in their 20 s and 30 s have children , they reminisce about their own childhood , said ms taylor of course , there are risks in retreads old zoomers may not like the new features \( among them , shorter segments , more dynamic graphics , a bolder color scheme and zoomchats in which children talk about major issues from starting school to divorce \) and young viewers may resist watching a show with which their parents identify as they wrap up shooting , it s clear that making the show has been like an extended summer camp for the zoom cast , which will change next season in june , the group bonded through a twoandahalfday outward boundstyle retreat in a nearby suburb at wgbh , the children had their own private playroom , where they learned the material for each segment , rehearsed , ate and relaxed and they are learning at least one very adult lesson as david , age 10 , said , the hardest thing is , i do n't want this to end photos the 1972 hosts of the original zoom , which ran for seven seasons and received two emmy awards for outstanding children s series \( photofest \) \( pg 41 \) the new hosts of zoom , a daily educational variety series for children the show , a hit in the 1970 s , returns to pbs in january \( ed quinn for the new york times \) \( pg 35 \)
sacramento , calif , may 4 a federal judge sentenced theodore j kaczynski today to four life sentences plus 30 years in prison at a hearing in which the widow of one of the confessed unabomber s victims lashed out at him as a diabolical , evil , cunning murderer in a breathless , anguished voice , susan mosser , the widow of thomas j mosser , a public relations executive , recalled the blood and horror on dec 10 , 1994 , when a shattering blast blew nails and razor blades through her husband s body as he opened a package bomb at their home in north caldwell , nj she ran to the kitchen as the smoke lifted , she said , and her husband lay on the floor face up , his stomach slashed open , his heart perforated and the fingers on his right hand dangling by skin after paramedics failed to revive mr mosser , one of the couple s three children approached ms mosser recalled the unbearable pain when she told her daughter daddy s dead it was a bomb in sentencing mr kaczynski , judge garland e burrell jr of federal district court said , the defendant committed unspeakable and monstrous crimes for which he shows utterly no remorse mr kaczynski did not apologize for his 17year reign of terror that killed three people and injured 22 i ask only that people reserve judgment on me and the unabomber case , mr kaczynski , 55 , said shortly before he was sentenced afterward , his younger brother , david kaczynski , who first raised suspicions about his brother , offered an apology to all of these good people , the kaczynski family offers its deepest apologies , he said outside the court we are very , very sorry as ms mosser spoke at the sentencing hearing , mr kaczynski sat nearby , sandwiched between two defense lawyers at first he seemed relaxed , until he began scribbling notes as his victims and their relatives denounced him they condemned him as a vicious killer , a coward and a manipulative monster several expressed sentiments like those of nicklaus suino , a research assistant injured when he opened a package bomb at the university of michigan in 1985 his wound had healed , mr suino said , but even today he will not open a package unless he knows who sent it i would have shed not a single tear had he been executed , he said there was little surprise in the lifewithoutparole sentence mr kaczynski said he would accept a life sentence on jan 22 , when he pleaded guilty to 13 of the unabom crimes , including the three fatal bombings , to avoid a trial in which his lawyers intended to argue he was mentally ill prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty before the sentencing , mr kaczynski addressed the judge , berating prosecutors for the long sentencing memorandum they filed last week , which disclosed dozens of his journal entries in which he said he was motivated by hatred and revenge and had wanted from the start to kill a high government official or important businessperson mr kaczynski said the government memorandum distorted facts for purely political motives he said he would make public his comments and thoughts on the case later the only legal issue left after today s hearing was where mr kaczynski would serve his sentence prosecutors have asked that he be placed in a maximum security prison defense lawyers have requested a prison in the california region where they can have regular contact with him in another emotional moment , lois b epstein spoke of the bombing in june 1995 that seriously wounded her husband , charles j epstein , a geneticist , at their home in tiburon , a san francisco suburb she told mr kaczynski that she was a cancer researcher but did not mention that , like him , she had a degree from harvard she hoped , she said , that mr kaczynski would suffer for his crimes from the hatreds that have mangled and distorted your mind her husband also addressed the court , belittling mr kaczynski s lawyers' unsuccessful efforts to portray mr kaczynski as mentally unstable mr kaczynski , he said , had done a disservice to the thousands of people with mental disabilities but it was ms mosser who seemed to capture the pain , grief and hardship suffered by the families of the unabomber s victims she recalled that she kneeled over her husband , realizing that the pounding pulse she felt was my own heart her husband had none my children are bleeding from their souls , she whispered , adding , even after three and a half years we are processing the pain mr kaczynski , she said , received a lesser sentence than her children please keep this creature out of society forever , she told

a history of the american people by paul johnson 1 , 088 pp new york harpercollins publishers 35 the story of america , paul johnson says at the end of this enormous book , is essentially one of difficulties being overcome by intelligence and skill , by faith and strength of purpose , by courage and persistence america today is a human achievement without parallel that s not to say he likes everything about the united states he has no fondness for planning , government regulations , affirmative action , efforts to preserve the distinct identity of american indians , multilingual education or contemporary leftleaning intellectuals in the academy or the press a history of the american people is not balanced and does not pretend to be but anyone who dismisses it as a conservative tract will miss the arresting contentions and pieces of fascinating , oddball information sprinkled through its 1 , 000plus pages the book also offers a rare opportunity to witness someone trying to make sense of all 400 years of american history and to discover what tremendous lessons it holds for americans and the rest of mankind like a circus acrobat on the high wire , johnson may seem fated to fail , but it s hard to stop watching his act a prolific british author who writes a weekly essay for the spectator and has published other big books , including modern times \( 817 pages \) , a history of the jews \( 644 pages \) and the birth of the modern \( 1 , 095 pages \) , johnson undertook this project , he says , because american history was something of a black hole in his formal education at stonyhurst and oxford , and producing a book is the only way to study a subject systematically , purposefully and retentively he set out to provide a comprehensive account of american history from the late 16th century to the present , full of facts and dates and figures , which can be used with confidence by students who wish to acquire a general grasp of american history that required not just vast reading but a ruthless selection and rejection of material , which he promised to do as untendentiously as i know how the book starts slowly as he slogs through the colonial and revolutionary periods , picking up themes that can tie together the story of this greatest of all human adventures he finds one in the proliferation of laborsaving , waterdriven sawmills in early new england , which showed even the first settlers moving from an economy of scarcity to an economy of plenty , where men were valuable to a degree unknown in europe and plans for grandiose baronies based on feudal models always failed indeed , again and again in early america , planning of all sorts fell before an obstinate individualism made possible by what is for johnson a fundamental influence on american history the ready availability of land combined , in colonial times , with a persistent labor shortage america soon became a nation of middleclass owneroccupiers , a doityourself society that worked by the mid18th century , the economy of britain s mainland american colonies had one of the highest growth rates the world has ever witnessed so many things were happening in america , at such speed , that british authorities simply lost touch that was no disaster , since from their beginnings the colonies had developed , from british precedents , a system of selfgovernment that included representative assemblies irritation with intrusions of english authority became an early american characteristic , along with a deepseated antipathy to taxes so , given the arrogance and inflexibility of the succession of nonentities who ruled britain in the early reign of george iii , the road of history led only in one direction , to ultimate independence johnson s heart is less in the early period than in the 19th century , when , finally , he confronts the america he loves , a country specifically created by and for ordinary men and women with a system of government deliberately designed to interfere in their lives as little as possible , a place where the spirit of laissezfaire libertarianism pervaded every aspect of life the results were fantastic domestic birth rates reportedly reached levels never before equaled in history , while a great flood of immigrants arrived in the united states , which was for them a paradise with high wages , low taxes and , above all , cheap land the nation s landmass multiplied with the louisiana purchase and the mexican war new patents increased at a dizzying rate , and laborsaving machinery like mccormick reapers allowed gigantic annual additions of land under cultivation that were unprecedented in world history turnpikes , canals and railroads overcame the tyranny of distance , facilitating the expansion of markets and of benevolent prosperity then industrial development moved into high gear by the end of the 19th century , americans lived in the world s wealthiest country and enjoyed living standards unprecedented in the history of humanity
st louis , sept 27 his seasonlong performance so surpassed any individual performance major league baseball has ever seen that mark mcgwire said , i'm in awe of myself right now finishing that performance with a flourish , mcgwire clouted two more home runs on the last day of the regular season today , raising his record total to 70 like a longdistance runner with an explosive finishing kick , mcgwire sprinted away from the guy next to him , sammy sosa , by hitting five home runs in his last 11 atbats sosa , who remained at 66 home runs after hitting none today , is not finished playing the cubs , the team he has carried all season , will meet the san francisco giants in chicago on monday night the mets missed a chance to force a threeway tie by losing in atlanta today to determine the fourth and final team , the wildcard team , in the national league playoffs but sosa will be hardpressed to catch mcgwire , the largerthanlife superstar who has imbedded himself in the hearts of st louis fans and captivated the rest of the country with his performance and his demeanor a player has hit four home runs in a game only 12 times in major league history , none for five years good luck , mcgwire said earnestly long distance to sosa , who has become his ally in home runs and understanding of what he has gone through the past six months we 've been going back and forth it s been a tremendous ride for he and i mcgwire , who broke roger maris s 37yearold record of 61 with a line drive over the leftfield fence at busch stadium on sept 8 , trailed sosa only twice this season , each time for less than an hour sosa slugged his way into the lead last friday night by hitting his 66th home run in houston , but 45 minutes later , mcgwire tied him , then did not look back he socked a pair of home runs against montreal pitchers on saturday and connected against two expos rookies today he lofted a towering fly ball against mike thurman in the third inning that descended gracefully into the leftfield stands for no 69 then in the seventh inning , an hour and nine minutes later , he swung at the first pitch he saw from carl pavano and lined it over the leftfield fence for no 70 i ca n't believe i did it can you \? mcgwire said at a postgame news conference that had become as much a part of his day as hitting home runs it s absolutely amazing it blows me away hitting five home runs in the span of 11 atbats is incredible even for the hitter who finished the season with a record low ratio of 1 home run every 727 atbats mcgwire had registered the previous low ratio of 813 in 1996 , when he hit 52 home runs , surpassing babe ruth s record 848 achieved in 1920 i 've always said hitting home runs is getting pitches to hit , keeping your stroke intact and working hard , he said , discussing his fantastic finish home runs are n't easy to do when you work as hard as i 've worked the last few years to really work on my swing and get full extension , it s paid off in the cardinals' first six games against the expos , mcgwire hit one home run then came the deluge in his last 11 atbats , he hit a home run , singled , struck out , struck out , hit a home run , flied out to center field , hit a home run , grounded out to third base , singled , hit a home run and \( after walking \) hit a home run his last two swings of his already legendary season produced home runs he s amazing , said orlando cabrera , the expos' rookie shortstop everything he hits goes out cabrera , who hit a home run of his own in the third inning , congratulated mcgwire as the cardinal slugger passed him in the seventh inning i 'll be able to tell my kids i hit a home run the same day as mcgwire hit his 70th , he said neither thurman nor pavano , the rookie pitchers , was distraught over his contribution to baseball history thurman , a 25yearold righthander , said he threw mcgwire a breaking ball , a bad breaking ball that most guys do n't hit , up and in he added most guys take it or pop it up he just muscled it out that s why he s so special thurman said he was not particularly happy about giving up the home run but to be part of something that s special is a good feeling , he said it s something i 'll look back on thurman faced mcgwire again in the fifth inning and walked him on four pitches , the fourth making the 6foot5inch batter duck as the ball sailed over his head i was completely out of gas , thurman said i think everyone knows i was n't trying to hit him no one felt worse about it than i did , coming in with a 30 fastball at his head it could have been pretty ugly fortunately , he got out of the way i hope he knows i was n't doing it on purpose it was , mcgwire said , no big deal when he went to bat in the seventh inning , the game was tied , 33 , runners were at first and second , and pavano was pitching pavano , acquired from boston last november in a trade for pedro martinez , was making his first relief appearance of the season after 23 starts
washington , dec 2 after four years of harrowing investigation and two months of sitting mute through his trial , mike espy broke his silence today , alternating bursts of exultation at his acquittal with condemnation of an independent counsel s 17 million dragnet effort to put him in prison each and every day i read the 27th psalm , said mr espy , the former secretary of agriculture , beaming gratefully outside the courthouse where he prevailed against corruption charges and it basically says that the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear \? certainly not donald smaltz mr smaltz , the independent counsel , was among the special prosecutors who have been conducting seven separate investigations of clinton administration officials over the last six years it s cost a lot , mr espy said , eying his brother , henry , whose acquittal on charges brought by the independent counsel came too late for last election day , when he lost his job as mayor of clarksdale , miss it s been tough , mike espy said at his side , one of his lawyers , ted wells , celebrated the verdict as a double victory for mr espy personally and for those who feel the hefty investigatory and budget powers of the independent counsel law must be reined in hopefully , mr wells said , the united states congress will look at this victory and decide to change the independent counsel statute and put both donald smaltz and kenneth starr out of business with public opinion remaining strong behind president clinton , who has faced his own investigatory travails at the hands of mr starr , the fairness of the independent counsel law itself has come under increasing doubt as it faces renewal by congress next year this decision is probably another nail in the coffin for the independent counsel statute , which was in a lot of trouble to begin with , said irv nathan , a former justice department prosecutor who has studied the law in behalf of the american bar association it will be perceived as another example of excessive exuberance by an independent counsel and of poor judgment , he said of the espy prosecution mr espy said he was sustained by visits home to yazoo city , miss , over the last four years the people there took me in , he said they knew that none of this was true hometown friends helped him raise a legal defense fund at 25abowl soup pot rallies this is good news for yazoo city , said joseph c thomas , vice president of guaranty national bank , who said he thought the president might owe mr espy an apology for jettisoning him so quickly they pounced on him pretty hard , he said , but mr espy kept the faith with his supporters back home , whom he previously served in congress no , mr espy said , they did n't believe the cynicism and the levels of acrimony thrown at you , such as have been thrown here in washington , dc in his joy , mr espy prompted laughter as he described how his own troubles had almost totally distracted him from the president s troubles you may not believe it , but i barely know who monica lewinsky is , he said , smiling so i really have not paid much attention to it , and i just wish him well critics of the independent counsel law have argued that it lacks safeguards against politically biased and zealous prosecutors ranging across the land in a veritable parade of horribles , to use the phrase of walter dellinger , a former justice department official in the clinton administration who opposes renewal of the law i think the cure is even worse than the disease , mr dellinger said the law may lead to a kind of allornothing strategy once 17 million has been spent the high stakes leave no leeway , he said , for the sort of plea bargaining that is standard elsewhere in the criminal justice system asked whether his ordeal had soured him on public service , mr espy told of how , as he was forced from the administration , he met man to man with the president to profess his absolute innocence he looked me in the eye and we talked and he made a promise to me , mr espy said , declining to spell it out i'm hopeful that he 'll keep that promise mr espy said the ordeal of an independent counsel investigation was a test of physical as much as spiritual courage he s not unlike any other schoolyard bully , he said of mr smaltz you 've got to stand up to him having survived the independent counsel s charges , mr espy stood outside the court and looked back 11 years to the reagan administration and the independent counsel prosecution of labor secretary raymond j donovan mr donovan was acquitted of fraud charges after a lengthy , costly struggle mr donovan s parting comment , still widely remembered by politicians here , was , where do i go to get back my reputation \? as he prepared to leave the court a free man , mr espy said , i wo n't repeat that because i do n't believe that i ever lost my good name photo former agriculture secretary mike espy , right , with one of his lawyers , ted wells , outside federal court yesterday in washington \( justin lane for the new york times \)
tom goodridge , a special education teacher , arrived at work as usual yesterday morning , dropped his compost in the community garden across the street , picked up a few candy wrappers left over from halloween and was at his post at public school 76 in harlem by 7 40 two hours later , the living classroom mr goodridge had helped build for six years was flattened by bulldozers the sign explaining what should be put in the pentagonal compost hung lonely on the abandoned brick building next to what had been the garden , but was now just a pile of dirt mr goodridge and others involved in the studentnamed garden of love in harlem had known for a year that their space was in jeopardy , as part of the giuliani administration s plan to convert cityowned lots some merely vacant , many blossoming community gardens , of which there are 750 into new housing developments but they thought the city would notify them before the bulldozers came , so they could move the trove of trees , the curving brick path and the storytelling circle to a plot behind the school where a new garden was planned this was a symbol of hope for me , for the school , mr goodridge said it s devastating this is an incredible insult how do you answer a child s why \? why 'd they go and do that \? in their quest to create affordable housing in urban neighborhoods , city officials have often had to decide what to do with community gardens that sprang up in abandoned lots a policy statement from the city s department of housing preservation and development indicates the giuliani administration is striving for balance our goal is to create a policy that recognizes the need for more affordable housing and more permanent open space , it says as for the garden across from ps 76 , on west 121st street near frederick douglass boulevard , the agency released a statement yesterday saying the lot would be part of a new development of about 100 two and threefamily homes for low and moderateincome residents gardeners were advised to relocate and recycle their plants and building materials as their lease on the lot expired last fall , the statement said officials declined to explain why there was no specific warning of when the bulldozers would arrive the balancing act between affordable housing and garden oases amid urban blight held little interest for pilar johnsonscott , the pta president at ps 76 she was in a meeting at school when she heard about the bulldozers , and ran across the street in time to save the crab apple tree that had been the favorite of her 7yearold son , andre then she cried for the other plants the city comes in and just takes their dreams , ms johnsonscott said yesterday afternoon , her tears replaced by anger this is something that they made , that they created what is the city trying to do \? are they trying to build up the community or tear it down \? mr goodridge and mary emma harris , a horticulturist , were hoping to build a bit of community when they began the garden of love six years ago since then , the garden has received 27 , 000 in grants and other donations this becomes a part of people s lives , it becomes a part of children s lives , said cynthia worley , a founder of project harmony , a neighborhood group a part of them has been destroyed by having this living , growing thing they 've worked on for years and years and years destroyed in front of their eyes when he was growing up in greenwich , conn , mr goodridge said , he would climb a tree whenever he had a problem his students had none to climb on a field trip to central park , they marveled at all the trees together rather than marching in a line , he recalled gazing at another community garden down the block , he said , they asked what the apples were doing on a tree , rather than in the market it was thrilling to be able to do something in a green way , said mr goodridge , 47 , who lives just a few blocks from the school to me that s as important as the a b c s i think a child learns more by planting in a garden , doing something real , feeling their own impact on something , rather than just talking about something abstract in a book in the 25by75foot garden , each season brought new lessons fifth graders planted the grass science classes started warm compost third graders studied the bees buzzing around the flowers second graders made two large dream catchers , an american indian folk tradition , for the back fence in between , teachers found sanity and serenity eating lunch under the shade of the mulberry tree , while children turned over logs to uncover worms and munched on the peppermint , strawberries and blueberries there were tulips to pick , potatoes and greens to eat and , once , a monarch butterfly to gaze at i did n't come to play , i came to work , andre johnson said of the garden plant flowers and eat pumpkin and eat crab apples , crab berries the worms and stuff i almost took one home , but somebody killed it on monday , huge tire tracks remained in the freshly turned dirt , a few bricks from the path sticking up the trees , some eight feet tall , had all been taken to the dumpster , but a few broken flowerpots and garden labels remained in the rubble andre picked up a halfcrushed white plastic pot , took it to the stoop of the neighboring building and stuck a few leaves inside i want to make a new garden , he said photo above , pilar johnsonscott , the pta president at public school 76 , and tom goodridge , a teacher , on the harlem site of a garden that was leveled yesterday below , ps 76 pupils visited the garden in 1997 \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
washington , sept 23 in the watergate era , the misdeeds of lawyers provoked a national discussion about whether legal ethics was an oxymoron now , president clinton s troubles have ignited a new and broader debate about the role of lawyers in american society but this time , the issue is not whether they broke the law but whether lawyers and their way of thinking have become so pervasive that legalistic gamesmanship is dominating politics and , perhaps , everyday life there s been this intrusion of the adversary process into life as a whole , said daniel r fischel , professor and deanelect of the university of chicago law school , and it colors everything the way people interact , what they say , their willingness to cooperate with each other professor fischel said the monica lewinsky battle seemed to highlight a growing worry about whether the lawyerly ideal of prevailing by destroying the opposition had pushed aside other american values like trust and cooperation in the lewinsky investigation , legal definitions sometimes seemed to prevail over common sense mr clinton s contortionist language , which much of the country saw in his videotaped grand jury testimony shown on monday , has come to be seen as the ultimate example of such legal hairsplitting in his testimony , for example , mr clinton wondered aloud what the meaning of the word 'is' is , as he explained why he had not taken issue with his lawyer s earlier comment that there is absolutely no sex between the president and monica s lewinsky if 'is' means is and never has been , that is not that is one thing , he testified if it means there is none , he continued , that was a completely true statement now if someone had asked me on that day , 'are you having any kind of sexual relations with ms lewinsky , ' that is , asked me a question in the present tense , i would have said 'no' and it would have been completely true his answer might have won praise in trial tactics 101 instead , it drew ridicule and added to the backlash that has been building across the country against the use of legal fine points and distinctions there is a perception increasingly shared by lay people , but also by lawyers , said anthony t kronman , the dean of yale law school , that the gulf between the law and common sense has opened up in this crisis to a considerable degree and that has caused people to lose confidence in the law mr clinton , a former arkansas attorney general who has always seemed drawn to legal distinctions , drew rebukes even from senior democrats for asserting that his replies regarding the definition of sexual relations agreed upon in the paula jones suit were legally accurate the president and his advisers are going to have to accept that continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose , said senator tom daschle of south dakota , the senate minority leader representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the house minority leader , said , the considered judgment of the american people is not going to rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal argument but the concern that legalisms are leading the country out the door of ordinary logic has hardly been limited to the white house kenneth w starr , the whitewater independent counsel , has also been fighting off accusations that his investigation was little more than a lawyer s artificial construct i am not going to answer your trick questions , mr clinton said to one of the starr lawyers mr starr s critics call his investigation a mere perjury trap , which they say existed solely to impale the president on his own legalisms without the starr inquiry into whether mr clinton lied in a deposition in a civil suit that was later dismissed , the critics say , there would be no question of impeachment some of mr starr s critics say one explanation for the president s continuing strong showing in public opinion polls may be that americans view the starr assertions , mr clinton s defenses and virtually everything else about the battle in washington as legal skirmishes that have little to do with real life mr starr s report to congress included scores of examples of such lawyerly logic in great detail , for example , it spoke of lies mr clinton told top aides like john podesta , the deputy chief of staff lawyers say mr starr was inventive in his assertion that mr clinton violated the law by telling lies to his own staff members in private meetings mr starr argued in his report that mr clinton s lies to his staff , knowing all the while they might be called to testify about his denials , amounted to obstruction of justice both the president and the independent counsel , said david w leebron , the dean of columbia law school , are reinforcing a stereotype of lawyers and their reasoning that is detached from reality the public perception is that the visible lawyers on both sides including the president are not reassuring about the use of law in pursuing justice in our country , mr leebron said on the side of ken starr , many people have come to feel , it is legal procedure run amok the use of legal tools totally without discretion and judgment in their televised questioning , the starr lawyers often seemed unable to resist lawyerly pursuit of the obvious they defined phone sex and framed such inquiries as if there is a semen stain belonging to you on a dress of ms lewinsky s , how would you explain that \? as the details have come spilling out , it seems that everyone , even ms lewinsky , who is not a lawyer but knows plenty of them , was addicted to legal distinctions in ms lewinsky s case , vernon e jordan jr , the president s friend who was helping her get a job , asked her if she and the president had had an affair , mr starr s report said ms lewinsky , who was not yet 25 , saw the question as just another legal maneuver , the starr report concluded she answered 'no' because , prosecutors said , she interpreted mr jordan s questions as , 'what are you going to say \? ' rather than 'what are the answers' long before the lewinsky case , there had been a growing concern , even among some legal scholars , about the intrusion of too much lawyering in america , voiced through books , seminars , cartoons and general handwringing the events of recent weeks have catapulted those concerns to new levels among some of the nation s most influential legal educators one legacy of the lewinsky era is sure to be a reexamination of the influence of lawyers on the country , said ronald a cass , the dean of boston university school of law the question , dean cass said , will be whether lawyers are serving any real purpose in life or whether lawyers are simply engaging in semantic arguments that do n't make sense to ordinary people that debate , said derek bok , a former harvard law school dean and former president of harvard university , is very much a reflection of our culture we believe in competition people like the competition , mr bok said , but they want a kind of wise restraint that is probably asking too much of human nature
union city , nj , june 5 hidden in the wooded bluffs overlooking the hoboken railroad tracks , at least a dozen homeless people have built makeshift shacks in recent years using scraps of wood and and corrugated tin , tree branches , plastic tarpaulin and other junk but on thursday morning , a crew from the city s department of public works , assisted by the police , took axes and a buzz saw and razed the shacks union city police officials said the move to demolish the shantytown came after a rising number of complaints by residents of nearby houses and apartments about noise and petty thefts the police said they had warned the shanty occupants a week in advance that the structures would be destroyed when officers returned thursday at 9 am , they were accompanied by officials from the north hudson community action corporation , which runs counseling programs for the homeless , and from the palisades emergency residence corporation , which operates a shelter and soup kitchen we did n't go there in an arrest mode , said chief paul hanak of the union city police we went there to urge them to accept social services eight homeless men were near the shanties when the police arrived , chief hanak said four agreed to speak with the outreach workers , but in the end , none followed up by seeking food or shelter later in the day we gave out literature we told them of all the services that we provide , said jane a casares , the coordinator of emergency food and shelter for north hudson community action they were supposed to come to our offices they did n't show up the action by city officials to remove the cliffside encampment cast light on a mostly ignored nether world that outreach workers said has existed for years , a shadowy collection of dozens , perhaps hundreds , of homeless people living hidden in the craggy palisades at the edges of some of new jersey s most densely populated municipalities we have worked with several of those individuals before and attempted to assist them , said vanessa van orden , the executive director of the palisades emergency residence corporation in addition to finding the cluster of shacks on the cliffs in union city overlooking hoboken , ms van orden said , outreach workers were familiar with several other locations where the homeless had set up camp , including in nearby west new york in union city , some of the shacks had existed for years , and although the police occasionally razed one or another of them , the homeless were largely left to their own hardscrabble existence but the cliffs have also become a popular hangout for teenagers and others who gather to drink alcohol , leaving empty cans and broken bottles strewn about and it was a search for a missing teenager last week that brought the shantytown back to the attention of the police the teenager was later found elsewhere , but officers , alarmed by the growing number of shacks and the often fetid conditions of the area surrounding them , warned the shanty residents that they would return an offer of transportation to a shelter was universally rejected , the police said it was an unsanitary condition they were living in , chief hanak said there was no running water , no sanitary facilities it s in their own best interest they may not see it that way , but it s in their best interest that we took this action one of the men appeared to be drunk and admitted having an alcohol problem , but the others appeared to be in generally good condition , he said we did n't want to dismantle their houses and not have contact with them , the chief said first , we had to make sure there was no one with any serious physical injury or anyone with serious mental deficiency all were able to speak and knew what was going on as long as they can make an intelligent decision , we honor their wish as to whether they want help or not in recent years , local officials across the country have sought to eliminate encampments of the homeless even as more and more shantytowns seem to materialize in new york city , for example , the authorities have torn down nearly every large encampment , including those at or near columbus circle , the united nations and one called the hill , which consisted of a teepee and about 15 shacks by the manhattan bridge new york officials have also moved to chase squatters from abandoned buildings chief hanak said he wanted to clear away the shanties before we have too many people to deal with though the sturdiness of the shanties varied , almost all were equipped with a mattress and bedding the structures were without running water or electricity , but many of the people living in them had installed cooking equipment that could be operated with an open fire or propane gas because of the danger of a gas explosion , fire officials were on hand for thursday morning s sweep this afternoon , piles of rubble and a lingering stench were the only signs of the former shantytown in one spot were a cracked plastic lawn chair and a crinkled tube of toothpaste a brown jacket was hanging neatly from a nearby tree branch in another area , a mattress had been repositioned , covered neatly by a brown comforter there were a pair of old work boots and a small grill , a frying pan and an empty can of pineapple chunks that was being used to store utensils but there was no sign of the owner photo a child from a nearby neighborhood on the site in union city where officials on thursday tore down makeshift shacks used by several homeless men , because of complaints from residents about noise and theft \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)

baltimore for the second year in a row , horse racing rises up from its low ratings and raises a glorious vision a thoroughbred on the threshold of sweeping the triple crown and an unlikely one at that real quiet , a horse with a crooked right foreleg who was known as the fish around bob baffert s barn because he once was so skinny he personifies the underdog who prevails he was fifth choice in the kentucky derby , but won he was second choice in the preakness , but won he may be the public s favorite when he takes the suspenseful next step in the belmont stakes on june 6 , but with coronado s quest lurking on the sideline of his home base at belmont park , you never know the only thing certain about the fish is what baffert says the triple crown is survival of the fittest well , real quiet has so far survived enough drama to fill a soap opera in the week leading up to the preakness alone , indian charlie , the favorite , was withdrawn because he looked weary halory hunter fractured his ankle coronado s quest bruised his foot the day before the big show and after they finally raised the curtain with a record crowd of 91 , 122 jamming old pimlico race course , a transformer shut down three blocks from the track , cutting power for lights , airconditioning , elevators and , worse to many people , betting windows and betting machines because the electric timers were n't working , they had to clock real quiet s performance by stopwatch how s that for melodrama at the big show \? sort of like the scenario last year , when silver charm came out of the baffert barn to win the kentucky derby and the preakness before shooting for the triple crown before a crowd of 70 , 692 at belmont park the stage setting was n't bad , either flowers were banked all over the place , valets dressed in tuxedos parked cars and wandering bands let people know this was new york , new york then , on the lip of history , silver charm lost his sweep by less than a length but baffert , adjusting his perspective , reasoned , people came for a show , and they got it now he is back with real quiet for his second chance at racing history only 11 horses in racing have swept the triple crown , and none since affirmed 20 years ago real quiet looks like a horse hero cast in the image of other recent superstars holy bull , cigar , skip away , silver charm they may not come onto the stage often enough to sustain an entire business but , when the business falls upon hard times , why play down the stars in the cast and the suspense in the scenario \? why hitch your wagon to an advertising campaign that leaves horses out of the picture but features a woman running up and down the sideline shrieking for a pony to cover her bet while the caption intones , there comes a time in every girl s life when she puts away her innocence , steps up to the window and says , 'gimme a 50 exacta box and make it snappy' \? the caricature neither looks nor sounds believable , and neither does racing s recent move to save itself in spite of its heroes after years of watching its attendance figures and television ratings drop , the fathers of the sport created a search committee to find an executive who would lead them to higher ground they announced this spring that they had found him tim smith , an articulate and engaging lawyer who convinced the searchers that their salvation rested in better marketing of their product but smith knows little about the product horse racing and he persuaded the searchers to open the headquarters of their new organization , the national thoroughbred racing association , in atlanta , where he lives but where no race track exists instead , he says that he will focus on national purchasing , national marketing and , he hopes , national television he has a 20 million advertising budget and he may improve racing , but he sounds starstruck when he boasts that jack nicholson , robert duvall and rick pitino were among the crowd at the kentucky derby as for the product , he intends to structure racing into a series of races that awards points for performance but where would that leave lil s lad , event of the year , halory hunter and coronado s quest from this year s class of injured 3yearolds \? the last time racing established a national office , it also spent lavishly to direct the product toward television s promised land the office lasted about one year now , we give you racing s true hero , real quiet , and his supporting cast and we offer the scenario the final race for the triple crown as baffert says , it s a show how much more melodrama do you need \?
washington , june 28 we figured we were untouchable , said representative joe scarborough , speaking recently of the cockiness of the revolutionaries the house republican freshmen of 1994 and the political flameout last month of one of its tyros , representative jon christensen of nebraska mr christensen , an insurance agent and political nobody four years ago , caught the tide of the party s contract with america and swept into the house as a rising star in the republican majority that made newt gingrich the speaker just as suddenly , this aggressive , selfassured campaigner , one of the most conservative of the freshman standouts , impulsively leapt into the nebraska primary for governor this year he lost , firmly rebuffed for his brashness by fellow republicans you can determine more about a person from how he loses than from how he wins , said a chastened mr christensen , having lost his congressional seat in the process of finishing last in the threeway primary that he had led in the polls until the final two weeks it was a contest that he headlined but ultimately misjudged , because his entry split the conservative base vital to a campaigner so proudly rooted in grassroots christian fundamentalism and it was a contest in which his attack tactics , so often identified with the class of '94 , came under criticism from a republican establishment disquieted by the pugnaciousness of the gingrich prodigy now , mr christensen s new status as a political object lesson is a matter of considerable study among his closest friends in the 73member class of '94 in spirit , those still in congress remain feisty iconoclasts with a continuing flair for just the sort of insurgent gambits that mr christensen excelled at until he reached for the nebraska governor s race and plummeted the morning after jon lost , said mr scarborough , of florida , there were some of us saying to each other , 'what \? the political rules applying to everyone else apply to us , too \? ' the '94 landslide may have given us a false sense of security , the feeling that everything you touch is going to turn to gold but there has been electoral gold in their guerrilla style our class was very aggressive and committed and not compromiseoriented , noted senator sam brownback of kansas , the former representative who first showed mr christensen the way by bolting the class of '94 to challenge his state party organization in 1996 and win interim incumbency in bob dole s vacated senate seat mr brownback noted that other '94 members remain fully involved in similarly uphill challenges for higher office this year , including john ensign of nevada , mark w neumann of wisconsin and linda smith of washington all three from my class , all three challenging senate incumbents , mr brownback said mr scarborough laughed at how blithely members of the class still encourage one another to go for any fresh challenge they see we say , 'hey , we 're invincible ! why ask \? ' that will remain our style , though tempered now by jon and the realization that some machinegun nests you just do n't attack as a chronic insurgent , senator brownback sounds comfortable to be running in his fourth race , including primaries , in the past five years as he seeks a full senate term this november the spirit remains , but people are a little more knowledgeable about how to get these things done , he said , insisting that the lesson of mr christensen was more about tactical mistakes than arrogance but back in nebraska , edward j burchfield , former chairman of the sarpy county republicans and one of the earliest christensen champions , found a lesson in hubris overdue for the class of '94 they came in a great wave , a bunch of young bucks full of themselves , walking those streets , oozing power , said mr burchfield , who once worked in washington as a pentagon liaison to congress when jon jumped in for governor without consulting the powers that be , that really ticked off a lot of people who worked so hard to get him into congress at the age of 35 , mr christensen talks of returning to the business world but friends expect that some fresh roll of the political dice will be quickly tried by this intuitive combatant , who first made himself noticed in washington four years ago by boldly stalking representative peter hoagland , the democrat he eventually defeated mr christensen had stared intently at the incumbent from the front row of capitol committee audiences , as if attempting a hex as much as an upset across four years in the house , his knack for political cutandthrust became celebrated he checkmated one critic s campaign accusations by taking a liedetector test and pronouncing himself truthful in his 1996 reelection , he overcame a publicized divorce proceeding in which his wife attested that she had been the unfaithful spouse , leaving mr christensen clear in the eyes of the many fundamentalist churches in his camp he entered the primary for governor on the 25th anniversary of roe v wade to emphasize his unyielding opposition to abortion he campaigned heartily for family values , announcing that his fiancee , tara dawn holland , a former miss america , was saving herself for marriage this november oh , i hate to lose , but i want to be a good loser , mr christensen said achingly , speaking recently in his office here , his time in the house down to six months i did n't come here for the trappings of office , he said , noting that , in any case , he did favor term limits a conservative position that some politicians think guarantees an extra fast reach for another office by the class of '94 i think it s timing , not hubris , said rich galen , executive director of gopac , a republican campaign financing committee these men and women have to take their shot when opportunity is there in the primary , mr christensen was criticized by party elders , notably senator chuck hagel of nebraska , who expressed concern about a christensen brochure that accused the eventual primary winner , mayor mike johanns of lincoln , of tolerating pornography on cable television jon is not an arrogant guy , senator hagel said later in an interview , estimating that the brochure backfired but did not cause defeat jon got in way late and that was as big a problem as anything else and , the way it happened , none of us knew about it and that did not go down well mr christensen is already working hard at healing the primary scars and helping mr johanns with fundraising if you ca n't learn from your mistakes , then you 've made the ultimate mistake , he said the spirit of '94 helped impel him into the primary seven months before the vote , drawing big headlines and the early polling leads but he now concedes that mr johanns , who ran a 32month campaign up and down the state , was the patient tortoise who beat the upstart hare photo representative jon christensen , center , who has six months left in the house , met with two nebraska constituents and representative john ensign \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
in hastingsonhudson , two independent booksellers , deborah boylan and rosemary edelstein , stubbornly ignore the writing on the wall , as does carol greenman in pleasantville and harold makanoff in white plains struggling to survive in the growing shadow of large chains like borders books and records and barnes noble , they remain holdouts aware of the perils of their profession yet unwilling to give in mr makanoff s main street bookshop is the sole survivor in a city that once was home to six independent bookstores ms boylan and ms edelstein are banking on the fact that their smalltown bookstore overlooking the hudson river is enough off the beaten track from the chains to survive and ms greenman , opting to stare down her rivals , recently moved her establishment , the bookstore , out of its quaint home of 25 years into larger quarters trying to appear more competitive , ms greenman traded in oldfashioned charm for what she hopes will be a more contemporary marketing advantage we used to have lots of nooks and crannies , she said now we 're big , open and bright at good yarns in hastings so named because it used to sell knitting supplies as well as books the two owners offer discounts on best sellers , an incentive bonus for frequent readers , discounts for the elderly and tender loving care to their customers , they said and mr makanoff , in the book business for 33 years , now also sells beanie babies , greeting cards and anything that will bring dollars into the store with a waldenbooks in one nearby mall , a borders books in another , a b dalton at yet a third and two barnes noble bookstores just 10 minutes away in separate directions , mr makanoff described his little shop as surrounded in tarrytown , the american booksellers association , a trade association , reported that while the independents held a market share of 31 percent in 1991 , that number had dropped precipitously to under 19 percent five years later len vlahos , a spokesman for the company , said the fallout was the result of the chains bullying the book publishers for a competitive advantage he called westchester a pretty good example of what is happening across the nation but while superstores muscled into the increasingly profitable retail book market nationwide in the 1980 s , they were johnnycomelatelys to westchester in large part because of the high cost of retail space the superstores had made inroads in connecticut , for example , by the late 1980 s , but it was not until 1992 that the first barnes noble opened in white plains today the retail landscape in westchester is fairly saturated with bookstores , mr vlahos observed there are barnes noble bookstores in yonkers , hartsdale , white plains and mohegan lake borders , which opened in white plains in 1994 , now also has a store in mount kisco there are also encore books stores in eastchester , ossining and thornwood and a b dalton in white plains , will we be able to compete with them \? said irwin hersch , owner of the mount kisco book company that s questionable mr hersch , who opened his store in june 1996 , then moved to another spot in town after a fire six months later , said he is now trying to hold out against a borders books and music five times the size of his establishment avin mark domnitz , president of american booksellers , which represents 8 , 000 members and 4 , 500 bookstores , said the new superstores were mimicking the small , independent bookstore , only doing it bigger and better offering more than just books , many of the chains have cafes , which sell coffee , tea , sandwiches and soup , and provide a homey setting for afternoon and evening miniconcerts and poetry readings in the face of the competition , the trade association on behalf of itself and more than 20 independent bookstores has filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal district court for the northern district of california against barnes noble and borders the suit contends that the national chains are using their clout with publishers to obtain secret and illegal deals and preferential treatment in a manner that puts independent bookstores at a serious competitive disadvantage and poses a threat to their survival and to the diversity of american bookselling contending also that the chain booksellers are violating a federal antitrust statute the robinsonpatman act , passed in the 1930 s to protect small and independent retailers from unfair competition by chain stores the suit contends that those illegal dealings come in many forms , including soliciting special discounts on both large and small orders , granting more favorable promotional advertising terms , threatening large returns to obtain extra discounts and other illegal dealings ms greenman at the bookstore said because the chains have earlier access to the galleys of books , they potentially also have a say in how the books are written because they are in a position to say what sells and what does n't she said there is a need to level the playing field so that main street usa can compete again in the marketplace the lawsuit represents the first time a group of independent businesses and their trade association have used the antitrust statute to fight back against national chains
nagano , japan , feb 16 a few days ago , when the americans were still among the goldmedal favorites in the men s olympic hockey tournament , coach ron wilson discussed the biggest incentive for winning in the preliminary round a good record might get you an easier opponent in the quarterfinals , wilson said , and you will not have to worry about goalie dominik hasek of the czech republic eliminating you with a 60save performance wilson s team did not play very well in the roundrobin , which ended today with a 41 loss to canada , leaving the americans with one humble victory and two discouraging defeats as their reward , they play in the quarterfinals wednesday against hasek and the czechs and hasek says he is ready for them except for his headgear my helmet is broken completely , said hasek , the most valuable player in the national hockey league last season i hope i can get a new one it was damaged by a valery kamensky slap shot in today s game , a 21 victory for russia a piece of the helmet s blue plastic landed on the ice as play continued kamensky s shot did n't get past hasek , but two others did , 10 seconds apart , early in the third period the defeat left the czechs with a 21 record , but hasek kept his optimism as they prepared for the united states team usa is a better team than team belarus , hasek said , damning the americans with faint praise but i do n't think the us team is more talented than the russian team i believe we can beat the us team this does not make hasek unique sweden beat the americans in the first game , 42 the united states needed two late goals to pull away from belarus , 52 against canada , the americans could n't score on a fiveonthree power play that lasted for 100 seconds wilson and his players talked later about how much they had improved against canada but they will probably have to improve even more to get past the czechs on wednesday and play the canadakazakhstan winner in the semifinal on friday night in the other quarterfinals , undefeated russia will play belarus \( 03 \) and sweden \( 21 \) plays finland \( 12 \) the way this tournament is going , with all its nhl stars , it is likely that canada could play the czech republic in one semifinal while russia may play sweden in the other a canadarussia goldmedal game is a growing possibility the russians , despite some stars refusing to participate , seem to be getting better each game and they have that family feeling that is obvious by the long postgame gatherings alongside their bus next to big hat arena wives and girlfriends , wearing fulllength minks , greet the players there , amid their agents and fans the chatter , in two languages , is about social dining for the evening darius kasparaitis , a lithuanian who plays defense for russia , signed one of his pittsburgh penguins jerseys for a japanese girl who swooned at the sight of his puckpocked face then he explained the russians' motivation people say russia is no good anymore , kasparaitis said they say , 'the russians have no team and they have no heart' we have hearts we have skills and we have pride we are a team no doubt , the americans are a proud team , too , but they are playing the way the russians did in the world cup of 1996 , when the united states triumphed and russia disappointed at first , the american confidence came across as cockiness now , it sounds like wishful thinking jeremy roenick , one of their better players today , said we have a tremendously talented hockey team i think we 're coming together , but i do n't think we are at the point we want to be we 'd better do it quick , he added it s elimination time chris chelios , the captain , said i do n't think we were overconfident i think we felt the pressure with the high expectations of ourselves and we expected everything to go so perfectly and it has n't so , now , we 've got to win there not play scared play with confidence and play a great game easier said than done brett hull , who scored the only american goal today against canada s patrick roy , said irresponsibility by the forwards may be a problem i do n't think the concern is the goals we are not scoring , hull said it s the ones we are letting in we are working hard from the red line in and we are not working at all from the red line back we forwards have got to make a commitment you ca n't stay out there a minute on that big ice , going up and down you are just too tired to get back on defense when the time comes three games in row we 've let bad line changes cause goals against and that s just selfishness in today s game , keith primeau scored two goals for canada , and roy stopped 30 of 31 shots hull spoiled roy s shutout with 5 56 remaining with a rising wrist shot rob zamuner and joe sakic scored canada s other goals primeau s first was while shorthanded i do n't think i can remember anything more exhilarating , said primeau , a center with the carolina hurricanes i think we did real well today we kept our composure the momentum swung to canada s favor late in the first period , after the canadians killed off a twoman american power play when two minor penalties against canada overlapped by 1 minute 40 seconds in this span , the americans took 10 shots on or at roy s net one , by hull , hit the goal post but none went in only 14 seconds after the second penalty expired , zamuner scored after wayne gretzky set him up with a pass the score was only 10 , but the game , as it turned out , was decided i could tell the us team was trying to feed brett hull , roy said , of the american attack during the twoman power play my focus was on him he was trying to go high when asked if an olympic gold medal would mean as much as his two stanley cups , roy said i would not trade my stanley cups for a gold medal , that s for sure but i 'd love to add a gold medal to my career

if two new cd s by the english violinist andrew manze are any indication , early music may finally be shedding one of classical music s most venerable but useless assumptions to wit , the funny notion abroad among classicalmusic reviewers that the best thing a performer can do is disappear ian bostridge , an english tenor , was warmly praised recently for what one critic somewhat infelicitously called his selfelimination during a performance of schumann s dichterliebe , of all things pianists and violinists who fail to duplicate mr bostridge s feat during concerto appearances regularly take their lumps , in these pages and elsewhere , for distracting the audience s attention from the music since the complaint is voiced just as frequently in reviews of recordings , the offending distractions must be not merely visual \( upthrown limbs , tossing manes , whatever \) but aural , too yet what can it mean to say that the sounds of the performance distract from the music \? are n't those sounds the music \? apparently not my god , what has sound got to do with music ! , charles ives wrote in one of his blustery memos or , as sir thomas beecham once opined , the british public does n't really care for music , but it simply adores the noise it makes contempt for crowdpleasing virtuosos is often touted as a blow against romanticism , that allpurpose punching bag but critics who distinguish between the sounds and the music share with ives and beecham the assumption that a piece of music great music , anyway is a fixed and sacrosanct idea rather than a bunch of noises that may vary greatly from performance to performance that is idealism , and idealism is romanticism at its most extreme romanticism s transition into its late , late phase called modernism \( as the music scholar leonard b meyer so delightfully puts it \) can be gauged by noting the mounting hostility toward performers as the 20th century reached its middle for arnold schoenberg , whose career actually enacted the move from late romanticism to latelate , performance was at best a necessary evil , of value only to those lacking the skills required to derive the full experience of a musical composition from silent perusal of the score pierre boulez , in his bombthrowing youth , actually declared performances obsolete for contemporary music , since the only information of interest to intelligent musicians was the kind that notation conveyed to the eye , and the eye to the mind hearing added nothing even brahms , more than half a century before the peak phase , voiced a kindred thought when he turned down an invitation to mozart s don giovanni with the remark that if he sat at home with the score , he 'd hear a better performance mozart would not have known what on earth brahms was talking about in his preromantic age , the score was not the sacred repository of the fragile idea that critics were sworn to defend against marauders the score was simply what enabled a performance and furnished its springboard the more one bunch of notes thus enabled varied from another , the better the performer s contribution was cherished and eagerly awaited to fail to astonish or surprise in a word , to distract the audience with one s novel take on the familiar would have been regarded as an insult performers who selfeliminated could expect to be flushed away of no one was this truer than of mozart himself as we know from the deliberately incomplete notation of the scores , he left himself plenty of room for spontaneous display in his own concertos and expected the same of anybody else who played them that is why it has always been so bizarre , even if inevitable , that earlymusic performers , though they specialize in preromantic repertory , have been especially prone to impose on themselves all the puritanical inhibitions with which romantic idealism has shackled the performance of classical music the result , we may as well admit , has been pious boredom how could it be otherwise , when notations meant as springboards for fancy diving are treated as holy writ \? you might as well stare at a diving board and call it the olympics what early music has been needing even more urgently than other branches of classical music has been a new infusion of oldfashioned truly oldfashioned performerly values not selfelimination but selfasserting , crowdpleasing exhibitionism and vulgarity , the kind for which mozart was famous , and handel , and vivaldi for some time , the only promising figure on the horizon has been the pianist robert levin , happily more famous than notorious by now for his improvised cadenzas , florid embellishments and other distractions from the music of mozart s concertos now there is another mr manze , who in a pair of new harmonia mundi cd s of music by vivaldi \( concert for the prince of poland , hmu 907230 \) and giuseppe tartini \( the devil s sonata and other works , hmu 907213 \) combines formidable fiddling virtuosity with a truly baroque \( that is , overthetop \) taste for the outlandish what results from this crossfertilization especially in the astonishing tartini disk , where mr manze goes it alone , unaccompanied and under high magnification , for 68 minutes of enthralling mischief is one of the most encouraging defiances of latelate romantic taste i 've heard in years
six months before the police arrested daniel robacker and theresa fremgen on charges of repeatedly raping their two daughters in a filthy brooklyn apartment , child welfare officials approved the home as a safe place for the teenage girls they are home with their parents , said esther simon , a lawyer for the administration for children s services , during a court hearing in january as she recommended that the sisters not be sent back to foster care they are doing fine and even though a city caseworker was assigned to see the girls twice a month , and a city housekeeper was assigned to clean the bushwick apartment each weekday , neither saw signs of the sexual abuse that occurred routinely , child welfare officials say but all the while , the police say , mr robacker , ms fremgen , her exboyfriend and her two brothers were raping and sodomizing their own children and young relatives in apartment 2e of 232 linden street the details of the abuse , which emerged yesterday as investigators released snippets of statements made by each suspect , painted a horrifying portrait of a home where two sisters were raped amid squalor and stuffed animals along with an 8yearold boy , who was a friend of the family , while the household was under the city s watch the five adults , many of whom are mildly mentally retarded or illiterate , spoke openly to the police about the rape and incest that took place , investigators say and in a graphic but neatly written statement to the police , one suspect , ezra fremgen , described the boy as a willing accomplice , saying matteroffactly we had sex every saturday that his father brought him by child welfare officials , who are investigating the case , declined to say whether the caseworker had made all the visits required by law and even if she had , it was unclear whether the worker would have detected signs of the sexual abuse , which is notoriously difficult to spot , especially when it is a closely guarded secret the police said the children kept silent about the abuse for at least three years and the girls , who were placed in foster care for three weeks last year before returning to their parents , denied ever having been sexually assaulted but new information in the case raised disturbing questions about whether the city had adequately assessed the safety of the children one sister , a 14yearold , and the 8yearold boy each had more than 18 absences from school this year , school officials said , often an indicator of trouble at home child welfare records indicate that ms fremgen , 35 , was abused or neglected when she was a teenager , another highrisk factor in abuse cases , city officials say helen robacker , her aunt , said ms fremgen was raped by a relative when she was 15 caseworkers are required to seek out such information about the parents they monitor and to document it in the 30day reports they file , because past abuse sometimes increases the risk of abuse to children living in the household , child welfare specialists say but none of the psychological evaluations of ms fremgen , which were conducted by the city in 1994 and by an agency contracted by the city in 1997 , mention or assess the severity or impact of any abuse edward f stancik , the special investigator for the city schools , said that his office was poring over the children s attendance records and was working with the brooklyn district attorney s office and officials at the administration for children s services declined to comment about the other issues , saying they wanted to complete their inquiry first the matter is under investigation , said leonora wiener , a spokeswoman for the administration for children s services we 'll have no further comment until our investigation is complete as the officials searched for answers to the many troubling questions , a bleak picture was developing of the suspects , whose lives were marked by poverty , mental illness and , sometimes , neglectful behavior toward children , according to court records and psychological evaluations ms fremgen is mentally retarded , according to a psychological evaluation mr robacker , 40 , her companion and first cousin , dropped out of school in the fourth grade and curtis e james , 35 , the father of the 8yearold boy , lived on the streets and had trouble reading a newspaper , even though he completed trade school , the court records show homeless in 1993 , mr james sent his son to live with ms fremgen , who was his exgirlfriend and the godmother of his son i 've got to find a place to live , mr james told a psychologist , according to the court records all five adults were arraigned yesterday in brooklyn criminal court on a total of 82 counts of rape , sodomy , sexual abuse , incest and endangering the welfare of a child included among the suspects were vincent fremgen , 28 , and ezra fremgen , 25 , the brothers of ms fremgen brett taylor , a lawyer for mr james , denied the charges in court yesterday when all the evidence is in , this case will look a lot different , he said the police , who had said on wednesday that four children had been abused , said yesterday it appeared there were only three victims they said that the two sisters , age 13 and 14 , were victimized by all five adults , and that the 8yearold boy was victimized by his father and by one of the uncles all the sexual offenses took place in the linden street home , a cluttered , filthy apartment with stacks of trinkets , clothes , garbage and , in the bedrooms , pornography while investigators said they believed that the sexual abuse went on for years , the charges cover numerous sexual offenses that prosecutors say took place between april 1 and june 30 child welfare officials took notice of the household in july 1997 when someone reported the family to the state s child abuse telephone line child welfare workers reported that they found a filthy apartment with animal feces , and a child with lacerations on the body they decided to try to keep the household together by offering intensive counseling services , but the caseworker finally ordered the three children put in foster care on sept 23 , when it became clear that ms fremgen and mr robacker were not responding to the city s help on oct 14 , 1997 , judge nora freeman of family court decided to send the two girls home after the foster care agency , pius xii , recommended that they return , city officials said the agency made the recommendation because the charge of physical abuse had been discounted , leaving only a charge of neglect for keeping the children in a filthy house on wednesday , city officials insisted that they had not wanted the children returned to the family , questioning why the judge and the agency had supported the return but yesterday , court documents showed that the city actually approved of the girls' placement in the home as long as a housekeeper was there to help the boy , who told court officials that he did not want to return to the fremgen household , was sent to another foster mother and the case finally unraveled when the boy told his

kissing the beehive by jonathan carroll 232 pages nan a talese doubleday 2295 jonathan carroll s kissing the beehive is a tale of unintended consequences , and a promising one sam bayer , a bestselling author of thrillers , decides to write a nonfiction book on the murder of a young woman he admired when he went to high school 30 years before sam begins his sleuthing , but as he does his very activities provoke new murders , so that to solve the 30yearold crime , he needs to solve the new crimes as well mr carroll , whose other books include from the teeth of angels and after silence , uses sam s investigation to spin a genuinely mysterious mystery how is it that a person who appears to be the murderer himself is posting notes to sam encouraging him in his research \? when the notesender kills two people whom sam encounters in his search for truth , the mystery takes on more than an ominous edge , with the villain s identity remaining well concealed until just before the end mr carroll s book is in this sense a success , as it is in other ways sam is likable and a sufficiently complicated character to hold our interest even aside from his amateur crimesolving efforts and his girlfriend , who has the charmingly unlikely name veronica lake , is a similarly good creation , an emotionally needy beauty who throws nasty surprises the way other people throw dinner parties the problem with kissing the beehive , which is the problem of many pretty good but not great mystery stories , is that it does not stand up to rigorous logical scrutiny a great mystery story has to make sense it also has to muster its evidence in such a way that the reader actually sees each piece fall into its place in the puzzle , so that we can be assured that what happens in the story is logically possible kissing the beehive falls short on both of these requirements its major premise seems superficially plausible , but a little thought reveals that it is too insubstantial to support the minor premises that follow it and too much of the information that sam gathers comes to him via invisible pathways one suspects that even the author does not know the origin of some of what sam finds out kissing the beehive begins with our introduction to sam , who is eating lunch in new york with his agent and complaining that his new book is going nowhere everything in the book is goo , sam says , using a sort of preadult language that we will find elsewhere in mr carroll s book it s not writer s block , it s writer s drought my brain is in ethiopia these days quickly we learn that sam has been married three times and divorced just as often his 15yearold daughter , who is not only beautiful but a better baseball player than most boys her age , is his only object of unalloyed affection casting about for something to do , sam , who lives alone in connecticut , drives up to his boyhood home , crane view , ny , for a nostalgic visit he comes across a familiar name , pauline ostrava , and literary inspiration strikes pauline was a sulky , sexually adventurous , academically gifted girl in the local high school who was murdered three decades before sam himself found the body floating in the hudson river but he , like many people in town , never believed the results of the criminal investigation , which found that pauline had been killed by her 21yearold boyfriend , edward durant , with whom she had argued the night of her death edward was sentenced to life in prison and , subject to constant sexual assault , killed himself there here is where mr carroll s book begins to falter on the deep plausibility front from the evidence he gives , mainly that durant admitted to arguing with pauline near the scene of the crime , it does not seem likely that he would have been convicted of murder and sent to prison for life most likely , a jury , and possibly even the police and prosecution , would have shared the doubts that sam has three decades later and even if edward had run into a stupid jury , an unscrupulous police department and overeager prosecutors \( none of which is suggested in sam s account \) , he had plenty of resources with which to appeal we soon learn that edward s father is a famed lawyer and former prosecutor with some of the best law enforcement connections in new york it would make sense , given the circumstances , for sam to begin by looking deeply into edward s conviction , but he does n't he simply begins investigating on the assumption that somebody else killed pauline , an assumption that appears pretty solid as events unfold meanwhile , he travels to california , struggles with his girlfriend and renews old friendships in his hometown , gathering information on the case of pauline ostrava , almost by accident paradoxically , perhaps , mr carroll s book sometimes seems stronger in its smalltown sliceoflife aspects than it does as a mystery still , the plot is sprinkled with ominous occurrences , especially as the notesender serial killer swings into operation mr carroll succeeds well in introducing a degree of complexity into the intrigue there is a local police chief , a former vietnam war veteran , who has some secrets there is an old organizedcrime figure whose murder years ago may or may not have been linked to pauline s at the same time , veronica s behavior is so full of manipulation and concealment that she threatens to become the biggest mystery of all veronica , in fact , tends to steal this whole show , though , it must be said , when she produces a breakthrough in the case , her sources of information remain extremely murky everything is sorted out before the end , of course , and , unless you have been both extremely attentive and more prescient than i was , you will probably not guess the denouement before it occurs but while the intrigue is clever and mr carroll s story is briskly told , his novel requires too much suspension of belief for the whole thing to work perfectly , and that is what prevents this pretty good crime novel from being better

paris , nov 16 foreign minister hubert vedrine reacted angrily today to remarks by senator john mccain that mr vedrine interpreted as a charge that france had tipped off iraq that american bombers were on their way officials said mr vedrine was referring to an agence francepresse report in french from washington on the appearance on sunday of mr mccain , republican of arizona , on this week on abc news the report said mr mccain , when asked about the coincidence between the time of the planned start of the strikes over the weekend and the iraqi decision to give in and allow united nations arms inspections to resume , had responded , we had to inform our allies , including the french the french news agency report said that asked whether he were making a specific charge , mr mccain responded , no , i ca n't make such a charge it s clear from the transcript that i did not directly accuse the french of informing iraq of the attack , mr mccain said today when asked that specific question on 'this week , ' i stated that i could n't make that charge , but that many of our allies were involved and aware of our plans moreover , i had no specific knowledge then , nor do i now , that saddam hussein had advance warning , just that the media was reporting an attack was imminent but mr vedrine said on french radio this morning i find that this is a shameful and completely idiotic accusation i demand an explanation of this statement from the american authorities foreign ministry officials said he had instructed the ambassador in washington , francois v bujon , to obtain an explanation the american embassy here could offer none today the incident highlighted longstanding differences between france and the united states over iraq , contrasting sharply with britain s readiness to join the american bombing against iraq if saddam hussein fails to live up to agreements to let inspections resume during periods of tension with iraq last winter france pressed the united states to allow diplomacy to work and provided a french presidential plane for the united nations secretary general , kofi annan , to go to baghdad to negotiate with iraq later , mr vedrine and other french officials said the combination of french diplomatic pressure and american military threats had forced mr hussein to agree to keep cooperating this fall france succeeded in having the security council undertake a comprehensive review of iraqi compliance with international orders to do away with its weapons of mass destruction and the ability to make them , opening the possibility for the first time that if iraq complied some sanctions against it might be lifted that would let french petroleum companies eager to do business with iraq regain preeminent positions lost in the gulf war but when mr hussein instead announced at the end of last month that iraq had ended all cooperation with the united nations inspections , france acquiesced in a new american and british bomber buildup and did not publicly call for renewed negotiations with baghdad mr vedrine and president jacques chirac , on a tour of floodstricken central american countries today , strongly supported mr clinton s decision to call off the bombing after iraq had backed down and agreed to resume cooperating with the united nations but mr vedrine distanced his government from president clinton s open support on sunday for democratic opposition in iraq to mr hussein it is not in the tradition of french diplomacy to announce plans of interference and action of this type , he said on europe 1 radio france has no tradition , politically and diplomatically , of doing what the united states thinks it can say and do by virtue of selfgiven right
among serious golfers there is a trinity that can be called holy , for it consists of the three most important clubs in their bag the driver , the wedge and the putter nightmares in which any or all of these clubs are lost are not infrequent it makes sense the driver is used , on average , 14 times in an 18hole round , and it is critical that each usage produce a reasonably accurate shot with decent distance most golfers do not hit their second shot on the green , even after a good drive \( tour pros themselves miss , on average , four greens per round in regulation \) , and are left with shots in the 30 to 80yard range sand wedge distance to hit the ball close enough to save par \( or make a birdie on a parfive \) , dexterity with the wedge is essential finally , even the best wedge players leave putts , on average , in the 6to 15foot range so one must be a sure putter , too equipment makers , wise to the scoring importance of the driver , wedge and putter , have long made a special effort to produce attractive and effective trinity clubs \( or utility clubs , as they are also called \) indeed , callaway golf began its rise to eminence with the big bertha driver the ping line of clubs began with a hugely successful putter cleveland golf took root on the strength of a sand wedge in recent years , the trinityclub business has been most active in the driver and putter departments the driver , because it is the ultimate powerdistance club the putter , because it is never part of a set of clubs , and putting is so unfathomable that the only possible solution is a different putter every week but the lust for power and a nevermiss putter has been sated for the moment , and the current focus is on the most interesting club , the wedge or , more precisely , the sand wedge , which differs from all other irons , including the pitching wedge , by having a wider sole that produces bounce gene sarazen designed and introduced the first popular , and legal , sand wedge in 1932 \( another such club had been introduced a year or two earlier , but it had a concave face so that the ball was effectively hit twice , making it illegal \) what made sarazen s weapon , as he called it , so effective is the angling of its sole so that its back edge is lower to the ground than the front edge this provides the bounce set the clubhead down with its sole flush to a hard , smooth surface if the lower or lead edge of the face is slightly off the ground , the club has bounce and playing out of greenside sand bunkers is easier because the back edge of the sole hits the sand before the front edge even the greatest golfers were poor bunker players before sarazen s club , because they had to use a thinsoled niblick \( 9iron \) with no bounce , and it was hard to keep the sharp lead edge from digging too deeply into the sand with the sand wedge , the club head , which is heavier than all the others , can move through the sand under the ball without gouging into the sand the club face never touches the ball , which explodes upward and forward on the force of the driven sand when sarazen won the 1932 british open , in large measure because he \( and only he \) had his newly minted sand wedge in hand , the club was on its way to becoming a permanent member of every golfer s set since sarazen s time , golfers have expanded the use of the sand wedge by learning to use it out of the grass this prompted wedge makers to redesign certain aspects of the club , and with the sand wedge lately getting more attention in the fiercely competitive equipment industry , the club is being seriously tweaked there are now a variety of lofts , from the 55 or 56 degrees that for years was the only loft , to 60 degrees and higher more loft produces less forward flight and a shot that hardly rolls after landing the 60degreeplus wedge makes a 20to 30yard pitch shot easier , and it has made the lob shot part of golf s terminology bounce can make the sand wedge a risky choice from hard ground if the back edge of the sole does not penetrate the ground , the raised front edge bounces into the middle of the ball and linedrives it past its target solution \? a sole ground so there is bounce at the back end , but less to none toward the front you simply square the blade for hardground lies to put the bounceless portion into play enter the doubleduty sand wedge but there are more sophisticated tweaks these days the odyssey sand wedge has more bounce in the center of the sole than on the toe and heel , which creates a ridge that helps glide the club more readily through sand and grass sand wedges are now on the market with face surfaces of spaceage material that promise to last forever some sand wedge faces are made rougher , within legal bounds , by incorporating diamonds and other materials the rougher the face , the more backspin can be put on the ball sand wedges are also being introduced with more flexible shafts and heads with softer steel , intended to provide more feel for distance and in the spirit of the times , designer names are now being attached to sand wedges just as we have ralph lauren underwear , we are seeing the \( bob \) vokey wedge by titleist , the promotion of austie rollinson as odyssey s wedge maker to the world \( along with roger cleveland \) , and , among others , the tad moore , roger maltbie \( orlimar \) and phil rodgers \( cobra \) sand wedges some traditionalists would like to see the entire sand wedge genre banished , believing the club makes the game too easy indeed , the sand wedge is the only club innovation since 1932 that can claim to have helped all golfers take strokes off their game at that , the average national handicap is still in the high teens one does not expect the traditionalists to win this one
since the 1970 s , the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled workers has widened sharply but new research shows the inequality does not stop there discrepancies in job benefits and the quality of work life have also grown , pointing to a bigger chasm than previously recognized unskilled workers get the short end of the stick and it s getting shorter , said james heckman , an economist at the university of chicago study after study has shown that the gains from post1970 s economic growth have eluded unskilled workers the median wage of those with only a high school diploma fell by 6 percent , adjusted for inflation , from 1980 to 1996 , while the earnings of college graduates rose by 12 percent though there have been indications in recent months that a scarcity of workers in the surging american economy has begun raising wages for those on the low end , the gain has been modest so far and not enough to counter the decadeslong trend besides , wages alone provide an incomplete picture of a worker s standing though economists have long recognized the need to incorporate working conditions and fringe benefits in any comprehensive analysis , they have been stymied by a lack of detailed data until now brooks pierce , an economist at the united states department of labor , used confidential data regularly collected by the bureau of labor statistics from businesses to measure trends in total compensation the results are striking while specialists had long assumed that benefits acted as a leveling influence , particularly because of governmentrequired benefits like social security and unemployment insurance , the opposite is true in 1982 , people in the top onetenth of the work force made 2480 an hour , 395 times the 628 an hour for workers in the bottom onetenth by 1996 , the wage gap had widened , with the highend workers averaging 2574 an hour , or 472 times the 546 an hour of those at the bottom wages for the purposes of mr pierce s study are all expressed in 1997 dollars to account for inflation the decline among unskilled workers is hardly surprising given the increasing demands of an informationdriven economy but to understand it requires a look at total compensation , which places a value on benefits like health insurance , vacation time and pension plans by mr pierce s calculation , the total compensation in 1982 of workers in the top 10 percent 3516 a hour was 456 times that of workers in the bottom 10 percent 772 an hour fourteen years later , the ratio had increased to 543 to 1 , with highly paid workers having gained 173 an hour and lowend workers having lost 93 cents an hour benefits led to a greater discrepancy in earnings between high and lowwage workers in both 1982 and 1996 moreover , they were responsible for onetenth of the increasing disparity between the working elite and the working poor over the 14 years benefits have long been perceived as a great equalizer in percentage terms , after all , a barebones 3 , 000 medical insurance package adds more to the compensation of a worker making 20 , 000 than a fullfrills 10 , 000 package for an executive earning 200 , 000 the catch , according to mr pierce , is that a growing number of workers at the bottom of the pay scale have lost access to key employerprovided benefits more than 80 percent of workers received paid holidays and vacations in 1996 , but less than 10 percent of those in the bottom tenth received paid leave of any kind similarly , about 70 percent of workers have pension plans , while less than 10 percent of those in the bottom can count on any employerfinanced retirement benefits access to health insurance follows a similar pattern employers generally cannot deny benefits to lowerwage workers without putting the taxexempt status of those benefits at risk so how is this disparity in benefits possible \? henry farber , an economist at princeton university whose own research on medical benefits confirms mr pierce s findings , points to loopholes that allow companies to deny benefits to workers just starting out and to workers not classified as full time employers are figuring out all sort of ways to discriminate between employees they wish to keep and those who come and go , he said none of this would come as news to mary mendez , a 40yearold single mother who sorts apples in a packing plant in wenatchee , wash , for 771 an hour her employer takes such a strict view toward paid absences that she was docked for the hours she missed while recovering from a minor accident at the plant and while the company does offer health insurance in an industry where fringes are rare , she must contribute 21 a month to cover her child in other cases , employers have turned to temporary and contract workers , whose pay packages do not include time off and other benefits united parcel service even endured a strike in which a big issue was the company s desire to use more parttime workers to hold down costs perhaps an even bigger surprise than the lack of benefits is how little people with especially demanding or unpleasant jobs are compensated for difficult working conditions
on an industrial strip in buffalo , where just over a year ago the remains of a steel mill sagged on an oilsoaked lot , bumblebees now dance among the yellow blossoms of 170 , 000 tomato plants growing in artificial soil in a computercontrolled greenhouse this month , 125 workers will start picking what the greenhouse company says will be at least seven million pounds of vineripened tomatoes each year in trenton , a supermarket , office complex and 70 new apartments for the elderly now occupy a jumble of longdormant factory buildings where workers once wove cables for suspension bridges and left traces of toxic metals and industrial chemicals and on a patchwork of decontaminated factory sites and empty lots near the waterfront in bridgeport , conn , fresh sod was laid last month on the infield of a 14 million minorleague ball park the bridgeport bluefish are to toss their first pitch in may the economic boom , new commitments from local , state and federal government agencies , and technical advances have opened the way to aggressive redevelopment of contaminated patches of inner cities , long shunned as environmentally hazardous and financially risky the land is desirable for the reasons businesses once favored inner city locations proximity to transportation and easy access for suppliers and customers and the reclamation of sites known as brownfields is taking root across the urban northeast , midwest and almost everywhere else that fenced tracts of tainted soil , rusting iron and falling brick pay tribute to the decline of many manufacturing centers none of the sites , though , have been deemed hazardous enough to qualify for cleanup money under federal or state superfund programs with new streams of government money aimed at these projects and demand for urban real estate rising , an entire industry of financial consultants and environmental scientists has grown to attend to them in new york , the picture is mixed new york state has committed 200 million to clean brownfields in the 1996 bond act , but has so far spent only 84 million the state also lacks a law protecting prospective developers from unforeseen cleanup costs , prompting many developers to shop elsewhere new york city has identified more than 6 , 500 such tracts , most of them in old industrial areas of brooklyn , the bronx and queens the city has put together some successful pilot cleanups and has several more in the works among the most notable successes is the cleanup of the 96acre harlem river rail yard , which is also slated to include an industrial and commercial complex but some environmental experts in the private sector say the city is taking too long to compile and market a list of usable sites these neighborhoods ca n't wait , said walter hang , president of toxics targeting , who participated in a new york city task force on brownfields every day , every year you delay , structures are falling apart , the work force is leaving , the community is dying randy mastro , the first deputy mayor , defended new york city s record , saying that a wide array of sites , from the bronx to staten island , were being returned to productive use after decades of neglect it s in our interest to do so , mr mastro said it s both environmentally sound and good planning for the city elsewhere , redevelopment of polluted sites is becoming a thriving business mr hang , whose company is based in ithaca , ny , said that more than a third of his work involved sifting data bases of environmental agencies for records of spills before a real estate sale took place sensing a new business in the making , several insurance companies , including american insurance group and kemper insurance , have created divisions offering policies that protect developers of polluted real estate against unforeseen cleanup costs or lawsuits coopers lybrand , the accounting firm , has sharply expanded a division focused on evaluating cleanup costs for brownfields , creating five regional divisions last year to handle the work load , jennifer johnson , a manager in the division , said there s a lot of capital out there looking for the highest rate of return , and brownfields are a source of that , ms johnson said more and more people are finding their way through the muck laws , technology and attitudes evolve laws and regulations governing cleanup have been changed recently in more than three dozen states many of the changes limit the potential liability of new buyers to known cleanup costs freeing them from the specter of some surprise discovery years down the road some cleanups are being financed through loans by the federal department of housing and urban development and pilot grants from the federal environmental protection agency the epa has awarded more than 120 grants to municipalities to identify and fix sites , with 85 million in this year s budget for more grants in addition , a federal law enacted last year allows developers of brownfields to write off their cleanup costs in the year they are incurred , instead of stretching the tax break over several decades the tax breaks are expected to amount to 2 billion over the next three years
cairo , jan 10 just two weeks ago , the relatives of karam mohammed ismail had become so worried about their missing 18yearold son that they prepared to place an advertisement in a local newspaper then the police arrived with bad news mr ismail , they said , was among the 6 gunmen who killed 58 foreign tourists and 4 egyptians in november at a pharaonic temple in luxor , a massacre that has left egypt deeply shaken mr ismail , a secondary school student , had not been seen in his village 400 miles south of cairo , naza albouss , since the beginning of the threemonth school vacation his family believed he was working in the suez canal town of ismailiya , his usual summer haunt , and the two letters he sent home hinted at various benign adventures instead , the police say , those adventures led to an assault that was by far the deadliest in nearly six years of violence between security forces and islamic militants bent on overthrowing egypt s government the picture that has emerged in recent weeks suggests that the ringleader was an islamic militant , medhat abdel rahman , 32 , who somehow managed to enlist young students not known for radical sentiments mr abdel rahman had been wanted by the egyptian authorities since he traveled to pakistan in 1993 for training by other members of the islamic group , the largest and most violent of egypt s antigovernment organizations but the other attackers identified by the police included men like essmat erian , 24 , a veterinary student , and mahmoud ahmed abdel karim , 23 , a medical student , both at asyut university , the largest in southern egypt a third was saeed mohammed salama shawaki , 23 , a student at the high institute of agricultural studies , also in asyut , about 200 miles north of luxor , where the massacre took place one of the attackers has still not been identified asyut has been a hotbed of islamic violence since 1991 , when the militants began their campaign to overthrow their government and all of those who studied at the universities there had lived away from the watchful eyes of relatives but except for mr abdel rahman , none of those who have been identified so far had been suspected by the police of any connection with militant groups , and interviews with their relatives and associates have yielded mostly disbelief i still do not believe that a terrorist was among us , said assem mohammed , a classmate of mr abdel karim at the medical school in asyut all i remember of him is a shadowy personality that never mingled with anyone he hardly even said good morning the older brother of mr ismail , the missing 18yearold the police identified on dec 27 as one of the attackers , said he did pray , of course , like all muslims do but not even in a mosque only at home he did not even use the word 'haram , ' the arabic word commonly used by rigorous muslims to condemn what they regard as religiously forbidden mr ismail s brother , who declined to provide his own first name , is among those who have steadfastly insisted that their relatives have been made scapegoats by the police but witnesses who watched the gunmen flee the scene of the massacre until they were run down by the police in the barren hills near the valley of the queens have said they have no doubt that the bodies that the authorities hauled back into luxor were those of the assailants what is unnerving about this , western diplomats say , is that it suggests either that most of those who carried out the attack represented either an unknown splinter group or that they were persuaded to risk their lives on behalf of a militant organization with which they may have previously had little contact mr ismail , for one , hardly fit what most experts have long regarded as the profile of the typical militant driven by economic desperation the youngest of seven children , he came from a prominent family , made wealthy by the sheep and cattle they farmed mohammed ahmed bezed , the village chieftain , said he is welloff he did not do it for money foreign diplomats and other experts , while saying they believe that militant violence is on the wane , warn that sporadic attacks are likely to continue i do n't think the egyptian government is at risk in any way , said a diplomat who is an expert on islamic militancy but what the luxor massacre suggests is that even people who have not known to be part of a militant organization may be sufficiently impassioned to risk their lives in order to carry out a dramatic statement most of the attacks , which have killed more than 1 , 200 people in the last five years , are committed in the name of islam but most experts say they believe the motivations are far more complex they include a sense of desperation at an economic plight that for many has shown no sign of improvement
to the editor last week s cover article , newark s toxic bomb , described the worries of neighborhood residents about the dioxincontaminated soil at the former diamond alkali plant on lister avenue from 1951 to 1960 the same chemicals that constitute agent orange were manufactured at the site , and agent orange itself was produced from 1962 to 1969 i was plant manager from 1951 to 1960 and worked there as a supervising chemical engineer for several months in the 70 s starting in 1954 a number of the workers in the plant who were directly exposed to the chemicals containing dioxin developed serious health problems but at no time in this long period were there any signs of dioxinrelated health problems among the neighborhood residents or nearby factory workers for several years in the 1970 s a crew of dozens of workers was engaged in construction and chemical manufacturing at the site this even included digging up a considerable area locating and repairing a leak in the main water underground piping workers in the plant commonly wore only the protective safety gear normally worn in chemical plants yet to my knowledge none of these workers developed any of the health problems known to be caused by exposure to dioxin dioxin is truly a deadly chemical it has been found to be produced in numerous ways such as paper manufacture , coal burning and household waste incineration but , like all chemicals , there is a limit below which it is nonhazardous the history of this plant and its neighborhood indicates that the fears of its neighbors as described in this article are not warranted john burton washington
a 15yearold autistic boy who was found wandering in the erie lackawanna terminal in hoboken , nj , on tuesday but could not identify himself was reunited with his mother yesterday after she saw a news report about him on television he had been missing from his home on staten island for 11 days the boy , leshawn ware , was returned to his mother , stephanie ware , at st mary hospital in hoboken , where he had been cared for since being found in the waterfront terminal s main waiting room his mother had called the new jersey authorities after seeing his picture thursday night on wwortv although developmentally disabled , the boy was said by doctors to be unharmed and in good condition , was clean and did not even seem hungry officials said it was unclear where he had been or what he had done since he wandered away from his home in the great kills section on nov 2 but his mother told officials he had an affinity for mass transit she said that he has a love for the trains and the buses , and she surmised that he must have gotten on a train or a bus or the ferry and had been traveling the system before he wound up in hoboken , said penny bassetthackett , a spokeswoman for new jersey transit mrs ware , who has four other children , none of whom are autistic , said that leshawn , who attends special classes at an annex of public school 25 in staten island , was wearing a black and white down jacket when he disappeared she had called the new york city police to report him missing when found by erie lackawanna station employees , he had no money and could not identify himself but he was carrying five metrocards from the new york city transit system , and gave his address as 370 jay street in brooklyn , which turned out to be the headquarters of new york city transit the terminal where the boy was found is a hub for new jersey transit trains and buses , the port authority transhudson system and the new york waterway ferry from the world financial center in manhattan he might have come from almost anywhere law enforcement agencies , including the new york police , were alerted , but no connection was made immediately the boy seemed unruffled by his experiences in any case when we got him , he was clean and not particularly hungry , said joan quigley , a hospital spokeswoman we suspect he was using the restrooms in the train stations to freshen up she also said that workers at a burger king may have fed him , but that she had no details
when i read the account of matthew shepard s murder , the words that i could not forget were those reportedly used by one of his killers after he and a companion had lured mr shepard out of a laramie , wyo , tavern and into the pickup truck in which they would drive him to his place of execution guess what \? i'm not gay and you just got jacked these words odors from the abyss , as forster might have put it recalled others spoken by the narrator of eudora welty s 1963 story where is the voice coming from \? which she wrote in a white heat after the assassination of the civil rights leader medgar evers now i'm alive and you ai n't , evers s killer tells his dead victim in the story we ai n't never now , never going to be equals , and you know why \? one of us is dead certain commonplaces cannot be restated enough hatred of gay men in this country is an epidemic as pernicious as aids , and as unfathomable nor is any gay man untouched by this epidemic it haunts not only the drag queen who takes her life in her hands every time she steps onto the street , not only the middleaged man who invites a stranger home with whom he has spoken on a phone sex line , not only the isolated college student in wyoming longing for friendship and trusting in the overtures of moles from the stasi of hate , but also the forwardthinking , welladjusted , worldly homosexual man who imagines that in his urban corner of sanity and tolerance , in greenwich village or los angeles or london , he is somehow immune he is not immune either from hatred or from the fear of hatred , which is in many ways even more destructive thus even though mark mitchell and i have lived together for almost seven years , even though when we stay at the homes of our enlightened parents we are treated by them no differently than , say , my brother and his wife , even though we share a house , a bed , a car and a bank account , when we walk together in any city we never hold hands and not because we flinch at public displays of affection \( as might my brother and his wife , for whom such decisions carry little weight \) but because we are afraid of being killed no , gay killings are not everyday occurrences , any more than lynchings were ever a daily event in the south , but the fear colors everything especially in a year when reported bias crimes against gay people in new york city have increased 81 percent certain commonplaces cannot be restated enough in the brutal con game to which matthew shepard fell prey , what was exploited was nothing less than a young man s trust and hope and eager longing , if not for love , then at least for friendship , for camaraderie in this game , kindness can be held out as bait sex can be used as a lure the payoff may be death , as it was for matthew shepard , or it may be robbery or gaybashing or merely unkind , ignorant words but few of us walk away unscarred , if we are lucky enough to walk away at all for years aids conveniently helped the hatemongerers do their job , by wiping out gay men in appalling numbers but now , for the first time in more than a decade , aids deaths are down , and it seems as if ignorance is stepping in and pick up the slack shoot a gay or two , a piece of graffito in laramie announced several years ago i have seen and become inured to a blunter epithet , one that is found too often on bathroom walls and in university libraries faggots die die that s really what it s all about , if for no other reason than that it is only when faggots die that their systematic persecution ever gets any attention in part this is our own fault for instance , when i was robbed a few years ago in paris by a man who invited me to his apartment building for coffee , i never reported the incident to the police , or even spoke of it , out of shame nor , i suspect , would matthew shepard have gone to the police had he merely been beaten to a pulp and if he had , would it have done any good \? shoot a gay or two psychiatrists have long speculated that many killers of gay men are themselves repressed homosexuals , which is why , so often , they murder their victims after sex for these attackers , the mere fact that another man desires them \( not to mention the possibility that others might consider them to be gay \) is seen as justification for an act of retaliatory violence this may have been what happened to my friend lou inturrisi , a journalist and travel writer , whose body was discovered last august on the floor of his apartment in rome his skull had been bashed in he had not , however , been robbed his was one of a spate of gay killings in italy in recent years , only one of which has been solved in that case , the killer turned out to be a male prostitute there are many reasons a gay man would go home with a stranger perhaps because the thrill of danger excites him perhaps because he is naive perhaps because he does not know any better in the end , however , none of this excuses the person who kills or those who blame the victim for his own murder , in much the same way that women are often blamed for having encouraged the men who raped them when i was matthew shepard s age , my greatest fear was aids , because i had no idea then how the virus was spread now , 16 years later , there is still no cure for aids , but there is prevention we can instruct a matthew shepard in how to protect himself against infection by hiv but could we instruct him in how to protect himself against hatred \?
portland , ore , may 24 it was clear after 5 or 10 minutes today that the rain and soggy field at civic stadium would give the united states soccer team far more difficulty than lowly kuwait would the americans took 14 shots to none for kuwait in the first half in 90 minutes , kuwait mustered only 4 shots , while the united states blistered goalie khalid alfadhli with 25 attempts on goal but this is a team that has chronically struggled to put the ball into the net ernie stewart and tab ramos finally did , but a 20 victory for the americans should have been three times that dominating we 're not going to have great chances like that in the world cup , goalkeeper kasey keller said there might be four or five good chances , and you 've got to take advantage the encouraging news is that the americans are getting loads of scoring opportunities in their new 361 formation , which features three defenders , six midfielders and one forward and neither austria , macedonia nor kuwait have been able to score a single goal against the alignment but it was difficult to accurately assess today s match because , as ramos bluntly put it , the opponent was n't there the united states plays one final exhibition before its opening world cup match , against germany on june 15 in paris next saturday , the americans will face scotland , a fellow world cup finalist , in washington the quality of the opponent will be much higher than today s and coach steve sampson may finally have a chance to field his preferred starting lineup , which had to be restructured against kuwait because of injury neither of the wide midfielders , cobi jones \( sprained knee \) and frankie hejduk \( hamstring \) , was available against kuwait and forward brian mcbride continues to experience headaches after sustaining a concussion in a collision last saturday against macedonia on the other hand , david regis , the frenchman who became a united states citizen on wednesday , played impressively in his first start with the americans regis defended comfortably , fluidly moved forward , displayed his ability to head the ball as advertised and produced two scoring opportunities his only mistake came in the 62d minute , when kuwait s ali alhadiyah beat him to a pass and headed the ball off the crossbar after 10 or 15 minutes , you knew you could trust him , thomas dooley , the american captain and sweeper , said of regis the squishy , temporary grass field at civic stadium left players feeling as if they were running in sand , said forward eric wynalda , who made several vital runs and purposeful passes in the second half , even if he lacked explosiveness in his first appearance in two months after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery even though many players grew exhausted , the 361 has still given the americans resolve and vibrancy in their attack with brian maisonneuve and chad deering hanging back as defensive midfielders , claudio reyna and stewart have the freedom to go forward without restraint in the 37th minute , maisonneuve bent a perfect chip shot from 35 yards out , laying the ball at the feet of stewart , who drilled a shot inside the near post from 11 yards this was only maisonneuve s seventh appearance with the national team , but he has all but secured a starting spot against germany in the world cup in the 82d minute , ramos knifed in from the left flank , made a crossover move that would have made tim hardaway proud and rocketed the ball inside the far post from 15 yards out , putting the americans up by 20 ramos played only 15 minutes today , but he has made a remarkable recovery from two knee operations , and continues to challenge for a starting position realistically , it s hard to say , ramos said the coach s job is on the line , not mine he wants to win he s got to have the best lineup with the people with the best fitness to get the best results if he feels it s without me , i support it 100 percent i wo n't like it , but i 'll support it

bangkok , thailand , feb 8 southeast asian leaders , hoping to reduce their reliance on the american dollar and shore up their troubled economies , are rallying behind a proposal to trade goods in local currencies instead of dollars the proposal , dismissed as quixotic by some currency experts , gathered support this weekend after a capitalhopping tour by prime minister mahathir mohamad of malaysia , its leading proponent the leaders of thailand , the philippines and singapore issued statements after meeting mr mahathir that supported using regional currency for regional trade they said they would assign central bankers to work out details , possibly including the establishment of a regional currency clearing house the currency proposal is the latest attempt to find asian solutions to asia s economic crisis the malaysian leader joined japan last fall in pushing an asiansonly bailout fund that would exclude the international monetary fund but that idea garnered little support calls to promote use of local currencyfor trade have found more favor the dollar , used for almost all regional trade , has become costly for southeast asian countries that have seen their currencies plunge to record lows in the last six months supporting mr mahathir s idea on saturday , president fidel ramos of the philippines said southeast asia should promote more such homegrown solutions with more creative and intensified cooperation all around , east asia s economy will recover , he told reporters in thailand , prime minister chuan leekpai and the thai bankers association backed the idea of a common currency for the area but mr chuan said further study was needed to determine feasibility exactly how such a system would function is unclear one version outlined over the weekend suggested that traders would pay for a neighbor s goods in the exporter s home currency in an alternative system , the singapore dollar , southeast asia s sturdiest currency , would replace the american dollar in regional trade should the currency plan be adopted , it could help create demand for local currencies and reduce the appetite for dollars , helping local currencies gain in value thai traders would need to buy malaysian ringgit , and filipino businessmen would need indonesia rupiah , creating a market for currencies that few foreigners care to hold today but many currency experts said the plan could work only on a small scale none of the regional currencies is widely available internationally there are few ways for traders to hedge the thai baht or philippine peso on currency markets , making them risky to hold even the japanese yen , by far asia s strongest currency , has never caught on as an alternative to the dollar eric nickerson , a currency expert at bank of america in hong kong , dismissed the idea as impractical it comes from a trading bloc mentality , that we should take care of ourselves , he said but i do n't give it much credence mr mahathir conceded that some people might see the idea as harebrained , but said regional leaders were ready to give it a try anyway we are ready to start almost immediately , he told reporters stocks rise in tokyo tokyo , monday , feb 9 \( bloomberg news \) stocks were trading higher here today at midday the nikkei index was up 5175 points , or 03 percent , at 17 , 09181
london , feb 11 the renovated toffee factory on the edge of the bloomsbury district is no ordinary office for one thing , none of the 100 or so workers mostly denimclad men and women in their 20 s and 30 s have their own offices , or even their own desks they pick up portable phones in the morning from a recharging rack and seat themselves just about anywhere this seemingly chaotic setting , though , is home to a feisty young agency called st luke s that is challenging some precepts of the british advertising business and bucking the industrywide trend toward consolidation in less than three years , st luke s the wayward child of chiat day has placed itself on the short list of london s creative elite , coming up with some of the most rulebreaking campaigns on either side of the atlantic in a surprise , it recently snatched one of the largest accounts awarded by the british government and st luke s has done this even as it turned the corporate structure and culture of the traditional monolithic egodriven ad shop upside down it has created an agency with almost no corporate hierarchy and an entity that boasts that every employee receives an equal share of the profits , even the housekeeper , rose salaries , of course , are not equal , though st luke s would give no specifics for an industry consumed by the bottom line , st luke s is one of a handful of agencies that strive to be iconoclastic , rebellious voices , using cheeky humor to push otherwise prosaic products into the advertising stratosphere the st luke s line chuck out the chintz , from its ikea ads , has become part of the british vernacular and its ads for clark s shoes grab for youthful appeal with the line act your shoe size , not your age but for an agency named after the patron saint of artists , it was n't foreordained that st luke s would reach ad heaven it was born the day chiat day was acquired by omnicom group inc in october 1995 andy law and david abraham , then managing director and account director , respectively , of chiat day london , refused to merge their london office with their crosstown rival , omnicom s tbwa instead , for 1 and an undisclosed percentage of future profits , mr law and mr abraham simply bought the office from omnicom , then turned around and transferred ownership to the 35member staff of the agency , renaming it st luke s we were n't attracted to becoming millionaires , we were attracted to creating this intellectual experiment , mr abraham , 35 , said in an interview in a small room in the agency s basement known as the chillout room the principle was you could n't own people , but you could let people own the company the result is a culture that seeks to stir the creative juices by making every employee an owner , with no corporate ladder to climb or glass ceiling to break through even the stationery lists every employee er , owner from creative director to receptionist the company is governed by a sixmember board elected by the staff called the quest , short for qualifying employee shareholder trust and mr abraham and mr law are purposely excluded asked whether he felt powerless in the company he cofounded , mr abraham said , it s like buddhism if you let go , you gain more it is such cultlike talk that has some industry experts questioning whether such a corporate structure or lack thereof can really last in the cutthroat world of bigtime advertising others are bothered by its holierthanthou attitude st luke s set itself up as an easy target for critics , wrote campaign , the british advertising industry trade magazine its refusal to enter work for creative awards , and its insistence on pulling out of pitches with which it feels uncomfortable can smack of pretension and insufferable preciousness st luke s refuses to enter award competitions , mr law said , because they usually single out one person , not the team anyway , we believe they reflect last year s standards , he scoffed some executives at competing agencies are scornful of st luke s , but , noting how small and inbred the british ad community is , insisted on anonymity i ca n't see what all the fuss is about , one competitor said still , by all available measuring sticks , st luke s has arrived despite the criticism , it was recently named agency of the year by campaign , and has attracted 21 million , or 347 million , in new business in the last year the agency has assembled an impressive client roster for an independent shop , including cocacola , ikea , midland bank , clark s shoes , bbc radio 1 , two cosmetics lines at the drugstore chain boots and eurostar , the passenger rail service that travels through the channel tunnel when these guys want an account , they can get it , said karen yakes , deputy news director of campaign their creative work is just so alarmingly exciting perhaps their most notable accomplishment is winning the labor government s welfaretowork account , estimated at 18 million , or 30 million , over three years it seems to reflect the recasting of the stodgy government , which was run by the tories for nearly two decades , into a more fluid institution interested in pursuing a social agenda it is also a departure for a government that usually awarded accounts to big , established agencies
the field was spotty in some places , with a fine , grainy green mixture patching crevices where the grass had worn or yellowed in streaks at one end of the field paint obscured some other blemishes , and from the upper deck at giants stadium , it was easy to see where forklifts had marred the grass in patches , turning it brown but most of the first grass field to play host to a football game in the 22year history of giants stadium was unscathed , and afterward the field was an unqualified success in the eyes of those who played on it add giants coach jim fassel to the list of supporters team executives were pleased as well the condition of the experimental grasstray field , damaged by a concert on aug 2 at the stadium , was not a factor in the giants' 2417 preseason victory over the cincinnati bengals saturday night but it became the players' most frequent postgame topic of conversation i loved the field , cornerback jason sehorn said sure , if you 're going to have a concert on grass , some of it s going to die but it was n't bad besides , i 'd rather play on dirt than artificial turf tackle scott gragg said it was a very true field , no lumps , bumps or parts that were n't level they had the grass cut down short , so it was quick it was fine , and i'm sure we 'll all feel a little fresher because of it tomorrow giants linebacker scott galyon , in his third season with the team , said the grass field made him see giants stadium in a different light you come off the field with dirt and grass stains on you , not rug burns , he said you feel like you 've been in a football game , and that makes it much more like a football experience the whole atmosphere of the place is different with that grass no player said anything critical about the grass field until it was mentioned that the team would play just one more game on it this year after the giants' exhibition game with the jets on aug 20 , the grass , which is positioned on 6 , 100 portable trays , will be removed the giants will play their final preseason game and the regular season on a new artificial turf , which is now beneath the grass field that is going to be the hard part , sehorn said going back to the old turf after we 've seen this but if the current grass field continues to satisfy giants players , coaches and management as it has so far and particularly if it improves as it recovers from the concert damage it will only hasten the implementation of a permanent grass field at giants stadium that could come as early as next season , though giants officials have indicated recently that a grass field in giants stadium for the entire national football league season is more likely by the year 2000 fassel is encouraged even after reviewing the video of saturday s game , coach jim fassel could not offer much criticism of his team s performance he felt his second and thirdteam players were not accustomed to the pace of an nfl game , which , fassel said , accounted for the two secondhalf touchdowns the reserves gave up for his starters , who charged to a 173 halftime lead , fassel had mostly praise of quarterback danny kanell , who overthrew a few receivers but otherwise looked sharp , fassel said what i liked is that danny looked very comfortable in the pocket i liked his footwork , his mechanics , and he kept his vision down the field sometimes , in the first time out in a season , you see guys flinching a little i saw none of that in danny fassel also singled out cornerback phillippi sparks , who intercepted a pass and forced a fumble phillippi is very alert and in the best shape i 've ever seen him , fassel said fassel said safety rodney young was a dramatically improved player , and the coach continued to marvel at scott galyon galyon s play as a linebacker in the nickel packages has been so good that he would probably be a starter except that jessie armstead , the giants' allpro weakside linebacker , plays the same position special teams highlights there were some standout performances saturday on the giants' special teams , which were statistically a trouble spot last year david patten returned a kickoff 41 yards , which is significant when you realize that the giants had just two kickoff returns longer than 30 yards in 17 games last season placekicker brad daluiso produced touchbacks on three of his five kickoffs and punter brad maynard had punts of 58 and 59 yards injury report coach jim fassel said there were no serious injuries saturday night safety tito wooten has a dislocated finger on his right hand the backup quarterback kent graham has a deep thigh bruise that may limit his practice because of swelling and soreness fassel , however , was injured he has a sore right arm after an official s flag they are stuffed with lead pellets so they wo n't blow away on windy days struck him in the arm during the game the guy really flung that thing and it hurt , fassel said photo phillippi sparks intercepting a pass intended for carl pickens saturday night sparks also forced a fumble \( vic delucia the new york times \)

expanding far beyond its home territory in the west , sbc communications inc , the nation s largest local telephone company , announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the southern new england telecommunications corporation , the local telephone company for nearly every connecticut resident , for 44 billion in stock the acquisition would give sbc , the parent of southwestern bell and pacific bell , a beachhead in the region controlled by one of its biggest rivals , the bell atlantic corporation the deal would mean the end of one of the biggest local nonbell phone companies and would move the headquarters of connecticut s main phone carrier from new haven to san antonio snet has aggressively expanded into new businesses in recent years the company has signed on more than 800 , 000 of its 22 million local telephone customers to its longdistance service but as the telecommunications industry continues its breakneck consolidation and as companies try to offer broad bundles of communications services , snet simply found itself too small to be financially viable if the acquisition of snet is approved , sbc may become the first regional bell to find a back door into the lucrative 80 billion longdistance telephone business the efforts of the five bells to sell longdistance service within their regions have been blocked by the federal communications commission , which contends that the bells have not done enough to open their systems to potential competitors but snet , like the hundreds of other nonbell local phone carriers , has been allowed to sell longdistance service without undergoing such a federal review the bells are being forced to leap over a higher regulatory bar than nonbell local carriers because the bells used to be a part of att , which was broken up in the 1980 s as part of an antitrust lawsuit despite the fact that sbc has not been allowed to sell longdistance service in its sevenstate western territory , which includes california and texas , sbc and snet believe that the combined company will be able to remain in the longdistance market in connecticut because snet was never part of att last week , a federal judge in texas overturned the parts of the telecommunications act of 1996 that force the bells to undergo the difficult review but that ruling has been appealed and it could take months or years for a final decision snet s chairman , daniel j miglio , said the company had to find a buyer because snet lacked the resources to compete in the industry despite our success and our good track record , we began to see that scale would become more and more important in the future , mr miglio said as the industry becomes more competitive it would be relatively harder for us to spend what you 'd need to spend on new technology after the merger , most connecticut consumers will probably see little change in the daytoday workings of the telephone system sbc would continue to operate under the snet brand in connecticut and the companies said that none of snet s 9 , 700 employees would be laid off but consumer advocates said yesterday that the state and federal regulators who must rule on the merger should view the deal as an opportunity to force snet to open its local network to other companies , giving connecticut consumers a greater choice of local phone carrier bell atlantic and the nynex corporation agreed to such terms last year as they sought approval for their 256 billion merger bell companies have acquired other local telephone carriers before , but only in states where those bells already do business and so are explicitly restricted from the longdistance market , industry executives and people close to the fcc said yesterday for instance , last year the ameritech corporation , based in chicago , bought some small local operations in illinois from a unit of the sprint corporation the question of whether a combined sbcsnet should be allowed to sell longdistance service in connecticut is expected to be the crux of the regulatory agencies' reviews of the deal but no bell company has ever before proposed to acquire a local telephone company outside of the states where it traditionally operated , according to people close to the fcc and industry executives so while sbc and snet have a reasonable argument for remaining in the longdistance business in connecticut , the people said , there is no precedent for considering such an arrangement the justice department and connecticut regulators will also examine the deal nonetheless , edward e whitacre , sbc s chairman , was confident yesterday that the deal would be good for his company s shareholders and good for callers in connecticut we can learn from their longdistance and they have expertise in that that we do n't have , so it s just a real good fit , he said but mark cooper , director of research for the consumer federation of america , based in washington , was not convinced if you 're a consumer in connecticut , this is not going to make it easier for other companies to get into the local market in connecticut , he said sbc will offer 08784 of a share for each share of snet sbc s shares closed yesterday at 728125 , down 2125 , on the new york stock exchange , making the offer worth about 6395 for each share of snet snet s shares closed on friday , before the deal was announced , at 49625 , making the deal worth almost 29 percent more than friday s closing price that s a great price for snet , said scott wright , a telecommunications analyst for fahnestock company yesterday , snet s shares rocketed to 6050 , up 10875 the gap between snet s price and what sbc is offering could reflect uncertainty about approval of the deal sbc s shares fell , analysts said , in part because the company said the deal would reduce its earnings for as many as three years coming on the heels of sbc s 167 billion acquisition last year of the pacific telesis group , parent company of pacific bell , there were also minor concerns that sbc was expanding too quickly sbc and snet intend to complete their deal by the end of the year sbc will assume 14 billion of snet debt the two companies' wireless telephone customers could also see enhanced service as sbc , which operates wireless systems in upstate new york and around boston under the cellular one brand , links with snet s wireless network in connecticut and rhode island the deal makes sense for three reasons , said michael price , an investment banker at lazard freres , who worked on the deal for sbc one , it s a consolidating industry two , it s an expansion of a contiguous wireless footprint and three , it provides sbc with experience in entering the longdistance business sbc was also advised by the law firm of sullivan cromwell snet was advised by the law firm of cravath , swaine moore and by salomon smith barney , the investment bank owned by travelers

the pleasures of their lives were admittedly simple baking peanut butter cookies , growing tiny plants in window boxes , making the occasional trip to the mall others were no longer able to bake or even read , and contented themselves in wheelchairs on the boardwalk while some people generally regard nursing homes as depressingly unwelcome places , many of the residents of cityrun neponsit health care center in the rockaways poor , chronically sick and long schooled in distrusting institutions got their first taste of stability and community at the beachfront nursing home but that stability and community came apart last month when the city suddenly closed the home and scattered its 282 residents throughout the health care system , where 53 are still waiting for permanent homes two have since died and one is missing , and advocates are embroiled in a fierce debate with the city s health and hospitals corporation over whether the move hastened those incidents some former residents , like the many alzheimer s patients , are simply bewildered others , who had grown accustomed to a life peppered with daily activity , are simply bored others still , especially those who came to neponsit from considerably worse places , fear for their future i do n't want to be in the street or get hurt no more , said 55yearold mary chandler , who had lived in neponsit for a decade when the city hospitals agency closed the 85yearold home on sept 10 , officials said its deteriorating buildings had been made unsafe by a labor day storm and last week , saying that the estimated 51 million price tag on repairs was too high , they announced that the home would be closed and bulldozed and the land turned into a park \( on friday , the legal aid society and the law firm kaye , scholer , feirman , hays handler succeeded in enjoining the city from demolishing the center , pending a wednesday hearing \) the closing has attracted the attention of regulators , politicians and advocates for the elderly and poor , all of whom have criticized the way the residents were moved on the fly and without many of their belongings and the way they have been housed since the federal health care finance administration , which runs medicare and medicaid , is fining the city 3 , 050 a day until all the residents are placed in longterm homes at the same time , local politicians and advocates say the closing underscores a lack of commitment to medical care for the poor as the city tries to cut costs and make the sprawling public hospital system pay for itself in an increasingly cutthroat health care market for their part , city officials say they remain committed to the public health system , but simply could not let neponsit stand i had to balance the potential for the stress associated with the sudden change in environment with the real risk of physical harm to residents , employees and visitors , said dr luis r marcos , president of the city s health and hospitals corporation and the corporation is fighting the fine , contending that the federal government had promised to help find permanent places to live for the residents , but had failed to do so mostly removed from the debate are neponsit s former residents , who have been uprooted from a life that many had known for more than a decade like the city s four other longterm care centers , neponsit was something akin to a shelter for the poor and sick , people who could not live on their own but had nowhere else to go many were only in their 50 s but had cancer or other disabling diseases marie converse , who said she was beaten so badly by a former roommate that she required spinal surgery and has to use a wheelchair , built herself a social system at neponsit based around resident committees that would decide things like how the laundry would be done or what would be served for dinner ms chandler was placed in neponsit after a social worker found her walking around aimlessly without shoes she made her first real friends among the other residents , and enjoyed watching movies with them hermi miranda , who had lived on the couches of friends in upper manhattan for several years before doctors told him he had stomach cancer , loved the privacy of his own room , to which he could retreat when he was feeling poorly neponsit is a beautiful place , mr miranda said we lived there together as friends , and now everybody is separated all because the building has some little cracks while details of the proceedings leading up to the evacuation are muddy when staff members were informed , when the decision to close the home for good was made , who said what to whom there seems to be little dispute that the evacuation was sudden and chaotic interviews with several residents and neponsit workers paint a picture of 48 hours in september of confusion and misery during which elderly and sick people were given a few hours' notice to pack their belongings into plastic bags before they were shepherded to a bus to go to hospitals or other nursing homes the evacuations began on the evening of sept 10 some went by ambulance , still in sleeping gowns jackie brown was one resident who was moved early in the morning of sept 10 and now awaits her future at colergoldwater memorial hospital on roosevelt island

washington , dec 10 saying that some of the proposed impeachment charges hinged on conflicting he said , she said versions of what went on between president clinton and monica s lewinsky , democrats stepped up their efforts to undermine ms lewinsky s credibility today , citing inconsistencies in her accounts of the affair and her taped statement to linda tripp that she had lied her entire life it was the second consecutive day in which democrats sought to raise questions about ms lewinsky s reliability in recalling elements of her relationship with the president and it left mr clinton and democrats fighting impeachment in a delicate position , not wanting to be seen as attacking the 25yearold former white house intern but intent on challenging her veracity on critical details like where and how the president touched her in their sexual encounters abbe d lowell , the counsel for the house judiciary committee s democrats , said in his twohour presentation to the committee today that if the house voted to impeach mr clinton for lying under oath about where he touched ms lewinsky , it might require that the former white house intern testify before the senate in detail about their relationship such a 'he said , she said' drama , if you really want it , would also have to include questions into the inconsistencies in ms lewinsky s testimony that the independent counsel seems to ignore in his referral , mr lowell said mr lowell cited statements made by ms lewinsky to friends that the secret service had brought the president to her apartment and that she had sex with mr clinton in the oval office without any clothes mr lowell cited testimony by bayani nelvis , a white house steward , that ms lewinsky had asserted that the president had invited her to martha s vineyard while mrs clinton was away and mr lowell said ms lewinsky had told job interviewers that she had lunched with the first lady , who had offered to find her a place to live in new york mr lowell said none of those events cited by ms lewinsky had happened but that type of embellishment would require scrutiny in a senate trial , he said judy smith , a spokeswoman for ms lewinsky , declined to comment today mr lowell did not present any evidence that ms lewinsky had lied when she told the grand jury that mr clinton had touched her in intimate ways that would fit the definition of sexual relations used in the deposition given by mr clinton in the paula jones case mr clinton s denial of a sexual relationship with ms lewinsky in that deposition is at the heart of the perjury charges in the impeachment resolution the judiciary committee took up today but mr lowell argued that inconsistencies in ms lewinsky s accounts of the relationship in general left the house short of the threshold of evidence needed to send to the senate charges based on statements by mr clinton about the nature and details of his involvement with ms lewinsky mr lowell also played for the committee a segment from a conversation taped by linda tripp of ms lewinsky saying that she was brought up with lies all the time in the taped conversation , ms lewinsky recounts how she had to make up stories to get money from her father , how her mother had always lied to her father , how her mother had helped her sneak out of the house i have lied my entire life , ms lewinsky says on the tape representative lindsey o graham , a south carolina republican , accused mr clinton at the house judiciary committee s hearing on wednesday of encouraging aides to leak stories last january about ms lewinsky being unstable and a sexual predator charles f c ruff , the white house counsel , immediately denied the accusation , saying a very careful and wellconsidered decision was made to do our damndest to insure that in fact no such personal attack was ever made a few hours later , however , judiciary committee democrats released a statement saying that ms lewinsky s memory had been affected by prescription drugs a contention that an associate of ms lewinsky s denied and that she had repeatedly been untruthful
palermo , italy feature films about the sicilian mafia used to be predictable fare , like cowboy or kung fu movies stock characters included the stern patriarch , the nasty killer , the silent wife , the corrupt businessman and , of course , the lonely antimafia crusader put them together in a mournful struggle of good versus evil , and , poof , there it was another in a long string of movies that regularly crowded italian theaters and television screens now along comes a mafia movie that has none of these characters , not even a moral dimension to speak of , and that is , of all things , a musical comedy it was filmed in one of palermo s most notoriously mobinfested neighborhoods , featuring characters literally drawn from the street and to some extent it s real life with its singalong tunes \( we are the mafia is one , sung in sicilian dialect \) , nutty dance numbers \( featuring mafiosi waving dead chickens \) and chorus of overweight mafia women complaining about their overbearing men , tano to die for , is a sometimes surrealistic film by roberta torre , a 36yearold director in palermo the film does more than challenge cliches about sicily s mafia culture , it ridicules them the movie reflects a historical necessity , which 10 years ago would have been impossible , said franco maresco , an avantgarde sicilian filmmaker whose movies , made with his partner , daniele cipri , present a bleaker vision of sicily , italy s southernmost island ten years ago , the actors from the vucciria neighborhood would not have participated they would have been afraid to make fun of a mafioso , to make fun of 'omerta , ' the mafia s code of silence they were the same people who used to see dead bodies in the streets there was no space for satire then it was a war , recalled goffredo fofi , a film critic who once lived in palermo people were losing their lives by breaking what had become an invisible cultural barrier , tano to die for , which is a big hit here in the sicilian capital , is seen as a cultural monument , a sign of palermo s recovery from its smothering oppression by a criminal organization that six years ago was brazenly executing italy s most celebrated prosecutors the murders of two of them in 1992 were the turning point in italy s war against organized crime spurred by popular outrage , the government dispatched army troops to sicily , and the pace of prosecutions picked up mafiosi were encouraged to break their vows of silence and turn state s evidence today most of the top bosses of the cosa nostra are in jail and while the mafia is still a pervasive force here , its mystique has been tarnished that s where tano to die for enters the picture 'tano' is the first denunciation of the mafia as an ambiguous phenomenon , says leoluca orlando , the mayor of palermo he is a big booster of ms torre s movie , which he calls an act of liberation no one not mr orlando or ms torre would ever argue that the war against the mafia in sicily was over all they are saying is that the time has come for another look at the enemy in the old days , mr orlando recalled , mafia bosses had nicknames like the pope , the prince , the baron by the 1980 s , he said , when the violence and brutality had gotten out of control , the nickname for toto riina , the boss of bosses , was the beast that shows to what extent the mafia had become barbarians , said mr orlando and that s what 'tano' does it reveals their barbarity , their vulgarity , their ambiguity nonetheless , after its release last summer at the venice film festival , the movie stirred debate over whether the mafia could ever be seen in a humorous light , whether , for instance , scenes of wedding guests being mowed down by machine gun fire are appropriate in musical comedy that debate coincided with a similar one over the italian film life is beautiful , directed by the comic actor roberto benigni and due to be released in the united states later this year , in which a jewish father , in an attempt to shield his young son from the horrors of the holocaust , turns the ordeals of a nazi death camp into a humorous game the argument is an old one , circling the question of whether comedy and humor are appropriate for subjects that are deeply painful and tragic ms torre , a northern italian who moved to palermo seven years ago , has little patience for a debate that she says was resolved by the ancient greeks she said she did not set out to make fun of the mafia within the tragedy of the mafia , there is also a cultural side , a subculture that exists , she said that is what i wanted to explore to see what is really happening in the mafia neighborhoods , in the homes of the mafiosi themselves the story of tano guarrasi , a butcher and smalltime neighborhood mafia boss who tyrannizes his unmarried sisters , is a true one that mr guarrasi s brotherinlaw originally told her in embellished form , with the quasimythical details that have given the mafia a special aura discovering the truth , she said , was part of her immersion into the mafia culture as it really is i really entered into this story , and i was lucky , because it is not an easy world to get into , she said you can only enter if you have a middleman to introduce you it helped that the people who acted in the film coexist daily with the mafia that is the part that i found most fascinating taking people who were quasimafiosi and putting them into a film about the mafia they loved it the film , with its snappy music by nino d'angelo , a neapolitan , views mafia culture and traditions as more grotesque , more exaggerated than the old glossy images usually seen in the genre but also more realistically in tano to die for , the mafia initiation rites do n't involve pricked fingertips , candle wax and images of saints , but rather a gaudy songanddance of male bonding with a strong homosexual undercurrent similarly , family honor , the tie that binds sicily s mafia clans , is reduced in the movie to an incestuous relationship between tano and the sisters he would never let get married none of these scenes are very flattering to sicilians , let alone mafiosi , a fact that has disturbed some people in palermo giorgio castellani , a local filmmaker whose father , michele greco , was a notorious mafia boss , found the movie distasteful , saying it is n't realism , it is a comic book he added they made a caricature of sicilians , which i found offensive because we are presented as ugly and monstrous there are no beautiful women in the film even if the mafia image is changing , the old stereotypes are still in demand in his latest movie the grimaldis , the story of a sicilian family , mr castellani had to insert a mafia figure at the insistence of his producers i did n't want to talk about the mafia in this film , but i was forced to , because you have to meet the needs of the market , he said still , there are signs that even the italian public is growing weary of a genre that has been outstripped by reality this year , ratings for the ninth installment of the hugely popular mafia television serial the octopus were the lowest ever the world has changed , said mr maresco , the filmmaker children in palermo play with computers a hundred years ago , this was truly an isolated island , where cultural development had stopped a hundred years before now the children of mafiosi have the same idols as children in the states photo ciccio guarino as a palermo mob boss in tano to die for \( sergio cipri \)

empire , la blessed by a gentle breeze , mitchell and frank jurisich stand on the deck of their wide , white fishing boat as it scuds across a louisiana bayou beneath them lies a bed of rockheavy oysters , ready to be wrestled from the sea , in a rite of harvest handed down three generations in the early days they could n't get people to do this work , mitchell jurisich , a beefy man of 34 , says as he culls and sacks the blackshelled bivalves with his brother to get these oysters from the bottom to the oyster bar takes a lot of heartache these days the struggle is more complex than the oystermen of the louisiana bayou ever imagined in an era of growing concern about hidden dangers in the nation s food supply , their way of life depends on a shellfish blamed for more severe illness than any other seafood since federal officials started cataloguing cases in 1989 , an average of 10 people a year have died from eating raw gulf oysters that carried a littleknown bacterium , vibrio vulnificus millions of people eat gulf oysters with no ill effect , and here , as in many other industries , health officials are grappling with a kind of moral arithmetic of regulation , weighing lives potentially lost , workers displaced and traditions ended you get into these societal , ethical questions , said glenn morris , an epidemiologist at the university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore after being steeped in the oyster issue for 18 years , dr morris said , i'm still on the fence in louisiana , the top processor in a region that harvests nearly 60 percent of the nation s oyster crop , the livelihood of about 900 oystermen is at stake the coastal version of family farmers , many work as their fathers and grandfathers did , on water bottoms leased from the state and inherited like liquid land from 1991 to 1996 , they have seen the price they get for oyster meat come in 35 to 40 percent lower than expected as a result of public alarm over health issues , according to a study at louisiana state university here in empire , 55 miles southeast of new orleans , oystermen are battling a paradox of the gulf the same warm , brackish waters that make it the nation s most abundant oyster grounds create ideal conditions for vibrio vulnificus vibrio vulnificus , first reported in medical journals in 1979 , is natural in the water and harmless to most people its presence cannot be detected by smell , sight or taste in the fleshy , grayskinned morsels that people savor but when the gulf gets warmest in the summer and early fall , the benign bacterium turns deadly for a small group of people with chronic medical conditions the most commonly affected are people with liver disease and more specifically alcoholic liver disease , said sean altekruse , an epidemiologist at the centers for disease control and prevention liver ailments like hepatitis and cirrhosis are a factor in 80 percent of cases the food and drug administration has shifted its approach to this new threat several times , buffeted between industry leaders who have opposed major restrictions and consumer advocates who want gulf oysters either pasteurized or taken off the market during warmwater months for now , the fda has settled on a program of public education and fishing rules still , vibrio vulnificus is not widely known as a result , people like daniel gregor , 46 , can become its unknowing victims mr gregor , a construction contractor from cape coral , fla , was meeting his fiancee s family for the first time over lunch in a new orleans restaurant on aug 15 , 1996 , when he ate raw oysters a recent blood donor , mr gregor had been told he might have hepatitis c but had no idea it could be a problem , said his fiancee , elizabeth lyle ms lyle recalled that she had asked the waitress about the wisdom of eating oysters in a month without an r , in violation of the adage 'we eat them all yearround here , ' ms lyle recalled the waitress as saying a health warning at the raw bar was not pointed out by the next morning , mr gregor was in an emergency room with a high fever a day later , he was in a coma it happened so quickly that i never had the chance to say any last words , said ms lyle , a teacher , who watched in horror as her intended husband with his merry blue eyes and rich storyteller s voice died 10 days after the lunch vibrio vulnificus is the worst of the pathogens linked to raw oysters , and it has not been found to cause illness in oysters outside the gulf the vast majority of people who become ill from raw oysters endure nothing as traumatic as mr gregor did and are reacting to more innocuous pathogens , primarily a group called norwalkrelated viruses these viruses , spread when sewage is dumped into the water , have sickened at least 440 people in four reported outbreaks in the last four years , causing flulike symptoms vomiting and diarrhea that pass in a day or two experts say they believe that thousands of other cases have gone unreported unlike oysters that are cooked to high heats , those served raw can contain pathogens ingested in the waters where they grow coastal states have instituted educational programs to prevent sickness but in the gulf , the problem is trickier the greatest hazard has nothing to do with pollution

starting next month residents of bellrose , floral park , floral park south and stewart manor will be able to turn on their television sets and see their government in action they will be joining other nassau county communities with designated stations the stations and some equipment , negotiated as part of longterm franchises with cablevision , allows the municipalities to create noncommercial programs how the towns use the stations depends on philosophy , expertise and finances unlike public access , which allows just about anyone with noncommercial issues on the air , municipal stations are for official use , include programs about fire and police departments , historical groups and education the first designated channel was in lynbrook , negotiated in 1981 with adamsrussell cable services of waltham , mass , which cablevision inc later bought with just a few channels in use , lynbrook was given three despite the embarrassment of riches , communications commissioner michael shindler said , lynbrook for many years did little more than run a 24hour calendar of events occasionally residents with camcorders would tape a fire department training program or even local news , but the village had no longrange plan it had to do a lot with village administration , which did n't see a big advantage in having the stations , mr shindler , an audio engineer for abctv , said but getting volunteers and people who know what they 're doing is also a problem three years ago , when a new administration was voted in , mayor eugene e scarpato decided to expand programming he began with the televising of board meetings live and reruns on weekends soon other events like the memorial day parade were shown in a storm last winter , mr shindler said , the mayor gave updates on road clearing or other information but when the town wanted to create a village electric company , mr scarpato used the station to promote the effort the proposal was approved by 15 votes , despite opposition from the long island lighting company when a family tragedy led to the cancellation of the televising of a board meeting , mr shindler said , residents called the village hall to complain mr shindler said there were few cost in having a station , except for videotape , because updated equipment was part of the renegotiated franchise agreement two and a half years ago in 1988 and 1989 , malverne moved , under its franchise accord with cablevision , to install a terminal at village hall to transmit messages to residents the village also began producing programs like our village , with mayor cathy hunt as host events like the christmas and hanukkah lightings , police blotter and an events calendar in 1991 , mayor joseph hennessy decided to televise board meetings mr hennessy , now a trustee , has become less enthusiastic about showing live board hearings although the telecasts have opened up participation , he said , people sometimes use the sessions as a sounding board for particular agendas sometimes , he said , the same people show up month after month they become the show mr hennessy said the three political parties in the village provided abundant bickering and grandstanding i was warned when i first started the station that people would be coming down hear to complain about everything , he said in some ways that has happened i do n't like being the wednesday night special pass the popcorn and put on channel 40 the wednesday night special now has a spinoff last month malverne expanded its programming again , introducing people s forum , which shows people who are voicing grievances to the trustees rockville centre also has a station , primarily for an events calendar with an occasional series about local government a spokesman for the village , james heany , said that new equipment would be needed to transmit live board meetings and that the village had a popular monthly newsletter , an annual report and a web site to inform residents four villages bellrose floral park , floral park south and stewart manor decided to share their station and programming mayor steven v corbett of floral park said the towns planned to have state , county and town representatives make bimonthly reports , as well as church and school programming the towns do not have plans to transmit board meetings a spokeswoman for cablevision said the villages with stations had established their franchises years ago with a limited number of stations available , she said , the utility would have to be assured that a community would spend the time and effort to make a dedicated station worthwhile huntington , the spokeswoman said , is the lone community to express interest in setting up a station tci , which covers brookhaven and several villages , said that none of those communities had their own stations and that none had expressed interest
washington , aug 4 far more than republicans from anywhere else in the country , house republicans from new york , new jersey and connecticut have been bucking their party s leadership to support legislation to overhaul the way federal elections are financed repeatedly in recent weeks , a significant majority of the 22 republican representatives from the three states have joined with democrats in votes that have kept alive the most sweeping of several campaign finance measures before the house that measure , sponsored by representatives christopher shays , a republican from connecticut , and martin t meehan , a democrat from massachusetts , passed a pivotal test on monday night as the house endorsed it by a 237to186 vote though it still faces several hurdles , the bill is expected to pass in the house later this week and be sent to the senate , where it is thought to have little chance of being approved in monday night s vote , 51 republicans defied their leaders in voting for the bill , and 15 of those came from new york , new jersey and connecticut only 11 democrats voted against the bill , and none of them came from those states the shaysmeehan bill would effectively ban soft money , the unlimited , unregulated donations to political parties , and restrict socalled issue advocacy commercials by outside organizations during the 60 days before an election political analysts and members of congress cited several reasons for the strong support among republicans in the region for the shaysmeehan bill , including a tradition of reform politics in all three states , unwavering support for the bill from the region s major editorial pages and concerns that democrats would use the issue in fall campaigns i think in this region voters are more sensitive to this issue than they are in other parts of the country , said representative michael p forbes , a new york republican who represents suffolk county and voted for the shaysmeehan bill it does n't rate high in polling but when you say to people , 'what do you say about money in politics \? ' they go crazy i think a lot of my colleagues in the region have heard this ann mcbride , president of common cause , the watchdog group , also said that many of the earliest and most stalwart republican supporters of the shaysmeehan bill come from the new york region , including representatives marge roukema of ridgewood , nj , nancy l johnson of new britain , conn , and amo houghton of corning , ny in interviews , almost all the republicans from the region who voted for the shaysmeehan bill said they would continue to defy their leadership and push for the bill in the coming days under the rules of the house , the shaysmeehan bill will be pitted against several other campaign finance measures this week the one that receives the most votes and is reapproved by the house will be sent to the senate it shows what the moderates can do when they band together , mr houghton said mr houghton and other republicans said they were not being pressured to switch their votes by republican leaders , who contend that the shaysmeehan bill would abridge citizens' first amendment right to contribute to campaigns and would unfairly undermine the party s current fundraising advantage over the democrats the republican supporters of the shaysmeehan bill said that one reason the house leadership might not have been vigorously twisting arms was that they were confident that the senate s republican leadership would kill the bill aides to senator trent lott , the majority leader , have said he does not plan to bring the senate version of shaysmeehan to the floor but some republicans were uncertain how they would vote right up until the last minute on monday , partly , it seems , because they were concerned about alienating their leaders representative rick a lazio , a new york republican who represents suffolk county and is a deputy whip , did not decide to vote for the bill until monday afternoon , becoming one of only a handful of members of the house republican leadership to support it some republicans , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said they expected the house leadership to become more active in opposing the shaysmeehan bill in the coming days , mainly by pressuring republicans to vote for an alternative bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of freshmen congressmen several republicans from the region who oppose the shaysmeehan bill , including two representatives from new york peter t king , who represents nassau county , and vito j fossella , who represents staten island said they might vote for the freshman bill whether their leadership asked them to or not i 'll vote for it to stop shays and meehan , mr king said i'm being open about my cynicism but it is the lesser of two evils and i have n't heard that from leadership
philadelphia , feb 18 reacting to criticism that philadelphia s police force is ineffective , sometimes corrupt and in dire need of new blood , mayor edward g rendell reached outside the city today and hired a new police commissioner , john f timoney , former first deputy commissioner in new york mr timoney , who was second in command on the new york force in 1995 and 1996 and helped carry out many of the street patrol programs and other efforts credited with sharply reducing that city s crime rates , will succeed richard neal mr neal resigned last week to become a private security consultant after struggling for five years to improve the performance of a 7 , 000officer force that has been troubled over the years by numerous accusations of brutality , graft and , particularly this year , ineptitude the latest accusations of ineptitude , still heard almost daily , stem from widespread dissatisfaction in the city with the police department s limited success in reducing crime rates , particularly the murder rate tha murder rate has been dropping sharply in most other major cities , especially new york , and philadelphia compared unfavorably the accusations also come from philadelphia residents who contend that the police department has been making only a halfhearted effort to rid the city of such everyday nuisances as panhandlers , graffiti and , more seriously , pursesnatchers and petty thieves so vocal and widespread has the complaining been that it was threatening to blemish the record of a mayor whose administration has otherwise been mostly praised for good management of a major american city in announcing the appointment of mr timoney to philadelphia s top police job , which pays 113 , 000 , mayor rendell called him perhaps the best available candidate in the nation to lead the police department here and to reclaim the city s rightful reputation as the best police department in the nation when you review commissioner timoney s record , the mayor continued , it is clear that he is wellversed in every aspect of police operations and , indeed , that he is a dynamic commander accepting the appointment effective march 9 , mr timoney promised results i guarantee you that , he said , adding that he would be a handson commissioner and that philadelphia police officers and residents would see him on the street day and night , walking the beat with officers and riding with them in their patrol cars i think the next 22 months are going to be a lot of fun , mr timoney said , alluding to the amount of time mayor rendell has left to serve in his second and final term mr timoney , 49 , spent 29 years with the new york police department and as first deputy commissioner was instrumental in redeploying its street patrols around the city to increase pressure on criminals , particularly drug dealers and others who victimize homeowners , shopkeepers and other ordinary citizens that redeployment , police experts say , was a major factor in the strikingly sharp decline in the city s crime rate in recent years mr timoney resigned in 1996 when mayor rudolph w giuliani chose fire commissioner howard safir to replace , william j bratton , as the police commissioner of new york city mr bratton subsequently became a parttime police adviser to mayor rendell and is said by city hall aides to have been instrumental in getting his former top aide hired mayor rendell had high praise today for mr neal , a 57yearold veteran of 36 years on the philadelphia force who has been hired as a security consultant by drexel university and the penn s landing corporation , a philadelphia development group mayor rendell , who has given some thought to running for governor and who has repeatedly denied finding mr neal another job to speed his departure and avoid further criticism of the city government , said the police commissioner had done good work in carrying out a comprehensive series of reform and deployment initiatives during mr neal s tenure as the city s top police officer , the city has been sorely embarrassed by a scandal involving physical abuse and money shakedowns by some officers none of it was ever linked to the commissioner and half a dozens officers were eventually convicted and some sent to prison the city has never been classified as one of america s more dangerous big cities but that was not the issue with mr neal s critics , some of whom have an eye on mayor rendell s job what they kept pointing out was that at a time when many major cities were enjoying a steady decrease in crime , in part because of the healthy national economy but also because of innovative and aggressive policing , philadelphia was a laggard in many areas , with its murder rate especially stubborn the critics said the force was a laggard in adopting modern technology , particularly computers they said the force was poorly trained and equipped and , most serious of all , they warned that unless the city charter was changed to permit the police commissioner to appoint and dismiss all top department managers , the force would remain trapped in a bureaucratic morass the police commissioner can now appoint and dismiss only his two deputies the rest of the force is protected by civil service regulations that are often restrictive
fire marshals spent yesterday slowly searching what was left of a row of brooklyn buildings in search of definitive clues to what caused a fivealarm blaze that killed a fire lieutenant and left a fire captain severely burned and clinging to life , fire officials said the injured captain , scott lapiedra , 40 , of staten island , was in critical condition last night at jacobi medical center in the bronx with second and thirddegree burns over more than 70 percent of his body his wife , addie , was just asking people to pray for him today , said deputy fire commissioner michael regan he s as strong as an ox fire officials said scores of firefighters streamed through jacobi medical center yesterday as captain lapiedra s family held vigil all of us in the department are praying for him , said firefighter elbert washington , a fire department spokesman there s an extreme danger of infection it s a matter of time we 're hoping for improvement investigators picked through the charred remains of the threestory , wood and brick cityowned apartment building at 2530 atlantic avenue in east new york , which burst into flames friday night no occupants of the building were hurt , but the blaze spread to three adjacent buildings and took more than 220 firefighters more than four hours to bring under control fire officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they suspect the fire started in a mattress in the apartment building about 8 20 pm but firefighter washington said yesterday that fire marshals had not announced a definitive cause of the blaze the extent of the damage was complicating the investigation , he said you had three buildings that were destroyed , he said given the number of buildings that were involved , combined with the gathering of physical evidence , it s not unusual for it to take this long fire officials said funeral services would be held wednesday for lieut james w blackmore , 48 , who died of a heart attack in the fire in addition to captain lapiedra , five other firefighters injured in the blaze remained hospitalized with second and thirddegree burns and other injuries yesterday , fire officials said none of their injuries was considered life threatening lieutenant blackmore , captain lapiedra and the other firefighters were injured when they rushed onto the second floor of the burning apartment building after a woman told them her elderly mother was trapped there as the firefighters searched for the missing woman , the second floor collapsed , dropping them into a raging fire other firefighters dragged the injured men from the building the missing woman , it was later discovered , had already escaped the wake for lieutenant blackmore will be held today and tomorrow at the mccourt trudden funeral home at 385 main street in farmingdale , ny his funeral will be held on wednesday at 11 am at st kilian roman catholic church at 485 conklin street in farmingdale
in keeping with his campaign promises , mayor rudolph giuliani has given new yorkers strict law enforcement ordinary citizens get ticketed for jaywalking taxi drivers and street vendors are under close scrutiny from the new york city police department given such enforcement policies , mr giuliani and the police have been troublingly quiet about the drunken brawl staged by new york city firefighters last week at the bryant park grill the melee included between 50 and 100 uniformed firefighters who trashed the restaurant , harassed patrons , exposed themselves and fought for five hours despite a wealth of witnesses , the only person arrested was the restaurant s bouncer if mayor giuliani wants to keep his credibility , he needs to condemn the rioters openly and make sure there is no double standard for publicsafety employees who brawl in public our bet is that if 50 to 100 plumbers , lawyers or schoolteachers tore up a restaurant , they would be denounced in press conferences and arrested by the score the disorder at the bryant park grill followed a celebration in which the mayor praised the firefighters for risking their lives for their fellow citizens the first accounts of the brawl indicated that about 40 firefighters had drunk too much and gotten rowdy in the restaurant but a quick pass by city investigators showed that the number of firefighters involved might actually have approached 100 and that the situation was worse than initially reported mayor giuliani gives regular new yorkers an earful when they misbehave but so far this year there has been no more flagrant breach of his civility campaign an official said mr giuliani had kept quiet out of respect for the family of another firefighter who died in the line of duty two days after the brawl that show of respect is proper , but it cannot become an excuse for letting so many laws be so flagrantly violated without a strong investigative and prosecutorial response over the weekend , law enforcement officials raised the troubling possibility that none of the firefighters would be criminally charged but would face departmental charges instead today the police department was talking about pursuing the investigation wherever it leads , and that sounds better new yorkers will be understandably perplexed if there is a loophole in the mayor s civility campaign big enough to drive a busload of brawling firefighters through

birmingham , ala , jan 29 in what is believed to be the first fatal bombing of an abortion clinic in the united states , an offduty police officer was killed and a nurse critically wounded in a blast early today at a clinic on birmingham s south side the explosion at the new woman , all women health care clinic , long a target of protesters , went off at about 7 30 am , just as the clinic was opening , said the city s police chief , wm coppage the bomb , believed to have been a small homemade device planted somewhere just outside the front of the clinic , killed robert d sanderson , 35 , an eightyear police veteran who was working part time as a guard at the clinic the blast also badly injured emily lyons , a 41yearold nurse who was opening the clinic ms lyons , in surgery all day today , was wounded in one eye and her face , and both legs were seriously injured investigators refused to comment on what , if any , suspects they have a regular protester at the clinic was taken in for questioning , but was released chief coppage said there were no threats or warnings at the clinic , which is within a block of two university of alabama at birmingham college dormitories , a daycare center , an apartment for parents of critically ill children and some restaurants we deplore this despicable incident , mayor richard arrington jr said if the bomb had gone off just a few minutes later , another employee at the clinic , lisa hermes , might have been one of the casualties mrs hermes , a counselor there , was about a block away , driving to the clinic with her husband , terry , when they heard the blast when mrs hermes stepped from the car in front of the building , she just said , oh my god officer sanderson and ms lyons , who investigators said had been near the bomb , lay in pools of blood and on broken glass mr hermes , who ran to the clinic , said he saw that the officer s body had been badly mangled and called to his wife across the street , do n't come across although five people have been killed by gunfire at abortion clincs since 1993 , officer sanderson was apparently the first person to die in the bombing of a clinic , said federal agents with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , and vicki saporta , executive director of the national abortion federation , based in washington as we have continually said , clinics cannot continue to be bombed and burned without someone getting hurt , ms saporta said it is with a heavy heart that we have now witnessed the grave truth of those words more than 100 investigators searched the crime scene for pieces of the bomb the investigation was slowed because the authorities were afraid there might be a second bomb , as there had been in the bombing of an abortion clinic last year in atlanta on jan 16 , 1997 , two bombs shook an office building containing northside family planning services , a women s clinic that performed abortions the first bomb blew through an outside wall of the atlanta clinic as investigators , firefighters and reporters milled around the building about an hour later , a second bomb that had been hidden in a corner of an adjoining parking lot exploded , injuring six people investigators said the first bomb , the weaker of the two , was intended to draw people to the scene , and the second bomb was intended to maim or kill investigators have said they believe those bombs were linked to the bombing of a lesbian nightclub just a few weeks later , and the blast that killed one person and injured 100 at centennial olympic park during the 1996 summer olympic games federal agents from atlanta rushed to birmingham at this stage of the game , we do n't know if there is a connection , said bill king , an atf agent in atlanta but other agents said the simple fact of proximity atlanta and birmingham are only 125 miles apart was reason enough to suspect a link counting today , there have been 199 attacks including nonfatal bombings on abortion clinics since 1982 , when the atf started to track them clinic workers in birmingham had feared some kind of attack in connection with the 25th anniversary of roe v wade , the landmark supreme court decision on abortion more than 500 people demonstrated here last week , outside this clinic and others , without violence michele wilson , a sociology professor at the university of alabama at birmingham , is a member of alabamians for choice , which helps women find and get to clinics like the one that was bombed we 're so angry , ms wilson said the press has n't done anything to report the bombings in the past it s been a page seven story but birmingham is getting a lot of attention now because of the death people continually block , scream , lie and terrorize the patients it happens at every clinic students who lived near the clinic said protests were common none of them expected this some 300 students were evacuated from dormitories after the blast shook the walls maegan walker , an 18yearold freshman at the university of alabama at birmingham , called it an awakening to the threat the clinic workers live with they say abortion is murder , miss walker said what do they they think they did to that police officer \? president clinton called the bombing an unforgivable act , and activists on both sides of the abortion issue rushed to condemn it the national right to life committee , while supporting peaceful protest , also condemned the bombing people active in the abortion rights movement said the constant picketing at the clinics fosters an environment of hatred that leads to violence the birmingham officer was the sixth person to die by violence at abortion clinics since 1993 dr david gunn , a doctor who performed abortions in pensacola , fla , was murdered by michael griffith , an abortion protester , in march 1993 in july 1994 , also in pensacola , dr john britton and his escort , james barrett , were shot to death by paul hill , another protester in december 1994 , shannon lowney and leanne nichols , receptionists at a brookline , mass , clinic , were murdered by another protester , john salvi photos two unidentified women embraced

it was the big one , the storm everyone expected but hoped would never happen a category 3 hurricane , similar to the devastating one of 1938 , was churning up the atlantic coast , heading for long island emergency managers and other officials were on the phones , ordering evacuations from coastal areas , opening shelters and preparing the island s 27 million people for winds of more than 110 miles an hour the hurricane s timing was ominous it would strike on the labor day holiday when the moon was one day past full the date was sept 7 , 1998 the storm was just a desktop drill , called by the federal emergency management agency and carried out last month in nassau , suffolk , new york city and westchester , several upstate counties , six states and four canadian provinces but with the 1998 atlantic hurricane season due to begin june 1 , these drills have perhaps never been more prudent william m gray of colorado state university , regarded by meteorologists as the country s leading hurricane forecaster , is warning that a period of more frequent and more intense atlantic hurricanes has arrived the prediction , based on atmospheric , water temperature and water current conditions , is for the atlantic basin , a vast area that includes the midatlantic states and long island dr gray said the new period began in 1995 , when a long hiatus from active hurricane seasons lasting from the late 1960 s ended in the busiest threeyear period for hurricanes on record years of more frequent hurricanes now lie ahead , he said last year s uneventful atlantic hurricane season , dr gray and other meteorologists said , was a result in part of el nino , the pacific ocean warming phenomenon that affected global weather this year they said el nino produced upperlevel winds that blocked hurricane development in the atlantic by shearing off the tops of developing tropical storms but with the most powerful el nino ever recorded now fading , dr gray said , these hurricaneblocking benefits will all but vanish by august , when the most active part of the hurricane season begins as a soontoarrive la nina cools pacific waters that heated up during el nino , conditions for hurricane activity in the atlantic will improve further , he said dr gray said the 1998 season would be near the historic average he forecast 10 named tropical storms , 6 of which would become hurricanes , including 2 intense ones rainfall in the sahel region of africa could change that prediction , which will be updated in june wet weather in the sahel is closely linked to the formation of tropical storms in the atlantic but dr gray is forecasting a more active season for 1999 as el nino fully dissipates warmer atlantic ocean temperatures and western winds favorable to hurricanes will increase activity further , he said dr gray s longerterm forecast for a new period of more atlantic hurricanes takes account of what he said was a naturally occurring periodic change in an ocean circulation system called the atlantic ocean conveyor what is happening now , he said , is an increased southern movement of denser , more saline sea water that sank to deeper levels its movement is causing a compensating northern flow of warmer surface water from the south warmer water sustains tropical storms and hurricanes on long island , emergency management and planners assume water temperatures are too low in the north atlantic to sustain a catastrophic category 4 or 5 hurricane heading for long island they said a category 3 storm was the maximum that could be expected or planned for but none discounted the possibility of a stronger storm everyone is prepared to the level they can be , said david h fischler , the commissioner of fire rescue and emergency services for suffolk county he said a category 3 hurricane making landfall on the south shore barrier islands would create a tidal surge that would overwash the entire beach emergency plans , he said , are designed to save lives , not property our planning involves tracking the storm and making the decision to get people out of out of vulnerable areas and sheltering them , he said then mother nature is going to do what mother nature does charles t hamilton , the regional supervisor for natural resources for the new york state department of environmental conservation , said a state agreement between the army corps of engineers provided that any breaches a hurricane opened on the barrier islands would be closed within 72 hours he said the department had also stockpiled sand to deal with problems like a washover near shinnecock inlet on the westhampton barrier island last month if we have a 4 or a 5 , all bets are off , he said then you are dealing with a catastrophic event ray e cowman , the department s long island regional director , said emergency plans were in place and had proven effective in protecting people but beyond that , if you are talking about what can be done from a physical standpoint , there is n't much we are going to do between now and hurricane season , he said whatever status we are in now is the status we will be in when the hurricane hits
americans should be saving like crazy baby boomers the oldest in the group of 78 million who were born between 1946 and 1964 are due to retire in a decade or so are now in their prime earning years the aftertax return on investments has rarely been better and the proliferation of 401 \( k \) plans , individual retirement accounts and other taxfavored saving plans has made thrift more painless than ever instead , americans are saving less than ever indeed , according to the latest government figures , consumers have recently been spending all of their incomes and then some in september , the personal saving rate slipped below zero for the first time since the great depression october was more of the same on the surface the reason seems perverse economists say the better people feel about their situations these days the less likely they are to set aside extra for the future the seemingly imperturbable stock market , strong confidence in the economy and the ease of borrowing all make consumers feel richer and less inclined to postpone gratification some experts warn of dire consequences , but the situation may not be as bad as it looks despite the drop in personal savings , the broadest measure of saving the national saving rate , which includes not just households but corporations and the government sector has rebounded from its low in the early 1990 s we have a lot of saving now compared to then , said gary burtless , an economist at the brookings institution investment in the nation s capital base certainly has not suffered foreigners have happily sent america their extra savings and seem inclined to continue to do so besides , with asia and latin america mired in recessions that threaten to spread , americans' grasshopper habits may at least for now be more boon than bane this is not the time to tell people to stop spending , said gregory mankiw , an economics professor at harvard finally , the fear that consumers will react to the recent orgy of spending by slamming on the brakes and suddenly turning thrifty seems overblown consumers are not as stretched as the saving numbers make it look wage and salary income is going up faster , not more slowly , than spending , and that is what most households rely on one reason the official savings rate is falling is that interest income , which goes mainly to the rich , has shrunk , dragging down overall reported income gains but most forecasters agree that each individual s own income , job situation , wealth and confidence loom far larger in household spending decisions of course , many americans are passing up a chance to get back 2 in eight years for every 1 they save today that may seem irrational , even for welloff citizens of a wealthy country the standard neoclassical view that people make rational tradeoffs between present and future and that we 're saving the amount that best suits our purpose is obviously wrong , said robert frank , an economist at cornell whose new book , luxury fever , argues that americans ought to save 20 percent of their incomes moreover , what is good \( or at least acceptable \) for the nation is not necessarily what is best for the joneses even optimists concede that one to twothirds of babyboomer households are not saving enough to maintain in retirement the life styles to which they are accustomed still , many economists say that focusing on the plunge in personal savings is a bit misleading for one thing , the personal saving rate is one of the government s least reliable statistics that is because saving is the difference between two very large quantities , overall personal income and overall personal spending minuscule changes in either can produce huge changes in the savings rate moreover , revisions based on more complete data sometimes alter the initial impression left by the published statistics for example , a rigorously researched 1987 paper , cowritten by lawrence h summers , now deputy treasury secretary but then teaching at harvard , attributed half of the drop in national saving at that point to a decline in household savings but subsequent revisions of the national income accounts showed that the decline they cited had not actually occurred it is even harder to interpret the data in a period when households , especially wealthy ones , are reporting big investment profits in the form of capital gains last summer , the government started subtracting capital gains , which are not part of gross domestic product , from personal income that change , which reflects a shift in accounting practices rather than any real change in behavior , sliced two percentage points off the published saving rate none of this is to deny that there have been real changes in savings as well as stock prices have risen , lifting the value of assets held by pension funds , corporations have cut contributions to defined benefit pension funds , which pay a set amount based on salary and years of service with more profit on their investments , corporations do not need to set as much aside to meet their obligations pensions are counted as household saving john sabelhouse , a congressional budget office economist , attributes about half the decline in the personal saving rate to the slowdown in pension contributions then , too , consumers have been spending part of their capital gains , especially on bigticket items like houses , furniture and cars \( although not as large a part as historical experience would suggest \) more of them have been borrowing , too the downandout banker in tom wolfe s recent best seller a man in full , ray peepgas , is maxed out on 18 credit cards and does not know how he will make it through the weekend unless another one arrives in the morning mail he is a perfect symbol of the credit revolution of the last five years that has allowed borrowers who previously might have been forced to stop running up debt to keep on spending and credit companies have learned to tailor interest charges so that , while worse risks may have to pay higher rates , they can still usually get credit the big fear is that many baby boomers will wind up working a lot longer than they expected because they failed to save enough for retirement although experts cannot agree on what fraction of baby boomers is headed for trouble , estimates range from one to twothirds and everyone agrees that middleclass , middleaged americans ought to be more worried about the future than they appear to be for all the concerns , however , americans seem better prepared for retirement than the citizens of most other countries the net financial worth of american households equals nearly four times their income , double that of german households some economists have taken to saying that the saving rate is not as important as they used to think if all we did is jack up the saving rate , the economy would n't look that different , said robert hall at the hoover institution in palo alto , calif in any case , the dire predictions of the past have not materialized interest payments have not in fact ballooned american managers proved more efficient at deploying savings than their foreign counterparts the rates of return on american investments abroad are far higher than those on foreign investments in the united states there s no question that as a nation , we 'd be better off if we saved more , professor mankiw said but it s not like the day of reckoning is around the corner graph mixed signals tracks saving in the united states as a percent of gnp \( source council of economic advisers \)
kanata , ontario , april 28 rocked hard again tonight by the ottawa senators , the reeling devils might soon get rolled out of the stanley cup playoffs , perhaps as early as game 5 thursday night back in the meadowlands the senators , the eighth and lastseeded team in the eastern conference , beat the conference champions , 43 , to take a threegamestoone lead in their firstround series daniel alfredsson scored three goals for the underdog senators , who were boosted by a roaring capacity crowd in the corel center the devils made the score respectable and may have generated some momentum for game 5 when they scored two goals in the final six minutes and almost tied it with about a minute left on that play , doug gilmour , who scored one of the comeback goals and now has four for the series , had the puck on his stick with another great chance as he stood alone in front of goalie damian rhodes but rhodes made the save with his chest we 'll see what we are made of , gilmour said afterward we 've just got to make sure the next game is ours he and several teammates seemed to lose their poise at times in the middle of the din here gilmour took two unnecessary penalties but the late surge by the devils gave them hope while it is difficult for a team to rally from a 31 deficit in a fourofsevengame series , it most often happens in the first round , when lowly teams get an early edge against a favorite before squandering it now , we are the underdogs , goalie martin brodeur said coach jacques lemaire , cool and composed afterward , discussed what it was like to make mistakes during a postseason slump , the same kind of slump that victimized the devils last year , when the rangers stunned them in the second round of the playoffs it s like we 're playing with fire , lemaire said things are going well , and something happens i do n't think anyone is panicking for sure , it will be tough i ca n't say it is an easy task what is important for the devils is to win the next game i do n't know if we are a little tight or what they certainly seemed that way one of their worst errors , in the first period , set up alfredsson s first goal the culprit was defenseman scott stevens , usually a rocksteady captain , whose long pass across the neutral zone was stolen by alfredsson , who scored on a breakaway at 16 minutes 20 seconds of the first period that tied the score at 11 , erasing the early lead denis pederson had given the devils by scoring on a shorthanded breakaway at 6 33 in the second period , with the senators leading by 21 on alfredsson s goal , stevens took a slashing penalty in retaliation for an undetected provocation , putting his team down two skaters although an ottawa penalty a few seconds later cut the power play to one man , the senators took a 31 lead on a goal by jason york when the second period ended , brodeur left the ice slamming his stick against the glass and boards it s tough , brodeur said nothing works on our side , and it gets to you at some point the frustration is pretty hard you do n't want to go back to your own building , first seed , down 31 it s happened now when reporters began to question stevens after the game , he abruptly ended the discussion by bolting down the corridor when he did n't like the direction of the interrogation his teammates discussed poise , and lack thereof , among the group if there s a department we can improve , it s the discipline and composure , bobby holik said turn the other cheek another department needing improvement is goal scoring holik has no goals this series and none over 20 games , going back into the regular season he led the devils in goals this season with 29 he had five shots tonight , including two from pointblank range after alfredsson s third goal put the senators up by 41 early in the third period , stevens began the comeback at 14 04 by scoring on along , fluky shot from center ice after the devils got a late power play , they pulled brodeur for an extra attacker and gilmour scored at 18 41 by banking a puck off a senator in front of rhodes back in the lineup tonight for the devils was brendan morrison , who played in game 2 and brings a dimension of offensive creativity that the devils have lacked also dressed was patrick elias , who had played in game 3 after missing the first two scratched forwards were jay pandolfo , petr sykora and sergei brylin along with defensmen sheldon souray and brad bombardir asked about his lineup for game 5 , lemaire said i will make other changes among the devils with no shots tonight was dave andreychuk , the slumping wing he also turned the puck over in the neutral zone , leading to alfredsson s second goal one of the best devils was krzysztof oliwa , a rookie fighting master from poland he skated well , put three shots on goal , flattened several senators with nasty checks and created the devils' final power play by provoking lance pitlick into a oneparticipant fight we just have no luck , oliwa said i think we 're playing better we have to bear down on our chances we 'll never give up photos ottawa celebrating jason york s goal the faster senators carried play , despite a late devils flurry \( associated press \) \( pg c1 \) ottawa goalie damian rhodes stopped 31 of 34 devils shots last night , including this sprawling save against new jersey forward bobby

perane , serbia , dec 21 yugoslav forces and ethnic albanian rebels seem to be goading each other into a major new round of fighting , with the people of kosovo and western countries able to do little more than watch military and police units have been on the move in the last few days long convoys , including tanks and armored personnel carriers , are leaving bases where the government had promised that their forces would remain and are putting men in new positions or taking territory from the rebels the rebels , who moved into many areas vacated by the serbs in october , are stepping up the recruiting and training of fighters and are obtaining large amounts of military gear , according to diplomats in the last week eight serbs have been slain serbs are convinced that the rebels are responsible , and many are threatening to take their revenge against ethnic albanian civilians the supreme commander of nato , gen wesley c clark , and senior american diplomats went to belgrade today to tell top yugoslav officials to rein in their forces but many western diplomats in yugoslavia say they doubt that they can stop renewed combat on a large scale , even though it had been believed that the harsh balkan winter would prevent any new conflict the chief western diplomat in kosovo , william walker , an american , is more optimistic than others still , he said there was not much the west could do except try to persuade the rebels and the government to act peacefully i hope no one is overestimating the tools at our disposal , mr walker said we do n't have many in a month or so , as many as 2 , 000 international observers are scheduled to be on the ground in kosovo , monitoring each side and trying to ease tensions now , however , there is a question whether war will erupt before most monitors are in place a senior western diplomat , referring to the rebelrun kosovo liberation army , said the government s decided enough is enough the kla is out of control if the government responds the way it seems to be getting ready to do , then the monitors will have to get out because there 'll be war everywhere today in this village , six tanks were involved in combat with rebel forces that recently moved into the area the tanks left their base over the weekend for what the government called a training exercise new rebel trenches have been set up on the hills around the fighting the fighting here , along with the appearance today of heavily armed serbian paramilitary policemen on the roads nearby , comes after a police official was shot to death as he walked to work this morning in a neighboring town none of this was supposed to happen after president slobodan milosevic , under threat of nato air strikes , agreed to stop offensive operations and withdraw many of his forces from kosovo in october diplomats , led by americans , thought that if the government halted their attacks , the rebels would honor a ceasefire , allowing negotiations but negotiations have made little progress most ethnic albanians , who make up more than 90 percent of kosovo s population , want independence the government is offering limited autonomy , and ethnic albanian political leaders are deeply divided over what level of autonomy would be acceptable rebel leaders generally feel that they can win independence through war on saturday , when the body of the deputy mayor of kosovo polje , a serb , was found by the roadside shot to death , miroslav mijailovic , one of the 1 , 000 or so residents of the village of velika hoca , was welcoming guests to his home the serbian family was giving its annual homage to its patron , st nicholas dishes of potatoes , sweet peppers , cabbage rolls , fish and cookies nearly overflowed the long table as people tried to find solace in talk of religion and tradition but it did not work , because they said they could feel kosovo sliding quickly into war the people are not to blame for what is coming , not the serb people or the albanian , mr mijailovic said everyone wants what we had before , peace but there are leaders on both sides who are setting a fire historically , serbs and ethnic albanians have been very close in the area of western kosovo near velika hoca but now , the guests said , they are terrified by rebel fighters they see on the hills around the village the two peoples were so close that one guest , the serbian mayor of the city of orahovac , three miles away , said one of his best friends was the man who is now the rebel commander for the area when he started his chicken farm , he came to me for the money to buy the first load of chicken feed , said the mayor , andjelko kolasinac we are at the limits of our patience , mr kolasinac said the west must put enough pressure on the kla that they stop what they are doing otherwise what i see coming will not be stopped when the government has taken action against the rebels in the past , it has usually been so brutal that it has only increased the conviction among ethnic albanians that they must create their own country a large military offensive over the summer forced as many as 300 , 000 ethnic albanians to flee their homes government forces then looted and burned an estimated 20 , 000 houses it was the prospect of mass starvation and deaths caused by exposure in the balkan winter that prompted western countries to intercede so that refugees could feel safe enough to move back to their villages but even now , in response to the rebel actions , government forces often brutalize ethnic albanians after the funerals last wednesday of six young serbs shot in a coffee shop in the city of pec , the police went on a rampage for several days , arresting and severely beating dozens of ethnic albanian men many victims said they had not even been questioned about the killings , only beaten at the same time , government forces retook a nearby village , causing hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to flee the area as his children packed clothes , blankets and bags of flour and a red kerosene lantern into a wagon behind the family tractor in the village , called glodanje , nysret maloku echoed the appeal serbs are making to western countries you must stop these attacks on us , he said we want peace , but we want to survive and just as serbs are insisting that government forces be unleashed against the rebels , mr maloku said he wanted the kosovo liberation army to strike back at the government they have to protect us from the regime , he said any army is supposed to protect its people map of kosova showing

columbus , ohio , feb 16 wearing the annoyed look of a man recalling a halfforgotten enemy , paul ward , a retired accountant , put down his shopping bag at the mall and pondered whether america should bomb iraq if the united states could put an end to the leadership of president saddam hussein , mr ward said , he was all for it should have been done right the first time , mr ward said , contending that the united states could have driven mr hussein from power during the persian gulf war in 1991 but if we 're going to do it , let s do it right none of this fiddlefaddling around i do n't want to see them bomb and then a few years down the road , he s back at us let s go in and get it done with secretary of state madeleine k albright and defense secretary william s cohen scheduled to hold a town meeting here on wednesday on possible military strikes against iraq , the people in columbus have been weighing their sentiments on war and peace in talks with dozens of people at a shopping mall , it is plain that the people here , a largely whitecollar region of one million people , have been following the accounts of the standoff with iraq , which center on the iraqi leader s refusal to allow inspection of weapons sites , and grappling with hard choices while most people seem to believe the united states should take action against iraq , there is plenty of doubt , and almost universal exasperation that american forces might once again be placed in harm s way you wonder , 'is it really worth american lives \? ' asked kelly armstrong , a 28yearold barber , as he carried his sixmonthold son but if we do n't do something now , then there s going to be a lot more lives lost later on no matter what their stance on military action , almost everyone says they have grown weary of the image of a dangerous despot tweaking the united states he s just like a little bully on the playground , said walter cain , a 61yearold social worker he s kicking sand in our face , and we 've got to do something about it we ca n't just let him get away with it that same sense of outrage , and strong demand for american respect , rang as a familar theme among people who supporter military action immediately i'm really mad we 've waited so long , said renee moos , a 35yearold cosmetics clerk , complaining that the united states looks weak if it does not act in the strongest way possible they should go in and get it done now we ca n't just let this go on and on while gallup polls in midjanuary and again in early february showed americans divided over whether to use military action against iraq , the surveys indicated that support for an armed attack is growing still , there is plenty of anguish over what course to follow , and some voices that say america should stay out of the middle east i'm not sure it s the american people s responsibility to take care of a place so far away , said liji zhao , 33 , who stays at home to care for two children this view is shared by jodi bacon , a 36yearold mother of four children , who pushed a stroller through the mall she noted that arab allies are unwilling to help , and said some countries would condemn military aciton by the united states if we take a really aggressive stance , the reaction around the world against america will be negative , ms bacon said we need to be careful what other countries think the world s getting smaller , and we depend on each other more the last time the united states prepared to take military action against saddam hussein , steven leist , a young college student , traveled to washington to protest against it but mr leist , now a 27yearold clothing store worker , said he has become convinced that bombs should be dropped on iraq i used to be very idealistic , and i thought you could reform people , said mr leist , who had been a theater and english major at ohio state university during the persian gulf war but this guy is insane and he needs to be gotten rid of many people said they wished there were a way for american intelligence forces to covertly topple president hussein so innnocent lives might be spared among both iraqis and american troops the poor people of iraq they do n't have much of a say in all this , said dimitri karmagiannis , 38 , who works in computer operations they 've got machine guns at their backs for all the talk in washington about whether the sex scandal in the white house would color the iraq situation , almost nobody here mentioned it the one or two people who did talk about it did so almost flippantly , dismissing the notion that president clinton s decisionmaking would be affected by it the problem with iraq was on the drawing board long before anyone heard of monica lewinsky , said byron peasley , a 55yearold banker , so i do n't think it s fair to link the two mr peasley , who gives mr clinton high marks for his handling of the economy , said the president had been mostly untested on international matters this would be his biggest action on the world scene , he said , and i'm not entirely confident in his ability to handle international affairs to eric duhlen , a 25yearold music store worker , there are no good paths to follow in the standoff with iraq it s kind of a nowin situation , said mr duhlen , his arms crossing his chest if he s got these terrible weapons , we ca n't just ignore it , and let him go but everybody knows that when the bombs start falling , he s going to be safe somewhere and then he s going to come out , and still be in power nancy ward , the wife of the retired accountant , said she had hoped after the gulf war that mr hussein would eventually lose power now she believes the united states must crush his military sanctions and diplomacy and all that , they do n't always work , said mrs ward , a 66yearold bookkeeper how long were we waiting for castro to fall from power \? and he s still there photos should have been done right the first time paul ward a retired accountant you wonder , 'is it really worth american lives \?

music productions labels are looking for a developed , polished sound and confident , competent musicians gone are the days when record companies discovered artists and developed and nurtured them over time today , they want the quick buck , they want an almostfinished product gig lizzie provides services for a fee , plus a percentage , ranging from 7 to 40 percent , of what the artist earns from material released commercially that the company has represented nova music productions is more like a giant clearinghouse of musicindustry resources for musicians interested in producing their own limitedrun cd s , usually in batches of 10 , 000 the idea , mr nova said , is to establish a track record on your own before signing with a major record label mr nova , a musician who has also been in business for about six months , directs artists through a network of 150 affiliated companies , getting discounted bulk rates on their services his rates vary , he said , depending on what the

, she said i'm an indie girl , and did n't know how to promote myself but michael found me and became a fullservice consultant to my career , with radio promotion , advising on booking gigs and general coaching , pilley said and he s shopping me to major labels he s doing an amazing job getting me heard he s gotten me much farther than the other losers i 've worked with not everyone is as impressed i 've never heard of anything like it , but i'm skeptical , said craig marks , executive editor at spin magazine i 'd be wary of giving all that artistic control to the company , not to mention a piece of your longterm career artists would have to be careful not to become indentured servants charlie walk , senior vice president of columbia records , said the concept , also new to him , is great in theory for someone trying to get their music heard it s good to seek professional advice , mr walk said , and some people need someone to mold and direct them , and explain what the music business is really like still , he cautioned , it s a little scary seeing this we 're getting into dangerous territory here springsteen and dylan needed no packaging some great stars were found in the back of a club debbie southwoodsmith , artist and repertory director at am records , was harsher it s not real , you 're creating a product what s appealing about music is people who struggle to have their songs be heard or else they 're natural stars , larger than life , you 're just drawn to them a good demo absolutely helps , she said , but it s the music that has to be good it s also about attitude , and that goes way beyond nice photos and expensive clothes and great haircuts it s about exuding something that says , 'ooh , these guys could be stars ! ' even so , mr oehler found his music industry experience more than a little amazing all i 'd done before was some busking in idaho , he said now i'm going home with voice coaching , a master demo and cassettes with a cover , contacts in the industry and real promotion in my career and to think people back home think new yorkers are strange foreigners photo we 're like a beauty salon for musicians , says gig lizzie s owner , lizzie bowman , advising andrew jonah of the rap group taboo \( vic delucia the new york times \) chart career counseling seeking fame a compex trek mountain mike oehler recently went through a 2 , 000 , fourday crash course , paid for by the british broadcasting corporation , at gig lizzie on west 30th street in manhattan saturday 9 am1 pm breathing exercises , voice coaching , rehearsing and choosing four songs for demo tape 13pm arranging music 38 pm recording three 24track songs for demo tape shot of whiskey , glass of beer , travelin' on , and peanut butter and honey sunday 11 am5 pm mixing and mastering demo tape with gig lizzie s audio director , kenny feinberg monday noon1 pm photo session for cassette cover there was talk of styling me , mr oehler says but i quoted thoreau 'beware of all enterprises that require new clothes' they did n't even get me to comb my hair 1 pm demo tape and other materials sent by messenger to road runner records in greenwich village , which decides against a recording contract 48 pm intense coaching and moral support for tonight s gig 99 30 pm performance at dark star lounge on west 72d street it went really well , mr oehler said it s great training in new york , and i got to meet a record industry lawyer there , which was very helpful tuesday noon2 30 pm briefing by gig lizzie staff before meeting with mark schulte at palmetto records , a jazz and folk label in the village 33 30 pm meeting with mr schulte he said he s definitely considering me , mr oehler said
at a little past 7 tonight , todd hundley will jog to the outfield grass of shea stadium , where he will play somewhere other than behind home plate for the first time in his major league career the view , hundley said earlier this week , will be different from anything he has experienced in his first eight seasons with the mets but the sight of hundley , in uniform and in the lineup regardless of where he is playing , can only be heartening to a stumbling mets team that is 1321 since june 1 and could fall right out of postseason contention soon unless things turn around as john franco , the senior leader in the clubhouse and the loser again last night , said we 've been missing something and now we have our leader back he s been our leader on the field when he was catching every day and when he was gone , nobody had the kind of presence like todd does his presence here should help us immediately , even if it might not make a couple of guys happy because of playing time those guys would be bernard gilkey , brian mcrae and butch huskey , the mets' starting outfielders , none of whom have hit enough this season to justify fulltime employment in the lineup and all of whom may take turns sitting to make room for hundley but a bigger concern is whether hundley s presence in the outfield will lead to longterm happiness for both hundley and his fellow allstar catcher mike piazza , who has taken over hundley s role behind the plate it is one thing to hypothesize about potential ways the mets could keep hundley and piazza happy together in the same lineup for years to come , with hundley playing in the outfield and giving piazza a rest behind the plate on certain days and piazza playing behind the plate and taking a breather now and then at first base that kind of scenario is apparently being embraced by mets decisionmakers , the people who will ultimately have to agree on how much to offer piazza , a free agent at season s end , to stay in new york but what happens this august , or next april , if piazza makes a few mistakes behind the plate and the rumbling begins that hundley should be catching and piazza should be playing in the field \? those kind of mutterings almost seem inevitable , and it would thus be understandable if piazza might feel a little wary of resigning with the mets , for fear of having to look over his shoulder all the time still , piazza said yesterday that i'm not worried at all about that i just concentrate on doing the best i can , he said i ca n't be preoccupied with reading the papers or worrying about what s said you just have to block it all out mets general manager steve phillips put his own positive spin on things , saying every quote i 've read from mike indicates that he is willing and open to figuring out a way to make it work and whereas hundley has made some statements about wanting to catch again next season , i also feel there is a way to make it work , phillips said how that gets divided is not completely clear right now , the general manager added but i think we can make it work with both guys on the team and i think they both think there is a way to make it work all those things we still need to figure out but there is a way to keep everyone sharp and hungry and healthy and there is enough playing time to go around to make it work how and where it is broken down , we have to figure out but i have a general , not a specific , sense of how it works because piazza has a say in his future in any negotiations with the mets , the assumption has always been that he would remain the mets' no 1 catcher if he stays in new york the fact that hundley , who underwent reconstructive surgery on his right elbow last september , is still a question mark physically and might be better off for good at a less stressful position than catcher , has only added to the belief that piazza ranks first right now , we just do n't know if todd will be able to catch because of an elbow situation that bothers him when he makes snap throws , manager bobby valentine said , referring to the discomfort hundley sometimes experiences when throwing from behind the plate hundley , however , thinks that he will be able to catch again , if not this year and so there are all those indications from within the organization that there should be a diplomatic way to divide the playing time in the future so that hundley does not feel frozen out from ever playing catcher again for now , the mets will simply hope that hundley s crash course in outfield play will keep him from embarrassing himself on defense and that he will be able to hit with enough power to put a little more life in an oftenquiet mets lineup phillips said yesterday he also hoped that hundley s return to the lineup might actually take a little pressure off piazza , who has hit for average with the mets , but not for that much power , and has generally failed to drive in runs in key situations i look at it as just pressing , phillips said of piazza s recent struggles all the focus is on him todd s coming back may actually take some focus off mike and give him the opportunity to take a deep breath hundley and piazza in the middle of the mets order the adventure begins the mets hope it leads to something photo todd hundley , left , completed a twoday stint last night with the norfolk tides and manager rick dempsey \( tom strickland for the new york times \)
karuizawa , japan , monday , feb 9 here at kazakoshi park arena , where four women s curling matches commenced this morning , there were no campbell s soup endorsements to be had but after decades of languishing in demonstrationsport purgatory , there finally were medals beginning with their 76 women s victory over the united states and their men s match later in the day against japan , the longdominant canadians were , quite literally , going for a goldmedal sweep this sport , dating from 16th century scotland ancient by mainstream sports standards involves sliding round granite stones down a 146footlong , 15foot7 1 2inchwide sheet of ice into a 12foot circle known as the house , while two sweepers with straw or synthetic brooms help steer the stone by reducing the friction between the running stone and the ice do n't tell a curler that the game is something like shuffleboard on ice they insist they are elite athletes , as worthy of a medal as anyone else curling is a finesse sport but it is also mentally and physically grueling , said lisa schoenberg , the american skip , or captain , who shoots fourth , or last , and devises the strategy for each of the 10 ends , curling s version of innings our athletes train just as hard as those in any other sport that said , the curling arena is where one can say hello to paul savage , 50yearold olympian savage is the alternate for the canadian men s team , a 38year curling veteran who welcomed himself to the nagano games last week by standing up at a news conference , turning around and dropping his pants he wanted to show off his new tattoo , a curling stone tucked inside the canadian flag not so shocking , apparently , in curling circles , which enjoys its greatest popularity as a canadian bowlingnightout few towns do not have curling rinks major competitions are nationally televised and draw ratings that rank only behind hockey and baseball the olympic trials in saskatoon , saskatchewan , drew 20 , 000 most players , none of whom make their living at this , have nicknames , like the canadian women s star and skip , sandra schmirler , the curler arguably the most popular women s athlete in canada , schmirler , 34 , out of regina , saskatchewan , has won three world championships , the last of which came in 1996 while she was six months pregnant three months later , during the olympic trials , a match was interrupted while she took time out to breast feed her daughter for five or six years i 'd given my life to curling and i was n't going to do it any longer , she said i did what i had to do , and i think women are really good at that all right , this is not exactly the legendary material of crosscountry , frostonthebeard skiing we are talking about , as the canadian curler eddie \( the wrench \) werenich would admit favored at the trials to make the olympic team , werenich , a 200pluspound fireman by trade , fell just short i'm 50 , overweight , he rationalized standing on a podium , even i 'd laugh the american men have a curler , in the third position , awaiting a kidney transplant when mike peplinski , 24yearold schoolteacher from eau claire , wis , told his doctor he was going to the olympics , the doctor replied , and what sport are you playing in your condition \? curling nonetheless was granted full medal status after being a demonstration sport in 1924 , 1932 , 1988 and 1992 the game does require tremendous offensive and defensive strategy , as when canada s third , jan betker , scored a doubletakeout in the 10th end today knocking two american stones out of scoring position as the american team , which trailed by 72 , tried to rally for the upset victory the canadian women , winners of five of the last six world titles , took a step toward adding the one elusive prize , an olympic medal the tournament runs seven days at the games , with the men s and women s medal matches to be played on saturday the curling arena is not quite in the heart of the games , reachable from nagano by a oneandahalfhour bus ride or by 30 minutes on the bullet train today s snowfall made the wooded area around the arena feel more remote schmirler , the canadians and even the losing americans would not have cared if they were playing in siberia the rings are up there , schmirler said this is the olympics we 're going for the gold photo canadian sweepers getting to work during a 76 victory over the united states in a women s match yesterday \( chang w lee the new york times \)
san francisco , sept 26 is she a national role model as first lady \? the president s top crisis manager determined to rescue his legacy \? or a traumatized victim deserving of america s embrace \? in a threeday , fivestate fundraising tour on behalf of democratic candidates for congress , hillary rodham clinton was analyzed and lionized , criticized and beatified on each of these points through it all , she stayed the course , smiling opaquely and assuring old friends and political allies that she was just fine ! as she thickly larded her speeches with praise of the president and criticism of congress her steadfast fans could not stop themselves from gushing she s kind of like our american princess di , said lawrence johnson , 30 , a clerk at seattle s westin hotel who saw mrs clinton as she swept in for an evening of fundraising on thursday they ought to leave her husband alone and she should be our next president ! with elections just a few weeks away and concerns that the president s sex scandal may inhibit democrats from voting , mrs clinton is getting many standing ovations as she asks audiences to empty their pockets and get out the vote and if there was any doubt that mrs clinton was withholding support from her husband as she sorted out her own feelings , she dispelled it in her sweep through new york , colorado , washington , oregon and california at times she seemed to be campaigning even more for mr clinton than she was for the candidates , tirelessly promoting him as the president who turned around the economy , reduced crime , furthered educational change and balanced the budget for the first time since neil armstrong walked on the moon by any objective measure , by any fair assessment , our country is so much better off because of my husband s leadership , she told a crowd of several hundred at a fundraising dinner for four congressional candidates in seattle most of the candidates said little about the president , and in some cases they appeared relieved that she , not he , was around even so , mrs clinton sits at the innermost circle of the president s crisismanagement team , drafting hardball responses to the lewinsky scandal and the paula jones sexual misconduct suit and to the republicans who have attacked the president because of them mrs clinton s loyalists believe that she is a first lady with a future , no matter how the clinton presidency weathers the impeachment debate , no matter whether the white house strategy , to which she has contributed so much , prevails the attraction of mrs clinton is that she focuses on the issues rather than the distractions swirling around washington , dc , said jay inslee , who is running for congress in washington state the president is a distraction despite the best efforts of democratic candidates to change the subject from mr clinton s woes to issues like child care , education , social security and the environment , the president s troubles kept intruding , often in unexpected ways at a reelection fundraiser for senator barbara boxer in the grand ballroom of the san francisco hilton hotel on friday night , the actress , frances fisher , of titanic fame read excerpts from mrs clinton s best seller , it takes a village , telling the 250aplate audience of 1 , 100 supporters how children are a moral touchstone amidst the complexity and contentiousness of modern life but on the sidewalk outside the hotel , 8yearold carolyn ahr carried a poster that she had drawn with a sad face and the words , the president lies and should be fired mrs clinton is a setback for american women , said catherine ahr , 37 , a homemaker , and carolyn s mother i 've never protested in my life and i even went to berkeley but this time was different what kind of moral message does this whole thing send to our children \? in none of her childrelated events did mrs clinton answer that question none of the candidates did either at portland state university in oregon , mrs clinton appeared in front of a big poster that read , kids first with david wu , a yaleeducated lawyer and candidate for congress whose main pitch is education and who praised his guest as our nation s foremost children s advocate asked whether there was a conflict between mrs clinton s focus on children s needs and the difficulty parents are having in explaining her husband s behavior to their children , mr wu said , i will have to think about that so much was said in code and fraught with double meaning on mrs clinton s campaign tour that it was often hard to sort out what the real message was supposed to be at the fundraising dinner in seattle , mrs clinton mocked what she called the other washington i think that s the way to look at it , she said it s like a parallel universe and sort of exists out there somewhere in outer space but she also said that the american people do not get enough political news , and throughout her trip described politics as a noble calling , exhorting her audiences to persuade people that politics matters unlike the first lady , mrs boxer , whose daughter is married to mrs clinton s brother , said flat out in her speech at the fundraiser in san francisco , the president has problems but she never said what they were and she blamed the extraordinary atmosphere we are living in for making it impossible to get the media to focus on serious issues

to them , left the registration desk to return to the governor the conversation between plaintiff , blackard , and ferguson lasted approximately five minutes and consisted of light friendly banter there was nothing intimidating , threatening , or coercive about it upon leaving the registration desk , ferguson apparently had a conversation with the governor about the possibility of meeting with plaintiff , during which ferguson states the governor remarked that plaintiff had that comehither look , ie , a sort of sexually suggestive appearance from the look or dress he states that some time later the governor asked him to get him a room , that he was expecting a call from the white house and had several phone calls that he needed to make , and asked him to go to the car and get his

flint , mich , june 30 the way ryan garland sees it , the two strikes here that have shut down the general motors corporation and put his father out of work are a blessing before tensions erupted and 9 , 200 workers walked off their jobs , ryan mostly fantasized about spending uninterrupted days with his father , dean , one of the striking workers but now they are inseparable , their twin smiles so bright that the two often seem out of place among the throngs of more seriouslooking strikers picketing outside the sprawling stamping factory where the walkout began on june 5 we 're doing everything together , ryan , 10 , said while holding a picket sign and counting down the minutes before he and his dad head to a local park their days are filled with waterskiing , boat rides and intense fatherson basketball games we did n't have a lot before my dad was always working or sleeping unlike his son , mr garland talks quietly about his days with ryan , low enough to avoid stares from other strikers after all , this was supposed to have been the first week of a paid companywide twoweek shutdown , a time that most gm workers set aside for family outings and vacations now , only the company s salaried workers will be paid for the time off the strikes have already idled virtually all of gm s hourly employees 162 , 700 as of today twentysix of the auto maker s 29 north american assembly factories are closed gm said today that the strikes would cost the company 118 billion after taxes in the second quarter most of the that resulted from a loss of 890 million at gm s north american operations , the company said delphi , gm s large auto parts subsidiary , lost 290 million i feel bad saying this , but i'm enjoying myself it s like a vacation , mr garland , 45 , said i owe my son this time we could stay off the rest of the year and it still would n't be enough to make up for what i 've given gm and that plant mr garland is married to a corporate lawyer and is not yet worried about family finances , but many strikers say they are having trouble making ends meet on the weekly strike pay provided by the united automobile workers on 150 a week with four kids to feed , your priorities get focused real quickly , said june cone , 40 , a groundskeeper at the second gm plant on strike in flint rather than traveling to amusement parks as she had planned , ms cone , a single mother , said her family was spending the twoweek shutdown scouring their neighborhood for odd jobs her children have found work mowing lawns , and she has helped paint the homes of a couple of neighbors a family crisis eight months before the strike virtually emptied her savings i have to be careful how far i drive because i really ca n't afford to waste money on gas , she said this morning , ms cone brought her sick 10yearold son to the picket line and left him waiting in a van instead of driving 25 miles back home to pick him up for a doctor s appointment a few bits of good news have emerged this week gm backed off its plan to cancel health care benefits for those workers idled because of the strikes and the top national negotiators for gm and the uaw have resumed negotiating for the first time since picket signs went up but none of that has washed away workers' anger , or their fears that strikes will stretch into late summer and be followed later this year by yet another crippling dispute at two parts plants in dayton , ohio workers there , who staged a 17day strike in 1996 , voted tonight to give union leaders the authority to call a walkout the next step would be a fiveday notice to gm before any strike i never thought it would get this big or this bad , robert harbin , 59 , said by now , he had planned to be in a rickety canoe , floating on a river in northern michigan instead , mr harbin sat in a lawn chair on the side of a dusty road , waving a picket sign and talking about what might have been all the time i 've put in this year , it s hard to think that i probably wo n't have a vacation , mr harbin said , flipping through a recent issue of backpacker magazine thirtyseven years of working with loud press machines have left him dependent on two hearing aids as well as a big fan of quiet outdoor vacations strikers are required to staff the picket line for only two hours once a week , but mr harbin said he did not feel comfortable straying from home the rest of the time because he was not sure how long his strike savings would have to last and even if he could afford a trip , mr harbin said it would probably not alleviate the stress when you 're on strike , your whole mind is on strike , he said you ca n't just put it away and go play it 'll end one day , but nobody is going to win we 're all losing things we ca n't get back
sugar land , tex dressed in white cotton shirts and trousers , with a guard stationed in the hallway outside , several inmates at the texas state prison system s jester ii unit sat in a stark white classroom , studying a list of steps to spiritual recovery one recent afternoon they were all nearing the end of their sentences for robbery , drug possession or murder and had come for a life skills class , whose teacher gently urged them to be part of the process of change by discussing each step with reference to the bible and their own lives one inmate , jerry kovaly , 50 , walked to a podium , near a board where someone had written a new testament verse about god cast all your anxieties on him , because he cares for you a person must invite jesus into his life , mr kovaly declared , adding , he 'll live in me and through me worship services and faithbased study groups have long been part of american prisons , but mr kovaly and 79 other men here are participating in something different , an experiment in rehabilitation through religious immersion inmates are to spend up to 18 months in religious support groups and classes on parenting , social skills and anger management , as well as work inside the prison upon release , each is to receive six months of aftercare , monitoring by volunteers , each affiliated with a local church with aftercare , said jack cowley , director of the program , called innerchange freedom initiative , everyone will have a job , everyone will have a mentor , everybody will have a home church people want to believe their prisons work , said mr cowley , a former warden in oklahoma prisons our one aim is to bring about a lifechanging experience through a walk with christ , and provide people with tools so they wo n't commit crimes anymore within the world of prisons , this is a bold goal , especially as 60 percent of inmates are estimated to be rearrested after release it also goes against current trends it used to be that the corrections system viewed its major mission as rehabilitation , said alfred blumstein , a professor of operations research and public policy at carnegiemellon university s heinz school of public policy but , he said , they have to a distressing degree abandoned efforts at rehabilitation , at reshaping behavior innerchange , where inmates rise at 5 30 am for worship , is a project of prison fellowship ministries , founded by charles colson , the watergate figure with 46 , 000 volunteers worldwide , it provides counseling , job training and bible studies in prisons prison fellowship officials said that although they knew of special areas set aside in other prisons for religious inmates , they believed themselves to be alone in offering a christianbased , immersionstyle rehabilitation program that includes a provision for following up inmates after their release prison fellowship s involvement at jester ii came after it responded to a request from the texas department of criminal justice for a valuesbased program for prisoners nearing release in the flatlands west of houston , jester ii is a low brick complex , crouched behind an impressive set of fences inside , narrow bunks cluster behind floortoceiling bars , guards stand watch , and views to the world beyond are bracketed by chainlink steel and razor wire yet , inside there are inmates playing a board game that teaches phonics , while others head for study sessions with bibles in hand in conversations , prisoners discussed their pasts in confessional tones i thought i needed a change before i go out into that society world , said ronnie flowers , 37 , who said he was serving a sentence for robbery and murder , because i came in with a lot of hatred this is helping me get to where i need to be at , mr flowers said , as he paged through a bible to find a verse , ii chronicles 7 14 , in which god promises to forgive his people if they turn from wickedness i read it every day , mr flowers said richard gonzales , 30 , who said he had been convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle , said he had lived a life of crime i was into anything that made money and made it fast , he said the program , he said , opened my eyes to christianity and to myself mr cowley said that although the inmates were honest about finding faith , he did not think that as a group they had given up the prison code each man on his own before christmas , he said , art supplies were stolen from a locker , although it was unclear whether the culprit belonged to innerchange or was another prisoner at jester ii what concerned him , he said , was that no one confronted the thief about the deed s moral wrong mr cowley said his goal was to make jester ii the hardest place in texas to do time , because we 're going to expect people to be normal and if somebody hits somebody else in anger , mr cowley said , i'm going to expect them to turn the other cheek , and then i'm going to expect them to come to me and we 're going to deal with it
bruce bochy got away with the biggest baseball gamble of 1998 , and now the yankees will pay for his good fortune not only did the san diego padres survive their manager s decision to use kevin brown , his no 1 starter , in relief in game 5 of the national league playoff , but they also won yesterday and ended their series with atlanta before brown would have had to pitch game 7 today that turn of events puts brown in perfect position to pitch the world series opener at yankee stadium on saturday night if bochy chooses , he can also schedule brown for games 4 and 7 i'm pretty sure we are , but it s something i 'll have to discuss with the manager , dave stewart , the pitching coach , said in atlanta after yesterday s game luckily we won and did n't have to chance bringing kevin brown back if the braves had won yesterday , brown or greg maddux , had the braves won today could not have pitched against the yankees until the third game next tuesday night if bochy had not used brown in relief monday night and the padres had lost , as they did because of his pitching , the dominating righthander would have pitched game 6 yesterday , then been available on sunday at the earliest but bochy got greedy , tried to terminate the braves right then and there and called on brown to protect a 42 lead but when bochy , at the urging of stewart , let brown pitch a second inning of relief , he gave up a stunning threerun home run to atlanta s michael tucker bochy summoned brown because he obviously did not trust his relief corps other than his terrific closer , trevor hoffman joe torre does not have that problem with the yankees' bullpen when david cone wore down in game 6 of the american league championship series tuesday night , torre brought in ramiro mendoza , who shut cleveland down on one hit before mariano rivera finished up flawlessly in the ninth mike stanton pitched a scoreless eighth inning in preserving a 40 lead in game 4 before rivera closed it out jeff nelson got the last two outs in game 1 after manny ramirez hit a tworun home run against david wells unless brown and his fellow starters , andy ashby and sterling hitchcock , pitch until it s hoffman time , bochy will not be able to hide randy myers , dan miceli , donne wall , mark langston and brian boehringer but brown is the pitcher the yankees have to get past first if he follows his 1997 pattern , they will be able to do that pitching for the florida marlins , brown allowed san francisco one run in seven innings in the division series last year , then beat the braves twice in the league series when he pitched in the world series , though , the indians battered him for 10 runs in 11 innings in two losing starts in this year s division series , brown held houston to one run and five hits in 14 2 3 innings over two starts , then shut the braves out on three hits in the league series brown has n't pitched against the yankees since 1995 , when he made a oneseason stop in baltimore he faced them once that season , shutting them out on four hits in eight and a third innings , and once the previous season , his sixth with texas in his career , he has started 16 times against the yanks and has a 123 record and 243 earned run average how relevant that record will be saturday night is debatable the teams that dressed in pinstripes from 1989 through 1995 did not resemble the team that has won 121 games and lost 50 games this year on the other hand , brown is a better pitcher than he was in those seasons , even 1992 , when he won 21 games brown will be pitching at yankee stadium for the first time since opening day of the 1994 season tony gwynn will be playing there for the first time ever i 've never been to yankee stadium , the lone holdover from the padres' 1984 world series team said amid flying champagne in the team s clubhouse yesterday gwynn has played 2 , 244 regular and postseason games in his 17year career but has never stepped onto the outfield grass in the bronx he has amassed 2 , 955 hits in those games , but none that skidded along that grass teammates like hitchcock , boehringer and jim leyritz , all former members of the yankees , will brief gwynn on everything he needs to know in one way , it is fitting that the yankees will end their year against the padres it was in san diego that their firstweek problems actually began problems \? oh yes , losses in their first three games and four of their first five the yanks went to san diego for the last weekend of the exhibition schedule , and the trip went sour from the minute they landed at the airport in tijuana as the bus carrying the team to a san diego hotel left the airport , it went to make a left turn and the tires on the left side of the bus went onto the curb , causing the bus to lean harrowingly to the left however , the bus regained its balance and the trip continued uneventfully the weather was another matter the yankees and the padres played only six innings saturday and not at all sunday because of rain some thought the inability to play the games left the players unprepared for the start of the season when they visit san diego next week , the yankees expect to find good weather , and they will travel to tijuana at their own risk
melbourne , australia , jan 21 although the williams sisters kicked off a difficult day by sharing an omelet and a practice session , mercy was nowhere in evidence on the secondround menu once the matches got under way at soldout melbourne park today and if this grand slam tournament s most conspicuous debutantes could turn melbourne into a town without pity as they tried to whack each other out of the australian open , what chance did anybody else have \? after the 17yearold venus williams defeated her 16yearold sister , 76 \( 74 \) , 61 , she slung a conciliatory arm around serena s shoulders and then , in a crowdpleasing move choreographed before the match began , took a synchronized bow with the dejected loser it was n't so funny eliminating my little sister , venus said , but i'm still a competitor myself , and i have to be tough joining serena williams on the sidelines today were last year s photogenic runnerup on the men s side , seventhseeded carlos moya of spain , and the strapping , 15thseeded mark philippoussis of australia but the day definitely belonged to the teenage siblings with those todiefor beaded hairdos even topranked pete sampras , who has little interest in the women s side of the draw , could n't resist the spectacle of williams versus williams in the sunny stadium it was , sampras said , a bit like watching a car crash there s no room for pity , said sampras , the defending champion , after he showed none in a brutal 62 , 61 , 62 dismissal of 94thranked davide sanguinetti of italy the worst thing in the world is to play a sibling , sampras said it s got to be an awful feeling although the largely mute crowd could n't help but be fascinated by the matchup , it also could n't reconcile itself to backing either sister except the one who happened to be behind at the moment i think they did that in respect they did n't want to choose sides unless forced to , said serena , who was hobbled by the same sore right knee that flared up last week
hartford , feb 13 the number of its passengers has already risen 18 percent in the last four years , to 54 million last year , but bradley international airport in windsor locks wants to keep growing with gov john g rowland s support , the airport is planning to spend 135 million to build a new , larger terminal and improve services to persuade more passengers who live well outside the hartford area in fairfield county and western massachusetts to use bradley instead of the new york airports or logan international in boston bradley s growth has resulted largely from the improved economy , and the expansion will assure further growth , said robert f juliano , chief of the bureau of aviation and ports for the state department of transportation if we continue to improve facilities and provide better amenities , you will see an increase , especially in the fringe market , mr juliano said he said bradley , which had 457 million passengers in 1993 , hoped to draw 86 million by 2010 the airport has two terminals now and officials plan to replace the older one with a new terminal to open in 2003 the new one will have 30 gates and cover 600 , 000 square feet , compared with the current 24 gates over 400 , 000 square feet in the terminal to be replaced the ticketing and baggage claim areas will be correspondingly larger all the gates in the new terminal will have covered boarding ramps to airplanes seven gates in the old building do not have them , mr juliano said sixty percent of the expansion will be paid for by existing airport fees and 40 percent by a state bond issue governor rowland has included the 135 million for the expansion in his budget for next year mr juliano said bradley had already started to draw more people from areas around hartford , and hoped to expand on that success bradley has advertised itself in those areas , and connecticut limousine , a private bus service , is now offering service from new haven and bridgeport to bradley , mr juliano said sara e unrue , a manager of new haven travel service , said her local customers were using bradley more frequently because of the convenience there is little traffic going into bradley , the airport is small and the longterm parking is relatively inexpensive once you realize you do n't have to go to new york , you do n't want to go to new york , ms unrue said bradley s goals for expansion are somewhat similar to what has been accomplished at t f green airport in warwick , ri , outside providence , where the number of airline passengers increased 64 percent last year , to just over four million the providence airport opened a new terminal with 17 gates in september 1996 , and a month later southwest airlines also started its first service to the northeast bradley s expansion is getting support from the business community in the hartford area michael meotti , president of the connecticut policy and economic council , said expanding bradley airport was an important key to economic growth for the entire hartford region at present , bradley is offering nonstop flights to 32 cities including dallas and miami , but it is offering none to the west coast , although united will start nonstop service to san francisco in june , mr juliano said if you could combine ease of travel to the airport with more nonstop service , then you get a really good combination , he said bradley has the potential of being more than a generator of magazine sales and coffee sales in the terminal map of connecticut showing the location of the windsor locks bradley airport has attracted more people from outlying areas

wildwood , nj , april 3 after a summer marred by several serious accidents on carnival rides , the new jersey senate passed a bill last week that would make the state s amusement park safety laws among the toughest in the nation , imposing stiff fines not only on negligent park operators but on reckless riders , too the bill , which awaits the final approval of gov christine todd whitman , would increase the maximum penalty for violating safety regulations to 5 , 000 a day from 500 , said its sponsor , assemblyman george f geist , a republican of gloucester township the bill would give state officials the power to revoke a park s operating license immediately if safety violations were found a spokeswoman for mrs whitman , jayne o'connor , said that although the governor supports legislation to improve safety at amusement parks , she is reviewing the specific provisions of mr geist s bill the bill also takes aim at rider misbehavior , which state officials say was to blame in most of the amusement park accidents in new jersey last year under its rider responsibility clause , riders who violated safety rules could be charged with disorderly conduct and fined up to 1 , 000 we saw a dramatic rise last year in the number of accidents at amusement parks , and with the proper safety precautions , many of these accidents could have been prevented , mr geist said no trip to an amusement park should ever end in tragedy state labor officials say that last summer was one of the worst in memory for accidents on amusement park rides but they also note that most accidents are caused by the riders themselves , not by operator or mechanical error of the 307 accidents reported in new jersey last year , 222 were blamed on rider behavior , said kevin smith , a spokesman for the state s department of labor , which oversees the amusement park industry operator error was found to have caused 23 of the accidents , and mechanical failure was blamed for 25 , he said thirtyseven accidents remain unexplained william morey , who operates morey s pier , an amusement park here , applauded the bill s effort to curb rider misbehavior the rider has largely been ignored in terms of accidents for years , he said but riders have responsibilities , just like operators , toward themselves and others you just ca n't take them out of the loop , so to speak but mechanical failure , not rider behavior , was found to be the cause of a serious accident at morey s pier last july patrick mckeown , a 9yearold from erial , nj , was riding a roller coaster when its emergency brake suddenly engaged , throwing him to the ground , shattering his jaw and crushing his leg mr morey and his brother , jack , were fined 500 , but are appealing the ruling both william morey and william erwin , who owns the casino pier amusement park in seaside heights , nj , where three people were injured on rides last year , said that a barrage of negative publicity about last summer s accidents had buried their assertions that the vast majority of amusement parks rides are safe most of the time behind park owners' fear of accidents , they said , lies the specter of rising insurance rates although none of the owners were willing to discuss insurance costs , larry zucker , a philadelphia lawyer who specializes in amusement park liability cases , said that insurance premiums could skyrocket after an accident , even if a park operator is not found responsible mr zucker drew a comparison between amusement parks and roller discos rinks that offer fastpaced skating to music which largely disappeared in the late 1980 s , after insurance companies stopped offering policies to operations that suffered dozens , if not hundreds , of claims each year the same type of thing could conceivably happen to amusement parks , said mr zucker , who helped draft the rider responsibility clause hopefully this bill will save lives and amusement parks at the same time some accident victims and their families seem to agree with mr zucker although patrick mckeown , now 10 , suffers permanent numbness on the right side of his face as a result of his fall last summer , his mother , alice , sees nothing wrong with placing a burden of responsibility on riders riders need to take care of their own actions too , she said i think anything that makes these rides more safe is great
islamabad , pakistan , may 30 pakistan exploded another nuclear test device today , the government announced , spurning worldwide criticism and calls for restraint after its nuclear tests two days ago speaking after a round of tests that have catapulted the impoverished countries of india and pakistan into declared nuclear powers and raised fears of war , a pakistani official indicated that nuclear weapons could now be swiftly made ready for use the devices tested conform to weapons configuration compatible with delivery systems , shamshad ahmad khan , a senior official in the foreign ministry , said at a news conference this evening we have proved our credibility , he said , adding that today s test had concluded the series but he also said that pakistan was ready to talk peace with india and that it is not our purpose to enter into an arms race the pakistani tests came two weeks after india exploded what it said were five nuclear devices a senior indian official said today that india did not view nuclear testing as a competition with pakistan requiring india to match each move by its archrival the united states , which has imposed economic sanctions on both countries , condemned the latest pakistani test articles , page 8 today s test came at 11 55 this morning in the same remote baluchistan region of desert and mountains near the iranian border where the previous tests by pakistan were conducted on thursday initial reports said two devices , each with a force of 18 kilotons slightly bigger than the bomb dropped on hiroshima had been exploded in reinforced lshaped tunnels , but pakistani officials later said there had been only one scientists outside india and pakistan have questioned some of the two countries' assertions about their tests , and it was not immediately clear what size device pakistan detonated today the cia put the size at one to five kilotons , a relatively tiny bomb by coldwar standards again and again in his remarks , mr ahmad , the foreign ministry s senior civil servant , referred to india s development of nuclear weapons and the struggle between the countries over the disputed province of kashmir , which he said was under the patently illegal occupation of india india and pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 , two of them over kashmir mr ahmad said pakistan had developed its nuclear ability only , only in selfdefense and only to deter aggression it is to restore the strategic balance , he said mr ahmad reiterated his government s assertion that it is willing to negotiate with india but negotiations , he insisted , must lead to a peaceful and just solution to the problem of kashmir jammu and kashmir is the only majority muslim state in predominantly hindu india and has been the scene of brutal violence between muslim separatists and indian security forces part of the kashmir region is held by pakistan , which has supported separatists in the indianheld area today s test was greeted here with jubilation crowds have been dancing in the streets of this desperately poor muslim country since thursday s announcement that pakistan had conducted five underground nuclear tests in response to an equal number by india earlier this month indeed , far from bowing to the pressure of international sanctions and at least four nations' recall of their ambassadors , officials here spoke openly of loading the newly developed nuclear warheads onto missiles there is no problem putting them on warheads , foreign minister gomar ayub khan said on friday dr abdul qadeer khan , the chief of pakistan s nuclear development program and the country s newest hero , agreed if the prime minister asked , it would not be difficult to mount them , dr qadeer khan said we can really , really mount them , not in months , not in weeks , but in days normally fractious parties across the splintered political spectrum are saluting prime minister nawaz sharif for standing up to india , and friday prayers throughout the country were devoted to giving thanks for the country s nuclear ability in the northwest frontier province , mountain tribesman let loose with the traditional celebratory volleys of gunfire from weapons of all descriptions office holders , usually enriched here by their public service , vowed belttightening to share the economic suffering to come the elation reflected the long tensions between india and pakistan with a vastly larger population and a military twice the size of pakistan s 1 , 145 , 000 to 587 , 000 india has been the dominant force on the subcontinent much of the tension has centered on kashmir with independence , the princely states that had made up the british colony were to chose which new country they wanted to join most of the population of kashmir was muslim but its maharaja was hindu when pathan tribesmen challenged his rule , he appealed to india , which sent in forces with the victory of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party in the indian election this year , the tensions have sharpened , and both sides have been emphatic in linking the nuclear race and the kashmir issue after the nuclear tests by india , that country s home minister , lal krishna advani , increased war jitters by speaking out strongly on kashmir both countries have been furtively developing their nuclear potential for years but it is only in the last few weeks that india and pakistan shouldered into the club of declared nuclear powers dr qadeer khan , pakistan s nuclear director , gave new details of pakistan s program in an interview today with a local newspaper , the news describing the tests on thursday , he said one was a big bomb that had a yield of about 30 to 35 kilotons , which was twice as big as the one dropped on hiroshima the other four were small tactical weapons of low yield mounted on small missiles , they can be used in the battlefield against concentrations of troops none of these explosions were thermonuclear , a hydrogen bomb , he said we are doing research and can do a fusion blast , if asked but it depends on the circumstances , political situation and the decision of the government this morning s pakistani newspapers were euphoric over the nuclear tests , carrying article after article about parades and celebrations here , and the discomfiture of the hindu nationalists and the reigning bharatiya janata party long live nuclear pakistan , declared the headline on the front page of the pakistan observer five nuclear blasts have instantly transformed an extremely demoralized nation into a selfrespecting , proud nation of 140 million people , having full faith in their destiny , a frontpage article said indian explosions and belligerent statements made by the bjp leaders were a constant source of constant anguish for patriotic pakistanis and a befitting response was inescapable to restore the badly shaken confidence of the masses india s selfperceived towering stature , on the basis of which it hurled threats on pakistan , has been razed to the ground in the mountains of chagai , the area of the test site photos people gathered in karachi , pakistan , yesterday to read the news about their country s new nuclear test the announcement was greeted with jubilation , as were the tests earlier in the week \( reuters \) pakistan said that before it conducted its new test yesterday in its western

albany , aug 23 barely three weeks before the primary , peter f vallone on monday will become the first of the four democrats running for governor to embark on a major television advertising campaign aides to mr vallone , the new york city council speaker , say that the campaign will spend almost 700 , 000 over the next week to 10 days a sizable effort , by any standard to broadcast two 30second spots in every major market in the state and in most minor ones but the nature and timing of the ads underscore how hard it will be for any of the democrats to unseat the popular republican incumbent , george e pataki mr vallone s ads are of the gettingtoknowyou variety , intended , as much as anything else , to introduce him to an electorate that , fairly late in the game , still knows little about the contenders and has yet to devote much attention to this race mr pataki , who has raised far more money than all the democrats combined , has had ads on television since june , and still has well over 12 million in his campaign treasury mr vallone s new television effort puts him on a pace to spend nearly all of his remaining 2 million by the sept 15 primary , leaving him , if he wins , to start fundraising from scratch for the general election we 're going to stay on the air through the primary , said kevin mccabe , mr vallone s campaign manager mr vallone s chief rival for the nomination , lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross , who reported having slightly more money on hand in midaugust than he did , has so far held her fire , spending a little money on radio ads and none on television nearly all her campaign money has come from her husband , the financier wilbur ross her campaign spokesman , kevin davitt , would not disclose when she might take to the airwaves more aggressively the other candidates , charles j hynes , the brooklyn district attorney , and james l larocca , a former state transportation commissioner , trail in the polls and have too little money for largescale advertising public opinion surveys show that ms mccaughey ross , a former republican who was once mr pataki s protege , is by far the bestknown of the democrats in the field , but is also the only one viewed negatively by large numbers of people many democratic strategists had predicted that she would be the first to do largescale advertising , either to combat the reputation for erratic behavior that she gained in a longrunning feud with mr pataki , or to attack mr vallone
in light of their town s selfproclaimed nickname the next station to heaven it is not surprising that many residents of new canaan think theirs is a very special place indeed , characterized by affluence and elegance , spacious parks , a nature center , good schools and a strong sense of community controversy is rare in new canaan , where a few old neighborhoods near the heart of town mix with luxurious homes in a fairfield county community of about 18 , 000 that has a sizeable number of millionaires and a downtown shopping district that looks much like it did a quartercentury ago but a controversy has arisen this fall over a recommendation that homeowners permit hunters to enter their property to help reduce what a committee of townspeople says is a threat to the town s quality of life a growing deer herd allowing deer hunters with guns or bow and arrow onto private property with homeowners' permission is not new it has been permitted under state law for the last 20 years but calling on homeowners to permit such hunting , as the new canaan deer committee has done is rare for example , no such encouragement has been given in the adjacent towns of wilton and ridgefield , which have far more woodland and open space and deer than new canaan conceding that there is a diversity of opinion on this issue , the new canaan deer committee said in a statement that there are serious health problems as a result of the burgeoning deer population one problem alluded to was exposure to lyme disease , which can be spread by ticks that feed on deer the committee s 10 members have direct or indirect experience with the disease but they also cited a need to lessen the danger of auto accidents involving deer and to help control property damage , which mainly has involved deer feasting on ornamental plants besides a communitybacked deer hunt , the committee s recommendations include a deerpopulation assessment , spraying in highrisk areas to reduce the number of ticks and amending local zoning regulations to permit eightfoothigh deer fencing according to the state department of environmental protection , 62 deer were killed last year by motor vehicles in new canaan , which several highways , including the merritt parkway , traverse that was four less than the number killed in greenwich and far fewer than the 107 killed in ridgefield in addition , 19 deer were killed by bow and arrow hunters and 7 by gunshot in 1997 in new canaan , according to howard j kilpatrick , a wildlife biologist for the state department of environmental protection , who estimates there are about 55 , 000 deer in connecticut but that deer kill which was not part of a communitysponsored campaign was not sufficient in the eyes of the town s deer committee , which includes one of new canaan s three selectmen , judy neville , who is the chairwoman and to insure that more deer are killed before this year s deer hunting season ends on dec 31 the gun hunting season runs from nov 18 through dec 22 the committee has asked for the support of the united bow hunters of connecticut , which is based in enfield robert clark , the secretary of the bow hunters' group , said he had provided the committee with a list of 34 trained archers , none of whom live in new canaan , which is available to homeowners at the new canaan police headquarters i was always getting stopped by people in town and asked , 'when are you going to do something about the deer , who are a real menace \? ' , ms neville said and now people are so glad that we are taking some action certainly not everyone some letter writers to the new canaan advertiser , the weekly newspaper which has been supportive of the committee s recommendations , have assailed the deerhunting initiative , and , during an emotionally charged public hearing early last month , most speakers criticized the committee s espousal of bows and arrows and guns as a means of ridding the town of as many deer as possible i find it appalling that this town , which has so much , could reject a more humane plan as being too expensive , said leslie hare , a resident , in alluding to spray repellents and netting in wooded areas like waveny park , a haven for joggers , walkers , birdwatchers and others it s a medieval solution to a modern problem norma collier , who also spoke out against the hunting proposal , said in an interview that deer often come onto her property , but do no damage i feed them grain and molasses , and the same four show up every day , she said and there are other ways to keep them from eating your flowers or doing any damage then , too , it s their land as much as it is ours the recommendation to invite hunters onto your property to kill them is horrible she added what s going to happen when a deer is hit by an arrow and then , while wounded , runs onto someone else s property \? when that happens , deer hunters are supposed to return the hunting weapons to their vehicles and then ask the homeowner onto whose property the deer has fled whether they can continue to pursue the wounded deer , according to capt john smutnick of the law enforcement division of the dep
i believe in the power of st lazarus and he holds me in his sight i know that these jitterbug days i'm livin , ' well , they wo n't last for all of us , but they 'll last for a long summer night from the score of the capeman , music by paul simon , book and lyrics by mr simon and derek walcott the long summer night of the capeman abruptly ends this saturday when the 11 million musical closes at the marquis theater just two months after its official opening , which followed nearly nine weeks of paid previews some broadway professionals have been uncharacteristically caustic about the flop of the ambitious if unfocused , utterly flaccid show with which mr simon made his debut as a broadway contender they do n't talk about his haunting , widely praised score or , if they do , they say it is n't for the theater instead , they prefer to equate the huge amount of money lost by the production with the size of the composer s ego how could a man with no broadway experience , someone who possesses only skepticism about the form itself , dare to come into town and , surrounded by other theater neophytes , attempt to teach the pros how to put on a show \? mickey and judy could do it , but that was in the movies yet the failure of the capeman should not be a cause for derision but for lamentation , even beyond mr simon s public of loyal admirers that would include everyone who , at the beginning of this season , read the schedule of forthcoming shows as an indication that , at long last , the broadway musical might stand a chance of finding some important new identities and none too soon the people responsible for the current crop of longrunning broadway behemoths have not been heard from recently andrew lloyd webber has abandoned for the time being , anyway the ornately melodramatic romances epitomized by his longrunning blockbuster the phantom of the opera he has not presented a new show in new york since sunset boulevard , though he has n't been idle he was hoping to come into town last season with whistle down the wind , but withdrew it for more work after the chilly reception for its tryout run in washington the flow of epic operettas by alain boublil and claudemichel schonberg , the french team that gave us les miserables and miss saigon , appears to have also been temporarily staunched their latest endeavor , martin guerre , which opened to dim reviews in london in july 1996 , has closed for a second time to allow for still more tinkering the show was clearly dead when i saw it on its second night , but cameron mackintosh , the producer , will not let it lie down yet the number of musicals planned for broadway this season , the variety of the auspices that were presenting them and the artists involved combined to create expectations of an unusually high order in addition to the capeman , the prospects included the lion king , ragtime , side show and triumph of love to the consternation of the traditional theater community , it s the disney company , the corporate giant whose name is synonymous with faceless clout , that has turned out to be the most eccentric and successful of the new producing entities forget beauty and the beast , the company s first , very characteristic production still running at the palace theater this season s disney appreciates both broadway tradition and the care and feeding of great , idiosyncratic talent of the new musicals , only julie taymor s innovative production of the lion king , a singing and dancing show not quite like any other , has become a hit on a scale to influence musicals that come after that it is being presented in the gorgeously renovated old new amsterdam theater , another disney property , is simply a dividend not to be outdone by disney is garth drabinsky , the canadian producer who hopes to assemble a new theatrical empire south of his border he built what is virtually a brandnew theater , the ford center for the performing arts , and his first production in it is ragtime , the musical adaptation of e l doctorow s satiric novel like the theater , which is second in size only to the gershwin , ragtime is big it is also well populated , handsome , literate and stately , being an epic operetta in the mode of a homegrown les miz , though easier to follow the show , which received very good notices from most critics and mixed ones in the new york times , seems to have settled in for what is hoped to be a long run it does n't surprise , but then it does n't offend already gone side show , the adventurous , darkly romantic tale of the reallife siamese twins daisy and violet hilton , a musical whose freakish metaphor seemed to alienate audiences in spite of the witty , unhackneyed score by henry krieger and bill russell and triumph of love , a nervy but disastrous attempt to jazz up the elegant subtleties of marivaux s 18thcentury french comedy the worst mistake made by the collaborators was to assume that broadway audiences might share the tastes of thirdyear french lit majors attending a jokey , onenightonly class show which leaves us where \?

ligaments \) hurts tremendously but the defense remains rock solid and will carry the giants back to the playoffs weaknesses the running game tyrone wheatley has the speed and size to be productive , but still does n't have the support of the coaching staff gary brown is solid , but he may not be the answer the giants want to use fullback charles way as a fulltime running back , but way is n't crazy about the idea tiki barber has had his problems in preseason outlook like last season , the giant defense will shut down offenses , the offense will do enough to get by and the coaching staff , led by coach jim fassel , will find ways to help the team win the division again 2 washington 1997 record 871 strengths in coach norv turner s fifth year , it is about time he lived up to his reputation the redskins have had winning seasons the last two years but have not made the playoffs this year they have two big guys in the middle who are each a dessert short of 320 pounds in defensive tackles dan wilkinson and dana stubblefield with that kind of beef , very few teams should have success running the ball weaknesses the lasting impression of quarterback gus frerotte is after scoring a touchdown against the giants last season , he ran into a wall near the end zone and banged his head into it he needs to be more stable , as does wideout michael westbrook , who has a tendency to run undisciplined routes outlook turner will either corral all of this talent and propel the redskins to the playoffs , or they will flounder again they will likely make the playoffs and could end up being one of the year s surprise teams 3 arizona 1997 record 412 strengths the cardinals fired the offensive coordinator dick jamieson , who was unpopular with the players , and hired marc trestman the new man runs the west coast offense , and those threestep drops and quick passes will work well for the young quarterback jake plummer weaknesses arizona allowed a leaguehigh 78

mciver with barber s shears , was truly a bad hair day for gailey but he handled it calmly , and gained the respect of the players his offensive smarts and strong backbone are the cowboys' best assets weaknesses they 're old teams picked apart the talented good old cowboys in free agency , and dallas has n't drafted as well as the club needed to replace that talent only five starters are from the

charlie garner , who has a career average of almost 5 yards a carry but has also been injury prone on defense , philadelphia signed hugh douglas to help the pass rush , but there are still too many holes outlook ray rhodes is a smart coach who has n't drafted well , so the eagles are in a sorry state unless they pull one of the biggest surprises of the last five years in the nfl , it is likely that rhodes will be fired at the end of the year philippi sparks , cornerback , giants sparks has always been one of those players who people either like or ca n't stand there is no inbetween some teammates think he is arrogant , not always sincere and jealous of the success enjoyed by the other starting cornerback , jason sehorn other players believe he is simply misunderstood but all agree on one thing sparks is one of the most talented defensive backs in the game this is a crucial year for him , and how sparks performs could be the key to the giants' success in defending their division title with sehorn out for the year because of torn ligaments in his knee , the secondary is more vulnerable teams will likely challenge the defensive backs more , especially sehorn s replacement ,

paris , aug 28 the finance ministers of four economically powerful western european countries warned moscow today that the only way out of its current crisis was to make the tough economic changes long urged by the international monetary fund a letter by the four ministers from germany , france , italy and britain to russia s acting prime minister , viktor s chernomyrdin , said those steps included enforcement of tax laws that were now widely ignored , and a monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation in check none of the countries offered russia any emergency bilateral assistance , emphasizing instead that the imf would be the lead agency for dealing with the crisis the letter from the four european members of the group of seven leading industrial democracies was part of a concerted european effort to urge mr chernomyrdin not to give in to pressure from the communist opposition in russia and drop unpopular economic programs a return of confidence in financial markets will be possible only if russia proceeds with its reform program in close relationship with the international monetary fund , a statement on the letter issued by the french finance ministry said prime minister tony blair of britain spoke on thursday with president clinton , who plans to visit russia next week , and officials in london said they had agreed on what russia needed to do the program and plan that has been put together over a long period of time by the international institutions does genuinely offer the only way out of this , mr blair said during a visit to scotland a highranking french official , however , said that the united statesrussian summit meeting would probably be useless president clinton is so weakened by the admission of having had an intimate relationship with a white house intern and mr yeltsin is so stricken by russia s economic and political turmoil that neither seems able to agree on a solution to the crisis , the official , who refused to be identified , said the german finance minister , theo waigel , said in munich today , russia needs , like any other country , to work closely with international financial institutions , but russia must solve its own problems he said that germany and france would work together to try to help , but stressed that bilateral financial aid to moscow from germany , which has already lent or donated tens of billions of dollars in gratitude for russia s agreement to its unification in 1990 , was out of the question as news accounts from russia indicated that mr chernomyrdin may be preparing to strengthen state control of the economy and let inflation run , authorities in bonn and paris expressed continuing concern about economic and political developments in moscow the finance ministers agree it is vital to strengthen the foundations of public finances with a fair tax system and to adopt measures to restore the stability of the financial system , the german finance ministry said it is also decisive that the russian central bank is able to pursue an independent , stabilityoriented monetary policy mr waigel told the german financial daily handelsblatt turning up the printing presses is never a wise solution inflation is no way to escape the financial crisis there is no way around rapid implementation of structural reforms the french finance minister , dominique strausskahn , said it is clear that the solution is in the hands of the russian government we appreciate that financial assistance from us is necessary , but not sufficient in particular , the russian government has to put fiscal reforms in place photo the german finance minister , theo waigel , spoke at a party meeting yesterday in munich he has urged russia to take harsh economic steps \( reuters \)
once he began publishing his bestselling accounts of his purported adventures with a mexican shaman 30 years ago , carlos castaneda s life and work played out in a wispy blur of sly illusion and artful deceit now , four months after he died and two months after the death was made public , a probate court in los angeles is sifting through competing claims on the estate of the author whose works helped define the 1960 s and usher in the new age movement his followers say he left the earth with the same elegant , willful mystery that characterized his life the man he used to call his son says castaneda died while a virtual prisoner of cultlike followers who controlled his last days and his estate given that castaneda s literary credibility , marital history , place of birth , circumstances of death and almost everything else are in dispute , the competing claims including questions about the authenticity of his will and his competence to sign it are not surprising but they are providing a nasty coda to the life of a man whose books , which sold 8 million copies in 17 languages , are alternately viewed as fact , metaphor or hoax admirers say the areas of dispute , most famously whether the purported shaman and brujo \( witch \) don juan matus ever existed , are peripheral to the real issues castaneda explored in his books carlos knew exactly what was true and what was not true , said angela panaro , of cleargreen inc , the group that marketed castaneda s teachings and seminars near the end of his life but the thing that s missing when people talk about carlos is not whether don juan lived or not , or who lived in what house it s about becoming a voyager of awareness , about the 600 locations in the luminous egg of man where the assemblage point can shift , about the process of depersonalization he taught the luminous egg , assemblage point and processes of depersonalization are all part of the practice of tensegrity , a blend of meditation and movement exercises that castaneda taught in his final years as a way for people to break through the limitations of ordinary consciousness skeptics say they sum up a career characterized , in the end , by literate new age mumbo jumbo and artful deception even margaret runyan castaneda , who had been married to him , while admiring castaneda and his work , says she doubts don juan ever existed and believes his name came from mateus , the bubbly portuguese wine the couple used to drink carlos castaneda rocketed from obscure anthropology graduate student at the university of california at los angeles to instant , if elusive , celebrity in 1968 with the publication of the teachings of don juan a yaqui way of knowledge , a vivid account of the spiritual and pharmacological adventures he had with a whitehaired yaqui indian nagual or shaman , don juan matus he said he met don juan at a greyhound bus station in nogales , ariz , in the summer of 1960 when castaneda was doing research on medicinal plants used by indians of the southwest in that book its sequel , a separate reality , and eight others , he described his apprenticeship to don juan and a spiritual journey in which he saw giant insects , learned to fly and grew a beak as part of a process of breaking the hold of ordinary perception admirers saw his work as a gripping spiritual quest in the tradition of aldous huxley s doors of perception skeptics wondered how much was true but despite castaneda s obsessive pursuit of total anonymity he refused to be photographed or tape recorded and almost never gave interviews he became a figure of international notoriety , and the books continued to sell well after his vogue passed 'the magic is in the movement' in recent years he surfaced with a new vision , the teaching of ten segrity , which is described on the cleargreen web site as the modernized version of some movements called magical passes developed by indian shamans who lived in mexico in times prior to the spanish conquest he even made public appearances and spoke at seminars promoting the work tensegrity , its organizers say , allows followers to perceive pure energy , zillions of energy fields in the form of luminous filaments and break the chains of normal cognition unknown to customers who turned out for the seminars which cost 600 and more , where they could buy mr castaneda s books , 2995 videos and tensegrity tshirts reading , the magic is in the movement castaneda was dying of cancer while describing his route to vibrant good health indeed , although only his inner circle knew about it for two months , he died on april 27 at his home , surrounded by high hedges in westwood , a welltodo section of los angeles , where he lived for many years with some of the selfdescribed witches , stalkers , dreamers and spiritual seekers who shared his work at a brief hearing in probate court in los angeles last week , the man whom castaneda for many years called his son challenged the will castaneda apparently signed four days before his death the judge , john b mcilroy , set a hearing date of oct 15 for the case

this is the question being asked by the sagaponack homeowners association , an ad hoc group of wealthy residents who are challenging the town s goahead for mr rennert s project , granted in the dead of winter when his prospective neighbors were 100 miles away in manhattan mr rennert s grandiose plans have produced protest and speculation among the masters of the universe who summer here , where private tennis courts are commonplace , squadrons of gardeners tend manicured lawns and the neighborhood market sells lobster salad for 40 a pound the homeowners have raised 70 , 000 to plead their case on two fronts before the town s zoning board of appeals , which held a hearing tonight , and in state supreme court , where a trial date will be set after the board rules in both venues they contend that mr rennert , a reclusive industrialist with a passion for orthodox jewish causes , has misrepresented his plans , claiming to build a residence in order to avoid municipal scrutiny when he actually intends the complex for a religious school or conference center i do n't care what it is , said joe zicherman , a money manager who can see the clouds of construction dust and hear the growl of trucks from his own fouracre hideaway , where he trades stock in bare feet and bermuda shorts , a cuban cigar clenched in his teeth i just know what it is not it is not a onefamily house as the land clearing goes ahead , much of the talk at the post office and the sagg main general store is wild and scurrilous rumor but some of the neighbors' concerns are grounded in the plans for the complex mr zicherman , who donated 10 , 000 to the homeowners' association , worried that 8 , 800 square feet of the main house had no specified use he could be building , for all i know , a nuclear reactor , mr zicherman said he also wondered , given local concerns about the water supply , whether i'm going to have water to shower after mrs rennert waters her 17 acres of english gardens nancy berman , who is building a 4 , 000squarefoot house adjacent to the rennert property , nearly wept at the prospect of overlooking his power plant , garage and garbage area and the author linda bird francke , whose 2 , 500squarefoot home also overlooks the rennert spread , feared that the high beams of security lights in her eyes would keep her from enjoying the glow of the silvery moon mr rennert , a 63yearold brooklyn native , has refused all invitations to meet his neighbors or speak to reporters his only comment has been a twoparagraph letter to the southampton press , promising to use the property as a private residence for the use and enjoyment of my family mr rennert paid 11 million for the land his filings estimate construction costs at 3 million , but independent experts say the project will cost anywhere from 30 million to 100 million , depending on the detail his lawyers conceded that the residence , made of limestone in the classic style of the frick museum , is the largest they had ever seen but that does not make it illegal , they said , nor does its system of service structures , which are more common to commercial buildings the battle began in earnest when 300 people mobbed the town hall in southampton for tonight s hearing , an event unprecedented in both size and passion instead of the usual requests for variances for swimming pools or garden sheds , the fivemember appeals board faced a battery of lawyers , engineers , landuse experts and citizens armed with architectural renderings , thick reports , aerial photos and no end of outrage john f shea , the lawyer for the homeowners' association , framed the debate by asking if mr rennert would be allowed to build a car wash or an office building on his property , as long as he said he would live in it with his wife and three grown children his question drew grins from the board members , who have the legal authority to revoke the building permits if the board feels the permits were granted in error association members begged the board to rule boldly , despite concern by the town elders that mr rennert will sue if his plans are thwarted then a parade of expert witnesses took the project apart one discussed the construction methods , sanitary and plumbing facilities , kitchen , laundry and mechanical systems and concluded that they were comparable to those of a hotel or conference center
ben boucher looked in the mirror several months ago and decided that he did not want to be bald like his father so , like millions of other balding men , mr boucher , a 25yearold animator in montreal who is a long way from losing his hair , picked up a prescription for propecia , merck company s hair growth pill , and awaited the results i ca n't say that i 've actually grown more hair , said mr boucher , who has plenty of long hair but has lost some around the edges but propecia has stopped my hair from falling out and i'm happy for that mr boucher does have his reservations he does not like having to take propecia once a day , at some 50 for a month s supply at first , he had been worried about a possible loss of sexual desire , one of the drug s side effects the experiences of mr boucher and others illustrate why socalled life style drugs like propecia have had a mixed sales record so far unlike traditional medications that relieve pain or cure an illness , these drugs typically help people feel good about themselves , including their hair lines and sex lives for many potential customers of life style drugs , the price of a dose of selfesteem may be a little too high life style drugs were once considered potentially bigger blockbusters than those that treated diseases indeed , some pharmaceutical executives believed that to be big sellers , life style drugs merely had to prevent a condition from growing worse instead of curing it but that has proved overly optimistic while some life style drugs most notably viagra , pfizer inc s impotency pill have generated huge worldwide sales , many others have yet to live up to expectations propecia , for example , had only 45 million in united states sales through the third quarter , roughly a third of what analysts had originally projected sales of nicotrol , johnson johnson s smoking cessation product , are off 479 percent this last year , while sales of nicoderm , smithkline beecham plc s patch , have fallen 128 percent such disappointments illustrate how life style drugs can be much more difficult to sell than traditional medications for one , insurance companies seldom pay for them , severely limiting the likelihood of repeat uses and consumers have come to expect more from life style drugs than they do from treatments for other ailments life style drugs must not only work quickly to justify their upfront costs , they must also be generally free of side effects to avoid turning off potential customers if the drug does not meet these expectations , patients can immediately stop using them with little downside , since the ailments that life style drugs treat are far from life threatening most of these products are viewed , fairly or unfairly , as being on the fringes of medicine , said neil sweig , a pharmaceuticals analyst with southeast research partners there s some controversy surrounding them if they have not been released to cure arthritis or some other disease they are just not considered part of the mainstream part of the problem is that many consumers associate life style drugs with overthecounter wrinkle creams , hairgrowth potions and the like earlier experiences with goops , tonics and gimmicks have made these consumers skeptical about life style drugs unless they provide measurable improvements that is not always easy to find , said david saks , a managing director of gruntal company who tracks the pharmaceutical industry you can tell when viagra is working , but most take some time it would be great that you could take a pill to grow hair in the morning and by the afternoon you 'd look like a model for gq huge advertising campaigns have not been enough to stir up enthusiasm to advertise propecia , the tracking service competitive media reporting says , merck spent 39 million through july more than 80 percent of the drug s sales in the same period yet , despite the difficulties in marketing life style drugs , pharmaceutical companies ca n't seem to roll them out fast enough the scheringplough corporation , pending regulatory approval , will market vasomax , another pill for impotence , with the help of zonagen , a tiny texas biotechnology company tap , a unit of takeda chemical industries , hopes to introduce a fastacting tablet for impotence that is placed under the tongue , while the bristolmyers squibb company is working on a compound to remove sun spots the prospect of finding another blockbuster like viagra or zyban , glaxo wellcome plc s smoking cessation pill , is generating the sudden glut drug makers can pocket more revenue from feelgood treatments than they can from some treatments for cancer and heart disease although viagra s sales have recently begun to slow , its 1 billion take this year should be onethird more than that of gemzar , eli lilly company s popular anticancer drug drug companies can also usher in more innovations with life style drugs than with their traditional diseasefighting staples before glaxo wellcome introduced zyban in june 1997 , the entire smoking cessation market consisted of inhalers , gum or patches by introducing a twiceaday pill , smokers had a convenient choice they apparently liked sales of zyban reached 836 million in the united states through june , some 50 percent more than many analysts had projected
new delhi , friday , may 29 pakistan responded to india s nuclear tests on thursday with underground nuclear tests of its own within hours , prime minister nawaz sharif declared his country a nuclear power , fulfilling a secret plan made by a predecessor nearly 30 years ago that pakistan would build an islamic bomb in announcing that it had conducted five underground nuclear tests , pakistan s first , the islamabad government simultaneously said it was already fitting nuclear warheads on a type of missile said to be able to strike targets across most of north and central india the news set off pandemonium in the indian parliament , which had been hotly debating india s recent nuclear tests the announcement raised the specter of retaliation by india , pakistan s archrival , which said after it conducted five tests of its own two weeks ago that it would begin fitting nuclear warheads on a range of missiles , including several developed specifically for targets in pakistan today , we have evened the score with india , mr sharif announced in a solemn television address about three hours after the tests , which were carried out at 3 30 pm thursday \( 6 30 am thursday , eastern time \) at a testing range in the chagai hills , a desert region in the remote southwest , close to the borders with afghanistan and iran as he spoke , pakistanis poured into the streets to dance and fire guns in the air , and crowds jammed mosques to offer prayers early today , mr sharif s government declared a national state of emergency , further heightening the sense of crisis that has gripped the subcontinent since the first indian nuclear tests on may 11 the statement was issued shortly after midnight by the titular president , mohammed rafiq tarar , acting under constitutional provisions that may be invoked when pakistan s security falls under threat of external aggression it was not clear whether mr sharif intended to go further , by curbing civil rights , suspending parliament or taking other measures that pakistan has often resorted to in its 50 years as a nation officials in pakistan said privately that they did not expect such moves , but noted that mr sharif would need emergency powers to respond quickly if india reacted to the pakistan tests by actions that push the two countries closer to a military confrontation tremors from pakistan s tests registered at seismic centers as far away as australia , sweden and the united states , although american intelligence officials said pakistan had probably tested only two weapons rather than the five announced pakistan described its tests as a complete success , but offered no details about the types of weapons involved or their explosive power but a separate government statement said the ghauri missile , testfired on april 6 , was already being capped with nuclear warheads to give a befitting reply to any misadventure by the enemy , meaning india some indian officials have said it was the ghauri test that touched off the tests ordered by india s hindu nationalistled government president clinton , who had made the last of five telephone calls appealing for restraint from mr sharif only hours before the tests , quickly announced that the united states would impose the same package of economic sanctions on pakistan that it applied to india after its tests the sanctions include a suspension of american economic aid , a ban on american bank loans to government institutions and pressure for a cutoff of aid from the international monetary fund and world bank , which have propped up pakistan s debtladen , enfeebled economy for years i cannot believe , mr clinton said that we are about to start the 21st century by having the indian subcontinent repeat the worst mistakes of the 20th century , when we know it is not necessary to peace , to security , to prosperity , to national greatness , or to personal fulfillment when the first shouted word of pakistan s tests has heard in the indian parliament , a communist leader , somnath chatterjee , interrupted a speech condemning india s tests and addressed himself directly to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee , the hindu nationalist leader who approved the indian tests you have started a nuclear arms race in this region , he said mr vajpayee left the chamber to check with other officials , returning quickly to make a statement if this is true , then india s policy has been vindicated , he said later , mr vajpayee rejected suggestions that india had set off a nuclear spiral , saying it had acted only because of concern about pakistan s covert nuclear program in fact , pakistan forced us to take the path of nuclear deterrence , he said he did not rule out retaliation india is ready to meet any challenge , he said asked if india might set aside the moratorium on nuclear testing it declared after its tests , mr vajpayee replied , a new situation has been created , and it will be taken into account in formulating our policy the tests set off widespread alarm around the world , with statements of condemnation from russia , china , britain and a score of other nations , some of which , including japan , australia , germany and sweden , announced economic sanctions of their own against pakistan many economists predicted that the sanctions , especially if they include a cutoff in emergency loans from the international monetary fund that have repeatedly staved off bankruptcy for pakistan , could be a body blow to an economy that has staggered from crisis to crisis for decades
funds are closing at a record rate this year but according to a new report issued by the kobren insight group , a lot more of them ought to be slamming their doors kobren insight , an investment management firm in wellesley hills , mass , lists 11 funds that for various reasons it said should be closed to new investors the reasons cited in the report run the gamut from overdiversification to an inability to maneuver quickly what s surprising is the number of highperformance , highprofile funds that make the list , among them janus , vanguard windsor ii , fidelity equityincome and mutual discovery our research suggests that many funds have grown very large , and their size may begin to have an impact on their performance , said edward r goldfarb , portfolio strategist for kobren insight none of these are panic sells , but shareholders would benefit from sponsors closing the fund and focusing on maximizing the return on existing assets , he said fund companies are often loath to close even those funds that have swollen asset bases because the fees they receive are figured as a percentage of assets under management the larger the fund , the bigger the fund company s pay check indeed , not one fund company plans to close a fund named on kobren insight s list and despite their size , some of these funds are still performing well in fact , several are rated strong buys in kobren insight s investment newsletters , the firm s highest rating one such fund is fidelity equityincome it held 248 billion in assets as of may 31 , but its performance remains strong and kobren insight rates it a strong buy but given a good alternative , mr goldfarb said , kobren insight will always recommend a smaller fund over one of the behemoths mr goldfarb , for instance , favors warburg pincus growth and income for investors looking for a solid growth and income offering warburg pincus holds less than 1 billion , which gives manager brian s posner , who used to manage fidelity equityincome ii , opportunities that the fidelity fund is just too large to grab , mr goldfarb said the strategies are similar , although the warburg fund is slightly more value oriented than the fidelity fund , he added kobren insight rates these five funds as holds , even though it said they would benefit from closing twentieth century ultra , janus , kaufmann fund , pbhg growth and acorn mr goldfarb said investors should not scramble to buy shares if these funds announce they will close to new investors he added that there s no point in dumping shares , either , if you hold them in a taxable account and have large unrealized gains twentieth century ultra uses an earnings momentum strategy that often requires the fund to trade quickly in response to earnings disappointments or rejiggered forecasts at 26 billion , it may soon be too large to move nimbly , mr goldfarb said gunnar hughes , a spokesman for american century , which runs twentieth century ultra , said the fund has more good investment ideas now than the money to buy them , and has experienced no liquidity problems the 22 billion janus fund is not only a giant in its own right , it also owns many of the same stocks as other janus funds in the aggregate , then , janus managers may have trouble moving large blocks of stock without affecting market prices , mr goldfarb said moreover , the 14 billion janus worldwide is still accepting new investments , while janus overseas was closed at just 43 billion earlier this year at the time , helen young hayes , who runs both funds , said she was concerned that significant cash coming into the overseas fund would make her job more difficult why not close the larger fund , too , mr goldfarb asked a janus spokeswoman responded that worldwide can own united states stocks as well as foreign stocks , and that makes it easier for ms hayes to maneuver it is especially important for smallcap stock funds to keep their asset bases small , according to mr goldfarb when these funds expand , they often tend to start buying midcap stocks they also begin to move more sluggishly , handicapped by their larger size kaufmann is a clear example , said mr goldfarb its performance has suffered as assets rose to today s 64 billion a fund official declined to comment the 41 billion acorn fund also owns much larger stocks than it used to , although its manager , ralph wanger , blames that on the appreciation of the stock market , which he says has gotten stupidly overpriced at the 53 billion pbhg growth fund , liquidity is a concern , because the fund needs to be able to move quickly to execute a strategy driven by earnings momentum , mr goldfarb said gary pilgrim , the manager , said liquidity is less of a problem at lowerturnover funds like his the 43 billion mutual discovery fund has moved to midcap names in the united states , and its size will lessen its ability to buy the smaller european stocks that had bolstered its performance , mr goldfarb says robert friedman , a manager of the fund , conceded that discovery has moved into midcap stocks , but noted that these tend to be less volatile he also said that managers have more clout with such companies , and so can pressure them into making shareholderfriendly moves finally , sheer size reduces a fund s ability to benefit shareholders by buying midcap and smallercap stocks , especially when funds balloon to 20 billion or more , mr goldfarb said funds in this position include the 266 billion vanguard windsor ii and fidelity s 187 billion equityincome ii fund , which mr goldfarb nonetheless rates as buys because of their strong managers but he advised investors to select smaller alternatives , if available a vanguard spokesman noted that windsor ii is run by four different managers who trade independently , adding flexibility that other large funds may lack a fidelity spokesman said the company would close its funds if it were in the best interest of shareholders t rowe price international stock fund s 106 billion in assets have forced it to own a large number of stocks , and lose flexibility , according to mr goldfarb but steve norwitz , a price spokesman , said size is not an issue because the fund owns large companies and is diversified internationally chart too big for their own good \? kobren insight group issued a report stating these 11

scarsdale writing biographies of the living can be risky business , especially when the subject is as full of contradictions as gloria steinem , the founder of ms magazine and perhaps america s most wellknown feminist sydney ladensohn stern s second book , an unauthorized biography , gloria steinem her passions , politics and mystique , was published earlier this month by birch lane press asked recently about the experience of writing about the woman she calls feminism s deadliest weapon , ms stern wrapped herself in a blanket to ward off the chill in her rambling 1878 brownshingled victorian home here and said with a laugh in biography , stick with the dead the worst part about doing a living subject is that they fight back ms stern has worked as a reporter for fortune and money magazines , as an editor and columnist at the scarsdale inquirer and as a journalist whose first book , toyland the highstakes game of the toy industry , was a featured alternate of both the bookofthemonth club and the fortune book club yet none of her experiences prepared ms stern for the moment when ms steinem got up off the pages , just like in the woody allen movie when he walks off the screen , and became a person , protesting and hurt and upset and angry it was very difficult an ardent feminist , reproductive rights activist and longterm member of the board of planned parenthood of westchester rockland , ms stern found writing ms steinem s life story the perfect project not only was ms steinem a complex personality courageous yet vulnerable , beautiful but insecure , ambitious but generous , intelligent yet sometimes willfully blind but researching ms steinem s history also allowed ms stern to relive an important milestone in her own life the feminist revolution the author s family , including her husband , john , who works in the securities business , and her two sons , ken , 23 , and toby , 18 , did not enjoy the process as much as she did when i was reliving a lot of the history of the women s movement , i 'd get so angry , and , of course , my household is all male , ms stern said i think they did feel a little under the gun they got a bit defensive it was kind of funny after signing her contract with carol publishing in september 1994 , ms stern began her research , reading the papers ms steinem had donated to smith college and conducting more than 200 interviews with friends , associates and lovers like the olympic gold medalist rafer johnson and the novelist stanley pottinger ms steinem s assistants faxed her schedule to ms stern so she was able to attend a lot of her public appearances that was really an important part of researching who gloria steinem is , what she means and what her role is , ms stern said because gloria in person , in public she s an icon , she s a symbol , she communicates so extraordinarily , and i believe that has been one of her major contributions she has done things that no one else could do and if this book does anything , i hope it will show that she has been a real leader to call her an icon is shortchanging her ms stern felt fortunate when ms steinem herself agreed to be interviewed many unauthorized biographers are not talked to by their subjects , you know , ms stern said if the subject ca n't control it , they wo n't talk to them in the first place she was extraordinarily helpful and very generous with her time eventually ms stern spent 50 hours interviewing her subject , 15 long interviews of three or four hours each , from the end of august 1995 through may 1996 but before she submitted to the interviews ms steinem required ms stern and her publisher to sign an agreement i 've worked on a number of biographies , and this was absolutely unique , said hillel black , editorial director of carol publishing and sydney stern s editor in order for sydney to get access to gloria we signed an agreement allowing gloria to read all the manuscript and to question any facts she felt were inaccurate if there was a dispute over accuracy , i would be the final arbiter that allowed us to retain full control of the manuscript what was interesting in the process was that gloria tried to rewrite the manuscript she had a view of herself , which we all do of ourselves , where facts did not necessarily agree with the image she wanted to project chapters on ms steinem s work with the recoveredmemory movement , rumors of central intelligence agency financing after college and questions about how much her friend mort zuckerman helped finance ms magazine became subjects of negotiation between ms steinem , ms stern and mr black in addition , ms steinem duplicated the manuscript and sent out pages all over the country and even overseas soliciting changes from others mentioned in the book ms stern only learned what was happening when she began receiving some of their responses , which ranged from helpful suggestions to harsh criticism by that time march of last year ms stern was familiar with what she referred to as history according to gloria , the penchant of ms steinem to portray herself as less pretty , less of a celebrity , more leftist and poorer than is the case still ms stern was surprised at the extent to which ms steinem felt she was entitled to rewrite her life story
new rochelle , ny the new coach was the most celebrated player the school ever had , and his motherinlaw lives right down the road so while the position of head basketball coach at iona college is far more vocation than it is community service , this is also a story about roots , about making it at home , about knowing where to go when there s no place to park the mcdonald s lot that s where jeff ruland dumped the car yesterday morning then he walked across north street and was officially given his first head coaching job by a man whose responsibility it once was to hand him his towel i do think there s something nice about having someone from your own place , said rich petriccione , who promoted ruland from his assistant s job after tim welsh cashed in on a threeyear , 7022 run and climbed the coaching ladder to providence this is iona s athletic director also speaking from personal experience when ruland confounded national recruiting circles in 1977 by choosing jim valvano and iona over joe b hall and kentucky , petriccione happened to be enrolling out of cardinal hayes high school and beginning a fouryear run as basketball team manager on their first iona goround , petriccione outlasted ruland by two degrees bachelor s and graduate to none ruland did n't much need the certificate when he was bulling his way to the basket for the washington bullets and making two allstar teams in the process , but after a trade to philadelphia , a knee injury wrecked ruland s career and he retired a decade ago , when he was just 29 petriccione , by this time working for pat kennedy at florida state , offered some counseling he would never have dared to when ruland ruled iona s mulcahy center i want to coach , ruland told him first go back to class , petriccione said get your degree at 30 , financially secure but hardly ceorich , ruland had to confront his old iona scholarship that he had victimized with neglect petriccione said , jeff would be the first to admit he was a little immature back then ruland s wife , maureen , whom he met at iona , added that he did n't have as many credits as he thought he did three years of college had left him 70 credits short ruland swallowed a lifetime of pride and reenrolled , sitting in classes with students a decade younger than him early each monday , he would leave his wife and the first two of his three daughters at their home in southern new jersey he would attend class for three days and nights , stay in yonkers with his motherinlaw , catherine larkin school never excited me , ruland said i did that for a year and a half , and it was hard since being back at iona , he has told his players , if i can do it , so can you he mentioned yesterday how proud he is of having earned his communications degree and of making dean s list a man seemingly indisposed to tears , ruland sounded for a moment to be on the verge he grew up a poor white kid in farmingville , long island , his father dying when he was a small boy , his mother struggling as the owner of a small bar on many levels , personal and professional , he believes his story will resonate with future iona recruits , many with backgrounds much like his why should they choose iona \? he did why should they dare to dream \? he did , and his iona team once beat louisville , a national champion , and nearly made it to the final four why should they believe he will not run off 20 minutes after his first winning season makes him a commodity for proverbial state u \? he is stating , unequivocally , that he has no aspirations to coach in college anyplace else of course , ruland conceded he could leave for the pros , presuming a nice run at iona given what larry bird and danny ainge make , petriccione said that would not be objectionable even if it is just for a few years , he said , it will be comforting to have a coach whose first daily order of business is n't to check the college want ads the wanton contract jumping by coaches is a blight on the sport maybe more of these schools need to start hiring those with strong community or campus ties , like clyde drexler , recently named coach at the university of houston ruland certainly has sacrificed for iona , as he recently recalled during the national tournament , when he stepped into an empty but regal rupp arena in lexington before the gaels' firstround game and roared , i gave this up for mulcahy center ! as of yesterday , the blue grass was n't greener anymore photo jeff ruland \( vic delucia the new york times \)
deja vu \? early public opinion surveys in 1982 had edward koch 30 to 35 points ahead of mario cuomo in the race for the democratic nomination for governor mr koch , in the first year of his second term as mayor , was by far the better known of the two men at that time mr cuomo was hugh carey s lieutenant governor and had never won an election on his own none of that mattered mr cuomo won the primary by a margin of 53 to 47 go back a couple of years before that , to the 1980 democratic primary for the senate seat held by jacob javits one of the candidates was elizabeth holtzman , a young congresswoman from brooklyn the candidate favored by most of the polls was bess myerson , who was famous , glamorous and rich , and had the support of mr koch , mr carey and the state s other senator , daniel patrick moynihan ms myerson had everything going for her but the voters she lost the primary to ms holtzman \( who then went out and lost the general election to the presiding supervisor of hempstead , li , alfonse d'amato \) in the 1992 democratic primary for the senate seat that was still held by mr d'amato , the heavy favorite was the very well known and presumably very popular geraldine ferraro during the summer she had a doubledigit lead over her closest challenger , robert abrams one poll had ms ferraro ahead by 14 points she lost a year later , in the race for the democratic nomination for city comptroller , alan hevesi was so little known he began his campaign commercials with the words , alan who \? he barely showed up in the polls a midsummer quinnipiac college poll had 56 percent of the respondents favoring the incumbent , elizabeth holtzman , and 30 percent favoring herman badillo only a minuscule 4 percent said they would vote for mr hevesi the last time i looked , he was the comptroller you 'd do better betting blind in a casino than riding the favorite in democratic primary polls in new york one of the problems , according to hank morris , a democratic political consultant , is that most polls , especially the early ones , fail to zero in on those who are most likely to vote in a primary mr morris is the furthest thing from a disinterested observer he is the media adviser for representative charles schumer , who is running last in the polls in this year s threeway race for the democratic senate nomination nevertheless , mr morris has a point there are about 49 million registered democrats in the state in 1992 only 11 million voted in the democratic senate primary the men and women who vote in primaries are generally better informed about the candidates and the issues , and are less likely to vote solely on the basis of name recognition this is how frontrunners get hurt on election day a random sampling of the entire population of registered democrats , most of whom are not going to vote , is bound to gather a lot of information that is irrelevant mr schumer s camp hopes this is especially true this year both of the congressman s opponents , ms ferraro and the city s public advocate , mark green , are better known than he is the early polls showed ms ferraro with a commanding lead that has eroded somewhat , but she is still well ahead , and both she and mr green are polling higher than mr schumer a confidential campaign report that is circulating among schumer supporters urges the faithful not to be fooled it says that a reliable poll by tubby harrison of harrison goldberg shows the congressman in a dead heat with ms ferraro among likely voters , and significantly ahead of mr green whether this poll is reliable or not , the ferraro camp would be wise to reconsider its strategy of coasting on the candidate s name recognition and poll numbers the political landscape , said mark mellman , who is advising the green campaign , is littered with frontrunners who ended up losing in two or three months , all three candidates are going to be equally well known and democratic voters are likely to be skeptical of ms ferraro s claim that by virtue of her fame and her standing in the polls she is the only one who can beat mr d'amato , and thus should be handed the nomination
san diego , may 11 al leiter and kevin brown pitched here tonight as if it were a grudge match the only real difference between the former teammates on last season s world series champion florida marlins was a bloop single and a baserunning mistake both came in the eighth inning of a 11 game , and they were enough to give brown and the san diego padres a 21 victory over leiter and the mets the baserunning gaffe belonged to the mets' alberto castillo , who was thrown out trying to stretch a oneout double into a triple with the bases empty the bloop belonged to the padres' wally joyner , and it came with two outs and runners on first and second it dropped in front of left fielder preston wilson to score tony gwynn from second and give san diego the victory , ending the mets' fourgame winning streak afterward , mets manager bobby valentine said he thought castillo had been overzealous wilson , who was playing in only his third major league game , said he lost the ball in the lights both mistakes cost leiter dearly in what he called a bit of a friendly rivalry he allowed just five hits and two runs in eight innings , walking three and striking out eight his earned run average is 139 , still the best in the major leagues with a little luck , leiter could be 51 instead , he is now 32 tonight , although both pitchers were brilliant , brown \( 32 \) was just a little bit better he allowed four hits and one run in eight innings , walking none and striking out six trevor hoffman pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 10th save brown , the ace of the marlin staff last season , nearly surrendered a home run to brian mcrae on the game s first pitch but gwynn reached over the fence in right field to rob mcrae , and brown was pretty much unhittable from there on through six innings , only john olerud and carlos baerga had hits off the padres' ace they came leading off the second olerud s a twostrike single up the middle , and baerga s a bloop single to right that dropped in front of gwynn , who just missed throwing out olerud at second brown was able to shatter the bat of the next hitter , butch huskey but the bat and the ball reached third baseman archi cianfrocco at almost the same time apparently flustered , cianfrocco decided to throw to first instead of tagging olerud , who had pulled up next to him and so the mets had runners on second and third with one out that brought up castillo , the mets' catcher with todd hundley , tim spehr and todd pratt all on the disabled list on an 01 pitch , valentine put on the suicide squeeze olerud , who has been hampered by a groin strain , did not appear to get much of a jump , and castillo bunted the ball hard to brown but brown could not come up with it cleanly , and olerud scored as brown threw out castillo at first it was five more innings before the mets got another hit , and by then it was a 11 game again , it came from olerud , who is batting 352 baerga was then robbed by joyner , the first baseman , who jumped to glove a line drive over the bag and double up olerud to end the inning leiter , who started game 7 of the world series for the marlins last fall , was mowing down padres nearly as quickly as brown was taking care of the mets in the first , leiter struck out gwynn swinging , after gwynn the national league s leading hitter with a 377 average had struck out only twice in 130 previous atbats like brown , leiter allowed only one run through seven innings , and it came in the second greg vaughn led off with a double inside the third base bag and took third after mcrae ran down a wellhit ball from joyner in leftcenter field but after leiter struck out carlos hernandez on three pitches , cianfrocco doubled over third past a diving matt franco to even the score inside pitch for the first time in a month , ralph kiner was back in the mets' broadcast booth monday night the 75yearold kiner is recovering from bell s palsy , a nerve affliction , and had taken some time off to be with his wife , diann , who has bone cancer pitcher mel rojas remained in new york with his wife , ceserina , who suffered a miscarriage last weekend rojas was expected to rejoin the team in san diego on tuesday the mets are still looking for a catcher , but general manager steve phillips said , i'm not sure i 'd make a deal for someone if it was just for two weeks

cloudsplitter by russell banks 758 pp new york harper flamingo harpercollins publishers 2750 russell banks s cloudsplitter , a novel of nearbiblical proportions about the abolitionist freedom fighter john brown , is shaped like an explosive with an exceedingly long and winding fuse the bomb part , the part that explodes , is a compact , climactic account of brown s famous raid on harpers ferry in 1859 , when a few determined christian soldiers and their fiercely pious general sought to provoke an uprising of slaves by capturing a federal arsenal and liberating its weapons for their cause the uprising never materialized , of course , and brown was later captured and executed , but it is banks s contention and that of most historians that the aborted raid led ineluctably to a larger , more cataclysmic battle the american civil war seldom in history have one man s actions been so grandly catalytic the novel s spark is slow to ignite and travels a twisting path before it fully combusts the story is narrated by owen brown , john brown s third son and comrade in arms in response to an inquiry about his father from a university historian , the now aged owen , a california sheepherder living a hermit s existence in the mountains , pores back over his early life as son , disciple and , finally , foot soldier in his father s homegrown crusade against slavery his intention is not to revise but to personalize what owen expansively refers to as the long , savage war between the white race and the black race is , for him and his siblings , a family matter smelling of leather and blood and wool , john brown is not just owen s father but his prophet a strict , imposing , hebraic patriarch who takes his orders directly from jehovah and seems to stand upon a private mount sinai when he hands them down brown has boiled the ten commandments down to one stern message thou shalt not enslave in his old testament vision of america , the land has been poisoned by the sin of racialism and must be cleansed by violence , if necessary beside his abolitionist contemporaries quaker pacifists , boston philosophers and new york journalists brown is a crude and primitive avenger in a world of feeble moral dilettantes the man had read every word of his bible hundreds of times nothing human beings did with or to one another or themselves shocked him only slavery shocked him to his children , who follow him through frontier america like a band of nomadic israelites , john brown is an unmoved mover his authority is absolute , and sometimes absolutely maddening a stockman and surveyor by trade , brown is as eager to make a worldly fortune as to pile up riches in heaven , but his business sense and his religious fanaticism work at cross purposes inspired by a vision of interracial civic harmony , he moves the family to the adirondacks and homesteads near a place called timbuctoo , a colony of free black farmers , only to become preoccupied with smuggling refugee slaves into canada later , brown hatches a scheme to warehouse wool and sell it in england at a premium price , but this plan , too , breaks down profits and prophecy do n't mix for brown , who goes on insisting , against all evidence , that once his joblike tribulations end god will reward him with redoubled riches cloudsplitter is a domestic drama at heart , not a historical saga banks is the author of 12 previous works of fiction , most of them on contemporary domestic themes this book s battles are fought mostly in owen s head , and its fundamental issue is n't slavery but the challenge of living with a fanatic for secular owen , this means chronic shame , an existential funk that does n't lift introverted , doubtful and selfaccusatory , owen is a spiritual tagalong when he steals a watch , his father lashes him 12 times , then hands him the strap and demands a harsher beating for having raised a thief on a trip to europe , owen stands off to the side as his father paces the battlefield at waterloo , speechifying about napoleon as though the emperor and he were peers banks wisely resists psychologizing this relationship , at least in modern terms the dynamic between owen and his father is beyond dysfunctional or abusive it s more like a geological condition , as if the father were a massive earthquake and the son a minor aftershock the only analysis banks indulges in is moral analysis his subject is motives , not minds yet there was so much that i could not understand about this man , my father , and the life we led because of him my thoughts , my questions , were blocked , occluded by the absolute rightness of his cause , which none of us could question , ever and by the sheer power of father s personality , the relentlessness of it , how it wore us down , until we seemed to have no personalities of our own , even to each other the cost of the father s righteousness treated by banks as a religious mystery rather than a neurosis is poverty , madness and death for his children owen s brother fred , a pious simpleton , castrates himself rather than give in to unclean impulses owen , too , becomes sexually distraught , though the nature of his lust is left unclear a bachelor whose only erotic experience is a hasty contact with a prostitute , owen becomes attached over time to one of his father s black confidants , lyman epps as well as deeply attracted to epps s wife the chemistry is racial , not physical repulsed and attracted by epps s otherness , owen grows distracted , hostile and envious , and ends up accidentally killing his friend by giving him a cocked pistol to hold the wages of ambivalence are death unlike his father , who is spiritually black , his conscience blasted clean by god s pure light , owen is a guilty , conflicted white man a faint masondixon line divides his soul

frank sinatra , the singer and actor whose extraordinary voice elevated popular song into an art , died on thursday night in los angeles he was 82 the cause was a heart attack , said his publicity agent , susan reynolds ms reynolds said his fourth wife , barbara , his son , frank jr , and daughters , tina and nancy , were at his side at cedarssinai medical center she said he would be given a private funeral widely held to be the greatest singer in american pop history and one of the most successful entertainers of the 20th century , sinatra was also the first modern pop superstar he defined that role in the early 1940 s when his first solo appearances provoked the kind of mass pandemonium that later greeted elvis presley and the beatles during a show business career that spanned more than 50 years and comprised recordings , film and television as well as countless performances in nightclubs , concert halls and sports arenas , sinatra stood as a singular mirror of the american psyche his evolution from the idealistic crooner of the early 1940 s to the sophisticated swinger of the 50 s and 60 s seemed to personify the country s loss of innocence during world war ii , sinatra s tender romanticism served as the dreamy emotional link between millions of women and their husbands and boyfriends fighting overseas reinventing himself in the 50 s , the starryeyed boy next door turned into the cosmopolitan man of the world , a bruised romantic with a toughguy streak and a song for every emotional season in a series of brilliant conceptual albums , he codified a musical vocabulary of adult relationships with which millions identified the haunted voice heard on a jukebox in the wee small hours of the morning lamenting the end of a love affair was the same voice that jubilantly invited the world to come fly with me to exotic realms in a neverending party sinatra appeared in 58 films , and won an academy award as best supporting actor for his portrayal of the feisty misfit soldier maggio in from here to eternity \( 1953 \) as an actor , he could communicate the same complex mixture of emotional honesty , vulnerability and cockiness that he projected as a singer , but he often chose his roles indifferently or unwisely it was as a singer that he exerted the strongest cultural influence following his idol bing crosby , who had pioneered the use of the microphone , sinatra transformed popular singing by infusing lyrics with a personal , intimate point of view that conveyed a steady current of eroticism the skinny blueeyed crooner , quickly nicknamed the voice , made hordes of bobbysoxers swoon in the 1940 s with an extraordinarily smooth and flexible baritone that he wielded with matchless skill his mastery of longlined phrasing inspired imitations by many other male crooners , notably dick haymes , vic damone and tony bennett in the 1940 s and 50 s and most recently the pop jazz star harry connick jr after the voice lost its velvety youthfulness , sinatra s interpretations grew more personal and idiosyncratic , so that each performance became a direct expression of his personality and his mood of the moment in expressing anger , petulance and bravado attitudes that had largely been excluded from the acceptable vocabulary of pop feeling sinatra paved the way for the unfettered vocal aggression of rock singers the changes in sinatra s vocal timbre coincided with a precipitous career descent in the late 1940 s and early 50 s but in 1953 , sinatra made one of the most spectacular career comebacks in show business history , reemerging as a coarservoiced , jazzier interpreter of popular standards who put a more aggressive personal stamp on his songs almost singlehandedly , he helped lead a revival of vocalized swing music that took american pop to a new level of musical sophistication coinciding with the rise of the longplaying record album , his 1950 s recordings along with ella fitzgerald s song book albums saluting individual composers were instrumental in establishing a canon of american pop song literature with nelson riddle , his most talented arranger , sinatra defined the criteria for sound , style and song selection in pop recording during the prebeatles era the aggressive uptempo style of sinatra s mature years spawned a genre of punchy , rhythmic belting associated with las vegas , which he was instrumental in establishing and popularizing as an entertainment capital by the late 1950 s , sinatra had become so much the personification of american show business success that his life and his art became emblematic of the temper of the times except perhaps for hugh hefner , the founder of playboy magazine , probably nobody did more to create a male ideal in the 1950 s for years , sinatra seemed the embodiment of the harddrinking , hedonistic swinger who could have his pick of women and who was the leader of a partyloving entourage that personality and wardrobe , borrowed in part from his friend jimmy van heusen , the talented songwriter and man about town who liked to insouciantly sling his raincoat over his shoulder , was , in turn , imitated by many other show business figures it was a style sinatra never entirely abandoned even in his later years , he would often stroll onto the stage with a drink in his hand

the film depicts wellknown figures like elizabeth i and christopher marlowe , as well as shakespeare , of course , in fictional situations the thing about shakespeare s life is no one knows anything , said mr madden , a 49yearold film and theatrical director and what s special about the movie s approach , i hope , is the way it gets behind the iconic nature of the persona and paraphernalia that is shakespeare now and deals with him in a fresh way , with a glorious mischievous attitude shakespeare , he said , should be treated almost as a pop writer who wrote for mass audiences
adam l barsky , the director of the mayor s office of operations , is proud of new york city s online efforts we are really the model for the country when you look at what we 've done with technology , mr barsky said enter the city s official web site \( www ci nyc ny us \) , and you 'll be greeted by a photograph of lower manhattan taken by none other than mayor giuliani the site provides information about the mayor s office and city agencies , updates on city events and attractions , schedules of public hearings , traffic advisories and the like there are also complaint forms that let visitors to the site gripe on line to appropriate officials about everything from cable television to pay phones to street lights want to nominate a city landmark for historic preservation , pick up a voter registration form , apply for a dog license or adopt a highway \? you can get the forms on the web site , print them out and mail them in but advocates for efficient government say new york could learn a lot from other cities that have found new ways to use the internet to expedite delivery of services there are certain things new york does reasonably well with their online approaches , but they certainly do n't lead the field in this , said richard delaney , president of the delaney policy group , a research and consulting company in washington that recently did a study for the citizens budget commission on hightech revenue collection in various cities across the united states what new york does well , mr delaney said , is provide information on line what they do n't do well , he said , is to respond to the interactive possibilities of the web the study found that new york could save up to 10 million a year by collecting taxes , fees and parking fines and issuing business licenses and building permits on line last march , indianapolis began accepting credit card payments for parking tickets on line since february 1997 , houston has allowed online filing of building permits in kern county , calif , a private company hired by the county has put a data base of propertytax assessments on the web if taxpayers want to challenge their assessments , they can use the data base to compare their properties with others new york city does operate 40 kiosks around the city that provide information about tax collection procedures and allow residents to pay parking tickets and real estate taxes with a credit card but will the city consider offering some online conveniences available elsewhere \? mr barsky , who said he found the citizen budget commission report useless , observed that the city had already been looking into several ideas suggested in it for example , he said , new yorkers will soon be able to pay parking tickets on line nina siegal
san diego , nov 30 this is how confident the denver broncos are cornerback darrien gordon was san diego s no 1 draft pick in 1993 and spent four years with the chargers before signing with the broncos as a free agent he came home on sunday , and in one of the best singlegame performances by a defensive back this season , he had three tackles , two interceptions , three passes knocked down and one fumble recovery most players would take the shy role after the game , playing down their performance , not wanting to attract attention to themselves gordon did the opposite , maybe because , deep down , he knows this team is unstoppable and it really does not matter what he says this is my house , gordon said , pointing to qualcomm stadium , home of the chargers i built this house coach mike shanahan usually scripts denver s opening 12 to 15 offensive plays on the broncos' first possession in their 3116 bashing of the chargers , quarterback john elway fumbled the snap the turnover was converted into a san diego field goal the chargers had momentum the record crowd of 66 , 523 was on its feet the stomach of most coaches might tighten up in a knot and those scripted plays would be tossed into the garbage but shanahan kept his cool he stuck to the script next possession , ed mccaffrey had a 15yard touchdown catch the possession after that , mccaffrey had a 37yard touchdown catch denver took back control of the game mike never loses his head , broncos defensive end neil smith said that s the biggest reason why we 're 120 twelve victories , no losses and , with four regularseason games to play , history is knocking at the door but if denver goes on to win all its remaining games , will the chargers game , one of the ugliest of the year , hurt the broncos' chances for being considered the greatest team ever \? one view is that the broncos are so good , they were able to overcome a first half in which elway threw three interceptions and the chargers outgained the broncos in total offense , 194 yards to 152 did you see every game the dolphins played \? the denver owner pat bowlen asked , referring to the 1972 miami team that went undefeated if at the end of the year we 're 190 , there s no reason you would n't consider this team one of the better teams in history , if not the greatest all great teams have bad games , but they find a way to win chargers coach june jones said i believe they are a very good football team maybe as good as i 've looked at offensively in the 20 years i 've been around the league the other view is that professional football has become so diluted , with 30 teams , that any potential denver claim to being the best will be weakened the chargers , who missed at least six starters because of injuries , are composed of some players who only months ago were playing football in europe they started a quarterback in craig whelihan who was 07 as a starter last season , and they still outgained denver , 367 yards to 322 , and limited running back terrell davis to 74 yards on 24 carries they 're beatable , said whelihan , whose five interceptions were the most by a chargers quarterback since dan fouts threw five in 1986 against the giants the chargers may have had the best chance to knock off denver because the broncos were not at their best this was the night to beat them , chargers general manager bobby beathard said denver has games at home against kansas city , at the giants , at miami and at home against seattle the only team with a winning record remaining on the broncos' schedule is 84 miami none of those teams have the offensive firepower to keep up with the broncos , who have outscored opponents in the first quarter , 13123 , and have a variety of weapons if elway is having a bad day , he can hand the ball off to davis if davis is slowed , elway can look for tight end shannon sharpe if sharpe is covered , there are wide receivers mccaffrey and rod smith , two pro bowl players the broncos were very good , chargers defensive back charles dimry said i think they 'll go 160 to close out the regular season
a federal agency released a 26page report yesterday citing several examples of serious mistakes in emergency treatment at kings county hospital center in brooklyn flaws that the hospital says it is now fixing the report , prepared by the federal health care financing administration , criticized the hospital s staff for making quick , and faulty , judgments about the severity of some patients' injuries and for repeatedly failing to provide adequate followup care in a case earlier this year , a patient was discharged even though cat scans showed that a pool of blood in his brain was growing , the report said it also criticized the treatment provided to patients with illnesses from heart failure to syphilis , and it found that on busy days , emergency physicians had downgraded the urgency of some cases without thoroughly examining the patients federal and state regulators discovered these problems during inspections at the hospital in october hospital executives said they had taken significant steps to correct them , and the federal agency has given the hospital 90 days to complete the changes but some doctors and leaders of medical labor unions said the latest findings added to their concerns that the quality of care at the city s public hospitals was declining in an era of budget and staff cuts kings county hospital , which serves many poor people in brooklyn , has long been noted for its active trauma center but like many public hospitals , its emergency rooms are often overcrowded , which seems to be behind many of the failures cited in the federal report the report said the difficulties typically began as nurses tried to screen which patients needed emergency care and which could be treated in a hospital clinic a block away regulators found that a number of illnesses were initially diagnosed as being less serious than they were and that none of the patients sent to the clinic were escorted to insure that they had arrived patients suffering from diverse ailments like back pain , numbness in the hands and a hernia were all returned to the emergency room after being incorrectly sent to the clinic for treatment , the report said in one case , an obstetrician was not called immediately when a pregnant woman arrived in the emergency room in labor she ended up bleeding so much that she needed a transfusion and one patient suffering from congestive heart failure received only partial workups during repeated visits to the emergency room , the report said it said that a social worker had noted on the first visit that the patient was uninsured but that five months passed before anyone wrote in the medical records that the patient could not afford heart medications it appears that a pattern developed wherein the patient would run out of medication , develop congestive heart failure and be readmitted to the hospital , the report said there was no evidence of coordination of services for this patient the report also said the problems at the hospital had been referred to two other oversight agencies in the federal department of health and human services , which could levy fines still , the hospital has been taking the right steps to correct problems , the regulators wrote , adding that we have determined that the immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety has been removed hospital officials said they had merged the clinic that treats lessserious cases into the full emergency room operation to eliminate the concerns about the patientscreening process they said this also should make it easier to coordinate followup treatment for many patients the hospital has also gone over its screening policies with its emergency nurses and doctors and plans to review 100 to 150 emergency cases a week for the next several months to check their decisions george m proctor , the hospital s operating chief , said the recent problems focused mainly on medical processes and coordination he said he believed they affected only a small percentage of the 100 , 000 patients seen in the hospital s emergency room each year mr proctor also noted that kings county had received a commendation from a hospital accreditation agency i think that , over all , the quality of the emergency care we provide is excellent , he said
newark , oct 8 a judge has ordered the city of newark to devise a plan to restore a potter s field that had been used to bury the city s poor from 1869 to 1953 but since the late 1960 s has been used as a garbage dump , where thousands of oncetidy graves are now hidden under mounds of debris the city began cleaning up the cemetery last month at the direction of state attorney general peter g verniero and in response to a lawsuit filed by elsie spade lascurain of hackensack after decades of searching for her father s grave , ms lascurain , 84 , traced it to city cemetery in newark , only to discover that the graveyard had been bulldozed and is covered with trash two weeks ago , the judge , julio m fuentes , in the chancery division of the state superior court in essex county , ordered newark to stop its cleanup effort he agreed with ms lascurain s lawyers , who argued that the city was in danger of further disturbing what are believed to be more than 18 , 000 graves in the cemetery , which is off bessemer street , just west of newark international airport today , judge fuentes extended that order and gave the city s lawyers a twoweek deadline to develop a restoration plan under state law , newark has only two options to restore the site as best as possible to a burial ground or to exhume whatever human remains can be found and rebury them at another cemetery in response to pointed questioning from judge fuentes , hugh gallagher , the city s lawyer , said newark was committed to restoring the potter s field , though he resisted the imposition of deadlines by the court throughout today s hearing , mr gallagher sought to impress on the judge that the process of setting aside city funds to pay for the restoration will be a complicated process despite the warnings of potential red tape , mr gallagher said , the city is definitely committed to restoring this cemetery property the judge said he wanted that to happen quickly i think what we need to do , mr gallagher , is to get that plan in writing , a specific detailed plan for what the city is going to do , judge fuentes said in addition to setting a twoweek deadline , the judge ordered the city to do a survey of the cemetery site and to conduct an extensive title search of the property going back 150 years setting the deadline , he said , we 're already mired in delay judge fuentes also reiterated his instructions that no work be done at the site until experts have determined how best to protect the graves everything stays the way it is until we have a serious plan for remediating the cemetery , he said in discussing restoration , the judge seemed particularly interested in the potential use of groundpenetrating radar as a tool to find grave sites ms lascurain s lawyers , anthony pope and douglas d burgess , as well as the city s lawyers , have been collecting proposals from experts on how best to restore the cemetery so far , none of the lawyers had determined how long a restoration project might take , how much it would cost or whether any individual graves or remains could ever be identified judge fuentes asked nancy costello miller , a deputy state attorney general , who was in court today to represent the state in the case \( the state regulates cemeteries \) , to help coordinate meetings between all of the lawyers in the case and to help draft the restoration plan mr gallagher said the plan would likely contain three phases historical research , locating the graves and , finally , restoring the cemetery ms lascurain s father , george spade , was shot to death in february 1921 impoverished , and with his children already in foster care , mr spade was buried in city cemetery after years of searching , ms lascurain s daughter , anna , found city cemetery by scouring newark s tax maps what i found was he s buried under a garbage dump , anna lascurain said photo a city garbage dump off bessemer street in newark was once a potter s field there are believed to be more than 18 , 000 graves there a judge has given the city a deadline to develop a restoration plan for the cemetery \( norman y lono for the new york times \) map of newark showing location of the city cemetery a potter s field has been used as a garbage dump since the late 60 s
houston , april 29 high on promise short on results that has been dave mlicki s story so far this year mlicki allowed four runs on nine hits in six innings tonight in a 61 loss to the houston astros , losing for the third time this season without a victory and after being swept in this twogame series here , the mets \( 1311 \) have lost their first series of the year and have now dropped a seasonhigh four games in a row the bullpen cannot be blamed for this one , although turk wendell did allow a couple of seventhinning runs the mets were simply in a hole from the start , after mlicki surrendered a pair of firstinning runs but mlicki was most upset with the sixthinning home run he served up to moises alou that made it 41 and even though the mets hit jose lima \( 41 \) fairly hard , their inability to score runs again was something they were not able to overcome mlicki s lack of success this season has been especially puzzling , considering how well he pitched during the second half of last year if i make a bad pitch , they hit it , mlicki said what s frustrating is when i make a good pitch , they hit it too when they hit it hard , it finds a gap when they hit it soft , it finds a gap but i ca n't give up nor will his manager give up on him i do n't give up on any of my players , bobby valentine said emphatically after the game no one is suggesting the mets give up on mlicki a 29yearold righthander , he is regarded by many to have the best stuff on the staff , although an argument can be made for al leiter , too but leiter already has three victories this season and would have four if the bullpen had not blown tuesday night s game his earned run average is a svelte 115 the rest of the mets' starters , minus mlicki , have a combined era of just 245 mlicki , meanwhile , has allowed 21 earned runs in 26 innings over his first five starts his era stands at a whopping 727 before the game , both valentine and pitching coach bob apodaca spoke of the progress mlicki had been making this season with each start he took a step back today when asked if he is putting too much pressure on himself , mlicki said maybe before the game , valentine said success breeds confidence and , at 1628 as a major league starter , success is something mlicki has not had enough of in parts of five bigleague seasons he had a real good run at the end of last season , valentine said and two of the games he has pitched this year were as good as any at the end of last season tonight was not one of them mlicki allowed base runners in each of his six innings he surrendered a single and a double to craig biggio and derek bell on his first two pitches of the game it was all downhill from there , even though the mets did close to within 21 on a runscoring triple by rich becker with none out in the third the mets left becker stranded , however lima took it from there and the astros went on to their sixth straight victory he pitched good , carlos baerga said of lima after hitting shots each time and still going 0 for 4 but we hit the ball harder than what it showed today the astros just hit it a little harder afterward , valentine pointed to mlicki s location , especially with his fastball he hears this stuff about having the best stuff on the staff , valentine said before the game and he thinks he s supposed to be perfect , throw a nohitter , dominate hitters every time out what he is supposed to do is be his best if he does , it will be enough when he pitches , he s hard on himself he needs to get over that bill pulsipher , at class aaa norfolk , is looking to get back to the mets a quick callup is unlikely but mlicki needs to turn things around fairly soon he has been the only weak link in a strong mets staff this april i'm glad he has confidence in me , mlicki said of valentine everyone knows what i can do it will happen it s just hitting some rough spots right now inside pitch john olerud said his strained groin felt fine , even after he was noticeably not running at full speed when derek bell made a tremendous play to throw him out at second on what looked like a sure sixthinning double bell is now hitting 413 after going 3 for 4 , prompting mets manager bobby valentine to say that bell is playing like the mvp of the decade armando reynoso said that if all goes well with his throwing session thursday , he will pitch off a mound for the first time since spring training on saturday after going 0 for his first 8 as a pinchhitter , matt franco got a pinchhit wednesday night franco led the mets with 19 pinchhits last season valentine said of jay payton s chances of playing the outfield again i can say there s a chance it will never happen , only from the way he throws payton , the mets' top hitting prospect , has undergone four arm operations and is playing first base at class aaa norfolk
yakutsk , russia to the russians crazy enough to live there , summer in the siberian arctic is merely a deep breath before the next winter , a few weeks of melted ice and midnight sun in which to gird for the next deep freeze either they use those weeks to haul in enough food and fuel to make it to the next thaw or they shiver and starve through the coming months of darkness the freighter kapitan glotov was skimming eastward along that arctic coast in late september , loaded with half of the next year s food supply for much of northeastern siberia , when the ship s dutch owners radioed the skipper an order stop and so he did , just short of the tiny port of tiksi , where the ship had planned to unload her cargo onto barges before the rivers turned to ice the shipping company kept sending us instructions that we could enter the port of tiksi and unload only with its permission , said the freighter s captain , aleksandr l vyalov the problem was that the freight bill could not be paid the real problem was that the bottom had dropped from russia s economy as the ship steamed toward tiksi , the rubles that russia had pledged to pay the 475 , 000 freight bill lost twothirds of their value the dutch demanded more money the bank holding the cash was in limbo , unable to pay even a kopeck and siberia , oblivious to the whole dispute , began to freeze over it is easy to call russia s travails political or fiscal crises but here in the siberian republic of yakutia , where a bad debt can condemn thousands to months of hunger , they can be a matter of survival all across arctic russia , almost 40 percent of the nation s land mass , at least eight million people must be fed and kept warm that vast enterprise leached untold billions of rubles from the old soviet union now it soaks up billions from the russian government , which finds it too expensive and logistically daunting to move from siberia many of the millions of people the soviet authorities lured there to mine the region s fabulous natural wealth among the people who run these vast , frozen lands , there is growing concern that the supply effort like the russian economy , the government and the country s adventure with capitalism is cracking under the strain in soviet times they brought not just the minimum amount of supplies , but 'insurance' reserves too , the governor of yakutia , vasily m vlasov , said in an interview in the arctic they supplied diesel oil and food for 12 months and even more , half the next year since '91 we 've survived six , seven years on the previous regime as of today , those reserves are 100 percent exhausted in a situation that seems tailored for panic , no one seems to doubt that the north will slog through the only question is how , and for how long we 've gotten used to getting by without money , said valery l popov , yakutia s minister of housing and communal services but this cannot go on forever life in the northern latitudes has never been a sidewalk brunch but what ails russia at large has put the north on the critical list facing a winter short of supplies food and heat cost money , and russia has none the russian government is too broke to meet the full cost of sending supplies to the arctic regional governments like yakutia s are picking up some slack , even as the ruble s crash has sent the cost of food , fuel and transportation skyrocketing but many regions are also broke and so some arctic areas , especially along russia s long border with alaska , face a winter in which villages may get few or no supplies at all russia s disastrous harvest , the worst in 45 years , led farming regions to husband their crops instead of exporting them , which led to hoarding in populous regions like moscow food imports up to half of some meats have all but dried up because of the fiscal crisis northern regions at the end of this food chain are left with a pittance resupply is further hobbled by the nearcollapse of russia s fleet of nuclearpowered icebreakers , half of which are now dockbound by mechanical problems or lack of money cuts in the meteorological budget may have led to a seriously late forecast for winter s onset and the stranding of supply barges that now cannot sail up frozen rivers over all , the situation is serious , but it s not irretrievable , said valery g georg , the deputy chief of the russian government s committee on northern affairs talk of evacuating most desperate villages along russia s east coast , from the bering strait to northern japan , there is talk of evacuating villages left without food or fuel in a telegram on oct 2 , the elders of the chukchi autonomous district , which borders the strait , warned moscow that food and medicine were running out and their remaining fuel would last less than three weeks parts of the kamchatka peninsula , opposite the western tip of the aleutian islands of alaska , received no deliveries before navigable rivers froze over russian public television last month called the situation there catastrophic
the escape of alexei son of tsar nicholas ii what happened the night the romanov family was executed by vadim petrov , igor lysenko and georgy egorov translated by marian schwartz and antonina w bovis illustrated 240 pp new york harry n abrams 2995 one day in the summer 1983 oleg filatov , the son of a schoolteacher in orenburg , a town in the steppes of russia , thought he learned he was the grandson of nicholas ii , the last czar of russia he had been out fishing with his father , vasily , when he first noticed scars on the older man and began to question him there was a revolution , the czarevich began vasily was then in his 70 s he died five years later and over the next several months he disclosed his secret history to his family on the night of july 17 , 1918 , when , according to the historical record , the czar and the czarina , their five children and four servants were shot dead by the bolsheviks in yekaterinburg , the 14yearold boy somehow managed to survive and escape with the help of two friendly bolshevik executioners he was taken to shadrinsk , 100 miles away , where he was adopted by a peasant family named filatov the czarevich was famously a hemophiliac , and several times had nearly bled to death after minor falls he had taken while playing yet his gunshot wounds miraculously healed , thanks to herbal remedies and a diet of raw meat prescribed by the tribal peoples of the north for the next few years he roamed as an orphan across the country , settling in 1930 in the tyumen region of siberia , where he trained as a teacher in 1967 filatov and his wife moved to orenburg oleg filatov is not the only person who thinks he should be czar recently blood relative , by michael gray , was published in london that book , like the escape of alexei , which gives filatov s account , claims to be the true story of the czarevich and written by his son there is nothing new ever since the execution of the romanovs there have been pretenders to their nonexistent throne aleksei has popped up in siberia , australia , new zealand , miami and vancouver today moscow is home to several of his sons and that s not to mention the anastasiyas none of the claimants has not turned out to be a crank all their stories have broken on hard facts first there are the testimonies of the execution squad that aleksei was shot several times and then bayoneted in the heart that the corpses of aleksei and mariya , his sister , were burned in a pit and that all the others , including anastasiya , were buried in the woods near yekaterinburg then there are the forensic tests that were carried out on their skeletons after they were exhumed in 1991 by comparing their dna with that of relatives of czar nicholas ii and the czarina , aleksandra , scientists are as sure as they can be that the bones reburied in st petersburg this summer are the bones of the romanovs the escape of alexei is fronted \( to say written would be flattery \) by three russian scientists , its publisher is at pains to point out but their scientific credentials are rather dubious igor lysenko \( not to be confused with trofim lysenko , stalin s fraudulent biologist \) is a nuclear physicist and graduate of the theological academy who advised the commission of the holy synod of the russian orthodox church on the canonization of the czar georgi egorov is an engineer and a prizewinning skier , the preface tells us , so he is well qualified to answer the question of how the czarevich , an adolescent suffering from hemophilia , may have survived the execution to live another 70 years and vadim petrov is called a candidate of medical sciences who wrote his dissertation on identifying dead bodies the science in their book does not amount to much first , in fact , they parade as historians , giving us , they claim , a fresh perspective on the events , free from prejudice but what follows in their historical chapters is the familiar account of the czar s abdication , his family s imprisonment and execution which has been recounted better many times before their only new idea is patently absurd that the deposed czar was no threat to the bolsheviks , who therefore had a motive to let his poor son go much of the book is then taken up with tedious homely reminiscences by oleg and his sisters about their father , illustrated with family snaps from the filatov album the scientific evidence , when it finally appears , is risible first the authors claim to prove that it would have been impossible to burn the corpses of aleksei and mariya largely on the grounds that it was wet that night and it takes a long time to burn a human body then they wheel on two specialists who testify that both the handwriting and the photograph images of vasily and aleksei belong \( with a high degree of certainty \) to the same man but anyone can see that they are chalk and cheese filatov s handwriting is obviously different , even though the writing style of the class to which he claims to belong was extremely standardized then there is the minor problem \( which the authors do n't discuss \) that , according to his birth certificate , filatov was born in december 1907 and the czarevich in july 1904 on this basis virtually anybody with a russian grandpa could make a claim to the romanov throne but there is one way for oleg filatov to prove his genealogy a dna test why has he not taken one \? more important , why did his publisher not insist on one before agreeing to sell his story \? when filatov first told his tale in 1988 he was a worker at leningrad airport since then he has risen to become a bank employee but all the same , one ca n't help thinking that the lure of money has played some part here he may not win the romanov fortune , but if the publicity his publisher has lavished on this book is anything to go by , he will make a fortune from book clubs what makes myths more salable than history \? why do we persist in believing fantasies in the face of all the facts \? it is simply inconceivable that anyone survived that brutal execution fifty shots were fired at 11 people and all their bodies subsequently bayoneted yet

taking a page from the litigation against the tobacco industry , three new york city council members proposed yesterday that the city file a lawsuit against all the nation s gun manufacturers , trying to recoup millions of dollars spent treating shooting victims the proponents say they also hope to restrict the number of guns entering the city the proposal would need the support of mayor rudolph w giuliani , and if he agrees , new york will join a wave of cities that have recently filed such suits last month , new orleans became the first city in the country to try the tactic boston announced plans for a similar suit just last friday , and chicago filed court papers the day before leaders in los angeles , philadelphia and dade county , florida , are also considering lawsuits the gun makers know they 're an accomplice when someone gets shot , but there s no incentive for them to do better , said councilman kenneth k fisher of brooklyn , one of the proponents of the lawsuit the gun manufacturers know that their guns are going to wind up in the wrong hands , and the gun manufacturers know they 're going to wind up used in the wrong way lorna bade goodman , a senior litigator in the office of the corporation counsel , said suing the gun industry is something we 've been looking at for his part , mr giuliani said he was not against the idea but added that he needed to research it while mr fisher and two of his democratic colleagues on the council jerome x o 'donovan of staten island and sheldon s leffler of queens are the chief proponents of new york city joining in lawsuits against gun manufacturers , the city council on its own cannot sue none of the lawsuits filed by cities have yet gone to trial , but similar cases filed by individuals have largely failed a jury in oakland , calif , ruled on monday that a gun manufacturer was not liable for the death of a 15yearold boy who was shot by a friend playing with his father s handgun earlier this year , a jury in brooklyn found seven gun companies not liable for the 1994 shooting death of a teenager on the brooklyn bridge other cases have been dismissed by judges they 're going after the wrong people here , said stephen l sanetti , general counsel for sturm , ruger and company , a manufacturer of rifles , shotguns , pistols and revolvers that is based in southport , conn we should n't say let s sue the manufacturer of the product we should look at who s using it and how the new orleans suit focuses on product liability law , saying the manufacturers do not take advantage of all the available technology to make their guns safe the chicago suit , seeking 433 million in damages , claims that the manufacturers are creating a public nuisance by knowingly making and distributing guns for illegal uses the new york city council members said they were not sure how much money the city should seek in a lawsuit against gun manufacturers two advocacy groups that support such lawsuits new yorkers against gun violence and physicians for social responsibility estimate that treating a firearm injury can cost up to 400 , 000 citing health department records and other documentation , the groups said that the total medical cost in 1992 for gunshot injuries in new york city was more than 94 million we 've reduced crime , but we still have a lot of shootings , said mr leffler , the queens councilman the gun manufacturers are partly responsible but gun industry leaders said that suing them was akin to blaming a vintner whenever a liquor store sold to a minor new york already has strict laws governing the sale of firearms , they pointed out guns are unlike tobacco , they say , because when used correctly they cause no harm it s a feeding frenzy out there right now , and the industry is the red meat , complained jack adkins of the american shooting sports council , which represents 350 manufacturers , distributors and retailers 'it s beyond guns now it could be a potential threat to just about any industry in this country the basic theory that they 're pursuing is that manufacturers , distributors and retailers should be held responsible for the criminal or negligent use of their products , mr adkins said proponents of the lawsuits say the courts are an important venue in which to attack the gun industry , because legislative efforts are often stymied by its powerful lobby barbara hohlt , chairwoman of new yorkers against gun violence , said that manufacturers make more guns than the legal market can bear and that their advertisements are sometimes intended for a criminal audience gun companies could n't make the profits they are making if they were not knowingly producing for the black market , ms hohlt said you 've got to come up with a way of stopping them there have been a lot of legislative suggestions , but it s not going anywhere'
h wayne huizenga cannot make money in the sports business or so he has claimed as the owner of three of south florida s four professional sports teams football s miami dolphins , baseball s florida marlins and hockey s florida panthers huizenga has spent the last several years insisting that his baseball and hockey franchises are losing money but like many of the owners of sports franchises who plead poverty , huizenga has found ways to turn a profit from his teams , no matter what his financial statements have to say about gate receipts and player salaries borrowing a page from ted turner , huizenga has used his sports teams to anchor a cable television station and like rupert murdoch , who bought dodger stadium along with the dodgers last week , huizenga owns pro player stadium , where both the marlins and the dolphins play but huizenga , one of america s richest businessmen , has also come up with a new twist on the familiar story of how to turn a supposedly moneylosing sports franchise into a financial bonanza sports team as investment tool capitalizing on his hockey team s 1996 drive to the stanley cup finals , huizenga sold stock in the florida panthers to the public public enthusiasm persuaded civic leaders in broward county , fla , to use public money to build a new stadium for the team then , huizenga used the hockey team s stock as currency to begin building yet another diversified enterprise the company s first move to buy two resort hotels owned partly by huizenga and other panthers officials , a move that enriched huizenga , his friends and others who have invested with him it has all worked out grandly for huizenga , whose original investment in florida panthers holdings has nearly tripled in value , to 150 million but those riches have won huizenga few fans in south florida , some of whom rate the maneuvering as a clever but cynical manipulation of loyalty to a local team investors who bought the stock in its first month of trading have done well , but many of those who bought subsequently have , at best , broken even the panthers , having traded away some of their top players , including dave lowry and esa tikkanen , have fallen from the stanley cup finals to having the secondworst record in the national hockey league this year even some profitable investors who got in early have expressed outrage , believing that huizenga and his friends profited improperly three classaction lawsuits seeking damages have been filed by shareholders huizenga , through a spokesman , declined to be interviewed but j ronald castell , a senior vice president at florida panthers holdings , defended the company s new direction he said the move into the resort business was not contemplated until huizenga had come to despair over the stock s failure to rise much above its initial price in the opening days , as usually happens with an initial public offering the filings made as part of the stock offering said that the company could acquire other businesses or properties , including some owned by huizenga or his affiliates and other panthers executives note that the purchase of the resorts was approved by disinterested members of the company s board of directors and was ruled fair by a wall street investment bank for team owners , an elusive bottom line those assertions give little comfort to bernard kalishman , a 67yearold miami resident and panthers shareholder kalishman said he had got caught up in the shortlived hockey mania in 1996 , but he is now angry that huizenga sold stock to hockey fans and then started buying his own hotels it was not an ethical thing to do , said kalishman , who filed one of the three suits charging that huizenga and other insiders misled investors , enriched themselves through selfdealing and violated securities laws against insider trading now , he has started to cut the panthers' payroll , like he did with the marlins fans have long expressed skepticism when owners say they are losing money on sports teams they read of lucrative television contracts , then get hit with higher ticket prices they see teams bought and then resold for double what the owners paid and this is not the first time such complaints have been voiced against huizenga in fact , fan disgust with owners crying fiscal distress reached its climax last fall when , barely days after huizenga s marlins won their first world series , the club dismantled the team , saying it had to trade away expensive stars left fielder moises alou and pitcher kevin brown among them because the team was losing too much money huizenga is not alone in crying financial duress for one , george steinbrenner , the owner of the yankees , has done his share of poormouthing over his club s financial performance , eager to get public financing for a new stadium and threatening to move the team otherwise but many economists agree that few , if any , sports teams truly lose money for their owners , who typically employ creative accounting and use their other businesses like stadium operations or cable television networks to make money off the team
on the core question of whether president clinton s misconduct in office merits impeachment , the testimony of kenneth starr brought more clarity than most americans could have expected the independent counsel outlined his case that mr clinton lied under oath , obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses , but he brought the house judiciary committee no new evidence beyond that offered in his sept 9 referral now , as then , that information provides what representative bill mccollum called a compelling picture of a president failing in his sworn duty to see that the law is faithfully executed but now , as then , the correct conclusion is that condemnation through formal congressional censure is the proper punishment for mr clinton , not impeachment by the full house followed by the ultimate constitutional penalty of removal from office by the senate for some time , this page s position has been that censure of mr clinton for lying under oath is the correct remedy unless new evidence emerges the logic of that position proceeds from the political consensus of the american people and the scale of the offenses , even if every detail of mr starr s allegations could be proved this misconduct did not occur in the context of national security or the misuse of key agencies it stemmed from personal weaknesses mr clinton s compulsive risktaking , his disrespect of the high office and historic residence entrusted to him , his habitual mendacity that no future chief executive is likely to emulate therefore mr clinton deserves to be punished in a way that writes his disgrace into the history books and affirms the presidency s subservience to and obligations under the rule of law , while at the same time sparing the nation the trauma that removal of this weak man would impose on the people and the political system mr starr hoped to use his testimony to salvage his legal reputation while also proving his case that lying in a sexual harassment suit was in and of itself grounds for impeachment his long opening presentation was at once an orderly and useful summation of the evidence to date , and a devastating admission that he had no additional evidence that would strengthen his case those who believe , as this page does , that new information was needed to raise mr clinton s misconduct to the level of impeachment heard none on the monica lewinsky matter or on earlier scandals indeed , mr starr testified that he could not prove his suspicions about president and mrs clinton on whitewater and that he found no offenses by them on travelgate and filegate this deckclearing exercise was useful , but mr starr failed to explain why he could not have settled those issues months or even years ago mr starr presented himself as bound strictly by the law , yet much of his case against mr clinton rambled far afield he listed misleading the american people , lying to the cabinet and white house staff , specious use of privilege claims and six refusals to testify before the grand jury as part of the enumerated charges these failings are , indeed , part of the conduct that makes mr clinton a slippery and unadmirable president but they are not legally impeachable or even prosecutable the strongest part of mr starr s case focused on incidents of presidential lying that unfolded after dec 5 , 1997 , when the president first learned that his paramour would be a witness in the paula jones case on six occasions , starting with his jan 17 , 1998 , deposition and ending with his aug 17 grand jury testimony , mr clinton testified falsely or lied in public about his relationship with ms lewinsky in addition , between dec 5 and his jan 17 deposition , mr clinton took a number of potentially illegal actions that mr starr said were shown by direct testimony or circumstantial evidence in mr starr s account , the president urged ms lewinsky to swear to a false affidavit , sought to tamper with the evidence of his gifts to her , coached betty currie to tailor her testimony to his , and reached out to vernon jordan and others to get ms lewinsky a job that would keep her silent mr starr said mr clinton s actions over this eightmonth journey amounted to witnesstampering , obstruction of justice and the use of presidential authority and power in an effort to conceal the truth of the relationship and to delay the investigation that is the heart of the impeachment case for our part , we have never been in the school that excuses presidential lying if it concerns private conduct we regard lying under oath for any reason as a serious breach of presidential responsibility and agree with mr starr that much of this inquiry was necessitated by white house stonewalling and deception on suspect events that started with whitewater but we still do not see impeachment as the appropriate legal response that is partly for the reasons of legal scale outlined above , and more importantly for the final judgment that has now developed in the public and the congress even diehard congressional democrats like representative barney frank want mr clinton to be punished but a substantial majority of the american people would not support impeachment or removal on the existing facts , and mr starr s bottom line yesterday was that he has no more to offer mr starr has dark and reasonable suspicions about , say , jobs for silence , but he cannot prove them those parts that he can prove , such as mr clinton s blatant lying under oath about sex , will not be supported as grounds for impeachment by a majority of the house , even though it is controlled by the republicans mr starr handled himself better than democrats had hoped in responding to charges of collusion with the jones lawyers , the bludgeoning of witnesses and ideological obsessiveness but serious questions remain about his prosecutorial conduct , including his handling of linda tripp and her tapes the republicans , meanwhile , have an acute problem they could probably clear an impeachment recommendation on a partyline vote in the judiciary committee but that vote would damage their party in the next election and displease their own designated speaker , robert livingston most important , it would not be warranted on the evidence presented by mr starr as for the final resolution of these matters , the mess does not look so large today as it did yesterday mr starr s reputation for legal acuity and balanced judgment has been seriously damaged mr clinton is probably much nearer the severe censure that he deserves for betraying the rule of law and if the democrats can realize that events have tilted their way and if chairman henry hyde can keep a lid on his republican colleagues , the judiciary committee may be lurching toward a conclusion of an episode that brought down a speaker and permanently blotted the president s record the smart parliamentary move and the best outcome for the country would be for a senior republican and a senior democrat on the judiciary committee to offer a joint motion recommending a censure resolution to the full house
as expected , don sundquist , the republican incumbent , easily won another term as governor , a job he came to in 1994 after 12 years in the house , where he served on the ways and means committee governor sundquist was so heavily favored that it was hard to find a challenger , and even when john jay hooker , who had the democratic nomination in 1966 and 1970 , stepped up for a third shot , it was never an allout campaign mr hooker , a nashville lawyer , was an unusual candidate who stayed clear of vice president al gore s tennessee appearances because of a decadelong feud with mr gore although mr hooker , whose minnie pearl friedchicken franchise failed in the 1970 s , tried to focus the race on campaign finance , he remained better known for suing state agencies and announcing that he wanted to hold his fundraiser in the governor s mansion gov sundquist emphasized his record on welfare reform and improved programs for children his easy reelection was mirrored in the races for congress , where incumbents prevailed in all nine districts none of the races were close , and two were uncontested governor 100 reporting hooker 287 , 241 29 sundquist 668 , 687 69 chart graphs views in the south was one reason for your vote for congress to express support for bill clinton 16 to express opposition to bill clinton 26 clinton was not a factor 56 no answer 2 was one reason for your vote for congress to express support for republican control of congress 36 to express opposition to republican control of congress 27 republican control of congress was not a factor 32 no answer 5 do you think congress should proceed with impeachment hearings 46 drop the whole matter 51 no answer 3 which one issue mattered most in deciding how you voted for us house \? 22 morals and ethics 19 education 14 taxes 13 the economy and jobs 12 social security 5 health care 5 the clinton lewinsky matter \( source voter news service exit poll of 2 , 744 voters leaving polling places in alabama , arkansas , florida , georgia , kentucky , louisiana , mississippi , north carolina , oklahoma , south carolina , tennessee , texas , and virginia \)

fort belvoir , va , feb 17 brenda l hoster , the retired sergeant major whose accusations of sexual misconduct sparked the courtmartial here of the man who had been the army s top enlisted soldier , lost her composure today only when talking of the hurt inflicted on that soldier s wife of 25 years ms hoster s voice broke and words failed her each time the questioning turned to wilhemina mckinney during a day of testimony about a sexual advance by sgt maj gene c mckinney , ms hoster s subsequent retirement and her decision to turn on sergeant major mckinney , who she said had preached respect for soldiers but then made her feel so disrespected ms hoster , who said she now scraped by running errands , walking dogs and cleaning houses , described a night two years ago in a hawaii hotel where she said the sergeant major propositioned her , forcibly kissed her and reminded her that he could overpower her if he chose ms hoster said she was unable to eat or sleep after the incident and so retired , ending a 22year career in which she had been one of the youngest sergeant majors in the service and was hand picked to be the public affairs officer for sergeant major mckinney , who as sergeant major of the army was its highestranking soldier but after the incident in the hale koa hotel in honolulu , ms hoster said , the speeches that she wrote for sergeant major mckinney rang hollow he talked about loyalty , about treating people with dignity and respect , she said today but i felt none of that applied to me i felt dirty and disrespected but for many months ms hoster , 40 , told no one what had happened in that time , she accepted a tearful apology from her boss there s no excuse in the world for what i did , she said he told her and celebrated her retirement with him and his wife ms hoster s decision to go public with her accusation , in an interview a year ago in the new york times , came only after sergeant major mckinney s appointment to a blueribbon panel investigating sexual harassment in the army she wrote him a letter , not yet admitted in evidence , which apparently urged him to refuse the post he never answered once ms hoster stepped forward , five other women followed , two of them reluctant witnesses testifying here under grants of immunity sergeant major mckinney has been charged with 19 counts of sexual misconduct and obstruction of justice he faces a dishonorable discharge and up to 55 years in prison if convicted the defense , in opening statements two weeks ago and in crossexamination today , sought to discredit ms hoster s testimony on two grounds first , sergeant major mckinney s lawyers said , she was a vengeful former employee who was frequently criticized by a boss who found her work slipshod second , she was a woman hungry for fame and fortune , the defense lawyers said , citing her many appearances on network television and her selection by people magazine as one of the year s most intriguing personalities ms hoster said sergeant major mckinney was quick to belittle her in front of subordinates and blame her for anything that went wrong in her sworn complaint , she said her life had been a living hell as his public affairs aide , a phrase that lieut col v montgomery forrester used as a mocking refrain throughout his crossexamination ms hoster said she now had a subsistence existence in el paso , where she gave up a 10anhour job managing a dentist s office because of the demands of this courtmartial she runs what she described as a personalservice business her lawyer , susan barnes , said ms hoster housesat and walked dogs for small fees like the women who testified before her , ms hoster said sergeant major mckinney used personal tragedy as a seduction tool , turning to female subordinates for comfort after the death of his only child in an auto accident as a member of his staff , ms hoster had commiserated by email during the weeks that the mckinneys were at the florida bedside of their 18yearold son , zuberi sergeant major mckinney s sexual overture came after a staff gripe session that had angered him , ms hoster testified he pleaded with her to have sex with him , she said , by saying , nobody understands me , and , what i need is you ms hoster said she urged him to get professional help with his grief and then reminded him that what you need is down the hall , a reference to his wife a few doors away ms hoster stammered and fought back tears today every time mrs mckinney s name came up she described mrs mckinney , who has been in the gallery here every day , as someone she adored and had a spiritual connection with at a pretrial hearing last summer , ms hoster said that sergeant major mckinney had disparaged his wife in her presence , but she claimed she could not remember his words today , she said she did recall the comments but she resisted revealing them he said things that were not nice , she said , then paused for nearly a minute i do n't

port st lucie , fla , feb 25 almost from the time bill pulsipher , jason isringhausen and paul wilson first donned mets uniforms , it has seemed as if their destinies have been intertwined the three have taken a similar path through bright expectation and brief success to bitter disappointment , complicated surgery and arduous rehabilitation somewhere along the line , we 've got to start separating them , manager bobby valentine said today after watching pulsipher and wilson throw two encouraging innings each in the mets' 63 exhibition victory over the south korean national team in the case of isringhausen , it is easier to consider him separately , considering he will miss this season because of reconstructive elbow surgery but pulsipher and wilson are finally healthy again , each fighting to become the no 5 starter this afternoon , both gave valentine and bob apodaca , the pitching coach , reason for optimism , even though the competition was roughly the level of class a pulsipher started and surrendered one hit in two innings more important , the 24yearold lefthander , who struggled with control problems last season , threw 14 of his 21 pitches for strikes and did not walk a batter the righthanded wilson , also 24 , threw a perfect third inning before struggling briefly in the fourth he allowed two hits and one run , also walking none , and threw 18 of 26 pitches for strikes i think they both handled themselves well emotionally , apodaca said and that s the first thing i was going to look at controlling his emotions became an issue for pulsipher last season , as he wrestled with an uncooperative pitching elbow while bouncing around the minor league system my brain s always twitching , pulsipher said and as he tried to grope with his lack of control last season , he became so fixated on his lack of success that he finally sought out the director of the organization s employee assistance program , dr allan lans lans prescribed prozac , which is used to treat depression as well as obsessive compulsive disorder , which is what pulsipher s condition most closely resembles pulsipher began the medication eight months ago and still takes one 20milligram dosage a day according to ilene zwirn , an associate of lans , there have been no scientific studies on whether prozac affects reaction time , which is extremely important for someone who makes his living standing 60 feet 6 inches from home plate but pulsipher , who says he has experienced little to no sideeffects , swears by the drug he said he was prepared to take it for the remainder of his career unless i start losing my feet or my arms fall off , he joked he could afford to laugh this is back to where i was throwing before the surgery , pulsipher said of his outing it was an evaluation apodaca agreed with stuffwise , he is back , the coach said the same can almost be said for wilson , who remarked today that baseball was fun again for him for the first time in almost two years late last season , and even this winter while wilson and pulsipher continued to struggle in the puerto rico league , there was concern within the organization about the length of time it was taking for wilson to regain his velocity apodaca estimated that wilson is 95 percent back , both in velocity and his ability to put a pitch where he wants it when he wants it inside pitch a highranking member of the mets' frontoffice said that before negotiations broke down with tony phillips on tuesday , the mets made two proposals one with 400 , 000 guaranteed and a 100 , 000 buyout at season s end , the other with 400 , 000 guaranteed and an additional 100 , 000 for 100 plate appearances both proposals , the official said , included incentives that would have allowed phillips to earn an additional 250 , 000 for 400 plate appearances an additional 250 , 000 was to have been included for 650 plate appearances , which would have pushed the final total of the deal to 1 million photos paul wilson is vying for the fifth rotation spot after losing his promise of two years ago \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \) bill pulspiher was in control in florida yesterday , but the mets will watch him warily \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \) \( pg c1 \) in his outing yesterday , bill pulsipher did what he rarely did last season throw 14 of 21 pitches for strikes \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \) \( pg c4 \)

the brinks security guards robbed of more than 1 million tuesday at the world trade center did not perform well on lie detector tests given shortly after the incident , law enforcement officials said yesterday meanwhile , the third suspect in the robbery , richard gillette , was apprehended last night after he briefly left a los angelesbound amtrak train during a 30minute layover in albuquerque , nm , the authorities in new mexico said the two guards who were robbed while delivering money to a bank of america currency exchange office tuesday were given the lie detector tests early wednesday , said one official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity he said one guard did poorly on the test , while the other did better but still had trouble while the test results did not establish that the guards were involved in the robbery , the official said , it raised questions with both of them the results of lie detector tests are not considered reliable enough to be used as evidence in new york courts , but they often prove useful to law enforcement officials or companies conducting investigations in the world trade center robbery , investigators have said they believe that the robbers may have had some inside help the test was administered by the federal bureau of investigation martin crowe , vice president of security for brinks inc , declined to comment on the case , saying only that the two guards were still employed with the company , which is based in darien , conn it is the position of brinks incorporated not to comment on stories concerning robberies of our employees , he said last night in new mexico , sgt bill johnson of the state police said the third suspect , mr gillette , was questioned at the albuquerque train depot in a routine check for drug couriers and fugitives mr gillette , 39 , who was wearing a bright green green bay packers jacket and hat , became noticeably nervous , raising the authorities' suspicion , but the authorities released him a computer check then revealed that mr gillette , who gave his real name when questioned , was wanted in new york officials found that mr gillette had left the train and officers fanned out across downtown albuquerque , sgt johnson said mr gillette was arrested 45 minutes after he was initially questioned he was carrying 18 , 000 , sgt johnson said yesterday , one suspect , michael reed , 34 , was brought before a federal magistrate , kevin nathaniel fox , who denied mr reed s request for bail and scheduled him to return to court for a preliminary hearing on feb 2 , said marvin smilon , a spokesman for the united states attorney s office mr reed was arrested in an apartment above a friend s home in the windsor terrace section of brooklyn on thursday john costello , a childhood friend of mr reed s who was also questioned by the police but later released , said that mr reed had gone to his house after the robbery and offered him a night on the town the pair first went shopping in midtown manhattan , with mr reed buying new tennis shoes and a watch before offering dinner at a seafood restaurant , mr costello said another suspect , melvin desmond folk , 44 , was arrested after being turned in by his wife on wednesday night he was also denied bail by the magistrate the suspects face federal bank robbery charges , which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison in recent days , investigators have increasingly focused on the possibility that someone other than the three suspects planned the robbery they noted that although the three suspects had extensive experience committing petty crimes , none had a history of bank robbery they added that the men apparently knew exactly when the money shipment would arrive and they knew which bags of money they wanted , ripping open four of the seven bags before walking away with 117 million in mostly foreign currency , according to a federal complaint but they were oblivious to the halfdozen security cameras that captured their faces on tape before and after the robbery security experts said the robbers' precision in showing up at the location just as the guards were about to leave a freight elevator with the money , their apparent knowledge of which bags they wanted and their limited understanding of the bank s security system meant that they probably had help in planning the robbery but that a bank employee probably was not involved
mutual fund portfolios are as different as the investors who create them some are positioned to reflect the market outlook three years from now others take a closer view some use contrarian strategies , and some work hard to reduce the portfolio s risk levels some play market momentum still others bet on unusual opportunities or historical patterns such differences in the hypothetical retirement portfolios created by five professional money managers for the new york times go a long way to explain the range in their returns for the first quarter this year all the managers came in winners , gaining 723 percent to 11 percent but none outpaced the market proxy , the vanguard index 500 fund , or even the average of all stock funds , because they held small or emerging markets stocks along with the large united states stocks that dominated the list of leaders in the first three months of the year holding a diversified portfolio for the long term as market favorites come and go can be hard to live with day to day longterm investing is my mantra and my faith , but i will admit that , about now , 'longterm' seems interminable , said harold r evensky , a financial adviser in coral gables , fla \( rather than publishing this retirement portfolio horse race once a year , as readers and managers were told last quarter , the times has decided to continue presenting it each quarter \) looking long term , mr evensky had carefully created a diverse portfolio that was held back by its big stake in small overseas companies and emergingmarket stocks as well as by its holdings in domestic small stocks the portfolio placed third among the five , returning 894 percent in the quarter he was also hurt by an 11 percent stake in barr rosenberg market neutral , which started in middecember and was flat for the quarter i ca n't say we 're happy , mr evensky said , although he noted that the return was not out of line with the performance of similar investment portfolios run by barr rosenberg my job is to plan for a lifetime , and my concerns include risk as well as returns , he said the portfolio is welldiversified and run by worldclass managers , so damn the torpedoes and full steam ahead ! his only change is to replace the yacktman fund with wilshire large cap growth , an index fund don yacktman is too often in cash and his investment style is tending too much toward value , mr evensky said in first place for the quarter was jack a brill , a san diego money manager who steers a socially responsible course mr brill s portfolio rose 11 percent , mostly because of its bias toward largecap stocks , he said he plans no changes my portfolio contains a good mix of growth styles and defensive funds for the high market volatility i expect this year , he said sheldon jacobs , who edits the noload fund investor in irvington , ny , retains the overall lead among the five managers , with a gain of 1284 percent since the contest began on july 7 , 1993 the five portfolios have risen an average of 1076 percent since then , compared with a 1765 percent return for the vanguard index 500 , which mimics the standard poor s 500stock index the performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by lipper analytical services of summit , nj it excludes sales charges , transaction costs and taxes because most retirement money is held in taxdeferred accounts the five managers can choose any fund open to new investors from the outset , they were asked to pick portfolios that would grow for 20 years while mr jacobs leads long term , he trailed the other four managers for the quarter , with a return of 723 percent in large part , he said , because he had made the portfolio more conservative when the times told him he would be making only annual changes now that he is back to quarterly reporting , he is bolstering his largecap stock allocation and generally taking a more bullish stance to that end , he has dropped heartland value plus and usaa taxexempt intermediate , which together had totaled onequarter of the portfolio , and added a 20 percent chunk of vanguard total stock market , an index fund i 've been gradually trying to switch over to index funds , which i think are superior in the long run because of their lower expenses , mr jacobs said he chose this fund over vanguard s s p 500 fund because total stock market holds small and midcap stocks in addition to bigger ones , more closely mimicking the overall market to me , the whole concept of an index fund is not to make any judgments on the market , he said mr jacobs also added a 10 percent position in marsico focus , one of the quarter s top performers thomas f marsico , formerly of janus capital , was doing a great job with a similar fund there , mr jacobs said now he can take the same strategy and start all over eric m kobren , president of kobren insight group in wellesley , mass , runs a portfolio of allfidelity funds that gained 887 percent in the quarter , taking fourth place among the five money managers mr kobren is selling his 20 percent stakes in the lowpriced stock and midcap stock funds , replacing them with two new fidelity funds smallcap stock \( 20 percent \) and contrafund ii \( 10 percent \) while we would not recommend buying new funds simply because they are new , our research does show that new fidelity stock funds tend to outperform their mature counterparts during their first and second years of operation , mr kobren said though larger fidelity funds are forced to take a more sectororiented approach to investing , these new funds can focus on the type of bottomup stockpicking that has helped other fidelity funds to outperform their competitors in years past he also doubled the position in fidelity international value , to 20 percent , on the theory that most international markets are attractive relative to united states valuations susan dziubinski , editor of morningstar investor in chicago , took second place among the managers , with a gain of 982 percent she is making no changes to her portfolio , which includes a big chunk of international stocks to help counteract a possible slowdown in the united states those holdings fared well largely because of a heavy investment in european companies her portfolio also includes smallcap issues that did well in the quarter her only loser was oppenheimer real asset , which fell 96 percent , in large part because of falling oil prices but she s sticking with it the fund acts as a hedge against inflation and the stock market because it s more like a commodity play , ms dziubinski said chart how the 50 , 000 investments fared quarterly and cumulative performance of hypothetical retirement savings portfolios created and managed for the new york times by five investment advisers each began with 50 , 000 on july 7 , 1993 weightrefers to the percentage of the portfolio s assets invested in each fund figures are preliminary and do not reflect sales charges , if any susan dziubinski has taken over the portfolio originally managed by john rekenthaler \( source lipper analytical services inc \)
two plays , three playwrights , a total of seven actors and the new york theater seems suddenly bursting with possibilities that s all it takes when the productions are of the order of these two works that have come to us by way of london the beauty queen of leenane , martin mcdonagh s dark , cheeky , highly theatrical irish comedy directed by garry hynes , and art , the ineffably funny , sometimes riotous , very french meditation on male friendship \( and other matters \) , written by the french playwright yasmina reza , translated by the british playwright christopher hampton and directed by matthew warchus the beauty queen of leenane , its original fouractor irish cast intact , is playing a nineweek run off broadway , through april 19 , at the atlantic theater , while art , starring alan alda , victor garber and alfred molina , has settled down on broadway at the royale what \? you have n't seen a straight play in months \? it s time to rethink your priorities though it was only a coincidence that the beauty queen of leenane and art opened just four days apart , they provide the sort of onetwo punch of accumulating excitement that no amount of prefabricated hype can manufacture the plays themselves have nothing in common except their display of talent and the heritage of a discipline whose pleasures can only be simulated by films and television this is living theater actors acting in the moment you behold them , creating a relationship in which the members of each particular audience are as integral to a performance as what is happening on the stage a performance is a spooky , ephemeral thing without you , it does n't exist when it s over , it s gone it s never to be repeated in quite the same way again , unlike movies and liveontape television that , being frozen in time , are essentially inert as the actors are alive in the theater , so is the audience , which makes possible a complicity between the two that gives a special edge to both of these new productions there is a moment toward the end of art when a character is given a felttip pen and dared to deface a whiteonwhite painting the audience does n't much admire , though it is aware that the price was 200 , 000 francs , or about 40 , 000 the character pauses only a second yet it is enough time for the entire audience to suck in its breath in horror at this possible desecration , then to erupt in glorious belly laughs that signal utter surprise the surprise is prompted less by what the character does than by the audience s sudden awareness of how completely and joyously it has become implicated in the events on the stage when you watch movies you are so wrapped in the dark that you can be persuaded to believe almost any nonsense it s part of the fun of movies the darkness absorbs the smells of hot dogs and popcorn and the noises of giant economysize candy wrappers being ripped apart like packing cases the darkness isolates the mind and melts the senses i 've wept more tears at junk movies than i ever have at funerals live theater is something very different there is all that light coming from the stage you are never unaware of surrounding members of the audience , or of the fact that you are observing actors impersonate other people the result is that you develop bifocal vision , which allows you to appreciate both the fiction taking place on the stage and the skills of the people making it possible when you are swept away , you can be sure it is because of a nearly miraculous conjunction of what are to us arcane forces the downside when the material is second rate and the actors unconvincing , you ca n't be wheedled into entering that other world you are too obviously sitting in a theater , behind somebody with a head tic , watching the scenery shake when a door is slammed by an actor whose shoelace is untied on the stage , every imperfection announces itself the pleasures of live theater are many and complex , but so rarely realized that when they are experienced they have a way of prompting you to try to redefine theater what makes theater different \? and , when it works , so fulfilling \? the answer is never the same for any two plays 'art' art could not easily exist in any other form , which is not to say that one day it wo n't be competently adapted as a film or television piece it has only the slimmest of narratives , being a consideration of friendship , its rewards , liabilities , frustrations and mortality specifically , it is about three middleaged , middleclass , heterosexual parisians marc \( mr alda \) , an aeronautical engineer who prides himself on his skeptical turn of mind serge \( mr garber \) , a successful dermatologist , happily divorced , who is beginning to enjoy the money he is making , and yvan \( mr molina \) , who , for 15 years , has played comic relief for his far more selfassured friends at the start of the play he has just begun a new career in the wholesale stationery business and is , at long last , about to marry or , as he puts it , i 've given in to the logic of events , marriage , children , death stationery his pals could n't care less about his marriage , as long as he continues to attend to them he has always been a perfect audience
an elephant of a merger raced down wall street on monday , chased by a pack of journalists like the proverbial blind men s examinations of the elephant , newspaper reports of the value of the deal between citicorp and travelers group inc also differed a 70 billion pact , reported the new york times and newsday 82 billion , said the washington post 83 billion , reported the wall street journal and usa today 166 billion , said the financial times of london who is right \? actually for the moment , at least none of the above by yesterday afternoon , after shares of travelers fell , the deal was worth 78 billion the difficulty in calculating a value begins with the fact that none of those billions of dollars are changing hands instead , citicorp stockholders will receive pieces of paper 25 shares in the new company for each of their current shares travelers stockholders will keep their current certificates the value of the merger , therefore , depends on how one approaches the deal that is , what price is assigned to the stock that is being exchanged and whether one judges that company a is buying company b or the deal is a merger of equals the new york times and other newspapers judged that travelers was buying citicorp and valued the merger based on the price of travelers stock just before the deal was announced by issuing 113 billion shares , each worth 6168 , the purchase by travelers cost 70 billion after the merger was announced on monday , the stock of both companies rose travelers shares finished the day at 73 that meant its payout for citicorp equaled 83 billion , the amount reported by several newspapers the financial times viewed it as a merger of equals and combined the value of the shares of the two companies citicorp s 82 billion plus travelers' 84 billion equaled the 166 billion of the headline of the three , the latter probably makes the least sense albeit the best headline after travelers and citicorp fell yesterday as investors reevaluated the odds that the merger would clear all regulatory hurdles , the deal was worth 78 billion think of it this way if citicorp , with a market value yesterday of 75 billion , bought the coffee shop in the lobby of its famous headquarters on lexington avenue , it would not be considered a 75 billion deal the purchase would be worth 1 million , or whatever the coffee shop was worth when citicorp decided to buy it and if the coffee shop owners were receiving pieces of paper rather than cold hard cash , the deal would be worth well , care to guess \?
commissioner david stern will recommend on jan 7 that the national basketball association owners cancel the entire season unless a new collective bargaining agreement is reached by then , a development that leaves two weeks for a resolution to the league s costly and calamitous labor dispute stern has scheduled a special board of governors meeting for that date , at which the nba s labor relations committee will submit a report to representatives from the league s 29 teams if we are where we are now on jan 7 , david and i will recommend to the board that we cancel the season , russ granik , the deputy commissioner , said yesterday i expect there to be negotiations before then but if we do n't get anywhere and there s no reason to think otherwise right now we 'll have done what none of us thought was possible the nba had not lost a game to work stoppage in its 52 years before this season now , the players and owners are perilously close to becoming the first league in professional sports history to lose an entire season to labor strife already , the first three months of the season have been lost and losses in player salaries may exceed 500 million the day after they took out fullpage ads in the los angeles times and usa today to portray their side in the lockout , top officials of the national basketball players association declined comment on the deadline but the feeling among many players was that at least they now have a date to work with weeks ago we tried to get the league to establish a date , if only to bring immediacy to the negotiations , said danny schayes , a member of the union s negotiating committee if anything , it gives us a measuring stick when we have to get a deal there s no question , we now have to meet we ca n't make a deal in our living rooms i hope this will spur activity neither the league nor the union is expected to resume talks until after christmas , possibly as early as monday billy hunter , the union executive director , returned home to oakland , calif , on tuesday stern has been at his vacation home in aspen , colo , since last weekend granik said he and stern have spoken every day , and that the decision to call the meeting rested with stern stern and granik have resisted requests to decide on a dropdead date , believing that if a deal were close to being consummated , a deadline would serve no purpose other than to apply undue pressure to the process but yesterday they appeared to conclude that any agreement signed after the first week of january may not be profitable enough for the owners or legitimate enough to the fans to take the risk at some point we have to face up to the facts , granik said , when asked why a date was finally picked we ca n't lose the season without a board meeting it just became obvious with how things were going at least as of that date , we 'll know where we 're headed before the announcement yesterday , day 175 of the lockout was proceeding like many others no talks and no hope of an immediate settlement the last round of bargaining took place 11 days ago , a session that broke off after less than an hour hunter and granik have admitted that a deal could be hashed out in 24 hours , but the union has been much more optimistic than the league about actually having a season while baseball has had eight work stoppages since 1972 , including a 232day strike that wiped out the 1994 world series , it has never lost an entire season the national football league and the national hockey league played through both world wars and , like baseball , never lost an entire season of competition to labor strife in 1919 , the stanley cup playoffs were not completed due to a flu epidemic but none of those players ever lost 11 billion in salaries , the price tag for the players if the season is canceled patrick ewing has lost 61 million so far , nearly a third of his annual salary of 185 million , currently the league s highest an additional 300 million to 400 million in leaguewide revenues would be lost as well meanwhile , the players' fullpage ad , which began setting the record straight , did not do much to break the stalemate , according to granik it shows to me why we are exactly where we are , granik said of the ad , which contained charts , graphs and full explanations about the players' positions we 're about ready to cancel the season to come out with that kind of rhetoric , it almost seems like the union wants to guarantee that we cancel the season
the politicians howled for the head of william j catacosinos and they got it until july 31 , mr catacosinos was chairman of marketspan , a new corporate creature created from the remains of lilco and brooklyn union gas when the old lilco board voted him a bonus of 42 million for the year , governor pataki and other pols put the heat on marketspan to dump mr catacosinos now the company has given in and pushed their 42 million baby overboard mr catacosinos did not ask for the 42 million he demanded 70 million and no doubt about it , he was robbed he is america s most underpaid executive , bar none for 12 years , the suffolk county government paid me to investigate mr catacosinos , beginning the day he took over lilco a quick review of my files on billy cat shows a man underestimated time after time among the milestones of his decade and a half reign at lilco the state penalized the company 17 billion for mismanagement the company paid 400 million to settle racketeering charges brought by the county government and an additional 50 million to settle claims of securities fraud the state forced mr catacosinos to close his unquestionably dangerous shoreham nuclear plant , the most expensive plant ever built and never run mr catacosinos first gave the public a taste of his unique management style when , in 1985 , hurricane gloria left 750 , 000 homes in the dark in response , the chairman ordered all workers off vacation , while he continued his mediterranean cruise mr catacosinos created what a former local legislator calls , quite accurately , the highest priced , least reliable , most arrogant and , when they owned shoreham , most dangerous electric company in america then he sold it to the state last month for more than 7 billion pure chutzpa , pure catacosinos investment bankers had valued the corporate mess called lilco at substantially less the windfall for lilco shareholders will be tacked on to electricity bills over the next 40 years , with interest econometric models indicate the electricity surcharge will cost about 36 , 000 jobs good for bill his job was to get the best deal for his stockholders and he got it but heads should roll and its easy to identify whose mr pataki filed legal challenges to the catacosinos bonus but it was the governor who cut the deal for the long island power authority to buy lilco it was mr pataki who then shrouded over the bloated purchase price with accounting trickery one of the governor s degimmicks was to promise a bonus 101 in suffolk and 232 in nassau to every long island ratepayer as a benefit of the deal he did not mention that the bonus was due from lilco anyway , the final payments on the racketeering and other court settlements and it was the governor who personally injected himself into negotiations and caved in to mr catacosinos s every bullying \( and brilliant \) demand the governor called the 42 million for mr catacosinos an extraordinary secret act of greed hardly several analysts , myself included , warned his office that the giveaway from the public s purse would trigger mr catacosinos s golden parachute and stock options , the source of the bonus the bonus was neither extraordinary nor secret , but the takeover deal cut by the governor was both mr catacosinos s true crime was that the bonus for his success exposed the government s failure mr catacosinos does not work for the public , but for his shareholders , whom he has served frighteningly well but governor pataki is supposed to work for the longsuffering electricity customers he has demanded the resignation of the man responsible for this costly mess that , mr pataki , is an excellent idea gregory palast peconic
new haven even as emerging markets sink into depression and stocks plunge from montreal to melbourne , a global economy is slowly emerging , albeit in a tortuous and painful way but governments seem paralyzed , unable to deal with both the crisis and the opportunity today s chaotic international market mirrors how the american economy evolved between the civil war and the 1930 s for well over half a century we , too , had booms and busts , countless bank failures , rampant bankruptcies capitalism was an uncontrollable darwinian process , with big winners and big losers but over time the united states set up crucial central institutions the securities and exchange commission \( 1933 \) , the federal deposit insurance corporation \( 1934 \) and , most important , the federal reserve \( 1913 \) in so doing , america became a managed national economy these organizations were created to make capitalism work , to prevent destructive business cycles and to moderate the harsh , invisible hand of adam smith this is what now must occur on a global scale the world needs an institution that has a hand on the economic rudder when the seas become stormy it needs a global central bank the sad fact is that we cannot rely on existing institutions or on national leaders for global economic stability the international monetary fund knows how to deal with one or a few countries at a time , but not an international phenomenon in which all countries' problems occur at once and are linked the world bank s mission has included financing big projects and alleviating poverty , but it is not designed for financial crises simply trying to coordinate the world s powerful central banks the fed and the new european central bank , for instance would n't work , either if there is no inflation in the united states , the fed wo n't lower interest rates simply because that would help , say , southeast asia such global responsibility is not in the fed s charter the european central bank , meanwhile , seems proud of its narrow focus on europe the result is inadequate attention to the threequarters of the world consisting of emerging markets effective collaboration among finance ministries and treasuries is also unlikely to materialize these agencies are responsible to elected legislatures , and politics in the industrial countries is more preoccupied with internal events than with international stability an independent central bank with responsibility for maintaining global financial stability is the only way out no one else can do what is needed inject more money into the system to spur growth , reduce the skyhigh debts of emerging markets , and oversee the operations of shaky financial institutions a global central bank could provide more money to the world economy when it is rapidly losing steam for example , it could buy the bonds of the central bank of brazil , thereby injecting hard currency into that country when it most needs the help \( like right now \) it would have the ability to buy a country s debt at steep discounts , a crucial need now because in countries like thailand and venezuela debts are piling up and preventing new lending and new investment ultimately a lot of this debt could be resold at a profit such a bank would play an oversight role for banks and other financial institutions everywhere , providing some uniform standards for prudent lending in places like china and mexico the regulation need not be heavyhanded providing clear and reasonably verified information to the market on the real state of banks around the world would be a leap forward investors could then make the informed judgments that they could n't have made in , say , russia or indonesia none of these functions are being performed effectively now , and it will be impossible to have a world economy that does n't resemble a reckless roller coaster unless they are there are two ways a global central bank could be financed it could have lines of credit from all central banks , drawing on them in bad times and repaying when the markets turn up alternately and admittedly more difficult to carry out it could be financed by a very modest tariff on all trade , collected at the point of importation , or by a tax on certain global financial transactions one thing that would not be acceptable would be for the bank to be at the mercy of shorttermoriented legislatures witness how the united states congress has consistently failed to provide new money for the imf even as the world economy slides toward deep recession a crucial political question is , to whom would a global central bank be accountable \? it would have too much power to be governed only by technocrats , although it must be led by the best of them one possibility would be to link the new bank to an enlarged group of seven perhaps a g15 that would include the g7 plus rotating members like mexico , brazil , south africa , poland , india , china and south korea another issue is the relationship between a global bank and the fed there would have to be very close collaboration the global bank would not operate within the united states , and it would not be able to override the decisions of our central bank but it could supply the missing international ingredient emergency financing for cashstarved emerging markets it would n't affect american mortgage rates , but it could help the profitability of american multinational companies by creating a healthier global environment for their businesses it is never easy to create a new institution too many people have vested interests in the status quo moreover , when these new structures are most needed , officials are preoccupied with managing the current crisis when calm is restored , attention turns to something else but the current global financial slide , with no one at the center to limit the damage , is evidence enough that there is a huge gap in the structures necessary to make globalization work as the eminent economic historian charles kindleberger said in examining the causes of the depression , for the world economy to be stabilized , there has to be a stabilizer , one stabilizer he was commenting on the lack of leadership by america in the 1930 s today , with the united states still showing no appetite for such a role , a global central bank could be an enormous help drawing \( dwayne schoop \)
washington , june 3 in the instant celebrity shorthand of capital power , it was plato and jake , as easy to remember as mutt and jeff , who held this city s attention today as they took up the defense of monica s lewinsky between them , plato cacheris and jacob a stein have more than eight decades of experience as leading courtroom lawyers to offer ms lewinsky , the former white house intern who is at the heart of the criminal investigation of president clinton s behavior between them , the two lawyers present a dynamic of differing personality traits , negotiating skills and courtroom cunning that friends in the bar say has instantly strengthened ms lewinsky s hand in her struggle to avoid indictment the two were on the case today , advising ms lewinsky as battlehardened elders with as sharp an appetite for highstakes trials as for intricate bargaining aimed at immunity in their first 24 hours , they paid a lawyerly dropin visit to the office of kenneth w starr , the independent counsel investigating the relationship between the president and ms lewinsky they also began the long unraveling of ms lewinsky s version of oval office events but offered only a glimpse of their initial impressions as a team jake is more detached and professorial and scholarly than i am , said mr cacheris in a telephone interview i am more of an alley cat in the courtroom than he is i get a little more strident in some ways , the two could not be more different the 73yearold mr stein , the son of a washington lawyer , had the boyhood dream of becoming a vaudevillian juggler i thought that would be a wonderful life , to do something to perfection , he once said , settling instead for 50 years in the law , a reputation as the unofficial dean of the capital s bar , and juggling for fun he himself has been an independent counsel hailed as the very model of one in his disciplined investigation and exoneration of edwin a meese 3d , the counselor to president ronald reagan but that experience , mr stein said recently , convinced him the independent counsel s office has the power to destroy people by contrast , the 69yearold mr cacheris , the son of a greek immigrant who bought into a small chain of waffle restaurants , had the childhood fantasy of becoming ambassador to greece but became instead a hardball defense lawyer specializing in highprofile , highly politicized cases he hates paperwork , partners' meetings and procrastinators , but loves notorious defendants the president and vernon jordan are already taken , he joked two months ago as he agreed to represent the relatively minor figure of the chauffeur to vernon e jordan jr , the presidential confidant featured in the starr inquiry so it s tough luck for me the new team s experiences have equipped them for either alternative in the evolving starr investigation careful negotiation for immunity or , in the event of the indictment of ms lewinsky , an allout court fight mr cacheris s peers credit him with some spectacular dealmaking in recent years , notably the agreement that spared aldrich h ames execution as a convicted spy mr stein , in turn , is respected for winning the sole acquittal in the major watergate criminal trial in the nixon era i 'd say ms lewinsky now has a stunning team , said kenneth w parkinson , former counsel for the nixon reelection committee , who was successfully defended by mr stein they 're not going to do anything that would be stupid or out of character even mr starr s office sent out some rare positive vibes today with prosecutors' expressing their relief that finally , as one put it , they were dealing with seasoned criminal defense professionals who knew the ways of washington the two lawyers bonded two decades ago during the watergate trial , when mr cacheris represented attorney general john n mitchell , while mr stein defended mr parkinson the two play tennis on the court at mr cacheris s home in alexandria , va , and they see each other in the summer at their beach houses they enjoy reminiscing about the fact that they are both products of district of columbia public schools , in the days , mr cacheris said , when students from the maryland and virginia suburbs would pay 25 a year to attend when mr cacheris sold the town house that housed his law practice a few years ago , mr stein invited him to take space in his building five blocks north of the white house it s almost a goodcop , badcop team , said paul f rothstein , a professor at georgetown university law center who teaches with mr stein and is a longtime friend of both lawyers they both shine in the courtroom and in making deals , but plato is more garrulous , more talkative , more slapontheback , hail fellow well met but with the threat that 'i could beat you up bad if i have to' while that is the reality with jake , too , he does n't wear it on his sleeve as much as plato does as elite members of the washington bar , their fees are in the top range of 400 or so an hour but the two newcomers to the lewinsky investigation also exemplify the smalltown closeness of the capital bar mr stein and mr starr crossed paths on the senate s ethics inquiry of senator bob packwood when mr stein defended the senator and mr starr vetted the packwood diaries for 17 years , mr cacheris was the law partner of william g hundley , who represents mr jordan mr hundley s son , john , works in mr cacheris s office
like thousands of other elderly americans , eugene delorenzo cannot find a medicare health maintenance organization in his area mr delorenzo , a 75yearold retired real estate broker and his wife , yuriko , enrolled july 1 in the medicare plan of healthnet , a unit of foundation health systems inc just three weeks later , healthnet , unable to make a strong profit in the rural northern california county where mr delorenzo lives , said it was ending its coverage there my first thought was , 'well , what are we going to do now \? ' mr delorenzo recalled it was n't going to do any good to get angry that s just the way these hmo s operate with few options , the delorenzos enrolled in traditional feeforservice medicare , the federally financed health care plan for the disabled and people 65 or older they may also have to pay hundreds of dollars more in premiums for a supplemental policy to replace the generous benefits healthnet had offered people like the delorenzos are fast becoming common statistics after aggressively recruiting the elderly and the disabled into their medicare plans , many of the nation s hmo s are now heavily retreating the united healthcare corporation , once a darling of wall street , recently took a 900 million charge against earnings , in part to scale back its medicare operations in 35 counties in the last year , aetna , pacificare health systems , oxford health plans , foundation health systems , kaiser permanente and blue cross and blue shield associations have canceled medicare plans in parts of 13 states virtually no medicare hmo s are available in utah or in rural ohio with medicare costs escalating wildly , congress has long looked to managedcare plans as the prime remedy introduced in 1985 to allow private insurers to cover the elderly , medicare hmo s provide health care more cheaply than the government does they also tend to offer more benefits to consumers and reduce the amount of claims paperwork despite the hmo problems in the medicare market , washington is now pushing for even more people to enroll in the plans yet financial setbacks for some hmo s have raised serious questions as to whether they can prosper covering medicare patients though critics of managed care are quick to say they cannot , analysts say that several hmo s namely humana inc and pacificare , two of the nation s largest medicare providers are making money on their plans , at least for now but even these companies have had to make adjustments there are a few hmo s that can be successful with medicare , and they should prosper , said kenneth s abramowitz , a health care analyst with sanford c bernstein company still , he added , some of these earnings charges related to medicare , united healthcare s for example , show just how difficult this business is several problems have bedeviled medicare hmo s for one thing , only 156 percent of medicare s 375 million members are enrolled in medicare hmo s though the government says it has overpaid the medicare hmo s , the companies say the federal monthly stipend for each enrollee is not enough to provide extensive benefits that is especially problematic in rural areas , where medicare hmo s cannot enroll enough members to negotiate discounts with local health care providers as a result , analysts say , hmo s must focus primarily on urban markets and must avoid offering generous prescription drug plans , which can attract a disproportionate number of sickly people while medicare has long been a perilous market for many hmo s , it may soon get even tougher the balanced budget act of 1997 will reduce the government s medicare spending by 115 billion over the next five years increases in the monthly stipends the government pays to hmo s have been sharply reduced , a move that could further lower operating margins , which have always been thin and now hover around 3 percent managedcare companies receive some 5 , 688 annually on average for each of their medicare patients , according to the health care financing administration , which runs medicare uncle sam s stipend comes with strings attached the hmo s usually agree to provide more benefits than traditional medicare does allowances for prescription drugs , hearing aids and eyeglasses and they accept the premise that they can make profits by controlling costs better than the government can a key to a healthy bottom line is to avoid a large percentage of sick patients , which can quickly devour revenues the odds appear to be in the medicare health maintenance organizations' favor 90 percent of all medicare enrollees are generally healthy and require only about 1 , 200 on average from the government each year for medical bills , according to the urban institute s analysis of the 1996 medicare current beneficiary survey , the latest figures available in contrast , the analysis found , the remaining 10 percent , who are sick , cost medicare some 37 , 000 a year each
a federal appeals court yesterday upheld the military s longstanding ban on homosexual activity and its more recent do n't ask , do n't tell policy , saying that the rules do not violate any constitutional rights because of the special circumstances of the military the united states court of appeals for the second circuit , in manhattan , said that individual rights traditionally have been curtailed in the armed forces the court also found that the military s justifications for the policies were rational because they promoted unit cohesion , enhanced privacy and reduced sexual tension courts are ill suited to secondguess military judgments that bear upon military capability or readiness , the threemember appeals panel said the decision overturned two rulings by a federal district judge in manhattan that struck down the ban on homosexual activity and the do n't ask , do n't tell provision , which allows homosexuals to serve in the armed forces as long as their sexual orientation is kept private the judge , eugene h nickerson , said the policies violated the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and free speech , and discriminated against homosexuals for no other reason than to cater to the prejudices of heterosexuals a lawyer for six reservists who had challenged the policies said that they had not decided whether to ask the supreme court to review the appeals court s decision at least eight other lawsuits challenging the policies have been filed in federal courts around the country over the last few years , but none have been taken up by the supreme court the decision basically gives to the military and congress , when it is acting on military matters , carte blanche to discriminate , said beatrice dohrn , the legal director of the lambda legal defense and education fund , a national gay rights legal organization ms dohrn , along with the american civil liberties union , represents the military personnel who filed that lawsuit in 1994 at the time , two of the plaintiffs were on active duty and four were in the military reserves all six are now reservists this decision is an example of a court saying , 'we do n't want to look , we do n't want to examine , ' ms dohrn said lieut colonel tom begines , a defense department spokesman , declined to comment on the court decision he defended the provisions , noting that they resulted from months of congressional hearings the policy maintains the necessary balance between the prohibition of homosexual conduct in the military and the privacy rights of service members , colonel begines said the do n't ask , do n't tell policy , a compromise between the clinton administration and congress enacted in 1993 , went into effect the next year under the policy , recruiters may not ask about sexual orientation , and commanders cannot investigate homosexual activity unless they have compelling evidence that it has occurred the military also kept in effect a longstanding ban on homosexual acts anyone found to have engaged in such activity , including the holding of hands and conduct that takes place off base and in private , must be discharged judge nickerson struck down the do n't tell provision in 1995 , saying that congress could not enact discriminatory legislation just to insulate heterosexual service members from statements that might excite their prejudices he also dismissed the government s contention that morale and discipline would suffer if gay men and lesbians were allowed to serve openly in the military the government appealed , and the court of appeals returned the case to judge nickerson , saying that he had also to determine whether the ban on homosexual activity was constitutional if the provision against activity was found to be constitutional , the appeals court said , the do n't tell , do n't ask policy would also pass constitutional muster in 1997 , judge nickerson ruled that the ban on activity violated the equalprotection guarantee of the fifth amendment becoming the first judge to overturn the provision but in its 23page decision released yesterday , the court of appeals panel found that senior military leaders , in testimony before congress , had offered adequate justifications for the rule barring homosexual activity the judges on the panel were wilfred feinberg , john m walker jr and pierre n leval
in 1976 the composer philip glass and the theater maker robert wilson unveiled einstein on the beach , an opera that expanded the horizons of musical theater it was nearly five hours long with no intermission , no plot , no narrative and a sung text that consisted entirely of numbers and solfege syllables mr glass and mr wilson s latest collaboration takes their fondness for experimenting with theatrical time and space literally into another dimension monsters of grace , which opens on wednesday at the brooklyn academy of music and proceeds on a 24city american tour , is billed as a digital opera in three dimensions the opera part is a bit misleading it might more accurately be described as a 68minute song cycle in 13 scenes , 9 of them settings of poems by the 13thcentury sufi mystic mevlana jalaluddin rumi , translated and adapted by the american poet coleman barks while the philip glass ensemble performs the score , the audience views a 3d computeranimated film through special polarized lenses in contrast to the thrills and spills associated with 3d films , monsters of grace dwells meditatively on such scenes as a boy riding an oldfashioned bicycle and a helicopter hovering over the great wall of china the slowmoving , dreamlike imagery will be immediately recognizable to fans of mr wilson , whose abstract , often controversial spectacles have appeared at theaters and opera houses around the world but it has been executed by kleiserwalczak construction , the computeranimation company that has supplied special effects for hollywood movies like stargate and mortal kombat annihilation high art meets high tech it is a brave encroachment into unexplored territory , bernard holland wrote in the new york times in april , when monsters of grace was performed as a work in progress in los angeles for those who wondered when classical music would get around to connecting with the rest of the world , this may be the beginning of an answer connecting mr glass and mr wilson , denizens of the international highart circuit , with the world of mainstream america was very much on the mind of the producer , jedediah wheeler , when he enlisted them to produce the touring theater piece that became monsters of grace mr wheeler s company , international production associates , represents mr glass and produced a revival of einstein on the beach in 1992 mr glass has gained widespread fame through his concerts and film scores , from godfrey reggio s koyaanisqatsi to martin scorsese s kundun but mr wilson remains relatively unknown in the united states , however revered he may be throughout europe in recent years he created three rock musicals at the thalia theatre in hamburg , germany the black rider and alice , with scores by tom waits , and time rocker , composed by lou reed and a second opera with mr glass , the white raven , in lisbon to help remedy that homeland neglect , mr wheeler proposed that mr glass and mr wilson cook up something more portable than einstein , which , in the revival , took three days to install from 1993 to 1996 , they developed storyboards for monsters of grace \( the title originated as a slip of the tongue , when mr wilson , touring his oneman rendition of hamlet , found himself repeatedly mangling the line angels and ministers of grace defend us \) mr wheeler , seeing the designs , was bemused to encounter such images as a hawk circling a helicopter and a giant foot landing in the desert so much for portable in 1996 , while pondering how to build such props for a stage spectacle , mr wheeler visited the massachusetts museum of contemporary art in north adams , where he met jeff kleiser and diana walczak , a married couple whose computeranimation firm rented space in the museum they showed him their studio , where they are now creating the adventures of spiderman , a sevenminute 3d installation for a universal studios theme park in orlando , fla intrigued by the technology , mr wheeler came to realize that although the initial costs might be higher , a film with music would be cheaper to tour than a live wilson spectacle mr glass was game mr wilson , though dubious , eventually agreed none of them knew what they were getting into when we began talking about a digital realization , there was some concern that it would be very cold , mr glass said recently from naples i wanted the text to have a strong human element the combination of intense spirituality and erotic passion in rumi s poems appealed to mr glass , who had recently created three works based on films by jean cocteau the basic thrust of rumi s work is seeing the ordinary world as a transcendent world , which is very much like cocteau , said mr glass , who is himself a practitioner of tibetan buddhism i'm very interested in people who look at the world and transfigure it through their own spiritual development when he finally saw the animation kleiserwalczak had created from mr wilson s storyboards , mr glass was astonished it was n't cold at all , he said even though computer graphics is all done by mathematics , it looks like a photograph of a ring of fire on the ocean or a chair descending from the sky , stuff that s impossible to put on the stage you get into this funny place where you do n't know if you 're looking at something real or something in a dream although he s never told me this , i think they really are bob s dreams
mayor rudolph giuliani likes to show that he cannot be swayed by demonstrations but we would like to urge him to take yesterday s protest by sidewalk vendors as a cue to ponder whether he has lost a sense of proportion about his civility campaign there is a difference between making the streets safer and cleaner and making war on the new yorkness of new york city in his zeal for order and obedience , he must not destroy the lively street scene that is part of the city s historic flavor no one misses the squeegee men , but do we really want to outlaw the corner hotdog stand \? mayor giuliani s three appointees to the sidewalk vendor review panel have agreed to ban vendors on 144 streets in manhattan the issue is whether those who sell coffee or silk ties or incense cause too much congestion , particularly in downtown manhattan and the busier areas of midtown in the next few weeks the review panel is expected to rule on dozens of additional complaints , most of them , like earlier pleas , from owners of shops and restaurants or from business improvement districts hundreds of vendors will be sent rolling to other locations in about 60 days , banned from sidewalks some of them have worked for years the complaints against these vendors are understandable , on some level under current rules they can set up carts on most sidestreets , provided they are not blocking building entrances , corners or hydrants if their tiny canteens mean cheap and speedy eats for a hungry pedestrian , they spell tough competition for nearby fastfood restaurants part of the reason is that vendors do n't pay for employees or rent or even for tickets if their customers litter the sidewalk city officials also argue that part of what they are doing is enforcing established city laws , to control those illegal merchants who roll out a table or a mat until the local police officer nudges them along in a manner that is as old as the city s cobbled streets the real problem is that mayor giuliani s review panel has no real definition of congestion and no real standards for what makes a street inappropriate for vendors some instances of congestion are apparently worse than others , leaving questions about whether the term is too dependent on the clout of the person or organization doing the complaining as city councilman anthony weiner put it , the review panel s arbitrary targets were the result of sophisticated lobbying we have supported the review panel as a way to give more balance to the vendors' eternal struggle for place , but now the panel needs to have better criteria for judging whether a cart deserves its corner perhaps the mayor and his staff should consider a proposal by city councilman kenneth fisher to allow one vendor per intersection , with some flexibility for areas that could use more or none at all picking the vendors for prime locations would be a challenge , of course mr fisher is considering a lottery or rotation , with some hope that longtime and lawabiding regulars could be given priority any new system will never and should never totally eradicate the hurlyburly nature of the city s pushcart trade there must be a better way for the city to hear the voices of the hotdog vendors and their customers , not just those who sell sandwiches or real estate nearby
san cristobal de las casas , mexico , nov 20 top leaders of the zapatista rebels , wearing their trademark black ski masks , emerged from their jungle hideouts to appear in public today for the first time in two years the zapatistas' reappearance in this colonial town in the highlands of chiapas state , which the rebels briefly occupied in january 1994 , had awakened hopes that they might consider renewing peace talks with the government but those hopes were quickly diminished tonight when the indian rebels angrily complained that a commission of federal lawmakers charged with organizing the event had failed to provide beds and food for them and treated them like animals we are not asking for luxury hotels or grand banquets or bar service , said a zapatista commander who is known only by his nom de guerre , tacho , speaking to a room crowded with their supporters he said that many of the 29 zapatista delegates to the threeday meeting had no beds , and were relegated to a building in a rustic conference center here where he said the plumbing was broken in icy tones , commander tacho accused the lawmakers of being racist and acting like spanish conquistadores the halfdozen legislators on the commission come from all the parties in the mexican congress , including both progovernment and prozapatista groups they serve as mediators between the guerrillas and the government none are indians the zapatistas demanded an apology but did not threaten to walk out of the meetings talks with the government fell apart in late 1996 , with the zapatistas charging that president ernesto zedillo had reneged on accords reached earlier that year in addition to restarting contact with the mediating commission , the zapatistas also summoned 2 , 500 of their civilian supporters to strategize about publicizing their message in other areas of mexico beyond chiapas since a paramilitary band of government supporters killed 45 zapatista sympathizers in december 1997 , zapatista leaders had severed contact with the outside world their agreement to attend the brainstorming session this weekend with dozens of prozapatista political groups seemed to indicate that they felt they had become too isolated however , subcommander marcos , a nonindian who is the rebels' chief strategist , did not attend so far
boston how could i not be glad to know my birth \? so says oedipus , in the 2 , 500yearold play , still unaware of the terrible revelation to come that his parents were not the people who had raised him well , past and present came together in a big way last week in a modern variation of the old story , as two families learned that their children , rebecca grace chittum and callie marie johnson , had been switched at birth each family found out that for three years they had been raising , and calling their own , another family s child worse , but like some fateful punishment described by sophocles , rebecca chittum s parents were killed in an automobile accident even as the mistake was being uncovered now , one little girl has lost the people she knew as her mother and father , and the other has lost the real parents she never knew a very contemporary childsupport battle and dna testing may have set this particular story in motion , but the issues are ancient and it is exactly the crash of the modern into the timeless that shakes us then how could he love me so , if i was not his \? oedipus demands when told that polybos was not his father then why did he call me son \? the questions oedipus poignantly asks are at the heart of the matter they are about the nature of the competing imperatives of genetics and love we may not daily think much about it , but we all subliminally know that , like oedipus , we serve two masters one is our kin by genes , and the other is our family through love sometimes they overlap but other times they coexist restlessly , horses in one harness that pull toward different homes like the wagon s uneasy driver , we often find ourselves to have arrived at unintended places in fact , few issues are more salient in contemporary culture we have witnessed a flood of memoirs and talk show revelations that repeatedly describe the stark failures of real families to love children adequately or keep them safe at the same time , we struggle with a thousand questions about how much weight to give the claims of genes does baby m belong to her birth mother , or to the parents who commissioned the pregnancy \? should a child stay with her foster parents who love her , or should she be adopted by the genetic grandparents whom she has never met \? what should we do when a man who once sold his sperm to a sperm bank tries to search for the child anonymously conceived from his seed \? or , as in the 1996 movie secrets and lies , how should we respond if the daughter we long ago gave up for adoption , the child of an embarrassing or unchosen sexual encounter , decides to look us up \? we might all at moments , like shakespeare s exasperated henry iv , wish we could switch our unruly son for our friend s perfectly behaved child o that it could be provd that some nighttripping fairy had exchangd in cradleclothes our children where they lay then would i have his harry , and he mine but in truth , given the chance , would we do it \? and could we bear the consequences if we did \? matters are complicated further by the fact that at least until they are grown , and sometimes forever , children must rely on adults to tell them about their paternity and maternity when , early in the odyssey , athena asks telemachus if he is odysseus s son , he answers simply my mother says i am his son i know not surely who has known his own engendering \? he cannot know none of us can know who we are unless someone tells us or at least we could n't until recently , when dna testing came on the scene in march , paula johnson , mother of callie , took her former boyfriend carlton conley to court to try to make him pay more child support the judge ordered dna testing on july 2 the tests revealed that not only was mr conley not the father of this child , but ms johnson was not her mother it s been absolutely devastating , ms johnson said i mean , there are just no words that can describe every way that i feel whatever else , it seems that we have some hard thinking to do about dna testing certainly it is noteworthy that a matter of so much awe has become a routine lab result seeing the shock and deep emotion engendered by the unintended consequences of what has become an almost casual court order , it is tempting to join iocaste , oedipus s wife and mother , in her plea , for god s sake , let us have no more questioning but that s not likely , and probably ultimately not desirable over the years , as a psychotherapist and as a neighbor , i have heard many stories not about the results of dna testing per se , but about the confusion that results for adults when they are unexpectedly told that their uncle was their father or that their sister was really their mother and , conversely , i have heard many times from people shy confessions of how they loved a neighbor more than a parent , or an adopted child more than one to whom they gave birth what can we do , hearing such news , but listen respectfully and with real interest \? sometimes , as the shady lawyer claims in brecht s the caucasian chalk circle , of all ties , the ties of blood are strongest other times , like the play s judge , we recognize that our only chance for real justice comes in honoring love over blood so , too , sometimes the truth frees us sometimes it devastates this is the complexity we have to live in and have always had to live in science offers us dna testing , cloning and in vitro fertilization but as often as these techniques lift us out of one human dilemma , they drop us straight into another if we had access to solomon s dna , would it offer up his wisdom \? all the signs suggest that we will need it

last fall , edward i koch and rudolph w giuliani partners in new york city politics until they effectively stopped talking to each other about five years ago taped a televised endorsement for senator alfonse m d'amato that playfully evoked their rivalry for both , it proved to be less unpleasant than they had expected , according to associates of each but this week , these two epic new york city figures returned to their regularly scheduled programming at city hall on monday , mr giuliani served up an unflattering imitation of mr koch highpitched and nasal and described the koch years as historically overrun with corruption and yesterday , mr koch compared mr giuliani to torquemada , the grand inquisitor of the spanish inquisition , and accused the giuliani administration of its own corruption the spectacle of mayors and former mayors squabbling is hardly surprising in new york city , particularly when one of them is the voluble mr giuliani he and his immediate predecessor , david n dinkins , have long had an antagonistic relationship , and mr koch rarely had a kind word for any former mayor but fiorello h la guardia but there is an extra dimension to the uncomfortable dealings between mr giuliani and mr koch they are more alike than either would care to admit , have similar ideas about how new york city should be run and have always appealed to similar constituencies and more than a few people are coming to believe that these two men are really wrestling over which mayor historians will judge to be the most dominant in the second half of this century it s an issue of legacy , said raymond b harding , the liberal party leader , who is both a close adviser to mr giuliani and a student of new york city politics of who will be remembered as the greater mr koch has faulted the giuliani administration for not investigating charges that the city s largest municipal union conducted a fraudulent vote in 1996 , when it approved a contract that included a twoyear wage freeze and mr giuliani has invoked the municipal corruption scandals of mr koch s third term he s dying for a corruption scandal in my administration so that he does n't end up with the most corrupt administration in the last half of the 20th century , the mayor said on monday not surprisingly , both claims lose their edge under close inspection mr koch says the union scandal eclipses the one in his own administration because it involves more money millions of dollars in lost raises but even if true , it remains money lost to workers , not to the city treasury it involved alleged wrongdoing by union leaders , rather than city hall officials , and there is no evidence that the giuliani administration ignored charges of union corruption mr koch s third term was pockmarked by corruption scandals , but none of the investigations led by a united states attorney named giuliani turned up any evidence of involvement by mr koch there s not a shred of evidence or suggestion that mayor koch knew of crimes that were being committed by several of the democratic leaders and the borough presidents , or had any involvement in those crimes , or would have done anything other than turn them in if he had found out about them , mr giuliani said in april 1987 , according to a newsday account that was faxed by mr koch s law office last evening mr koch happily campaigned for mr giuliani in 1993 and voted for him again in 1997 he does not regret either vote you know , i agree with him on about 80 percent of the substantive matters , mr koch said yesterday he s a good mayor , but his personality prevents him from becoming a great mayor he s mean he s vindictive he does n't always tell the truth cristyne f lategano , the mayor s communications director , said , the frustrating thing is that mayor giuliani has a sense of humor that sometimes the press does n't get most of the mayor s acerbic comments about mr koch , she said , were really only jokes yes , ms lategano said , the mayor had accused mr koch of running a corrupt city hall but he was only setting the record straight , she added mr koch said none of this concerned him i am proud of my 12 years as mayor , he said i'm proud that when i walk down the street , people say , 'oh , mr mayor , you must run again' you know my response \? he said , pausing for effect the people threw me out and now the people must be punished
it began 35 years ago , precable , preinternet , back when the current glut of culture and quasiculture , had it been foreseen , might have made its mission seem particularly daunting but when the new york film festival returns on friday with woody allen s new film , celebrity , it reflects the distinctly diminished prospects for serious film and the way the festival probably plays a more important role now than its originators could have expected when it began the event , which remains one of the smaller and most selective of the major film festivals , will offer 28 films from 15 countries highprofile offerings include mr allen s film , about the culture of celebrity emir kusturica s black cat , white cat , about a gypsy settlement along the polluted banks of the danube , and todd solondz s happiness , a dark look at a dysfunctional suburban community other highlights include a special presentation of strike , the first film made by sergei eisenstein a tribute to the swedish director ingmar bergman and showings of his new film , the presence of a clown , and two films by the british director john boorman his new one , the general , and his 1967 thriller , point blank the festival ends on oct 11 with the dreamlife of angels , the first film by a french director , erick zonca richard pena , program director of the film society of lincoln center and chairman of the screening committee for the festival , said the event was taking place in a cultural environment that is much more competitive and complicated than the world of the first festival , which made its debut in 1963 with such films as luis bunuel s exterminating angel , roman polanski s knife in the water and yasujiro ozu s autumn afternoon but , for all the explosion of the media , culture and entertainment , mr pena said , almost nothing has impinged on the festival s mandate of giving exposure to worthy films from around the world instead , while there is more theater , more performance art , more music , more of most kinds of cultural experiences available now than at the festival s start , that is definitely not the case with serious film there s much more culture , many more outlets than people might have imagined when the festival began , but almost none of them doing anything like what we do , he said take cable twenty years ago , i think a lot of people were under the impression that with this enormous number of channels , there would be this amazing variety of things on television channels devoted just to old french films or experimental films it seems not to have happened at all a lot of cable is less provocative or less ambitious than a lot of broadcast tv rather than an openingup of culture , in some ways it s made people more americancentric indeed , the decline of repertory or arthouse theaters and the narrowed opportunities for anything other than hollywood blockbusters and skillfully marketed independent films make the festival at least as important now as it ever has been , mr pena said thirty years ago , there was a much healthier alternative or independent or arthouse scene showing foreignlanguage films , he said there s been a great lessening of the role these kinds of films play in the american cultural life some people say that s because foreign films are just not as good anymore as they were in the 50 s , 60 s and 70 s when people flocked to these films obviously , my colleagues and i disagree there s an enormous amount of wonderful stuff from all over , from iran , from taiwan a festival like ours is such an important launching pad because the commercial possibilities of these films are so much less than they once were over the years , the festival has introduced the american public to films like francois truffaut s day for night , marcel ophuls s sorrow and the pity , bernardo bertolucci s last tango in paris , neil jordan s crying game and quentin tarantino s pulp fiction the most talkedabout of this year s films may be happiness , by mr solondz , whose welcome to the dollhouse was a critical success in 1996 the film , which will be released in theaters on oct 16 , is a scabrous look at the relationships and sexual mores of an extended family in a wellheeled new jersey suburb but the festival , as always , tries to cover as much cultural and cinematic ground as possible familiar names include alain resnais , with same old song , and eric rohmer , with a tale of autumn , the final work in his tales of the four seasons less familiar names likely to get attention include samira makhmalbaf , an iranian , whose first film , the apple , tells the story of young sisters imprisoned by their father in their home and what happens after their liberation the celebration , by a danish director , thomas vinterberg , is a taut family melodrama flowers of shanghai , by a taiwanese director , hou hsiaohsien , is a tale of sexual intrigue , set in a 19thcentury shanghai brothel , that is based on an 1894 novel wendy keys , executive producer for special projects with the film society , said this year s festival , rather than reflecting a particular trend , reflected the breadth of high quality films being made these are very individual films , she said they do n't speak to any trend they each pop up as their own entity , rather than as part of something larger photo melanie griffith and

andersonville , ga , april 9 the old soldiers stood ramrod straight , some with the help of canes , as a marine corps band played the national anthem at the dedication of the national prisoner of war museum here today try as they might , some could not keep their saluting hands from quivering with palsy for others , it was the poignancy of the day and not the infirmities of age that made them tremble after all this time , after the years of torture and deprivation and the decades of haunting memories , two senators and a governor and more than 3 , 000 others came to pay tribute to the sacrifices they had made for american liberty now people will know what we 've done , said bill j ashworth , a korean war veteran in a wheelchair , who wiped away tears as he recalled his 33 months of captivity at the hands of the chinese they 'll know the price we paid for our freedom the mission of the new museum here , built on the site of an infamous civil war prison in southwest georgia , is to insure that americans never forget the 800 , 000 soldiers taken prisoner in their country s wars , from the revolution to the persian gulf conflict prisoners of war have long had their own groups dedicated to preserving the memories and the camaraderie of their torment but many have felt that their country has never adequately acknowledged their contributions that is particularly true of those taken captive in world war ii , men who came home with the rest of the troops to a jubilant country that never paused to recognize that some soldiers had been severely scarred by their detention many stoically kept their nightmares to themselves but as their generation began to die out , a new urgency emerged to a large extent , we , as prisoners , did n't talk about it , said john s edwards , who was taken prisoner in germany in world war ii now , if i may use a euphemism , mr edwards said , we want to capture those stories this museum tells the whole story of those who truly know what it s like to be without freedom the 10 , 000squarefoot museum emphasizes the commonality of the prisoners' experiences in various conflicts rather than depicting the uniqueness of individual wars there are sections on capture , on living conditions , on communications , on privation , on morale and relationships , and on escape and freedom throughout today s dedication ceremonies , which were held under a white tent , speakers referred repeatedly to the common struggle waged by prisoners of war to preserve their dignity and humanity their story is the story of a struggle against daunting odds to choose their own way , to stay faithful to a shared cause , to remain human beings in a world where they were treated like animals , said senator john mccain of arizona , who spent more than five years in a north vietnamese prison most of the 58 million cost of the museum was raised by private veterans' groups , with the federal government putting in about 24 million the state of georgia contributed 12 million to build an entrance road construction began in 1996 , although the museum s roots date back to 1970 , when congress added the site of the civil war prison at andersonville to the national park system as a memorial to all prisoners of war the prison held more than 45 , 000 union soldiers during the final 14 months of the war , and almost 13 , 000 prisoners died here of malnutrition and disease housed in a brick building that imitates the towers and guard houses of a typical prison camp , the museum makes generous use of the televised images and voices of surviving prisoners they knew how to reduce a man in 20 minutes to a selfloathing , sobbing wreck , says one there also are models of bamboo tiger cages that were used to house american prisoners in vietnam , and of the small cells in hanoi where prisoners were shackled by their ankles to concrete platforms there are artifacts like the white linen clothing worn by sgt nathan p kinsley , a union soldier at andersonville , and the mug shaped from a butter tin by f g perkins in a world war ii camp in germany the ingenuity of the prisoners is illustrated in a display of handmade crystal radios crafted in german camps from bartered , smuggled and stolen parts another exhibit includes a remarkable threemasted ship made out of soup bones by prisoners in the war of 1812 there are videos of mothers recalling the ominous days when dreaded telegrams arrived there are displays of letters written home , both hopeful and apologetic dear edith , wrote curtis g davis on a postcard from a japanese camp in 1944 , i'm very sorry i have not written sooner , but i was so sure i had been but a memory to you while the museum s exhibits present a static account of the prison experience , the former prisoners of war who gathered today in the lobby and courtyards provided a living history for all who would listen james downey jr , an 83yearold world war ii veteran from newport news , va , told of surviving dysentery and malaria in a filipino camp his younger brother , detained in the same camp , did not make it col wayne waddell , air force , retired , who spent 2 , 069 days in prison in north vietnam , recalled being tied up so compactly by his captives that his fellow inmates said he resembled nothing so much as a suitcase joseph a sterner , who was captured in the philippines in 1942 and spent 40 months in japanese camps , told of wasting away to 90 pounds from 145 pounds he recalled the day when american b29 s announced the end of the war by flying over their camp and dropping bundles of cheese , cigarettes and chewing gum we did n't jump up and down when the surrender came , he said we were just too tired the museum , and the stories of the former prisoners , had a deep impact on many of those who visited here today , perhaps none more than those currently in uniform i walked through with my wife , said lieut charles c heaton , a 31yearold navy pilot , and it was difficult for her to see that imprisonment is one of my possible fates you ca n't help but have a general awe these men have been in extreme circumstances and have shown courage that you and i do n't get to display we all stand in their shadows photos buck prewett , above left , helped paul lankford over a stream of water from a fountain at the dedication of the national prisoner of war museum

following are excerpts from president clinton s news conference yesterday , as recorded by the new york times before i take your questions , i 'd like to make a few comments on a couple of matters that i believe are essential to the strength of america in the 21st century five years ago , we started a new economic course for a new economy , a combined strategy of fiscal discipline , expanded trade , increased investment in education , science , technology and our people today , we received more good news that that strategy is working the latest economic report shows that in the first quarter of 1998 our economy grew at 42 percent wages are rising while inflation remains low this expansion is not fueled by big government deficits but by booming business investment in the first quarter , unemployment was the lowest in 28 years , inflation the lowest in 30 years , consumer confidence at its highest level in 30 years for five years in a row now , our economy has been rated the most competitive in the world we are living in an american economic renaissance in which opportunity is abundant , communities are getting stronger , families are more secure and more prosperous but we cannot allow the hum of our growing prosperity to lull us into complacency as estimates of the possible budget surplus expand , so , too , the suggestions that we immediately commit to spending that surplus on tax cuts and new spending but americans have worked too hard for too long to put our economic house in order , so i will strongly resist the use of a single penny of the surplus until we have first saved social security for the new century nor can we turn our backs on america s responsibility to lead in the world we see that , by the way , in the commitment today of the vice president and mrs gore as they represent our nation on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the state of israel today the health of our economy is also deeply affected by what goes on in global affairs and by the health of the global economy therefore i call on congress to step up to its responsibility and renew our commitment to the international monetary fund and to pay our united nations dues i am confident we can do this in a bipartisan fashion the debate over nato enlargement has been a model of bipartisan action i want to thank senators lott and daschle , senators helms and biden for their leadership on this issue i hope for a strongly positive vote in the senate later today because by admitting poland , hungary and the czech republic we come even closer than ever to realizing a dream of a generation a europe that is united , democratic and secure for the first time since the rise of nationstates on the european continent at the threshold of the 21st century , we are on the rise at home and abroad but we have to continue this progress we have to continue to work if we want economic advances and strong national security we have to continue to work if we hope to overcome our divisions at home and work together as one nation we can be everything that all of you want us to be and all americans want us to be , but i want to emphasize the fact that we are doing well today should not be a source of complacency it should not be a pretext to drift off into politics as usual or small matters we need to bear down and deal with the longterm challenges of the country q mr president , in view of a new court ruling , monica lewinsky may have to appear before a grand jury under the circumstances , do you stand by your previous denials of any relationship with her or that anyone encouraged her to lie \? and while i have the floor , do you think that the special prosecutor has gone beyond the call and is out to get you \? a well , i think modestly observant people are fully capable of drawing their own conclusions to the latter question and as to the former question , i have answered it repeatedly and have nothing to add to my former answer i have repeatedly said what the answer to that question is q mr president , wall street is back above 9100 and the dow was up 165 points at 1 o'clock a lot of americans are pouring money into the stock market now do you think that this stock market bubble is going to burst \? do you think people should be nervous about that \? a now i did n't comment on it when it dropped a lot and i do n't think i should now q the pentagon said this week you 're expected to decide whether to reduce us forces in the gulf soon has baghdad made sufficient progress on allowing weapons inspections to permit a reduction in force \? and if so , will we see an ending of the sanctions against iraq \? a well those are two very different questions let me say first of all , we are encouraged about the level of compliance so far with the un inspections and by the evidence that has been educed by the nuclear side that more progress has been made and i believe we 've already issued a statement that we believe that if baghdad will continue to work with us that by october we can , the un may well be able to certify that they are actually in compliance on the nuclear side and they can go from the inspection to the monitoring phase keep in mind , even under the agreements , the un resolution , no matter what is found out in any of these areas , there will still be a monitoring regime there
