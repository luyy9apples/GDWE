for three days the tube was awash with soviet experts , moscow correspondents , washington officials and news anchors whose schedules and vacations had been disturbed but once again , it was the pictures that told the story the tanks on the move in moscow and then on the move out boris yeltsin atop a tank calling for defiance and then before the russian parliament calling for punishment of the men who had planned the coup the coup masters submitting to a news conference that would have made for a saturday night live skit if so much had not been at stake later , there were other soviet officials , notably the soviet foreign minister , aleksandr a bessmertnykh , coming up from wherever they had been since monday and declaring their allegiance to the democratic process and most powerfully , the people on the street , through two threatening nights this story was n't tidy the events , so confused for two days , shook the network anchors out of their accustomed role of controllers of the news there they sit , night after night , presenting the day s happenings in tidy packages , like managers of classy stores but now there was no package , just blasts of announcements and rumors coming at them like snatches of hurricane bob the regulars all operated professionally , switching fast in pursuit of new developments , pausing for analysis , repeatedly cautioning viewers that much of the information they were passing along could not be verified dan rather , on cbs , who has a way of seeming most comfortable in uncomfortable positions , seemed to draw particular energy from the challenge once again , for the news junkie , there was no rival to cnn the fastmoving , continuing story has become its specialty you could not be sure when cbs would resume coverage , but cnn was always there repetition is in the nature of its operation the same pictures hour after hour , the same reports from the same correspondents and nobody except television reviewers need endure it but that does not take away what cnn has earned by simply hanging in although steve hurst , the cnn man in moscow , showed himself to be up there with the other pros , the general level of reporting remains less polished still , many of the most fascinating minutes of the three days came in cnn s live broadcasts of newscasts and news conferences from moscow on monday and tuesday , it was almost like the bad old times on wednesday , although soviet newscasters are far from demonstrative , the gorbachevian spirit was back and even while the hardliners seemed to be in control , interviewers used their questions to bring the news of anticoup demonstrations to viewers at the bigger networks , abc and cbs gave the most time to the story , with nbc tending to play catchup jim laurie , in moscow for abc , and jonathan sanders , for cbs , held steady as they tried to get a grip on happenings that were not easily grippable but abc was also guilty of the shallowest single bit of ostensible reporting on tuesday , after hours of announcing that diane sawyer had obtained an interview with mr yeltsin , whom the other networks had not succeeded in bringing before the cameras , world news tonight presented what turned out to be a twominute encounter it was good to see mr yeltsin at his command post , but this flashy piece of theater starring diane sawyer , with boris yeltsin was pure show business compliments are due to whoever chooses guests for the macneillehrer newshour on monday night , at the height of the coup , the pbs program brought on four soviet emigres who agreed , with scarcely a reservation , that it would fail sages , and a charmer let their names be known for the record dmitri k simes of the carnegie endowment for international peace , who is becoming television s favorite soviet watcher vitaly a korotich , the editor of the reformist soviet magazine ogonyok , and a charmer and two former kgb officials , viktor sheymov and stanislav levchenko how did they know \? well , one of the kgb men pointed out that successful coups in the soviet union are carried out over the weekend , when everybody is off at their dachas never on a monday other familiar presences , like stephen f cohen on cbs , robert legvold on abc and marshall d shulman on nbc , took a more prudent course these media academics often seem to be in competition , playing itoldyousobeforehedid this time out , henry a kissinger , the expert on everything , let viewers know that the coup demonstrated the oftenstated kissinger position that placing confidence in any one individual in the soviet union is risky the true stars were the muscovites who guarded the russian parliament building through two rainy nights when mr yeltsin appeared before the republic s parliament yesterday , his tribute to these thousands only confirmed what viewers had seen for themselves by now most of the world has seen that in dangerous hours like these , the cameras are on the people s side even soldiers watch television none of the experts was promising a happy ending , but you do n't have to be a television nut to believe that having cameras around is not healthy for coups
from the shadows of city hall , the new york city council is emerging as the greatest beneficiary of a historic fight to make government more reflective of the city s underrepresented and often impoverished minorities on the verge of its greatest expansion and change , the council has challenged the mayor on some major initiatives , developed a staff of some competence in areas like municipal finance and even put a city commissioner under oath when he testified before it , all in a dogged effort to be taken seriously after more than a century as an ineffectual joke yet even as it amasses great powers under the new city charter , which took effect a year ago , the council is also becoming something unintended by many of those who fought to rework the city government a strong voice for middleclass values , in which different minorities with often competing priorities may have less of a voice than before different view on cuts with the jury still out , the council is in the spotlight on the most pressing civic question of the day what to do about new york s deepest fiscal problems since the crisis of the mid70 s and its leader , speaker peter f vallone , has vowed to challenge mayor david n dinkins s proposals to help close a 35 billion budget deficit with a 1 billion tax increase and cuts in a wide range of services invoking the values of middleclass new york , mr vallone and the council have called for reducing the tax increases by roughly half and looking harder at making cuts in some social services , while minimizing cuts in what they see as such basic services as schools , streetcleaning , parks and cultural programs that all new yorkers depend on because the council now has the sole power to approve the budget a power that former mayor edward i koch says , with some hyperbole , makes it stronger than the mayoralty itself the positions it takes could make a difference to millions of taxpayers , thousands of city workers facing layoffs and a giant population of poor people , which endured the sharpest cuts during the 1975 fiscal crisis the council is dominated by mr vallone , a regular democrat and parttime lawyer from the sidewalks of astoria , queens he has used his control of committee chairmanships , which carry extra pay , to reward loyalists and punish dissenters he has surrounded himself with a core of sophisticated aides making sixfigure salaries comparable to those of commissioners and top mayoral aides and he has more than doubled the council s budget and tripled the central staff directly under his control as a result of these bigshouldered political maneuvers , mr vallone has consolidated power in a 34member majority , including the six black and three hispanic members a battle over drawing new districts to increase the council to 51 seats from 35 in a special election this fall , as required by the charter , may change the proportion of minority members from one in four to perhaps one in three but , mr vallone s closest aides say , the council s political stance will probably not change at all , because its membership is likely to remain middle class the goal for the 90 s has to be a leaner more responsive efficient government that can still deliver the basic services as well as the services that make new york city unique , mr vallone said last winter in a speech outlining his vision of the city the reality is that we have an extremely small taxpayer base and we ca n't drive out those who pay the freight the question is how far the speaker , who has had a reputation for accommodation , will go in exerting the council s new powers to press this philosophy right now , most people in the city do n't know the council exists , mr vallone conceded it s going to take a long time to reeducate the public that we 're as good a body as they are , and that s pretty good his critics are less charitable i do n't think dinkins is going to have to have sleepless nights worrying about the council as a serious competitor unless the council works a lot harder than it does now , said gene russianoff , a lawyer with the new york public interest research group , a consumer and citizen advocacy group if they 're going to be coequal , they 're going to have to write more laws , ask tougher questions and show up at oversight hearings with more than a second s worth of thought at tops , a third of the council members are doing the job they were elected to do we know we talk to them stuck with early image of 'trained seals' from the creation of the modern city of five boroughs at the turn of the century , the council was overshadowed by the board of estimate , a hybrid of the mayor , comptroller , council president and borough presidents that controlled zoning and contracts and shared power on the budget the early council was derided as the 40 thieves for its corruption years later , mayor fiorello h laguardia dismissed its members as trained seals who took their orders from their county political bosses but in 1989 , the board of estimate was declared unconstitutional because each of the borough presidents had one vote while representing populations that varied widely in size the new charter abolished the board and gave the council broad new powers not only will it continue to approve local laws and hold hearings , it now has final say over the budget and can review all landuse decisions
in an effort to overturn a private reprimand against her last year , the new york city comptroller , elizabeth holtzman , is arguing that lawyers and especially prosecutors should have broad rights to criticize judges publicly a new york state appeals court concluded last year that ms holtzman violated the ethical standards of the legal profession when , as brooklyn district attorney , she accused a judge of humiliating a rape victim in the sealed ruling , which was never made public , the appeals court upheld a reprimand by a court disciplinary committee the committee found that ms holtzman spoke out against the judge in 1987 without troubling to find out if her accusation was accurate now the case , which has reached new york state s highest court , is evolving into a test of the closed system the courts use to discipline lawyers ms holtzman contends that she was correct when she set off a furor by charging that the judge made a rape victim reenact her assault court papers do not definitively resolve whether ms holtzman s charges were valid but even if the charges were inaccurate , her lawyers are arguing in the state court of appeals , disciplining a public official for criticizing a judge would violate the constitution by restricting free speech and suppressing debate about the court system details about the threeyear legal fight between disciplinary officials and ms holtzman emerged in ms holtzman s legal filings the legal papers are still sealed , but after a request they were given to the new york times by her lawyers the fact that ms holtzman had been reprimanded came to light last month when the court of appeals issued a terse ruling on a procedural point that order provided no details about the charges against her or the nature of the dispute the legal papers detail the charges lodged against ms holtzman by the court agency that polices lawyers' ethics they show that ms holtzman s appeal , which is expected to be heard this spring , is setting the stage for a landmark ruling about what restrictions are permissible on a prosecutor s comments about the courts and they show that ms holtzman has begun a broad attack on the fairness of lawyers' disciplinary proceedings , which are conducted in secret , asserting that they are onesided and loaded against the target of a complaint the papers provide new information about ms holtzman s charges against the brooklyn judge , irving w levine but they leave unanswered some of the questions that arose when the crosscurrents of criminal justice , women s rights and city politics turned what had been an unnoticed sexual misconduct trial into one of the most notorious cases in the city for a few weeks in 1987 most serious private sanction the discipline ms holtzman received , a reprimand , is the most serious private sanction available in the lawyergrievance process but it usually remains confidential and has few practical consequences more serious infractions bring public discipline , including disbarment ms holtzman s lawyers argued in court that the reprimand was a serious punishment and , the lawyers said , any discipline would be unlikely to remain private in the case of a public official ms holtzman is said to be considering running for the democratic nomination to challenge senator alfonse m d'amato in 1992 in its ruling last year , the legal papers show , the appellate division of state supreme court in brooklyn said ms holtzman violated ethics rules when she made public accusations without first determining the certainty of the merits of the accusation the grievance committee had charged that ms holtzman made false allegations the reprimand said ms holtzman s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and adversely reflects on your fitness to practice law three charges placed the legal papers show that the lawyers for the grievance committee lodged three charges against ms holtzman after a complaint by the state s chief administrative judge , albert m rosenblatt one charge , involving ms holtzman s release of a statement by the rape victim , was dismissed by the disciplinary committee another charge , involving statements she made in a press release , was dismissed by the appeals court the third charge , dealing with ms holtzman s release of a letter stating her assertions against judge levine , was approved by the court the disciplinary committee said ms holtzman made uninvestigated allegations against the judge it said she made her charges without interviewing the assistant district attorney on her own staff who handled the trial the committee said ms holtzman made no effort to reach anyone else who had been present and did not wait to review the stenographer s trial minutes the committee also noted that ms holtzman made her charges public against the advice of her three senior legal advisers , who had suggested that she wait to review the minutes ms holtzman testified at an unusual nineday closeddoor hearing in the case and offered her own interpretation of the events
for the first two months of the 1977 season , the yankees had eight pitchers on their staff then they added one and operated with nine until they called up two minor league pitchers in september in today s pitching world , that staff would be anachronistic today , teams carry as many as 12 pitchers and certainly no fewer than 10 , unlike the earlier years of the designated hitter when many american league teams had a nineman corps and sometimes eight rosters change from day to day but entering the weekend , the yankees , detroit and milwaukee each had 12 pitchers , 15 teams had 11 and the other 8 had 10 the increase in job opportunities for pitchers is a direct result of the decrease in talent among pitchers i carried nine quite a bit , especially the first five weeks or so , sparky anderson , the detroit manager , said , recalling times of greater talent that was usually enough some even carried eight but you have to have 10 or more nowadays you do n't have enough top guys who can give you the innings now it s gotten so that if you get six innings out of them that s a lot you do n't have enough clemenses and martinezes around we do n't have enough quality pitchers stump merrill , the yankees' manager , knows precisely what anderson means the way the game is today , the bullpen is dictated by the starting pitching , merrill said if you have five quality starters , your bullpen is n't going to get as much work the fifth and sixth relievers are going to be sitting around but the biggest need in baseball today is starting pitching we 've had some problems with our starting pitching from time to time where we had to go to the bullpen as good as the bullpen has been , if you continually go to them in the third or fourth inning , come august and september , you 're not going to have them we have 12 pitchers right now out of necessity i do n't think it s something we have to do for a prolonged period of time we have some questions as soon as they are answered , we 'll decide if we go with 12 or 11 the oakland athletics seem to make such decisions almost from series to series our attitude is we treat every series like it s the most important of the year , manager tony la russa said we do n't like to go into a series at a disadvantage you ca n't literally adjust your roster every series , but there are adjustments you can make every 10 days or two weeks situations change the athletics made todd burns their 11th pitcher friday night when they removed him from the disabled list , where he had been for two months they had dropped to 10 pitchers earlier last week when they sent john briscoe , a rookie , to the minors and brought up doug jennings , an outfielder we felt we could use the extra player because a couple guys were banged up , la russa explained but we wanted to go with 11 now because we have 10 games without an off day monday curt young is eligible to come off the list and will be put on the roster the question is do we stay with 11 or go to 12 the answer will come this weekend how many pitchers do we need to use \? if our starters give us innings , we 'll stay with 11 setting the trend the athletics were one of the first teams to use 12 pitchers , growing to that number last year there were some questions when we started this season with 12 , la russa said , but i see that some other clubs have 12 now the way la russa views the matter , the larger staff protects both the starters and the relievers , as well as the team generally suppose it s 104 and the bullpen is beat up , he said you leave the starter in longer and he might get hurt you want to use your relievers in a way that can keep them sharp and healthy let s say in today s game , you use three relievers tomorrow suppose you have a chance to win it would be a shame to lose the game because the relievers are unavailable or you push relievers into the game and risk hurting them if you have seven relievers , you can pitch three and still have four for tomorrow the key is how many innings the starters are giving you if they 're getting into the seventh and eighth , a sevenman bullpen is too many not every team has the athletics' luxury of having position players who never have to be removed for a pinchhitter i do n't have to hit for seven guys , la russa said i do n't need a bench where i have to be able to make four , five moves to win the game as if it were n't enough that starting pitchers get themselves knocked out of games , creating the need for more pitchers on a staff , some teams have pitch counts that determine when a starter should be removed , no matter how he s pitching all our pitchers are on pitch counts , lou piniella , the cincinnati manager , said the most any starter has thrown this year is 120 most of the time i would say 100 pitches is a pretty round number we do it to keep them healthy and keep them pitching piniella , who played for the yankees when they won with small staffs , noted that starters pitch fewer complete games now than they did in the 1970 s that s one reason clubs carry more pitchers , he said of course , one of the reasons for fewer complete games is that managers like piniella take starters out after so many pitches the reds , for example , have only two complete games in 59
washington , nov 6 in its 77 years , the new republic has been tagged with many labels , from stalinist to neoconservative now , the appointment of a 28yearold british editor , who describes his views as post ideological , and a renewed business partnership with its longtime conservative political adversary , the national review , are expected to reposition the feisty little journal of opinion once more this is a way of moving the magazine and making it more accessible to young people , said martin peretz , editor in chief and chairman , in explaining his selection of andrew sullivan as editor last month andrew is an immensely smart , lively and complicated person , mr peretz said he s catholic , working class , british , tory , gay and not at all doctrinal dressed in a blue denim shirt and jeans , mr sullivan looked younger than his age as he discussed his plans he said he was trying to put the weekly journal more in touch with the news and pointed proudly to the nov 18 issue with its cover , what october surprise \? noting that it came out three days before newsweek s october surprise cover mr sullivan wants to break down what he calls the berlin wall between the front of the magazine , which deals with current affairs , and the back , which deals with culture i want the front to be involved in serious discussion of pop culture , high culture and mass culture , he said mr sullivan brings a new perspective to the new republic those who know him say this gives him a real affinity with outsiders and none of the tendency to side with authority that is found in some conservatives mr sullivan s appointment comes as the new republic faces economic challenges as well as editorial ones like many other journals of opinion , the new republic depends considerably on the largesse of its owner to stay alive but the continuing move toward the center by the once liberal magazine has helped it with advertisers who have been reluctant to endorse a particular point of view still , like most other magazines , the new republic is confronted with the industrywide advertising recession so far this year , its advertising pages are down 137 percent , according to media industry newsletter , a trade publication in addition , the new republic s paid circulation is down 35 percent , to 94 , 000 with advertising making up only 25 percent of the magazine , we operate pretty close to break even and sometimes in profit , said jeffrey dearth , the magazine s president interest in a 'trendy' editor mr dearth said mr sullivan s appointment should help the magazine financially as well as editorially he said advertisers were becoming more interested in the magazine because andrew is seen as more 'trendy , ' and we expect to attract categories like fashion , highpriced consumer goods and records facing these advertising pressures , the new republic has renewed its joint venture with the national review to sell advertising the two magazines originally teamed up 15 years ago , and they eventually formed a sales operation that included nine small opinion magazines but last summer , the new republic and the national review pulled out of the group the sales venture with the national review was one of the moves made by mr peretz after he bought the new republic in 1974 more noticeable to most readers though , has been the magazine s drift toward the center , which left the nation as the leading liberal weekly the changes under mr sullivan s direction are already evident in its nov 11 issue , for instance , the magazine ran a long , detailed cover piece entitled the real face of rap , reporting that while rap music is still proportionally more popular among blacks , its primary audience is male , white and lives in the suburbs next week s scheduled cover article is a deeply affecting piece by john updike about the memoirs of his fellowwasp novelist , john cheever in another scheduled piece , camille paglia , the antifeminist author of sexual personae , will review the report on sexuality that the presbyterian church s general assembly rejected in june the report favored a new ethic for sexual activity based on the personal qualities of a relationship , regardless of the marital status or sex of a couple because esthetic considerations are as important to him as ideological ones , he is not going to run the magazine in a rigid or ideologically predictable manner , said hendrik hertzberg , mr sullivan s predecessor , who had been editor since september 1989 and before that from 981 to 1985 mr sullivan , who started as a summer intern at the new republic in 1986 , became editor after mr hertzberg stepped down to write a book on the constitution mr hertzberg is now a senior editor although mr sullivan was raised in britain , he said he was less daunted than he might be at the prospect of being editor of an american magazine a really american magazine , as he put it because he is such an american enthusiast england still drives me crazy the negative views , the snobbery , he said when i came to america , it suddenly seemed to me that there was much more oxygen in the air mr sullivan believes his catholicism and homosexuality will add a new perspective to the magazine i take my religious beliefs seriously they define a part of my life and truest convictions , he said i 'd like us to be the best magazine writing on religion in the country powerful and moving pieces in the last year , mr sullivan has written some powerful and moving pieces about gay men , including a cover story entitled gay life , gay death in the dec 17 , 1990 , issue about the increasing rift between gays who have tested hivpositive and those who are hivnegative his sleeping with the enemy column in the sept 9 issue was a scathing denunciation of outing , the naming of suspected homosexuals who have not publicly acknowledged their sexual orientation i think we have never dealt candidly with gay issues in the past , and now i think we are way ahead of the curve of mainstream magazines , mr sullivan said on the whole , he said he hoped to make the magazine as lively , as mixed and as brave as possible i still feel i have to prove a lot , he said i'm kind of a gutsy choice and when you are that , complacency is not the first thing that grips the mind photo andrew sullivan , the new editor of the new republic , wants to put the opinion magazine more in touch with the news and cultural trends \( jose r lopez the new york times \)

pete incaviglia , a powerhitting texas outfielder who put up some big numbers in a couple of categories too many , was cut by the rangers yesterday to make room for a rotation of lighterhitting replacements expected to be more efficient on offense and certainly more costeffective the 26yearold incaviglia , who had 24 home runs and 85 runs batted in last season , also had 146 strikeouts , giving him a whifftowham ratio of 6083 , a bit higher than the rangers were prepared to accept , especially from a player who would have cost them 17 million this season by cutting him before next tuesday , the rangers will not have to pay his full salary , but only 45 days of termination pay , or 414 , 148 and they will not have to pay that if he is claimed by another team by wednesday although the rangers said incaviglia s high salary was not a factor in what was called a baseball decision , none of the three players who are expected to take turns filling his spot in left field are in incaviglia s pay grade they are jack daugherty , who hit 300 with 6 home runs and 47 rbi in 125 games filling in at first base and elsewhere last season kevin reimer , who hit 260 with 2 homers in 60 games after being called up from oklahoma city , and brian downing , the veteran acquired as a free agent on thursday who had 14 home runs last year with the california angels incaviglia , who was hitting 231 in spring training with 1 home run and 1 rbi , seemed stunned by the decision to let him go after five years and 124 home runs with the rangers \( ap \) photo pete incaviglia \( associated press \)
hartford , april 3 the state senate voted overwhelmingly today to rescind connecticut s antiadultery criminal statutes , but lawmakers were careful to tread a fine line sex outside the bonds of marriage is still morally offensive , many stressed , but in the waning days of the 20th century it should not be an offense that could land one in jail i guess i'm from the other century , said senator thomas f upson , a republican from waterbury who cast one of only four votes against the bill in the 36member chamber under the bill , which was approved by the house of representatives over the objections of the roman catholic church , adultery would remain on the books as an element of civil law , and evidence of adultery could still be used in deciding alimony and child custody issues it would simply no longer be a crime punishable by a 1 , 000 fine and a year in jail the proposal , which was approved 31 to 4 in the senate , now goes to the desk of gov lowell p weicker jr , who has indicated at least tentative approval his press secretary , avice a meehan , said that barring any undue complications or questions , the governor would in all likelihood sign it capital crime in colonial days connecticut , where adultery was a capital crime in colonial days , is one of about a dozen states , including new york , that still list adultery as a jailable infraction , although the statutes are hardly ever brought to bear last year , however , the first cases in connecticut in decades began to crop up , mainly involving vindictive spouses , according to the cochairman of the general assembly s judiciary committee , representative richard d tulisano , a democrat from rocky hill who spoke on the bill s behalf in the house last month none of those cases resulted in trials or sentences because the local prosecutors declined to to accept them some of the lawmakers who endorsed the decriminalization measure said that while such prosecutorial discretion may be enough to make the existing law moot anyway , it should still be deleted because relations within a marriage are no longer the business of the state i do n't believe it s our affair , said representative andrew m norton , a republican from colchester , where one of four adultery cases in connecticut arose last year the senate bill approved today continues a gradual trend of moderation in punishing adulterers over the centuries in ancient india , the noses of adulterers were cut off in old testament times , death was considered the appropriate penalty connecticut s law in the 1700 s called for both participants to be whipped about the naked body and branded with a hot iron on the forehead with the letter a senator upson said the moral message should still remain on the books , whether used in the courts or not there should be some guidelines for society , and certainly adultery is one of them , he said

washington , oct 2 seeking to lower the cost and quicken the pace of cleaning up the nation s abandoned hazardous waste dumps , the environmental protection agency said today that it would replace companies that have performed ineffectively andwould establish an office to monitor contractors more closely william k reilly , the federal agency s administrator , said the steps were intended to improve the management of the superfund program , a government and industryfinanced effort begun in 1980 to respond to poisons leaking from abandoned chemical waste sites across the country the program has spent more than 48 billion in government money and corporations have committed 4 billion more , but only 63 sites have been cleaned up out of the 1 , 245 sites identified by the government as the worst on average , cleanup projects take 7 to 10 years to complete at a cost of more than 25 million but projects taking much longer and costing hundreds of millions of dollars also are not uncommon , the environmental agency said today critics say the superfund program , initially envisioned as a vital public works project to protect health and safety , has instead become a wasteful program that primarily benefits the few companies that gain cleanup contracts for their part , corporations that have received contracts to clean up hazardous waste sites say the program s intricate rules and cumbersome bureaucracy have made the task much too expensive and communities around the sites say that even after a location is designated as a superfund project work often does not begin until years later mr reilly said today that some of the blame for the program s poor performance lies with the difficulty of cleaning up toxic poisons , and he added that the government had underestimated the task when the superfund program was established the task was further complicated by the difficulties of building from scratch a new national industry to do the work but mr reilly also acknowledged that after 10 years of operating the program most of its basic problems now are due to the government s faulty management of contractors epa investigators this summer reported that a group of 23 companies hired in 1988 and 1989 to complete the early stages of hazardous waste cleanups around the country spent 28 percent of their 265 million budgets on wasteful administrative costs mr reilly said that none of the expenditures were illegal , but that many were inappropriate office plants and parties for example , one contractor spent 150 a month for the rental and care of office plants and charged it to the government another , the agency said , used government money to pay for christmas parties , one of which cost 1 , 600 mr reilly said the agency was considering releasing two of its contractors and has set a goal of reducing outlays for administrative expenditures to less than 20 percent of the contract s value we did n't find any goldplated toilets and 1 , 000 screwdrivers , mr reilly said but potted plants and christmas parties are expenses that do n't belong in the program and we 'll do everything we can to get them out mr reilly today named richard guimond , a 43yearold engineer and 20year veteran of the epa , as the director of a new office to oversee the superfund mr guimond is to be assisted by 20 people , who will audit and oversee cleanup contractors a report in july by the house energy and commerce subcomittee on oversight and investigations found that the epa had done a poor job in auditing its superfund contractors companies are paid on the basis of the number of work hours reported , and companies file bills for thousands of hours each year but the subcommittee said the companies routinely changed time sheets filled out by workers without offering explanations the subcommittee said the epa rarely asked questions about the changes or asked the companies to justify the charges the subcommittee concluded that tens of millions of dollars may have gone to pay other than cleanup costs because of the loose controls
las vegas , nev mike tyson is 25 years old today , prime time for a fighter , but he seems stalled in some twilight age he is n't getting better , or prettier , or , most important , scarier otherwise , happy birthday , mike tyson s 12round decision over razor ruddock on friday night was hardly vintage tyson he has forgotten how to bob and weave , how to fight defensively out of a peekaboo he rarely throws combinations of punches in those deadly flurries that drove opponents stumbling into the ropes there were no big knockdown punches but none of this was supposed to matter the consensus here , especially among the regular boxing press , was that tyson would knock out ruddock within the first three or four rounds between ruddock s alleged lack of heart and tyson s sense of menace , there would be plenty of time for other pleasures of the flesh tyson s game has always been the promise of pain he would hurt you so badly , breathtaking blows to the body , hammering head shots , that sooner rather than later you might want to consider falling down and playing out more than they are willing to admit , boxers knock themselves out they do down because they are tired or hurt or scared of being hurt they are overwhelmed by the will of an opponent more determined than they are and , of course , tyson , perhaps more than the others , so elemental in his style , his dress , his persona , climbed into the ring already ahead on psychic points until buster douglas knocked him out in tokyo early in 1990 and took his heavyweight title he was suddenly just a snarling parody of himself , a trashtalking street guy whose marital , vehicular and paternity misadventures were signs of a personal unraveling three months ago , in the first draft of friday night s fight , he was beating ruddock when the referee stopped the bout in the seventh round to prevent further unnecessary damage it may have been an overcautious decision , but hardly unwise or questionable nevertheless , the deconstruction of tyson had come so far that the news media darkly questioned the referee s honesty , and traced his links to the owner of the mirage hotel , site of both fights , and to tyson s promoter , don king in any case , it made possible the rematch , apparently a payperview bonanza , hyped by tyson s psycho pup routines in which he called ruddock a transvestite boxing is not nice , and a generation brought up on muhammad ali needs reeducation the first two rounds were tyson s his jab was breaking through , he worked his way inside ruddock s longer reach , he delivered several thundering body shots and several solid head shots there were blows below the belt , punching after the bell in the second round , a glancing right high on ruddock s left cheek a flash knockdown tyson would later call it put ruddock briefly on the canvas the crowd got hot soon now , the fans hoped , tyson would bring them to their feet , screaming , the blood rising and pounding in rhythm to blows that would shiver ruddock s liver , that would rock his brain against the sides of his skull but ruddock did n't get the message he came back to win the third round , to use his superior reach to keep tyson at bay and to deliver several good shots to tyson s head ruddock became less tentative he seemed to gather strength even in the fourth round , when a straight right dumped him , when his mouthpiece went flying after the punch that may have broken his jaw , ruddock never seemed intimidated by tyson in the later rounds , when the crowd realized that tyson was not going to drive ruddock into the ground , it began chanting , razor , razor ruddock , his face swelling , never quit , but he did n't fight furiously enough to contend seriously he would frequently stop to admire his handiwork , giving tyson time to recover but it was n't the fearsome tyson who slashed through the heavyweight division he is throwing punches one at a time now , and they were n't knockout punches in the weeks to come , this fight will be variously reinterpreted as the struggle for heavyweight boxing and for payperview heats up evander holyfield is the champion , but tyson is the drawing card , and rival promotional groups are fighting even harder than their fighters , and with less grace yesterday , king called holyfield s people eunuchs , while tyson , his psycho pup animus long gone , praised ruddock , and dismissed his own ghetto rap as part of the psych job i kind of like him , he said happy birthday , mike photo ruddock and tyson \( reuters \)

the antiapartheid sanctions imposed by congress in 1986 have fostered change in south africa what made them credible was washington s ability to speak with a bipartisan voice yet a big foreign policy success is now threatened by domestic politics as president bush and the democratic congress square off for a needless row on when to lift the sanctions mr bush impatiently hints that pretoria has fulfilled all but one of five conditions for ending sanctions , which is debatable prodded by a black caucus deeply suspicious of white house racial politics , democratic leaders claim that south africa has barely met a single condition , which is more debatable that change has occurred in south africa is not in dispute whether reforms meet us legislative tests is open to argument if mr bush hastily lifts sanctions , with congress in recess , the us will lose credibility and leverage at a critical moment in south africa if democrats resist acknowledging compliance , it will be just as damaging the responsible solution is to review the law and fairly stipulate which conditions must still be satisfied releasing all political prisoners though nelson mandela and many other prisoners have been released , hundreds remain in jail pretoria asserts that it will release all genuine political prisoners , and that none are now being detained without trial this surely can be independently verified ending the state of emergency the emergency laws have been repealed , and pretoria s critics concede minimal compliance unbanning political parties change has been substantial but incomplete previously illegal parties now operate freely , and debate is unfettered but some leaders are still in exile , and negotiations for their return are still under way it would be stretching the language of the law , however , to insist as some democrats do that blacks must be enfranchised before sanctions are lifted repealing apartheid laws with the repeal of the population registration act and the group areas act , the main legal pillars of apartheid have fallen critics assert that 59 other laws are still on the books , and that repeal has left untouched the evils of segregation but these charges are in factual dispute , and an itembyitem reckoning is needed opening a negotiation track the law stipulates that pretoria must agree to enter good faith negotiations with truly representative members of the black majority without preconditions by any fair reading , this condition has been met for mr bush to lift sanctions before reasonable doubts are resolved would be as indefensible as stretching the law s language to prolong sanctions america s good faith and south africa s struggle for a new democratic order would both suffer if this debate soured into a partisan brawl
johannesburg , aug 26 previewing its negotiating stance on south africa s future , the governing national party has drafted the outlines of a new constitution that would replace the existing presidency held by f w de klerk with an executive council of three to five members and would mandate elections held on the basis of one person , one vote the plan offers the most detailed look yet at what the government is likely to put on the table at a conference of political parties expected later this year some points have been mentioned previously others , like the proposed elimination of the presidency , are a surprise the plan , which was leaked to and sketchily summarized in rapport , an afrikaanslanguage sunday paper with close ties to the party , also called for a cabinet to be drawn from all political parties with sufficient support , a new twochamber parliament elected by proportional representation on the basis of universal suffrage it also envisions the creation of a federal system passing power down to nine regional governments developed by the leadership of the political party that perpetuated white minority domination for the last 43 years , the plan will be viewed as the party s opening bid in constitutional talks that mr de klerk wants to hold with representatives of the country s still disenfranchised black majority as leaked in the newspaper , the national party s proposals converge with the african national congress s constitutional guidelines on several key points while differing on others but they suggest that the party has given up its original hope of building overt guarantees for the white minority into a new constitution stoffel van der merwe , who resigned from president de klerk s cabinet and from parliament to run the national party as its new secretary general , said today the plan published by rapport was not the final version but he tacitly confirmed its authenticity reaction to proposals the national party is scheduled to present its guidelines at a special congress in bloemfontein next wednesday but the preliminary disclosures have already elicited blunt outrage from the rightwing conservative party and skeptical approval from the african national congress andries p treurnicht , the conservative party leader , called the national party s plan totally unacceptable to whites gill marcus , a spokeswoman for the african national congress , said the congress was studying the plan and would comment formally after it had been discussed by the leadership but the south african press association quoted a constitutional expert for the congress as saying the national party s plan was acceptable for an interim government but too farfetched to offer a permanent solution the congress has been pressing the government to resign in favor of an interim government , which would then convene the constitutinal talks under its authority but finance minister barend du plessis told a provincial congress of the national party in natal that the government did not intend to hand over power to any transitional body zach de beer , the leader of the liberal democratic party , said except for the executive council , the plan as disclosed coincided with his party s position but dr de beer said the country needed to be run by an executive president in its article sunday , rapport said the proposals resulted from studies by research organizations working within the national party over the last 18 months under the leaked blueprint , the current parliament , which consists of one chamber for whites , two smaller ones for south africans of mixedrace and indian origin with none for blacks , would be replaced by two houses of parliament the seats in one chamber would be allocated to political parties according to the number of votes they received nationwide , rather than by constituency the other chamber would be elected from the regions and would have the power to pass on legislation enacted by the first house the constitution principles proposed by the african national congress also envisage two houses of parliament , with the second chamber organized on regional lines the national party s plan would replace south africa s four provinces with nine administrative regions under a federal system this is at odds with the african national congress s view that south africa should remain a unitary state with a strong national government the national party and the african national congress agree that there should be a bill of rights and an independent judicial system enshrined in a new constitution another national party proposal would create single municipal councils with redrawn boundaries that apparently would encompass white towns and their satellite black townships currently , two segregated municipal councils exist , with black communities left outside the tax base of white ones
with the onset of the mozart year , polygram classics has favored us with not one but three new mozart operas each has its merits none displaces beloved past recordings two are conducted by neville marriner with his academy of st martininthefields and the ambrosian opera chorus die zauberflote \( philips 426 276 two cd s , three lp s and cassettes \) and cosi fan tutte \( philips 422 381 three cd s and cassettes \) mr marriner , who has already recorded le nozze di figaro for philips , is a mozartean of glassy elegance he prefers a playing style born of the 1950 s baroque revival but softened and warmed by traditional virtues , comparable to the viennese mozart manner that emerged after world war ii under herbert von karajan the playing is often genuinely beautiful , but especially in die zauberflote , with its protowagnerian masonic profundities , it seems to skate on the surface the singers , as in most modern opera recordings , are good and not so good , courting comparisons with the past francisco araiza , common to both casts , sounds hardworking but grainy and unmellifluous as tamino and ferrando in die zauberflote , the most striking performance is cheryl studer s queen of the night , solid in the coloratura and thrilling in the dramatic recitatives olaf baer makes a winning , refreshingly unviennese papageno , samuel ramey is lyrically appealing but not a true low bass as sarastro , and jose van dam is an authoritative speaker as pamina , kiri te kanawa sounds thickvoiced and mature but in cosi , karita mattila is even less successful as fiordiligi she has the sort of voice , warm but ungainly , that can make a sympathetic impression in a live performance but translates awkwardly to the recording medium , where flaws are enshrined for the ages apart from mr ariaza , the other cosi singers \( anne sofie von otter , elzbieta szmytka , thomas allen and mr van dam \) are effective and charming but this set fails to displace karajan s elisabeth schwarzkopf version for angel or james levine s recording on deutsche grammophon , just as the zauberflote pales before the rca levine and the teldec nikolaus harnoncourt versions the third new album is a don giovanni by arnold ostman and his drottningholm court theater orchestra and chorus from stockholm \( l'oiseaulyre 425 943 three cd s and cassettes \) as usual in his opera recordings , this set boasts a starrier cast than one normally encounters at drottningholm hakan hagegard in the title role , with arleen auger , della jones , nico van der meel , gilles cachemaille , barbara bonney and others mr ostman s mozart opera recordings have varied in quality the singers do not always conform to his periodpractice pretensions , and his tempos are often rushed and driven this set is rather pale vocally despite some solid work \( notably from mr hagegard and ms bonney \) , and the overall performance is mincing and eccentric mr ostman plays the complete early prague version on the first two cd s , with material composed later for vienna on the third disk thus , much familiar music \( ottavio s dalla sua pace , elvira s mi tradi \) is banished to an appendix better to stick with the old otto klemperer version on angel \( due for cd release in may \) or the harnoncourt recording with thomas hampson on teldec photo neville marrinera style born of the 1950 s baroque revival but softened and warmed \( minnesota orchestra \)
gainesville , fla , april 25 eight months after five college students were found slain here in a span of 40 hours , lawenforcement officials say they are sure they have found the killer but they will not say , at least publicly , who he is nor are all of the investigators convinced that he acted alone , the officials say and they acknowledge that it might be months before anyone is charged the authorities say the delay is a product not of their doubts but of their patience in pursuing all the leads the case has generated rather than answering basic questions about the killings , they say , the continuing inquiry is largely aimed at making sure that no new ones arise but they also acknowledge some discomfort at criticism over the failure of what appeared to be early breaks in the case to led anywhere a polite suspect the officials say the main suspect in the killings is a polite , cleancut 36yearold louisiana police officer s son named danny h rolling he sits about 30 miles from gainesville in a drab jail of neighboring marion county , having pleaded guilty last september to holding up an ocala supermarket because mr rolling has compiled a criminal record that includes felony convictions in two other states , he could be sentenced to life in prison for the ocala robbery without ever being tried on the handful of robberies , burglaries and car thefts with which he has been charged around northern florida another man , edward l humphrey , was frequently identified in news accounts last fall as the main suspect but mr humphrey , an emotionally disturbed university of florida freshman , has faded from the headlines , and this has left many people skeptical of the claims being made by the lawenforcement authorities about mr rolling still , the officials insist that mr humphrey has not been ruled out from prosecution in this case he , too , remains jailed on an assault charge that is not related to the gainesville killings given all that , some 60 city , state and county detectives quartered in gainesville feel no pressure to rush to complete their investigation , officials say after spending close to 3 million on the inquiry and running down nearly 5 , 000 of the 6 , 500 leads it has generated , it was less a revelation than a formality when a prosecutor was named april 22 to begin preparing the case for trial by then , the authorities had already been saying for months that genetic tests and other physical evidence had linked mr rolling to the crime scenes what has been less successfully resolved is the trauma in this bucolic college town , which was terrorized so thoroughly by the killings that about 500 of the 34 , 000 students simply quit their studies and went home back to normal on the surface , life in gainesville has largely returned to normal as students at the university of florida prepare for their final examinations , women can be seen walking home alone at night , joggers can be spotted at the crack of dawn and parties echo from fraternity houses and offcampus apartments guns and chemical mace are no longer the hottestselling items in town student enrollment is back up to normal and new tenants are about to move into the groundfloor apartment where the first two bodies were found on the afternoon of aug 26 but there are signs , though subtle , of lasting change the note boards of roommates who now keep each other informed of their whereabouts , the greater sadness that some students feel when they read about tragedies far away , the stark panel of five names that remains untouched on a wall of graffiti that students have traditionally redecorated almost daily jackeline siles , a 25yearold agronomy student from costa rica who lives in an apartment near those where the slayings took place , now has trouble sleeping it was that sensation of all of a sudden thinking , 'it could be me' kimberly woods , 19 , a sophomore who lived in the apartment complex where the first bodies were found , dropped out in the fall semester and went home to jacksonville it s almost like people have forgotten , she said , but she added that most of her girlfriends still carried mace in their backpacks and that she always looked in the back seat of her car before getting in to drive home from work the chief of police , wayland r clifton jr , suggested that even before the killings , the city s crime rate somewhat belied its pastoral appearance a magnet for convicts the laidback atmosphere has been something of a magnet for convicts released from the 15 prisons within 50 miles , chief clifton said , including prisons that house 60 percent of the state s violent criminals in 1982 , gainesville reported the highest rate of rape in the country , and a spokeswoman for the police said gainesville s serious crime rate was about double the national average for a city its size in the flurry of news reports this year that have tied mr rolling to the killings , none have offered an explanation for why he

washington , may 9 after winning passage by a big margin in the house of representatives on wednesday , the bill to establish a national sevenday waiting period for a handgun purchase could face a much tougher test in the senate , supporters and opponents of gun control said today in the senate , where the voting power of delegations from rural states likely to oppose gun control carries the same weight as that of states with violenceplagued urban areas , the outcome of the measure will rely more heavily on the fate of morecomprehensive anticrime legislation the chairman of the senate judiciary committee , joseph r biden jr , democrat of delaware , said today that the committee was likely to attach the waitingperiod bill to one of two broader measures proposed by senate democrats or to the anticrime legislation being pushed by the white house the waitingperiod legislation , called the brady bill for james s brady , the presidential press secretary left disabled by the assassination attempt on ronald reagan in 1981 , faces an uphill fight over here , mr biden said but i'm optimistic , because i think the momentum created by the phenomenally wide coverage this has gotten and the margin by which it won will help as the measure moves toward a senate showdown that will probably occur in june or july , complications have already cropped up president bush , mr biden and the senate majority leader , george j mitchell of maine , are all seeking comprehensive approaches to address violent crime , and none quite agrees with the others we 're trying our best to accommodate everyone , said gail hoffman , the chief lobbyist for handgun control inc but wayne lapierre , the president of the national rifle association , which opposes the brady bill , said a complicated senate compromise could sink of its own weight the white house anticrime bill , which is scheduled for its final hearing before the senate judiciary committee next week , would stiffen criminal penalties and ease restrictions on the use of illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials the administration has said mr bush will veto any gun control measure that is not part of his anticrime package
to the editor a few years ago , the legions of families living doubled up with relatives in tiny apartments were referred to as the hidden homeless now , it seems , we should consider such families adequately housed even if they are , like the ones in your sept 4 frontpage article , living nine to a room or two , not counting infants although technically these people have roofs over their heads , their situations are precarious their relatives' patience will wear thin , and they will have to move on in most cases , a relative s apartment is a last stop before the shelter system none of these families , i suspect , has any hope of scraping together the 2 , 000 or 3 , 000 needed to lease a new york apartment on the open market i am hardly surprised that people in this situation are taking advantage of the human resources administration s more humane policies and entering the system before they get booted onto the street what surprises me is the contention that they are somehow abusing the system the continuing flood of homeless families is evidence of new york city s shameful dearth of reasonably priced housing it has nothing to do with the honesty of the families themselves susan carleton mount kisco , ny , sept 6 , 1991
crowded house beacon theater countless pop groups have devised their own refinements of the beatles' harmonic blend over the last 20 years , but none have elaborated that style more engagingly than crowded house , which appeared at the beacon theater on oct 2 the quartet , whose members come from australia and new zealand , is led by the brothers neil and tim finn , both of whom used to belong to split enz , an artpop band that was popular almost everywhere except in the united states when split enz broke up , neil finn formed the more straightforward and tuneful crowded house , while his older brother began a solo career crowded house s third album , woodface , finds the finn brothers back together as band mates and collaborators on songs that alternate between being boyishly romantic and bouncingly cheeky and on wednesday the group performed material from all three crowded house albums with a precision and unforced playfulness that one rarely encounters at a pop concert the group s best songs are sweetly cheery numbers whose rich , fluent harmonies take off from the style of beatles ballads like baby s in black and i 'll be back sometimes , as in four seasons in one day , the material slyly alludes to a beatles song \( a day in the life \) other songs , like whispers and moans and all i ask , carry chromatic pop harmony to a level one step more sophisticated than the beatles more modernist numbers like chocolate cake , a pop art snapshot of american mass culture , find the group cautiously forging its own style of pop zaniness it is all underscored with throbbing electric keyboards laced with light rock guitar and propelled by the impeccably snappy drumming of paul hester the main obstacle to mass american popularity for crowded house is pop fashion the group s sweetness and wit are simply too airy for a pop climate absorbed in darkness and aggression
jerome robbins s other dances , a pas de deux to chopin s piano music choreographed in 1976 , was visibly a vehicle for mikhail baryshnikov and natalia makarova mr robbins made explicit use of the stylish classicism and powerful projection that characterized these former stars of the kirov ballet at the same time the choreography s folk touches , albeit more polish than russian , made a fanciful slavic connection between two exemplars of russian ballet training and poland s most cherished composer yet over the years the same duet has been performed by a variety of casts in a variety of ways in both american ballet theater and the new york city ballet with the possible exception of gelsey kirkland , however , none dared infuse the ballet s performances with the same unabashed high mannerisms provided by mr baryshnikov and miss makarova none , that is , until monday night at the metropolitan opera house , when julio bocca and alessandra ferri of ballet theater were seen for the first time locally in other dances the wonder of this performance was brilliance of nerve , its very peculiarity mr bocca and miss ferri virtually reinvented the choreography , twisting or tilting their bodies into new shapes their playful experiments with rhythmic phrasing had some liabilities mr bocca forced his effects and lost mr robbins s major punchline when the cavalier pretends he is dizzy , mr bocca had his back to the audience miss ferri s sudden snaps into position worked against her solos' implied reveries not to worry mr robbins himself is at his most affected in other dances and invites exaggeration moreover , miss ferri s lowslung dips into ballet s fourth position characterized an interpretation predicated on the extreme , while mr bocca , stressing his own accents , met her on the same dramatic ground one never knew what they would do next , and a duet that can sometimes be bland was always alive paul connelly was the fine pianist the evening , which also featured christina fagundes in a promising but cautious debut as the second ballerina in balanchine s ballet imperial , was dedicated to eugenia doll mrs doll , who died in december , underwrote other dances she reportedly did the same for ballet theater s current production of leonide massine s gaite parisienne , which closed the program

of all the odd couples created by neil simon in his 30year career in the theater , none has been less funny or more passionately acted than the battling mother and daughter indelibly embodied by irene worth and mercedes ruehl in lost in yonkers , the writer s new memory piece at the richard rodgers theater ms worth , her usual elegance obliterated by a silver bun of steelwool hair , rimless spectacles and a limping stride , is an elderly widow known only as grandma kurnitz a childhood immigrant from germany to the united states , she has devoted her adulthood to the yonkers candy store over which she makes her home bella , played by ms ruehl , is the 35yearold child who never moved out and has paid with her life a gawky woman with an eager smile and a confused , bubbly manner , bella is , as one line has it , closed for repairs her mind is n't quite right , her existence is bounded by the soda counter , and her development is arrested in early adolescence there s some humor in this , but , as one character remarks of ms worth s grandma , i never said she was a lot of laughs one does n't have to be of german jewish descent to recognize this icecold woman who yanks her face away from anyone who tries to plant a kiss on it and who belittles any relative who attempts to puncture her scowling reserve she is terrifying , and not primarily because she wields a mean cane as acted with matchless precision by ms worth , grandma is a nearly silent killer whose steely monstrousness can be found in the emotions she withholds rather than in whatever faint feelings she might grudgingly express as nature dictates , bella is her opposite , and ms ruehl imbues her with a vulnerability as electric in its way as the comic ferocity she so memorably brought to the role of a hellbent mafia wife in jonathan demme s film married to the mob all elbows and knees , ms ruehl seems to jitterbug constantly about the parlor , thirsting for any experience or human contact , however small and humdrum , that might come her way before her mother snuffs it out grandma and bella are on a collision course , and when the blowout arrives , it not only brings lost in yonkers to a wrenching catharsis , but it also wipes out much of the nostalgically sentimental family portrait that mr simon presented to broadway audiences in his autobiographical trilogy of the 1980 s whatever the virtues of the author s brighton beach plays , they always seemed a little too roseate to be true the relatives on stage were guilty of pecadilloes and frailties , never major crimes that s not the case here , where the only lines referring to the family as a safe haven are bitterly ironic grandma has a crushed foot from her berlin childhood and she is out to get revenge on the world by crushing anyone or anything in her path while mr simon s autobiographical cycle officially ended with broadway bound , it is in lost in yonkers that he seems at last to be baring the most fundamental scar of all , that of a child rejected by a parent i do n't see how anyone can fail to be moved by the sight of ms ruehl , the lonely repository of this grief , when she stands center stage in act ii of lost in yonkers , crying and begging for the intimacy , physical and otherwise , she has always been so cruelly denied if this play kept its focus on bella and grandma throughout , one might even be able to mention it in the same paragraph , if not necessarily the same breath , as the glass menagerie , the effect of gamma rays on maninthemoon marigolds and gypsy , among other american classics about lethal mothers and oppressed daughters but mr simon , whether by sloppiness or design , falls considerably short of this hallowed territory if he is no longer camouflaging human brutality , he is still packaging it within a lot of fluff , and not always his best fluff at that while the gripping grandmabella drama is never quite lost in lost in yonkers , it is too frequently crowded out by domestic comedy of a most ordinary sort as it happens , the dramatic axis of this play is not usually bella but grandma s teenage grandchildren , a pair of hollywoodwise boys who share virtually all traits except their names with the brothers in the brighton beach plays they are reluctantly dumped at grandma s for a period of months by their father , bella s widowed and broken brother \( a vivid mark blum \) , who must take to the road as a salesman to pay off his late wife s hospital bills the boys are well enough played by youngsters \( jamie marsh and danny gerard \) whose only sin is that they are not matthew broderick , but their characters often are as secondary as the pigeon sisters in the odd couple the brothers usually seem like wisecracking observers of the play rather than fully realized , fully engaged participants in it for all their stage time , and all the talk about how much they may or may not be damaged by their own extended exposure to grandma , their actual conflicts with her are bitesized sitcom anecdotes , unsullied by the complexities of puberty or much visible fallout from the loss of their mother
with the fate of the proposal hanging in the balance , mayor david n dinkins yesterday said that he favored schools chancellor joseph a fernandez s plan for making condoms available on request to high school students , even without parental consent the mayor s statement came as the sevenmember board of education prepared to vote tomorrow on the chancellor s condom plan , one of the most controversial issues it has tackled in many years and one that has drawn national attention with the board apparently split on the issue , mr dinkins s statement was expected to put pressure on the board member considered to be the swing vote on the plan , dr westina l matthews , an appointee of the mayor but late yesterday , mr dinkins s educational adviser , lee blake , said that a number of board members were trying to negotiate a compromise that may include a provision for permitting reluctant parents to exclude their children from any school condom program not only dr matthews , but two other members who oppose the current plan , carol a gresser of queens and michael j petrides of staten island , have indicated that such a compromise would make it more likely that they would support the plan willingness on amendment officials in the chancellor s office , which welcomed the mayor s statement , have indicated that mr fernandez would be willing to accept an amendment to his plan that would allow parents to bar their children ninfa segarra , the board s representative from the bronx and a supporter of the chancellor s plan , confirmed that backstage maneuvers toward a compromise were under way she said they were an effort to avoid either a defeat of the plan or its approval by a majority so narrow that the plan might not get the cooperation of the system s teachers and parents although six of the board s seven mem bers have said at various points in the oftenpassionate debate that they would be in favor in principle of some kind of condom availability , the outcome of the vote has been unpredictable because three of those supporters , including dr matthews , have urged that the plan include a provision that would allow parents to opt out by writing notes barring their children mr fernandez has refused to amend his plan in this manner , and yesterday morning , three board members said that they would vote against it and dr matthews , said she was still thinking and talking to a lot of people with three other board members strongly supporting the plan , dr matthews s vote is expected to determine whether the vote is 4 to 3 for the plan or 4 to 3 against officials in the chancellor s office complained yesterday morning that the mayor , who had on earlier occasions expressed general support for the principle of condom availability , had issued no statement on mr fernandez s plan a few hours later , the mayor told reporters , i would favor the plan as presented i recognize the concerns that some have that there be parental consent required , he said i'm also mindful that many of us , including me , have the point of view that that does n't necessarily take care of things there are many parents that never sign a report card , so to speak so i would favor the plan as presented while he opposed a requirement that students get parental permission before receiving condoms , mr dinkins did not state his position about one that would allow parents to exclude children , if they wished asked later what the mayor felt about an optout provision , a spokesman , jennifer kimball , replied , the mayor would like to see the plan go through as is in his remarks , mr dinkins said he spoke to dr matthews and concluded she does not oppose chancellor fernandez s plan , but rather has a fashion in which she would like to see it modified dr matthews , he said , was free to exercise her own judgment then , late yesterday , ms blake , the mayor s director of educational services , called reporters to tell them that ms segarra had joined with mr petrides to try to fashion a compromise that could win a broader board majority the lack of an optout provision as the chief reason cited by ms gresser in saying for the first time yesterday that she would vote against the plan as written mr petrides said he too would vote against the plan unless it gave parents the right to exclude their children from receiving condoms the plan s staunchest foe is dr irene h impellizzeri , the board s representative from brooklyn strongly favoring the plan , along with ms segarra , are dr gwendolyn c baker , the board s president and another mayoral appointee , and dr luis o reyes , the representative from manhattan the resolution that the board will consider mentions none of the reservations of mr petrides , ms gresser and dr matthews , and simply authorizes the chancellor to make condoms available in high schools the resolution would effectively give the chancellor the green light to enact a plan that would make condoms available on request with neither parental consent nor counseling required some members are annoyed that mr fernandez has put them in a difficult position by asking for a strict yes or no vote rather than incorporating their concerns in more of a consensus resolution that five or six of the members could support in unusually blunt criticism of a chancellor , mr petrides said mr fernandez was to some extent arrogant and may be irresponsible the board s potential 4to3 alignment is reflective of how this city is divided over the issue , he said
with the recent appointments of leo miles as the supervisor of officials and harold henderson to the job of chief labor negotiator , paul tagliabue has shown a commitment to hiring members of minority groups for highlevel management positions in the league office but few of the national football league teams are following tagliabue s lead on the club level shortly after tagliabue took over as the nfl commissioner , he made his first minority appointment in may 1990 he hired dr lawrence brown jr , an instructor for clinical medicine at columbia university college of physicians and surgeons , as one of the league s two advisers on drug abuse the recent appointments of miles , who was the athletic director at howard university for 14 years and an nfl official for 22 seasons , and henderson , former chief legal counsel and a labor negotiator for amtrak , to the league hierarchy implies that tagliabue has gone after qualified members of minority groups for those positions encouraging signs it s commendable that the commissioner has the interest and the initiative to followup on what he says , said henderson , who is the highestranking black in the nfl he has made a very special effort to find qualified minorities for key positions , not just for entrylevel positions , he said i think he s encouraged the clubs to do the same but the clubs have been slow in reacting to tagliabue s lead there are no black general managers or team presidents among the league s 28 teams only four black assistant general managers or team vice presidents and only one black head coach \( art shell of the los angeles raiders \) four nfl head coaching jobs were vacant during and after last season , but none of the openings were filled by a black coach tampa bay retained richard williamson , who was interim coach after ray perkins resigned near the end of the season philadelphia promoted offensive coordinator rich kotite to replace buddy ryan cleveland hired bill belichick , former giants defensive coordinator the giants conducted no interviews , taking less than 24 hours to promote offensive coordinator ray handley into bill parcells s position bill wallace , an assistant to eagles president harry gamble , said his recent appointment to philadelphia s front office to replace patrick forte , who left to become vice president of the patriots , signals progress in the hiring and promotion of minorities to management level positions by nfl clubs but wallace said not enough is being done wallace said he spent 10 years as outside legal counsel for the cardinals before the eagles hired him to a staff position breaking it down i think there are a number of reasons why change has n't happened in the league , wallace said one of the simplest explanations is that you 're dealing with not a lot of turnover no 2 is familiarity people hire people they are familiar with there has not been a lot of blacks in the mainstream of the decisionmaking process , so those people making the decisions about who to hire do n't hear our names there is an oldboy network the league has tried to promote the idea of hiring minoritygroup members for coaching positions among the clubs by setting up an internship program but thus far that grassroots approach has not resulted in a large upward push into defensive and offensive coordinator positions coordinator positions usually lead to headcoaching jobs marinovich adds bulk quarterback todd marinovich reported to the raiders rookie minicamp this weekend at a beefy 222 pounds marinovich will be listed as the no 4 quarterback on the raiders' depth chart when training camp opens he will be behind starter jay schroeder , backup vince evans and steve beuerlein marinovich weighed under 200 pounds when he auditioned for scouts at east los angeles community college in january he has been working under the watchful eye of his father , marv marinovich , who was a guard with the raiders in 1965 and a strength coach with the team from 1968 to 1970 the elder marinovich drew a lot of publicity for programming his son from cradle to quarterback , through diet , exercise and behavior lack of bulk was one concern about the 6foot4inch marinovich after he left the university of southern california to enter the draft after his sophomore season now , that he has answered the physical question , the next one is maturity that was a bigger concern to some teams after he was arrested on a charge of possession of drugs near his mother s home in marina del rey , calif , in january photo art shell of the los angeles raiders is the only black head coach in the national football league \( associated press \)
of all golf s great events , none sends a ripple through the game quite like the ryder cup , which begins friday at the ocean course on kiawah island in south carolina in the last decade , the onceobscure biennial matches have come to determine much more than whether a 12man team from the united states is better than a 12man team from europe over three days of 18hole matches for better or worse , the outcome of the ryder cup is now one of the defining factors for the entire world of modern professional golf , a world that is often a nebulous one this has become so because , after years of smug domination in the matchplay event , the americans have not beaten the europeans since 1983 each failure to win the ryder cup has brought an exponential drop in the perceived excellence of american golf , and a corresponding rise in the status of the resurgent european game europe s victory in 1985 and successful defenses in 1987 and 1989 changed the perspective of world golf more than any other factor , those victories have given vital weight to the increasingly prevalent contentions that the very best players in the world are now europeans that the british open is a more significant event than the united states open and that the european pga tour develops more wellrounded and competitively hardened golfers than does the pga tour in the united states this year , the united states goes into the ryder cup matches with the desperate determination of a man who has lost three straight doubleornothing bets while the europeans , relatively relaxed and likely favored , possess the peace of having proved themselves to the world , the american squad will have to play with the foreboding knowledge that a failure to regain the cup for a fourth straight time would make american golf incontestably second best for the first time since harry vardon s prime burden of legacy the united states has an overall record of 2152 since the ryder cup began in 1927 , with squads of players from britain and ireland winning once from 1935 through 1983 but since 1979 , when the opposition was expanded to include players from all of europe , the united states is 321 when the american team was beaten by 16 1 211 1 2 in 1985 at the belfry in sutton coldfield , england , the loss was regarded by most americans as an aberration that if nothing else revived a sense of real competition but when europe defended the cup by a score of 1513 at muirfield village in columbus , ohio , in 1987 , it marked the first time the united states had lost the cup twice in a row and the first time it had ever lost it on home turf winning it back in 1989 became a personal vendetta for united states players , producing brash predictions of victory beforehand but only solemn resignation after a 1414 tie allowed europe to keep the cup since then , american pros have engaged in a furious intramural competition to make the 12man united states squad all the while , they have resisted the kind of boasting that backfired in 1989 , choosing instead measured words emitted through clenched teeth i 've found these guys unbelievably determined , said dave stockton , who has succeeded raymond floyd as the united states captain it s simple we have to get the cup back electric atmosphere stockton s job will be to somehow keep his players from wilting in what has become the greatest pressure cooker in golf the atmosphere of the ryder cup has taken on all the electricity of a major championship , but with a distinction all its own the drama of match play and the spirit of team competition add a sustained intensity that is only rarely felt in 72hole strokeplay events this year s 28 matches also make up the only occasion in championship golf in which partisan fans can be expected to cheer missed 3foot putts i ca n't even imagine what the pressure will be like this year after us not winning it for six years , stockton said the emotions will come to the forefront i think i 've almost got to be a reverse motivator sometimes you want to win so much , you ca n't rather than urging a blood match , stockton is encouraging his players to enjoy the camaraderie of playing for a team and the challenge of headtohead golf in its most elemental form public catches on the spirit of the matches has caught on with the american golfing public , to whom the ryder cup was largely a ceremonial match until the united states began to lose for the first time in this country , tickets to the ryder cup are sold out , and 25 , 000 fans will crowd along the sand dunes of the ocean course each day television coverage of the matches will extend to 21 1 2 hours , the most ever for golf event on paper , this year s matches should break down as a battle between europe s star system and america s balance europe has the three top players in the sony world ranking in ian woosnam , jose maria olazabal and nick faldo , along with the player who has saved much of the best golf of his

moosic , pa it did n't start in moosic at ball parks all over the united states , bill craib and sue easler are being asked to throw out the first pitch , sign autographs and say a few words to reporters the former bartender and waitress are getting the star treatment because they are apparently the first people who have tried to visit all 178 major and minor league stadiums in one season as the two settled in here recently to watch their game 114 , between the scranton wilkesbarre red barons and the richmond braves , the 27yearold craib explained why their trip , which has been chronicled occasionally on espn , has captured the american imagination who has n't dreamed of spending a whole season watching baseball \? he said with a grin 45 , 000mile effort craib and easler , who expect to cover 45 , 000 miles in seeing all 152 minor league and 26 major league parks , started in oakland , calif , on april 9 , and they plan to end at yankee stadium on oct 6 along the way they are documenting an aggressively idiosyncratic world where the spirit of barnum and veeck is as strong as that of doubleday in frederick , md , team officials had players compete in cow milking races in savannah , ga , diamonds and zirconians were buried throughout the infield and fans were invited to dig them up they were out there with spoons and shovels , said the 23yearold easler one woman had an ax in greensboro , nc , the couple participated in a dizzy bat race at home plate we had to put our foreheads on a bat and spin around 10 times , craib said , rolling his eyes when we finished spinning , we were supposed to race to third well i took about two steps and slammed into sue before face planting into the grass they told me later it was a big hit then there was the sad case of san antonio s puffy the taco , who wears a big brown suit with green stuff like lettuce all over it and a tomato head , craib said one night puffy was racing a little girl around the bases she was supposed to tackle him before he got to home , craib recounted just before the the plate she took a flying leap at him she was straight out like superman , easler interjected she missed him and smacked the dirt , craib shuddered everyone started booing the little girl got up , walked over slowly and punched the taco the crowd went wild in this era of the milliondollar player and the monday morning fan , the minor leagues seem to produce a gentler and more forgiving following shortstops who bullet the ball into the stands and pitchers who walk in the gamewinning run are more likely to be greeted by awwws than boos , because they know the guy s just giving it his best shot , craib said 'fans are merciless' but woe to the umpire who blows a call the fans are merciless , craib said it s like they have to balance all the understanding toward the players when he was a child in kendall park , nj , craib s favorite day was when the major leagues released their schedules , he recalled i 'd just lay it out in my bedroom and stare , he said in 1986 , he did publicity for the minor league team in macon , ga i could n't believe there were 15 leagues and 152 teams in places like great falls , helena and medicine hat , he said god , i wanted to see them all he returned to the northeast and spent the next three years working in radio before realizing he was n't getting younger and i did n't know what i wanted to do , craib said i decided to go for it he aligned road maps and team schedules while working as a bartender in lyme center , nh , where easler was a waitress while i 'd wait for my drinks , he 'd tell me about his plan , easler said it sounded like fun craib said that squeezing in all the minor league teams , which stop play sept 4 , was the greatest challenge that s 162 games in 148 days , he explained wearily he had to account for acts of god rainouts do n't matter we 've had eight so far , because the point is to visit the parks and he had to account for rebelling bodies if one of us gets sick , the other has to do all the driving he estimated the cost at 10 , 000 and tried to lure 78 potential sponsors including anheuserbusch and cocacola none bit undaunted , the couple saved 4 , 000 and set off in their plymouth voyager unexpected aid has helped them avert the expected shortfall the booster club in baseball city , fla , for instance , gave them 200 many teams have provided food and lodging and scores of random fans have passed cups through the stands or handed them 5 or 10 i guess when it comes down to it , craib concluded , what we 're doing might seem strange to some people but in the world of baseball , it makes perfect sense photo sue easler and bill craib visit pilot field , where the buffalo bisons play \( joe traver \)
a new world order what is it \? president bush s new initiatives to control arms in the middle east could finally give some substance to all the vague and virtuous talk his first priority is to rid the region of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them but mr bush also sees the need for restraints on conventional arms , which , as the persian gulf war demonstrated , are every bit as deadly he now seems ready to cooperate with other big suppliers to curb arm sales to the region none of this will guarantee a broader peace but it will give states in the region something important to talk about and could actually reduce the chances of war mr bush s willingness to forswear chemical weapons represents a welcome change of heart earlier he insisted on keeping 2 percent of us chemical stocks until all chemically armed states signed the treaty now being negotiated by 39 nations in geneva the 2 percent solution was dubious both as deterrence and as diplomacy it gave states like syria a pretext to maintain and manufacture chemical arms and it shadowed the geneva talks mr bush s shift makes it possible to complete a treaty by year s end and induce other states to sign his pledge also shows that the us is prepared to do what it is asking of others destroy all chemical stocks and heads off any claim that a balky iraq is being unfairly singled out to induce other arab states to go along , washington quite reasonably wants israel to stop producing weaponsgrade nuclear material israel has said it is prepared to eliminate its nuclear capability and establish a nuclearfree zone in the middle east when it feels secure with its neighbors israel would be more secure if it moved first to restrict conventional weapons , mr bush would establish a group of the leading arms sellers they would be required to notify each other of impending sales to the region , giving the others a chance to object this would amount to an orderly marketing agreement to delay introduction of advanced military technology into the region , slow the arms race and preserve the military balance a similar arrangement among the us , britain and france in the 1950 s failed when egypt turned to the soviet bloc for arms conditions today are more favorable the middle east balance of power is not as precarious and the end of the cold war has muted competition for influence but the economic motive for arms sales may be more compelling because of the declining fortunes of militaryindustrial establishments in many countries mr bush is right to try to defuse the middle east powderkeg now , and these initiatives are a welcome way to promote peace
washington , aug 16 flaws in boeing 767 jet engines could lead to an engine suddenly reversing the direction of its thrust while the plane is flying , the federal aviation administration said today the agency ordered steps to avoid the problem such a malfunction is believed to have happened just before the crash of an austrian airline s 767 that killed 223 people in thailand in may although the aviation agency said it could not prove what caused the crash , it ordered airlines to disconnect the thrust reversers on similar jets to prevent any possibility of such an accident the boeing company said today that the potential flaw that could cause the problem had never been detected in an operational engine but was deliberately set up in a test engine by engineers searching for explanations of why the accident in thailand occurred 40 planes flying in us even so , the fact that the aviation agency ordered measures to prevent such a problem indicated that the theory was plausible there are about 380 boeing 767 s in operation around the world , but not all of them have the type of controls that are affected by today s order boeing said that about 40 planes operated by united states airlines and about 130 operated by foreign airlines would be affected soon after the crash in thailand , investigators for the national transportation safety board identified the sudden reversal of engine thrust as a possible cause of the accident but the faa said as recently as a month ago that it could not identify any single flaw that would lead to the inadvertent deployment of the thrust reversers , which are normally used only to slow a plane when it is on the ground jet engines power planes by expelling air , much as a full balloon shoots away when its spout is opened when the reverse thruster is activated , some of the air is suddenly deflected forward as boeing and the aviation agency continued testing , they identified two separate flaws that , if occurring simultaneously , could cause thrust reversers to be unintentionally deployed one flaws and a theory one of the flaws , a misaligned sensor that could incorrectly measure the position of the thrust reversers , was found to exist on 90 percent of the planes examined by the investigators the other flaw involves a valve being jammed by a piece of debris from one of its parts it was this flaw that boeing engineers deliberately created in the test engine their experiment demonstrated that the two flaws in combination could reverse an engine s thrust if a thrust reverser suddenly deploys in flight , it can lead to disaster , said aviation officials studying the crash of the plane , which belonged to lauda airlines of austria the plane broke apart suddenly while climbing at nearly 25 , 000 feet in the minutes before the accident , the plane s crew noticed that a caution light in the cockpit was flickering on and off , indicating that a safety valve might be opening and closing the valve cuts off hydraulic power to the thrust reversers so that they can not move during flight if the position sensor for the thrust reversers was out of alignment , it might have incorrectly signaled that the reversers needed to be stowed , or put into their normal , undeployed position this would be done automatically ordinarily , the incorrect signal and the unnecessary adjustment to the thrusters would cause no problem because a second valve , which controls the position of the reversers , is supposed to be set to stow them but the investigators for faa and boeing discovered in tests that a sliver of a sealing ring from the second valve could jam it , moving it unintentionally into the position for deploying the thrust reversers if that happened , then the spurious signal to automatically stow the thrust reversers would instead cause them to be deployed the suspect electrical mechanism is unique to engines built by pratt whitney , the faa said but the agency also ordered the deactivation of boeing 767 engines made by general electric and rolls royce because their designs are similar boeing , not the engine suppliers , makes the thrust reversers for 767 s the twinengine 767 seats about 300 people and is frequently used on fairly long , transoceanic flights ed states airlines united , delta , american and usair operate planes affected by the order industry officials said none of them would have any problem meeting the sevenday deadline for making the change , which takes just two hours and can be done on a routine overnight stop a spokeswoman for united said service would not be affected the thrust reversers are used in combination with brakes in landing to slow a plane airline officials said that brakes and wing devices would be used instead the thrust reversers are also used as a backup device to stop a plane if a takeoff has to be aborted without them , a plane is like an automobile without an emergency brake the main operating disadvantage , in relatively rare circumstances , would come when the planes were taking off from short runways that were slick from rain or snow in those conditions , an airline would either lighten the plane s load to shorten its stopping distance , or would wait for runway conditions to improve before attempting a takeoff diagram thrust reversers under scrutiny shows how the thrust reverser deflects the flow of air through the engine assisting the plane s brakes chart what might have gone wrong here is what could go wrong to cause thrust reversers on the 767 to deploy incorrectly 1 a sensor on the reversers is improperly aligned it sends a signal that the reversers are deployed when they are actually properly stowed 2the plane s systems issue an automatic command to stow the thrust reversers 3 this command opens the isolation valve that ordinarily is shut and keeps hydraulic \( or , in some engine types , pneumatic \) pressure away from the thrust reverser controls \( without pressure , the thrust reversers cannot be moved \) 4 pressure builds at the directional control valve , where a piston switch specifies whether the thrust reversers should be deployed or stowed ordinarily , this switch is in the stow position unless the pilot has ordered the thrust reversers to be deployed 5 but because of contamination in the directional control valve , caused by debris from a seal on the solenoid device that triggers the piston switch s movement , the valve is blocked and the switch is in the deploy position 6 with the valve blocked , the buildup of pressure causes the thrust reversers to deploy

at almost exactly 2 pm yesterday , senator alfonse m d'amato strode up to a stage in a midtown hotel and with an expression of exaggerated disappointment on his face , looked and then looked again , at a row of empty chairs it s too bad , you know , the senator said solemnly as nearly a dozen news cameras recorded his every move once again this week , mr d'amato had trained the spotlight on charges that he had used his influence to benefit friends , family and political contributors in his efforts to clear his name triggered by an unflatering profile on 60 minutes the senator has spent the last week putting himself at the center of a blizzard of news conferences and television and radio appearances but his efforts have left some political analysts wondering whether he is doing more harm than good were ratings enhanced \? in this instance , the senator had invited three men named in the 60 minutes segment to bring forth their evidence of his wrongdoing but none of the men , sydney h schanberg , a columnist for newsday , mark green , the city s consumer affairs commissioner , who ran for the senate against mr d'amato in 1986 , or harold scully , who worked for mr d'amato when he was the town supervisor of island park , li , chose to show up instead , mr d'amato once again attacked the charges , saying none had been proved some argue that mr d'amato s campaign against the 60 minutes segment a summary of allegations that have dogged him throughout most of his 10year career as a senator have only given wider attention to the accusations they argue that each appearance , which inevitably repeats the unflattering charges , builds an unfavorable impression with the voter mr d'amato also took the highly unusual route of holding a news conference to denounce the program even before it aired on sunday , a move that many thought only enhanced ratings i know that i made a point of watching because of his hype , said maureen r connolly , a political consultant who has been active in many new york campaigns i do n't believe you sit back when you are accused , but there s a point where you turn what might have been a twoday story into a full week s worth that really sticks in people s minds still others , however , argue that the senator has chosen a brave path when you have a show like this on '60 minutes , ' said david garth , a political consultant who said he was not a friend of mr d'amato s , you either do something or fold up your tent the show has that kind of weight mr garth said mr d'amato s call to have his accusers face him was a legitimate effort that should not be relegated to a publicity stunt i do n't think this is stupid , if he has nothing to hide it s one way to go mr schanberg who was quoted on 60 minutes saying that to believe the senator was innocent was to believe he was deaf , dumb , blind and had an iq of 23 , issued a statement declining mr d'amato s invitation because he was a journalist not a performer the questions have been asked , mr schanberg said , they only needed to be answered by mr d'amato honestly mr green , who brought his allegations to the senate ethics committee in 1989 , also issued a statement saying he would not be part of mr d'amato s high noon diversionary tactics efforts to reach mr scully were unavailing calls to his home were unanswered mr d'amato s spokeswoman , zenia mucha , said he was simply looking for forums to answer the allegations were relatives helped \? he was unable to do that on 60 minutes because the program s producers refused his demand to have him on live and unedited they said they had never done that before the program continued yesterday to stand by its story much of what was in the segment , reported by mike wallace , had been reported in the past it described allegations that the senator had helped a cousin skip to the head of a line for federally financed housing it also suggested that his brother , armand , a long island lawyer , had got several favors for his clients through the senator in his news conferences , the senator has deplored the lack of proof and repeatedly claimed that he was an honest man working hard for his constituency mr d'amato said of the charges that the volume of them cries , but when you look at them they are wiped away many of the charges are expected to be taken up soon by the senate ethics committee , which has been looking at a compendium of allegations of misconduct against the republican senator details of their closeddoor inquiry are secret but the main thrust has to do with allegations that mr d'amato used his influence to steer federal grants for housing projects in new york to major contributors to his political campaigns at yesterday s event , at the ballroom of the grand hyatt at east 42d street in manhattan , mr d'amato said he looked forward to a resolution from the ethics committee
as waves of chinese and southeast asian immigrants flood new york city in search of better lives , their expanding neighborhoods are being plagued by increasingly violent street gangs and new criminal enterprises that lawenforcement officials say may come to rival the mafia in its heyday the crimes , concentrated almost entirely in the hardworking chinese community itself , are likely to mount even more as three forces separately challenge the traditional order of the tongs , the fraternal societies that have ruled chinatown for generations one is the growth of street gangs fighting for control of burgeoning asian communities in queens and brooklyn another is an effort by the criminal triad societies in hong kong to establish a foothold in new york in anticipation of the 1997 takeover of the british colony by china the third is the emergence of ruthlessly violent gangs of young vietnamese 'no rules , no values' the criminal activity is expanding from the longstanding enterprises of protection rackets , gambling and prostitution into extortion , armed robbery , largescale heroin importing and the smuggling of illegal aliens , who are often held as virtual slaves to pay for their passage there are no norms anymore , no rules , no values the code has broken down , said dr ko lin chin , a sociologist studying chinatown s criminal subculture that is why it is so violent chinatown has burst its traditional boundaries the new asian community is expanding north and east along east broadway , glistening with new banks and office towers shielding hong kong investments , to division street , where immigrants from fujian province in southeast china are clustered , to centre street , where the taiwanese are , to henry street , where the burmese can be found , and along canal , where the vietnamese gangs dominate but like other immigrant groups in the city , the chinese have moved out along the subway lines , particularly the no 7 to queens the train they call the orient express through jackson heights , elmhurst and flushing where the subway ends , in the shadow of shea stadium , new highrises and signs in chinese mark a rapidly growing community none of the established chinese tongs operate there , and that has left a power vacuum for the youth gangs to try to fill queens is the future , it s open for picking , it s virgin territory , said lloyd hutchinson , a shanghaiborn police detective who went undercover in chinatown gambling dens a dozen years ago and is now on the queens district attorney s investigative squad it s not sanctioned territory like chinatown the question is who s going to be the first one to take over lawenforcement officials , struggling to penetrate a traditionally closed society that rarely cooperates with the police or prosecutors or talks to outsiders , concede that they can see only the tip of the iceberg the outside world becomes aware of the level of crime there only when a startling shooting occurs for example , the slaying of a leader of the vietnamese gang born to kill on canal street last july at his funeral in new jersey , attackers , who are still unknown to the police , pulled weapons from behind their funeral wreaths and sprayed the mourners with gunfire , wounding a dozen but a recent series of arrests and indictments gives an idea of the scope of the crime and violence one was a raid by federal drug enforcement administration agents on a heroin ring in brooklyn that seized 86 million in cash , the largest such haul in the united states in chicago , 29 people , including several new york chinatown civic leaders , were indicted on federal charges of operating a nationwide gambling ring last week in the bronx , the police raided a crowded apartment to rescue an illegal immigrant who had been kidnapped and beaten with a hammer because he had not paid 30 , 000 to a ring that that had smuggled him into new york thirteen of his captors , themselves all illegal immigrants from fujian province , were arrested last month , a joint police and federal bureau of investigation task force interrupted an investigation of youth gangs extorting asian merchants in queens to arrest seven leaders of the green dragons gang the authorities said the arrests broke up a plan by the green dragons for a shootout with a rival gang , the white tigers , who were shaking down the elmhurst and flushing areas among the 29 guns seized were two uzi submachine guns and a mac10 machine pistol investigators believe the rivalry has already led to a halfdozen killings every single business in chinatown and chinese areas of queens is being extorted , and sometimes not just by one gang , said catherine e palmer , an assistant united states attorney who specializes in organized crime in the asian communities gangs are a daytoday reality , a real problem look at all the shootings that happen in chinatown the lords of chinatown a union of generations in 1980 , there

kinshasa , zaire , oct 30 as hundreds of foreigners fled zaire today on the final evacuation flights scheduled by western governments , a growing sense of disorder and desperation gripped this central african country many of the foreigners held important technical and managerial positions jobs that most diplomats believe zairians , for now , are incapable of filling most banks here in the capital , for example , were run in close partnership with institutions in belgium , zaire s former colonial ruler now , with the exodus of tens of thousands of belgian citizens , banking links between here and most of europe have been virtually severed similarly , the italian mechanics who largely maintained the huge ingashaba power line , which provides energy for most of the country , fled several days ago after the area around the dam in western zaire became a target for army looting some western diplomats fear that it is only a matter of time before electricity will cease to flow through zaire , africa s thirdlargest country fears of a blood bath the imminent departure of french and belgian paratroopers , who have organized the evacuation over the last two weeks , has also provoked fears that zaire could face a blood bath france has announced that it will withdraw its remaining 150 paratroopers when the evacuation is complete , perhaps as early as thursday belgium , which has about 800 paratroopers , is expected to maintain a presence in the capital for two or three more weeks ilunga kalonza , a senior member of the union for democracy and social progress , zaire s leading opposition group , said president mobutu sese seko is just waiting until the foreigners leave so that he can wreak revenge on his enemies last week president mobutu dismissed etienne tshisekedi , the group s leader , as prime minister and replaced him with bernadin mungul diaka , the leader of a relatively minor opposition group in a petition sent today to foreign embassies , a coalition of nearly 150 opposition groups , called the sacred union , warned that with the withdrawal of foreign economic and political aid the zairian people are in danger of extermination by a dictator seeking blood mr mungul today named his 34member cabinet , which includes three members of the tshisekedi cabinet at the key portfolios of defense , the foreign ministry and planning , reuters reported mr mungul said 40 percent of his cabinet were drawn from the ranks of the sacred union two sides stand firm antigovernment leaders say they will settle for nothing but mr tshisekedi s reappointment as prime minister the president and other leaders of the governing party are equally insistent that mr tshisekedi is unacceptable one sign of the growing unpopularity of the president was the response tuesday night to a rumor that he had agreed to reappoint mr tshisekedi as prime minister for several hours thousands of people filled the streets of matonge , the heart of one of kinshasa s poorest neighborhoods , waving victory signs as soldiers fired into the air but today kinshasa was generally quiet there was none of the pillaging that had left the fashionable downtown district like a scarred battlefield nonetheless , for most zairians the days are increasingly spent in struggle crowds of people gathered in front of banks , eager to withdraw their money , but few opened lines of cars and trucks stretched through entire neighborhoods as drivers besieged the few gasoline stations before the shrinking fuel supplies disappear altogether for those few zairians who can afford to escape to another country , obtaining visas and other documents has become increasingly difficult in neighboring congo , which has readily accepted fleeing europeans , there have been reports that zairians seeking refuge have been turned back some zairians who have sought to enter congo illegally across the zaire river have reportedly been severely beaten and then deported
he has had many great moments during his wondrous basketball career but none were as courageous as magic johnson s disclosure on thursday that he had been infected with the aids virus this was leadership for the nation , just when it was needed mr johnson pledged to work toward ending the spread of the disease that pledge shames president bush , whose silence has allowed this plague to disappear from the national agenda magic s announcement that he was retiring because of the hiv infection broke the nation s heart in 12 extraordinary years with the los angeles lakers he became one of the dominant figures in basketball history he remains now as he was on his first day the soul of warmth and gentleness , a smiling member of the family who always seems happy to see us more than 125 , 000 americans have died of aids the disease is full blown in nearly 200 , 000 others and perhaps as many as 15 million are in mr johnson s category , infected , but not yet ill estimates say that over the next three years there will be 230 , 000 more deaths and between 200 , 000 and 600 , 000 new infections in a recent report , the national commission on aids was rightly critical of mr bush , saying that the white house had rarely addressed the aids issue and the president used one of those rare occasions to chide aids demonstrators for hurting labor day business in kennebunkport , me , not far from his vacation house the administration has also canceled two vital surveys of sexual behavior , one dealing with teenagers conservatives thought the questions might appear to condone casual sex that was a foolish and possibly tragic error hundreds of thousands of americans have been infected by unsafe sexual practices hundreds of thousands more may follow only a better portrait of sexual practices will let those in the field know how to save lives mr bush insists that changes in behavior will stop the epidemic but how will those changes occur if the president himself continues to disappear from leadership against this virulent enemy magic johnson knows that the epidemic is real we think , well , only gay people can get it it s not going to happen to me and here i am saying that it can happen to anybody mr johnson , who has played many positions in his basketball career , is now filling a presidential vacuum the nation can be thankful for his bravery and answer him with its prayers
united nations , march 9 the united nations group charged with encouraging respect for human rights has begun investigations of abuses in iraq and in kuwait while it was under iraqi occupation at a meeting in geneva that ended on friday , the united nations human rights commission also ordered an investigation of abuses in cuba and maintained pressure on iran s government with the aim of improving teheran s treatment of dissidents the commission also agreed to monitor arbitrary imprisonment around the world commenting on the measures , some private american human rights organizations called the sixweek 47th annual meeting of the human rights commission one of its most successful in years , even though china and several other governments the organizations consider repressive escaped censure it looks like one of the most successful meetings for some time , with three new investigations and a decision to monitor arbitrary detentions , said felice d gaer , executive director of the international league for human rights in new york reed brody , executive secretary of the genevabased international commission of jurists , said , everyone feels this was very productive shaming the violators while the commission cannot force governments to respect their obligations under the universal declaration on human rights , it can try to shame them into doing so by hearing charges of violations , undertaking investigations and adopting critical resolutions urging compliance after officially ignoring human rights violations in iraq for years , the 43nation commission voted overwhelmingly this year to investigate government atrocities there and in occupied kuwait , even though baghdad said it would not cooperate the bush administration also scored a victory in its perennial struggle to see the cuban government of president fidel castro condemned and investigated over mistreatment of its political opponents last year , the commission merely asked the secretary general , javier perez de cuellar , to discuss reported human rights abuses with cuba but this year it appointed an investigator and instructed him to report back on cuba s rights record after talking with both the government and the citizens of cuba , a reference to rights groups there inquiry on iran continues despite pressure from muslim countries to halt monitoring of iran s human rights performance , the commission voted to continue its investigation for another year but said it would be suspended after that if teheran made further progress in his report on iran , the commission s investigator , reynaldo galindo pohl of el salvador , said the position of iran s bahai minority continues to be uncertain bahais are regarded as heretics by iran s muslim fundamentalist leaders although none have been executed recently , as they were in the early years of the islammic republic , they are still denied university education , passports and the right to inherit property , mr galindo pohl said the commission s decision to establish a working group to investigate arbitrary detention of prisoners throughout the world was welcomed by western governments and human rights organizations the commission also expressed its concern over recent killings in the soviet republics of latvia and lithuania it asked to see the results of investigations in progress there in a carefully worded statement , which also praised president mikhail s gorbachev s support for human rights this was the first time that the commission has taken any action on reported human rights abuses in the soviet union
anyone who can solve the knicks' problems should report to madison square garden immediately the team needs help no one expected new york to be well under 500 this late in the season not the players , not the coaches , not the front office , not the fans , not even the team s opponents but the knicks , with a record of 2025 after their victory over sacramento last night , have earned every defeat their play has lacked emotion their overall effort has been questionable in many games and while they are a veteran team , they have not matured as a unit on the floor under pressure , they are prone to make costly turnovers , to force bad shots , to make mental errors , to forget teamwork and to resort to oneonone play if the knicks make the playoffs , what are the odds of them beating boston , detroit or chicago in a series when they have trouble beating orlando and minnesota at home \? with new york apparently headed toward an early summer vacation , here is an assessment of the team midway through a disappointing season , with the criticism spread around front office before last thursday night , when bernard king scored 49 points in leading the washington bullets past the knicks , had you ever heard fans heckling a general manager in the middle of a game \? al bianchi , the knicks' general manager , is taking so much heat these days , it s surprising he does n't have a permanent tan with the knicks over the salary cap when his tenure began in the summer of 1987 , bianchi inherited a difficult job and the team improved dramatically during bianchi s first two seasons , largely because he acquired mark jackson , charles oakley , rod strickland , johnny newman and sidney green but bianchi s most recent moves have not worked out as he had hoped the decision last summer not to resign newman , who accepted an offer from the charlotte hornets , was based on economics but the knicks are still over the salary cap without newman s salary , and they miss his scoring strickland , unhappy with his playing time in new york last season , forced the knicks to choose between him and jackson as the point guard of the future before last season was over , bianchi traded strickland to san antonio for maurice cheeks , who despite a potential hall of fame career , is 34 years old strickland is 24 and cheeks s arrival only enhanced the point guard controversy now the knicks are wondering what to do about the 25yearold jackson , who is unhappy playing behind cheeks while bianchi has been waiting for the knicks to improve as a halfcourt team for two seasons , their personnel remains better suited to playing uptempo basketball last fall , bianchi became disenchanted enough with stu jackson to replace jackson on dec 3 , just 15 games into the coach s second season , with john macleod but despite macleod s emphasis on fundamentals and teamwork , the knicks are struggling worse under macleod than they did under jackson bianchi wants to make a trade , perhaps several trades , before the feb 21 deadline but he is bargaining from a weak position many league executives feel the only two knicks with strong trade value are patrick ewing and oakley jackson s huge contract , gerald wilkins s erratic play , cheeks s age , kiki vandeweghe s propensity for injury and jerrod mustaf s untapped potential make them hard to trade for someone of value bianchi knew the knicks needed help last summer , but he did not make a deal now it may be too late hindsight is easier than foresight , and bianchi staunchly defends almost all of his decisions but consider this is the knicks' present roster weaker than it was two years ago , when they ended the season with oakley , newman , ewing , jackson and wilkins as starters , with vandeweghe , strickland , trent tucker , kenny walker , sidney green , eddie lee wilkins and pete myers on the bench \? perhaps the knicks have been overestimating their talent for the last two years and are paying for it now unless they finish the season strongly and win at least one playoff series , new york fans may not have bianchi to kick around anymore coaching those who thought stu jackson was the major reason for the knicks' slow start this season have discovered otherwise from his first day on the job , macleod has emphasized improving the knicks' fundamentals blocking out for rebounds , playing oneonone defense , passing unselfishly , taking highpercentage shots but whatever improvement new york has shown in these areas has come slowly and appeared inconsistently some players are upset by macleod s failure to set defined roles one night , a player may get 20 minutes the next , he may not play at all macleod also has tried numerous starting lineups , and says he will continue to make changes until the knicks win consistently but the constant shuffling of players may be doing more harm than good macleod is a proven winner , but it does not matter who is coaching the knicks if they do not practice what the coach preaches the knicks may have too many problems to solve before april and unfortunately for macleod , he may not get the opportunity next year to work with the knicks from the opening of training camp players
woodbridge , nj , april 23 a fire that burned out an abortion clinic here on monday was arson , investigators said today but the investigation is not focused exclusively on antiabortion groups or people who have been protesting and conducting daily vigils at the clinic , the investigators said you do n't have to be sherlock holmes to conclude this was arson , said woodbridge s public safety director , frank d wallace , who heads the primary investigation when somebody throws a rock through the window , and there is a gasoline can right inside the lobby , it s pretty clear alarms alert 2 departments the police and fire departments were alerted just after 5 am monday when automatic fire and burglar alarms at the clinic sounded about 50 firefighters from departments in avenel , colonia , iselin and other communities near woodbridge responded immediately the alarm was treated as urgent because a medical building was involved the firefighters had the blaze under control in an hour , but by then the interior of the building was severely damaged two iselin firefighters were injured slightly when a section of the building collapsed they were treated at a hospital in edison and released the clinic has been the target of sporadic demonstrations and daily prayer vigils by antiabortion advocates , but mr wallace said we are not going to develop tunnel vision or assume it was done by antiabortion people we 're not closing down any options it s too pat to blame those people , he said he said no one had claimed responsibility for the fire , which is also being investigated by the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , which usually takes part in cases involving bombings or arson at abortion clinics the newark office of the federal bureau of investigation has also been alerted but is not actively involved in the investigation at present , mr wallace said antiabortion demonstrations have been held at the clinic nearly very weekend by eight to 10 people , and two or three usually conduct a prayer vigil there each morning but it s a long way from praying to setting a building on fire , mr wallace said the clinic , called the medical care center , performs 20 to 30 abortions a day , and also does limited podiatry and minor surgical procedures , according to paul langevin , a spokesman for the new jersey department of health , which licensed the center in 1982 clinic cited as unsanitary there have been a number of arrests of demonstrators at the clinic , but none for the last year or so , according to the police however , the clinic itself has been the subject of investigation because of at least three complaints of incomplete abortions fetal material left in the womb mr langevin said in november 1989 the clinic was found to have inadequate antiseptic facilities and procedures and was fined 4 , 400 , he said the fines were appealed , and a hearing is pending , he added mr wallace said recent demonstrations at the clinic had been peaceful the building was unoccupied at the time of the blaze and apparently had been so since saturday afternoon workmen boarded up the clinic today , and patients scheduled for abortions were referred to other places photo a fire that swept an abortion clinic early on monday in woodbridge , nj , was declared arson yesterday by investigators they said the building s interior , including this examination room , was destroyed \( associated press \)
although it surely was not her intention , darrah cloud has brought off the bizarre feat of writing a politically correct play about the 1963 bombing of a black church in birmingham , ala , that all but ignores the bombing s victims the play is titled the stick wife , and rather than concern itself with the casualties of racism , it pleads what the author seems to feel is the now more timely cause of the ku klux klan s oppressed wives they , too , have a cross to bear the stick wife arrives at the manhattan theater club stage ii after previous productions at several other nonprofit theater companies , none of them anywhere near the south the setting is the hardscrabble backyard of a poor white trash household , designed \( by james youmans \) to uphold a sophisticated new york audience s prejudices about how the other , unwashed half lives in dixie in this tacky arena , ms cloud delineates the pathetic life of jessie bliss \( lindsay crouse \) , who ekes out a drab , terrified existence in the shadow of a bullying husband who destroys her selfesteem by day and spends most nights away from home dressed up in a sheet the playwright s point that racist men are also sexist is as indisputable as it is obvious but where is the drama \? the klansmen in the stick wife are the standard snarling cretins , while their fundamentally decent , if lowrent , wives are stereotypes of a more sentimental \( and recent \) sort there is a single funny speech in which one of jessie s friends , played by julie white , joyously imagines her display of grief when the day comes for her despised husband s funeral but otherwise there are none of the novel insights or even reportorial observations with which writers like beth henley and horton foote , among many others , revitalize and humanize the usual southern suspects worse , by retroactively and rigidly imposing an anachronistic feminist agenda on one of the tragic racial cataclysms of the 1960 s , ms cloud ends up trivializing two political movements in one play the punishment the klan wives suffer at their husbands' hands verbal and physical abuse , domestic drudgery bordering on servitude is so didactically presented that it seems like theoretical boilerplate the graver injuries that the same male villains inflict on their black victims murder , for instance are given secondclass dramatic treatment to the point where they become remote abstractions right as ms cloud no doubt is about the martyrdom of klan wives , she does her cause no service by failing to see these women s suffering in any kind of psychological depth or historical perspective the heavyhanded director , david warren , has not done the playwright any favors , either , by staging the stick wife in a naturalistic manner that seems more appropriate to tobacco road or perhaps steel magnolias for better or worse , ms cloud has written a stylized work that includes fantasized soliloquies about hollywood fame for its heroine and that is pockmarked , if only to jolt an audience awake , by such apocalyptic visions as the inexplicable slammings of doors and windows and the mysterious profusion of symbolic bloodred dresses on a clothesline in mr warren s staging , the stick wife veers ludicrously between travesties of the styles of carson mccullers and stephen king ms crouse , a good actress back on the new york stage after a long absence , is asked to sob her way through her role , which she does admirably , reaching her grandest outpouring when ms cloud throws in the bulletin of john f kennedy s assassination to bolster the final curtain with the exception of ms white s performance , the rest of the acting is predictable , but no more so than the writing like black eagles , the becalmed drama about black world war ii pilots on the manhattan theater club s main stage , the stick wife suggests that this otherwise rigorous theatrical company feels that the somber history of american racial conflict can somehow dignify the inferior plays it is dumping on the audience at the end of the season the stick wife by darrah cloud directed by david warren scenery by james youmans costumes by david c woolard lighting by donald holder sound by john kilgore fight director , j allen suddeth production stage manager , christine michael presented by manhattan theater club , lynne meadow , artistic director barry grove , managing director at city center stage 2 , 131 west 55th street jessie bliss lindsay crouse ed bliss murphy guyer marguerite pullet julie white big albert connor lanny flaherty betty connor margo martindale tom pullet michael countryman lindsay crouse \( gerry goodstein manhattan theater club \)

london , nov 20 the swiss bank corporation said today that it was demanding repayment of a loan of 55 million , or about 988 million , to a private company controlled by the family of the late robert maxwell similar demands for repayment by other lenders could have a domino effect and cause the maxwell empire to crash but the main british lenders to the heavily indebted publishing empire indicated today that an effort was under way to come up with a plan to defuse the overall crisis national westminster bank and lloyds bank , both of which have loans to maxwell family companies , were trying today to persuade lenders to agree to a freeze on principal repayments by the private companies for several months , according to several bankers who spoke on condition of anonymity also , a swiss bank spokesman emphasized that his institution had no immediate intention of forcing the private maxwell company into receivership one of the bankers interviewed today said he expects the banks and the maxwells to try to come up with a plan to deal with the crisis over the next week to 10 days it might include a restructuring of loans or some sort of moratorium on repayments but , he said , forcing the private companies into receivership would be in no one s interests right now asked whether it looked like other banks would continue to hold back and not demand repayment like swiss bank has , an official at one of the main banks said it s far too early to tell it s a very fluid situation , changing daily the swiss bank spokesman , who confirmed a report in british newspapers today that repayment was being demanded , said we have n't at this stage made any decision on what may or may not be acceptable as a solution to this problem we would much rather this was resolved through negotiation and we are certainly open to suggestions but if it cannot be resolved to our satisfaction , we reserve the right to call in a receiver maxwell stock plunges in trading in london today , the stock of the maxwell communication corporation continued to plunge , closing at 36 pence , or about 645 cents , down 10 pence it has dropped about 70 percent since early november , when mr maxwell disappeared from his yacht off the canary islands and was found dead shares of the family s other flagship public company , mirror group newspapers plc , continued to climb , closing today at 126 , or about 226 , up 11 pence and just 1 pence below the high it hit last spring after the maxwell family sold 49 percent of the company s stock to the public the maxwell family s private companies own 68 percent of maxwell communication and 51 percent of mirror group much of those stakes has been pledged as collateral for loans but with the continuing plunge in maxwell communication s stock , the collateral for some loans is believed to be grossly inadequate maxwell communication , whose businesses are largely in the united states , is heavily indebted mirror group , whose main businesses are british newspapers , is financially much healthier there has been speculation , which the maxwells have dismissed , that they might sell their 51 percent stake in mirror group to reduce their debts investing in japanese stocks swiss bank lent 55 million to adviser 188 ltd , which is owned by headington investments ltd , one of the family s private companies , to acquire first tokyo index trust , an investment firm that invests in japanese stocks first tokyo s portfolio of japanese stocks were supposed to have been given to swiss bank as collateral last month , the bank said but none of the listed securities have been made available to us , the swiss bank spokesman said today swiss bank filed a complaint with the british police , who along with the british government s serious fraud office are now investigating the case the swiss bank spokesman confirmed that the maxwell family had offered other security , but added that no offer has been made which would be satisfactory as an alternative to either the original security or the repayment of the loan the private companies owe about 750 million , or about 135 billion , to about 20 banks the public and private companies together have a net debt of about 25 billion , or 449 billion at current exchange rates , which owed to more than 50 banks robert cole , a spokesman for the maxwells , would only say we continue to work with the banks he declined to say anything specifically about the swiss bank situation

woodcliff lake , nj it is time for some straight talk about why 400 , 000 young americans spent christmas in the deserts of saudi arabia and why in less than two weeks the us may be once again at war we must first be clear about what the conflict is not about if we must resort to military force to drive saddam hussein from kuwait , it will not be a war about democracy while our goal is to restore kuwait s legitimate government , it is hypocritical to suggest that we hope to bring democracy to kuwait except for israel , there are no democracies in the mideast , and there will be none in the foreseeable future the emir of kuwait is among the world s more benevolent dictators , but once he is back in his palace in kuwait city , he will still be a dictator nor is intervention justified because saddam hussein is a cruel leader president bush has been criticized for equating him with hitler whether he is that bad is irrelevant he is bad enough his soldiers are murdering , torturing and raping defenseless kuwaitis and pillaging their country he violated international law by using chemical weapons against iran and the kurds but if our policy were to punish cruel leaders , we would not be allied with syria s president hafez alassad he ordered the massacre of 20 , 000 innocent people in the city of hama in his own country , has supported international terrorism and presided over an army that has committed brutal atrocities in lebanon both syria and iraq threaten our interests , but today iraq poses a profoundly greater threat those who fault president bush for enlisting president assad s support should remember winston churchill s classic rejoinder to those who criticized him for supporting stalin after hitler invaded the soviet union during world war ii if hitler invaded hell , i think i would find a kind word to say about the devil in the house of commons we are in the persian gulf for two major reasons first , saddam hussein has unlimited ambitions to dominate one of the most important strategic areas in the world when senator bob dole said we were in the gulf for oil and secretary of state james baker said we were there for jobs , they were criticized for justifying our actions on purely selfish grounds we should not apologize for defending our vital economic interests had we not intervened , an international outlaw would today control more than 40 percent of the world s oil while , by stringent energy conservation , the us might be able to get along without oil from the gulf , western europe and japan could not what happens to the economies of other great industrial nations directly affects the economy of the us we cannot allow mr hussein to blackmail us and our allies into accepting his aggressive goals by giving him a choke hold on our oil lifeline because he has oil , he has the means to acquire the weapons he needs for aggression against his neighbors , eventually including nuclear weapons if he succeeds in kuwait , he will attack others , and he will use whatever weapons he has to achieve his goals if we do not stop him now , we will have to stop him later , when the cost in young american lives will be infinitely greater there is an even more important longterm reason for rolling back iraq s aggression we cannot be sure , as many believe and hope , that we are entering into a new , postcoldwar era where armed aggression will no longer be an instrument of national policy but we can be sure that if saddam hussein profits from aggression , other potential aggressors in the world will be tempted to wage war against their neighbors if we succeed in getting mr hussein out of kuwait in accordance with the un resolution and in eliminating his capacity to wage war in the future which must be our goal if he refuses to get out peacefully and forces us to act militarily we will have the credibility to deter aggression elsewhere without sending american forces the world will take seriously us warnings against aggression some critics argue that we should continue sanctions for as long as 18 months before resorting to force they contend that even if sanctions do not work , mr hussein will be so weakened that we will suffer fewer casualties if war does come they are wrong on three counts first , while the iraqi people suffer the effects of the sanctions , president hussein will direct his resources so that the iraqi military will not second , while the sanctions will weaken iraq , they will weaken us even more , because of the political difficulty of holding our alliance together abroad and maintaining support for our troop commitment at home finally , the most the critics can claim is that it is possible that sanctions might work it is certain that military force will work the stakes are too high to risk failure other critics believe diplomacy will eventually convince saddam hussein that he should get out of kuwait but neither diplomacy nor sanctions has a chance unless he knows that if he does not get out of kuwait peacefully , the american people and our allies will be united in support of driving him out military should secretary baker s meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , tariq aziz , fail to produce an ageement that complies unconditionally with the un resolution , we must remember that when dealing with an insatiable aggressor a bad peace is worse than war because it will inevitably lead to a bigger war if we must go to war , it will not be just a war about oil it will not be a war about a tyrant s cruelty it will not be a war about democracy it will be a war about peace not just peace in our time , but peace for our children and grandchildren in the years ahead if saddam hussein gains in any way from his aggression , despite our unprecedented commitment of economic , diplomatic and military power , other aggressors will be encouraged to wage war against their neighbors and peace will be in jeopardy everywhere in the world that is why our commitment in the gulf is a highly moral enterprise drawing of an american soldier
thornwood , ny , dec 5 people in switzerland who knew the childcare worker charged with setting a fire that killed a 3monthold baby here have expressed shock and incredulity at the accusations , a swiss newspaper said today the paper , blick , interviewed an administrator of juventusschulen , a school in zurich where the 20yearold nanny , olivia riner , had studied to be a medical assistant i do n't believe it at all , the administrator , margrit thoma , was quoted as saying olivia was one of our best students blick , published in zurich and switzerland s largest newspaper , also quoted a neighbor of miss riner s parents in their home town , wettingen it must be a mistake , the neighbor was quoted as saying anonymously the family is without blemish and works hard olivia was always friendly and caring it is simply impossible that this girl did such an atrocity the police in thornwood , a central westchester hamlet in the town of mount pleasant , say that miss riner was home alone with the baby of denise and william fischer when she deliberately set three fires in separate bedrooms the fire damaged the ground floor of the splitlevel house and badly burned the infant , kristie investigators said miss riner had used flammable liquids and had poured some on the baby the child s official cause of death was smoke inhalation 3 other fires confirmed we 're prepared to show that she did it , paul j oliva , the mount pleasant police chief , said today but miss riner s lawyer , laura a brevetti , said i do n't think it s as open and shut as one would think the cops do n't know what happened and she does n't know what happened there are alternative theories if this is , in fact , arson to the one that she is the perpetrator the police here confirmed today that at least three other suspicious fires have occurred this fall in the fischers' neighborhood , all of them before miss riner arrived the police said that the other fires in a barn , in a house and in a car were being investigated as possibly cases of arson all occurred in late september within a mile of the fischer home in thornwood miss riner did not begin working for the fischers until nov 1 the police were studying whether these fires and the one on monday were connected we have n't ignored that possibility , chief oliva said a hearing in the mount pleasant town court on friday morning will determine whether the case , as expected , goes before a grand jury only after an indictment would the question of bail for miss riner be discussed we 're doing everything we can to make sure she does get bail and is released , her lawyer , ms brevetti , said the nonprofit cultural exchange agency that provided the fischers with miss riner , e f au pair in cambridge , mass , is paying ms brevetti s legal fees she is a partner in a manhattan law firm , morrison , cohen , singer weinstein au pairs are usually young european women who live with a family while caring for children in the united states they are often visiting on oneyear cultural exchange visas ms brevetti was formerly the chief of the justice department s organizedcrime strike force in new york she has also worked in the brooklyn district attorney s office as an assistant prosecutor miss riner s parents , kurt and marlies riner , have arrived here from switzerland and have checked into a hotel not far from the fischers' house and the westchester county jail where their daughter is imprisoned repeated calls were made to the hotel today , but the riners could not be reached for comment an only daughter blick , the swiss newspaper , described mr riner as a regional chief of civil defense and mrs riner as a parttime worker in the office of an autorepair shop miss riner is their only daughter until going to the united states , she lived with her parents in their thirdfloor appartment in wettingen , a town in northern switzerland on the limmat river e f au pair said miss riner had been a baby sitter for a family for three years , had worked in the pediatric unit of a swiss hospital and had graduated from a twoyear college ms thoma , the swiss school official , was quoted as saying that miss riner had been near the top of her class parents continued to come forward today with complaints about e f au pair the agency has said that job candidates go through an eighthour screening process and that they are given little financial support once they arrive dr ruth striegelmoore , who is an assistant professor of psychology at wesleyan university and who lives in cheshire , conn , was one such parent in the contract , she said , you are told that the family gets called on a regular basis by the regional coordinator the au pair herself is supposed to have regular meetings with her local counselor , who should get together all the girls in the area for social support none of that happened , professor striegelmoore said the neighborhood around the fischer home here seems to be a study in suburban isolation virtually none of the halfdozen or so immediate neighbors knew the fischers personally , even though mr fischer , who owns an autorepair shop , has lived there for many years only one resident reported ever having seen miss riner since she arrived the fischers have told the police that they were pleased with miss riner s job performance and that they had detected nothing strange about her behavior
seattle , may 3 just two weeks and eight games after he became the yankees' everyday third baseman , mike blowers was back on the bench tonight so who s turn is it now \? try jim leyritz although there was n't supposed to be a rotation system at third anymore , yankee manager stump merrill picked leyritz to start tonight in the first of four games against the seattle mariners at the kingdome the decision left blowers wondering just how much of a chance he had really been given it s hard to figure after a spring of indecision , and then two more weeks of the same when the season began , merrill finally established blowers as his regular third baseman but now , after giving blowers only a brief opportunity , he apparently has changed his mind but if it had seemed like a fulltime switch , merrill said today that it really was n't or was it \? not necessarily , the manager replied when asked if blowers was out for good he s got a couple of problems he s not feeling well , and he s got a little shoulder tenderness so we 'll give leyritz an opportunity for a day or so translation leyritz can keep the job if he produces offensively if he does n't , blowers can expect his job back the reason for the change is simple since he became a starter , blowers is hitting just 196 \( 5 for 26 \) with no multihit games and no runs batted in but none of the team s third basemen have offered help blowers \( 176 \) , leyritz \( 077 going into tonight s game \) and randy velarde \( 133 \) yanks beat mariners while the yankees were sorting out third basemen , they were also putting an end to their fourgame losing streak , beating the seattle mariners , 50 , behindscott sanderson s fourth career threehitter so far , sanderson has been two different pitchers this season in his season debut april 10 at detroit , he took a nohitter into the ninth inning and won , 40 but in his next three starts , he surrendered 18 hits and 15 earned runs in 13 1 3 innings , going 01 tonight , sanderson retired the first 11 batters of the game before giving up a twoout single to ken griffey jr in the fourth inning he then set down the next seven until the elder griffey hit a single past second baseman steve sax to open the seventh but shorstop alvaro espinoza , after taking the relay from jesse barfield in right , fired quickly to don mattingly , who tagged out griffey as he was walking nonchalantly back to first sanderson \( 21 \) was aided by hensley meulens , who hit his first home run of the season , a tworun shot in the second , and by matt nokes , who drove in two with a thirdinning double blowers confused blowers , who resides in nearby tacoma , seemed as confused as anyone after hearing of the lineup change he said that he has had flulike symptoms for a while now , and his sore right shoulder , which he hurt tuesday night in oakland , was not a problem i do n't know what to think , he said i'm disappointed because it s happening here in seattle i'm home , and i always hit well in the kingdome i think i deserve some type of look , but i do n't really know what the situation is leyritz , meanwhile , has grown agitated over a lack of playing time , and he conveyed his feelings to his agent , david lihn , who said he had spoken with general manager gene michael leyritz said he would seek a trade if he was n't used more i want to be in there at least five or six times a week , not so much because of my talent but because of what i bring to the team , leyritz said i think this team needs my enthusiasm and my leadership leyritz s remarks , however , have not gone over well when he heard them today , merrill smiled and said , i guess when you 're a 12year veteran you can say those things merrill has been searching for answers at third all season he suggested today that the switchhitting torey lovullo , who was sent to class aaa columbus after an 0for11 start , could be back soon leyritz , who is 27 years old , came up for the first time last june , after merrill was named manager but his selfconfident attitude has irritated some teammates , who believe that leyritz does not have enough experience to warrant his complaints one player even suggested that leyritz would benefit greatly from a return trip to the minors some guys have told me that i 've only been here four months and that i should n't be saying anything , leyritz said but i'm trying to help the team win what s the difference between me and a guy with 12 years in \? i would n't be here if i did n't have the ability all i'm asking for is a chance to show that i can do it
moscow , may 27 the nationalist leader of soviet georgia won an overwhelming victory in the republic s first direct presidential election on sunday , according to results announced today the victory of the georgian leader , zviad gamsakhurdia , was largely anticipated , in part because he has gained popularity with his nationalist and antisoviet stance , and in part because none of the rival candidates were regarded as viable alternatives election officials reported that mr gamsakhurdia , a former political prisoner who was already the effective leader of georgia as president of its proseparatist legislature , received 87 percent of the votes cast his closest rival , valerian advadze , won only 6 percent , and no other candidate cleared 2 percent the victory was certain to strengthen mr gamsakhurdia s demands for rapid independence from moscow the 52yearold georgian leader has been among the staunchest of nationalist leaders from the soviet republics who have rebuffed president mikhail s gorbachev in his efforts to forge a new union treaty assembly of secessionists the georgian election coincided with the creation in kishinev , the capital of moldavia , of an assembly of national fronts from the six republics that have declared their intention to secede from the soviet union besides georgia and moldavia , they are armenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania participants said the goal of the assembly would be to coordinate the six republics' political and economic steps leaders of the nine other soviet republics the slavic and central asian republics met with mr gorbachev in april and agreed to work toward a new union with a new constitution they agreed to allow other republics to leave the union , but with the consequence that they be excluded from any special economic treatment tension flared again in the baltic republics over the last week when maverick black berets , special police forces under the interior ministry , sacked and burned several border posts on the lithuanianlatvian and lithuanianbyelorussian borders the baltic republics set up border checkpoints over the last year to control the flow of consumer goods from the republics to opponents of baltic independence , these border posts represent further unconstitutional actions by the republican governments moscow is reticent the rigabased black berets have several times gone on rampages , notably on jan 20 , when they assaulted a latvian government building , killing at least four the kremlin has denied ordering the actions , but it has also stopped short of condemning the maverick units baltic leaders issued strong protests to moscow mr gamsakhurdia s weekend election victory was expected to further consolidate his grip on his mountainous republic of 55 million and his stern treatment of minority groups , some of whom have been as militant in their resistance to the georgians as the georgians have been to the soviet authorities the ossetian minority has been waging an especially bloody struggle against georgian rule in the autonomous region of south ossetia , which mr gamsakhurdia declared a part of georgia last year polling places remained closed in south ossetia mr gamsakhurdia , son of a famous georgian writer and himself a former dissident , is the leader of a coalition that swept to power in legislative elections last october authoritarian steps since then , he has enacted measures that have led many critics to warn of an incipient dictatorship these have included curbs on the press and the appointment of prefects to run local governments during the election campaign , mr gamsakhurdia repeatedly accused his opponents of serving moscow and being kgb agents when mr advadze hired four russian bodyguards , they were arrested by georgian security forces mr gamsakhurdia s victory was celebrated by a march of his 3 , 000strong national guard , formed of young georgians who have refused soviet military service the georgian election is to be followed on june 12 by direct election of a president in the giant russian republic the frontrunner is boris n yeltsin , who like mr gamsakhurdia hopes to acquire a direct popular mandate in his disputes with moscow map of soviet georgia
five years ago samuel billups , principal of walbrook high school in baltimore , took a hard look at his school and winced test scores were low and students , in his words , came out not really prepared for anything so he created a small school within his high school , with much more teacher attention to students and a strippeddown curriculum now those students' test scores , grades , attendance and motivation are soaring the total price tag 125 , 000 over four years to retrain and inspire teachers , plus a little more for new books walbrook high s experience goes to the heart of a central issue facing american education today is money the key to improving schools \? the answer continues to polarize those who would revamp american education saying dollar bills do n't educate students , president bush did not offer many when he outlined his strategy two weeks ago for fixing american schools without changes in the way schools work , his advisers argue , more money will accomplish little advice for budgets clearly , money alone is no panacea spending on education has steadily risen over the last decade scores have not many successful private and parochial schools pay teachers less and spend less on students than public schools swollen public school bureaucracies absorb money before it reaches the classroom but it is also evident that there are changes that money can buy many educators and politicians say mr bush should have sought much more money to fight the poverty and family disintegration that overwhelm many schools , to help prepare poorer students for school and keep them on track once they get there , and to reduce the gap between rich and poor schools those like mr billups who have actually saved failing schools offer this perspective spend money to retrain teachers , reduce class size and buy new technology save money by reducing educational bureaucracy and eliminating , if economy demands it , electives and extracurricular activities i like to say this about school improvement , mr billups said design the cadillac , although you end up buying the ford critics of american schools from president bush down like to cite a damning statistic spending on education increased by 33 percent after inflation in the 1980 s , without any marked improvement in american schools in general the educators would have you believe that the only thing that really makes a difference is money , said marc s tucker , president of the national center on education and the economy , a research institute that advocates overhauling schools there s an increasing crowd of people out there who say , 'wait a minute we have been putting out more and more money and we do n't see a change in the results' and they 're right but many educators argue , and mr tucker agrees , that such statistics do not account for the fact that today many more students are coming to school poorer , worseprepared and speaking less english than in the past few decades immigration rates soared nationwide in the 1980 s , as did poverty rates take the rochester school district the percentage of students who arrive in kindergarten testing well below average has leaped to 53 percent , from 23 percent , in 20 years , district statistics show the number of students speaking limited english doubled from 1986 to 1990 , and the number of poor children , those who qualified for free or reducedprice lunches , tripled in the 1980 s looking for links debates on whether money helps tend to get bogged down because of the competing statistics and studies if perpupil expenditures are measured , the united states is among the top spenders on education internationally yet it falls near the bottom if the studies measure education spending by a percentage of national income the same arguments swirl around research studies that try to trace the connection between spending and student performance in one widely cited paper , eric a hanushek of the university of rochester reviewed 187 studies and found no consistent statistical links between teacher salaries , smaller classes and highscoring students educators reply that most studies do not factor in teachers' abilities and attitudes instead , they point to a study of 900 texas school districts serving two million children by ronald f ferguson of john f kennedy school of government at harvard university mr ferguson factored in teacher quality , measured by how well teachers scored on required state tests he found that higher teacher salaries attracted betterqualified teachers , who in turn produced students who scored higher in tests but , albert shanker , president of the american federation of teachers , said , that means good teachers can produce dramatic results with smaller classes , while a teacher who simply uses the same methods for a small class as a large one will not as director of the coalition of essential schools , a network of about 150 schools that aim to raise intellectual standards through innovative teaching , theodore r sizer has watched schools make broad improvements , and he , too , said that regardless of how much was spent none of that is worth a hill of beans unless teachers think differently the budgets fat public schools , lean church ones the real question , even the severest critics of current education spending agree , is not whether money makes any difference , but where and how well it is being spent
new yorkers are not known for their reticence ask them for their views on how local government could do a better job of reducing its budget deficit and they respond vehemently , cynically , and sometimes , with solutions the new york times asked 30 citizens , some prominent , others not , to reflect on the imminent prospect of service cuts and tax increases none relished the idea of paying more for less but many also spoke of a sense of civic despair that went beyond current fiscal straits , a collective fear that the stark measures ahead do not cut to the heart of problems they see every day , situations that often defy common sense if there was one theme , it was that the city s faltering economy requires more than mere tinkering with the status quo robert hayes , an advocate for the homeless , called for a local public works project mirroring the social programs of the great depression housing , or the lack of it , was a widely shared concern so was education but like americans everywhere , new yorkers consider government part of the problem , not of the solution few disagreed with deidre sullivan , a writer whose word associations with state and city government were annoyance , bloat , waste and sluggishness or with edward w hayes , the former bronx assistant district attorney who was the inspiration for a character in tom wolfe s bonfire of the vanities he suggested , you could shoot every tenth bureacrat as a warning to the others former officials , understandably , offered less radical proposals ralph j lamberti , the former staten island borough president , favored introducing sports betting in otb parlors to raise revenues and avoid another tax increase we constantly read that millions and millions of dollars are bet on the super bowl , mr lamberti said instead of having the local bookies get all the money , we could have the revenue and susan brownmiller , the author , voiced a view shared by just about all but the happy few tax the filthy rich these are some of the comments david r jones president of the community service society a large part of the city s crisis can be attributed to failure at the state level the governor s proposed budget would slash aid to urban localities losses to new york city would add 600 million to the city s deficit , already approaching 2 billion this is an abdication of responsibility by state leadership at a time when the city cannot be forced to take any further measures in budget cutting i favor cutting expenditures but also increasing revenue , including taxes we need to revisit taxation possibilities , such as a surcharge on incomes over 100 , 000 i'm supportive of a new york city council suggestion that we revisit a possible commuter surcharge we need to revisit areas of waste we all know about costs of school custodial services are notorious , and so is the use of vehicles by city employees we should also look at some giveaways , such as tax credits and realestate tax abatements over the last decade aimed at attracting business , which paid no dividends as promised to city taxpayers paul gorman vice president at the cathedral of st john the divine what government should do is stop treating people like passive recipients and start offering support for courage and creativitynew york is an urban wilderness that has to be settled instead of throwing homesteaders out of abandoned buildings and maybe squeezing them into a shelter , the city ought to give them an award for their initiative and the resources to finish the job barbara ann teer founder and head of the national black theater the economy of new york city is based on culture and the arts the arts have to be subsidized they can do this through a government agency , or entrepreneurly or by expanding corporate funding long range , we 're talking about educating children so they will grow up to be supportive of the arts and buy tickets gordon j davis former new york city parks commissioner immediate needs on budget and tax strategy should be coordinated at the highest levels of the state and city to avoid working at cross purposes a longterm suggestion is the creation of a regional development bank , on the model of the world bank , that would take up the slack in jobs by rebuilding airports , highways , bridges , parks in new york beth anderson lifesciences teacher i hear a lot of things about hiring a lot of police if you do that , more money has to go to them then you will be arresting more people and putting more people in jail , and it does n't seem to me that that is an investment new york city or new york state should be making we need to teach kids not to get involved in things that police will later have to stop we need to look at finding ways to have people help each other more , for example putting homeless people into the available empty apartments that exist in the city we need to find ways to lower rents so people can afford to live in the newer empty buildings julia rivera executive director of aspira of new york , which promotes education and leadership for hispanic youth
sandy alderson can be thankful , in a way , that he will be able to get an early start on his offseason plans this year the king is dead , long live the king and now alderson s trick will be to resurrect the king and dress him up in his elegant clothes again while reducing the cost of clothing him for the first time in four years , the oakland athletics will not play in the world series the minnesota twins , by moving to the brink of the american league west championship , have ended the longest world series run since the yankees reached it in 19767778 the athletics did not win their fourth consecutive division title and league pennant for a combination of reasons , including the collapse of their strong pitching staff , particularly the failure of bob welch and dave stewart the predictably lethargic play of rickey henderson , last year s most valuable player injuries to carney lansford and walt weiss that decimated the left side of the infield , and the offensive malnutrition of mark mcgwire now alderson , the general manager , faces the task of making moves that will put the athletics back on top of the division the way he sees it , though , the moves he has to consider most seriously have to do with the team s record 37 million payroll and how to slash it while not undermining oakland s pennant chances in 1992 in terms of potential , i do n't think we have to do too much , alderson said but we 're going to lose 5 or 6 million this year , so from an economic standpoint we 're going to have to take a look at where we are we want to keep the team together because there s a lot of upside potential but we ca n't lose 5 or 6 million next year how can he hope to reduce the payroll \? you first look at expiring contracts , alderson said can you afford to do without these players \? we do n't have a lot of contracts expiring , nothing that would take 5 or 6 million worth out of a 37 million payroll we ca n't look for the total answer there we could look at the possibility of trades and see what we have in our farm system getting our financial picture back in focus probably is not a oneyear project it 'll probably take a couple of years the athletics have six players who can be free agents \( ron darling , brook jacoby , lansford , mike gallego , ernest riles and curt young \) and two others \( mike moore and vance law \) whom they must offer salary arbitration or lose as free agents their 1991 salaries totaled 859 million moore and darling , the highest paid among the group , make up twofifths of the starting pitching rotation , with moore clearly being the team s best starter this season the athletics , however , have a batch of rookies who gained major league experience this season one could replace darling another could replace young in the bullpen lansford would be returning from a seasonlong recuperation , and riles and law are reserve infielders at best , easily replaced by younger , less expensive players gallego is the starting second baseman , and jacoby could be the starting third baseman if alderson does n't trade for one the general manager does n't figure to sign any multimilliondollar free agents he could also trade mcgwire , though his 200 batting average has reduced his value for the moment the athletics could keep mcgwire and slash his 285 million salary the maxmimum 20 percent , a savings of 570 , 000 they ca n't do anything about next year s salaries for welch \( 345 million \) and stewart \( 35 million \) , who have combined for a 2322 record after last year s 4917 , and they wo n't do anything about henderson s salary \( 325 million this year and the next two years \) , despite his unhappiness with it that produced his mediocre performance i think the contract and the state of mind that left him in at the outset of the season was a contributing factor , alderson said but i also think the fact that the team did n't play well affected his play rickey can be a great player , but i do n't think rickey s going to take a lousy team and make it good he s the kind of guy who takes a good team and makes it great , and we were n't good this year alderson said he did n't think henderson s contract would be a problem next year i think this season will be motivation enough for guys next year , even rickey , he said i think he will look back on this season and not find it to his liking that view might be classified under wishful thinking , along with alderson s hope that he can slash the payroll and win nevertheless how to succeed without hitting when willie mcgee was traded by st louis to oakland on aug 29 last season , he left behind a 335 batting average and enough plate appearances to qualify for the national league batting title lenny dykstra , with a 340 average , led the league at the time mcgee was traded , but he lost 15 points the rest of the season and dave magadan slipped from 333 to 328 eddie murray got hot and raised his average 18 points , but he finished at 330 mcgee , without swinging the bat in the league in the last five weeks , won the title
paris , june 6 it was one bizarre production on the heels of another as two instances of unintentional selfdestruction were played out in a very public scenario in the women s semifinals at the rainsplattered french open this afternoon if i ever felt before the match that i was going to play this badly , i 'd never go out there , said steffi graf , who , along with gabriela sabatini , came out on the embarrassing end of two unanticipated mismatches first , defending champion monica seles advanced to her second consecutive final here by administering a 64 , 61 thrashing to sabatini under a sprinkling sky this afternoon at roland garros stadium then , 1989 champion arantxa sanchez vicario wreaked even greater havoc on the game and composure of graf , a twotime champion here , eliminating her by 60 , 62 it was the worst defeat of graf s professional career , and one for which she had no explanation other than an untimely absence of rapport with her tennis racquet seles holds the edge seles and sanchez vicario will meet saturday in the final they have met four times previously , with seles holding a 40 edge the most recent seles victory came on clay in straight sets in the semifinals at hamburg , germany , this spring in the men s semifinals friday , andre agassi will face boris becker and jim courier opposes michael stich if agassi and courier win , they will produce the first allamerican final since 1954 if becker and stich prevail they will produce the first allgerman final ever graf not only appeared disengaged during the match , but behaved similarly after it she seemed more bewildered and bemused than distressed by a match in which she committed 51 errors and managed to hold her serve only twice i could n't get a ball inside the court , said graf , whose only previous loss to the 19yearold spaniard in 11 meetings came on this same court in the 1989 final i lost a few games and my confidence went down everything i did did n't work , and i 'd never had that happen before i tried to keep the ball in play , it did n't work i tried to hit the ball , it did n't work graf s absolute disassociation from her surroundings was nowhere more evident than the moment late in the second set where , winding up for an overhead smash at netside with sanchez vicario far out of position , graf slammed the ball into the alley the loss prevented the 21yearold german , who had not lost a grand slam set by 60 since 1983 , from immediately recapturing the no 1 position held by seles and also extended her streak without a victory in grand slam events to five but by a quirk of the ratings computer , should sanchez vicario defeat seles in the final , graf will slip back into the top spot strange to be no 1' it s strange to be no 1 it s different to be no 1 , said seles , and if i keep winning my matches i 'll stay no 1 , but being no 1 is not a great excitement like when you win a grand slam i want both , but i do n't want all that pressure the sour weather caused two interruptions of the match , and after the second rain delay , which occurred with the players caught in a dead heat at 44 of the first set , sabatini appeared to forget to bring her tennis game back onto center court and lost seven quick games in succession sanchez vicario , who had promised an uninhibited game plan against graf and delivered it , packed her shots with topspin and aimed for the sidelines right from the first point of the match as invisible as sabatini was in the second set of her match , graf was even less of a factor in the opening set of hers , and a 43minute rain delay did not refresh her confidence although graf was a virtual nonpresence today , her father , peter , attracted interest in the stands when he scuffled with jim levee , an heir to the annenberg fortune who counts seles and sanchez vicario among the handful of female players he sponsors levee s association with the graf family ended on unfriendly terms several years ago levee , who was unhurt , contended that graf shoved him as both men went up a stadium aisle while sanchez vicario served for the first set graf said levee insulted his daughter levee said graf manhandled him , and levee later exchanged unpleasantries with pavel slozil , graf s coach , vowing to bring bodyguards to wimbledon for the sake of menacing graf i heard about it from my mother , said graf , but i have no idea what happened and i really do n't care match points none of the four men s semifinalists are averse to serving and volleying , and although andre agassi and jim courier prefer the baseline , both have taken pains to rely on more than their blunt groundstrokes it s not a power tournament , said boris becker , who has never advanced beyond the semifinal round there are always

san diego the day starts out simply enough for the 30 crewmen of japan s america s cup challenge team there is an hour of exercise running , swimming or working out on weight machines at the team s compound , a sprawling apartment complex close to where the boats are docked at mission bay then there is breakfast bowls of miso soup and seaweed , panfried fish , rice and green tea set a hearty

who form the sailing backbone of japan s first effort in history to win the america s cup few question the nippon s potential successes in the computerdriven aspects of boat design but finding experienced crewmen in japan s fledgling yachting community was like spotting a buoy in fogshrouded sagami bay near tokyo kaoru ogimi , vice commodore of japan s cup sponsor , the nippon ocean racing club , said recently in san diego that his team was forced to look outside japan for a crew the big question mark is , of course , the people , the software side , said ogimi the syndicate s answer was to hire chris dickson of new zealand , the topranked matchracing skipper in the world what we 've been doing around the clock with him in our own camp is trying to reach out and go beyond chris , said ogimi to make the best use of dickson s expertise , the nippon group in 1987 bought two former america s cup yachts to use as training vessels the boats happened to be the same 12meters , kz 3 and kz 5 , that dickson and his teammates sailed to a near victory four years ago in cup trial races in australia the purchase was designed to help japanese sailors prepare for even bigger boats the new 76 to 78foot international america s cup class yachts that will be sailed in the 1992 cup races here none of us have ever sailed in boats in any size approximating these , said ogimi of the 2 million racing craft the america s cup class boats are 10 feet longer than most 12meters , and onethird lighter they carry far more sail area , and are faster downwind by 6 or 7 knots even dickson , who has sailed on everything from a sevenfoot dinghy to an 80foot maxiboat , is impressed with the new class these boats portray power , he said , while standing on the deck of jpn 6 , the second of the syndicate s two identical new america s cup class yachts when you look up , you see a cloud of sail suddenly it feels like a tiny little boat with a huge amount of sail area a budget of six billion yen , about 40 million , has fueled the syndicate s extensive costs of research and development from a country rich in naval architecture through its commercial shipbuilding , japanese experts have turned their attention to sailboats at nippon s 45 , 000squarefoot compound on mission bay , a new sail loft is taking shape four trailers and 12 shipping containers a combination of 20 and

namba , his japanese team captain , had to teach many on the crew how to sail the first recruits answered newspaper advertisements placed by the syndicate the ads called for individuals at least 175

he was inspired to answer the crew ad by a video he had once seen of the 1983 cup races shiraishi , a professional diver , remembers being overwhelmed the first time he joined the nippon sailing team i did n't know the winch name , he said last week i did n't know anything someone told me to ease something , but i did n't know what ease meant others confess to falling overboard now and again , and embarrassment unbecoming to a seasoned yachtsman language was a barrier at first , and to some degree , still is there were reports that friction had developed on the boat during the early days because of communication problems dickson and namba insist that those days are gone bigboat sailing is very systematic , said namba at the docks last week once we have established the system , there are not many opportunities to express yourself any other way namba , who commented through an interpreter , speaks limited english but at crew meetings , he speaks in english the team returned two

considering that the lebanese cuisine is one of the most respected in the middle east , and that danbury has a large lebanese population , one might expect the city to have many lebanese restaurants with the appearance of roland s of lebanon , the number seems to have doubled to two roland s of lebanon is hardly prepossessing its dimly lighted , exceedingly modest storefront locale is as bare bones as a sitdown dining room can be just a handful of tables , seating at most 32 , with a counter area at the entrance where pizza can be ordered to take out inspection of the small menu is reassuring , though , with its lebanese dishes \( and with descriptions carefully listed below each one \) on the rear wall , a crayon board lists a special for each night of the week while pizza is available , the lebanese dishes are the restaurant s attraction you might begin with lentil soup , a hearty mixture of lentils and spinach in a broth sparked with lemon juice lemon is a constant , as in lebanese cooking in general , and you will encounter it in many of roland s dishes , including the three appetizers on the menu these were served with triangles of pita bread for dipping all three proved satisfactory , if not memorable hummus , an old favorite , was a pleasing chickpea puree , enlivened by lemon and garlic , garnished with a dribble of olive oil baba gannouj , with the eggplant homogenized and accented by tahini , had the requisite zing of lemon and garlic it , too , was tasty when scooped up with the bread tabbouleh , a lebanese standby , was served refrigerator cold even so , it was a refreshing blend of chopped tomatoes , parsley , onions , cracked wheat and lemon , but the customary tang of fresh mint proved elusive many entrees are vegetarian , like an agreeable vegetarian version of stuffed grape leaves \( with chickpeas , tomatoes , onions and parsley as the filling , seasoned with lemon and oil \) we really preferred the regular version with a good , smart lemon snap even though the ground meat used was beef instead of the more traditional lamb most of the entrees feature ground beef in one way or other , including a rather bland dish of cabbage stuffed with ground beef and rice two exceptions were samkeh harrah , a bestforgotten baked fish fillet with tahini , and chicken taouk , a grilled chicken breast that was skimpy and dried out , despite the pleasing zip of its lemon and garlic marinade and the pureed garlic served with the dish the standout entree by far was shawarma this consisted of shards of beef marinated in wine , vinegar and lemon , then broiled , mixed with chopped tomatoes , onions and spices and served in a pool of tahini the flavor was sharp and snappy with an order of rice pilaf fluffy , light and delicious , mixed with a tiny , noodlelike pasta called shaarieh it made the best main course of the evening another dish that fared reasonably well was kibbee , often called the lebanese \( and syrian \) national dish at roland s , the ground meat \( beef \) was mixed with crushed wheat and onions , baked crisp and served with a tahini sauce kafta , another national favorite , had respectable flavor , mixed with parsley and onions , but the ground beef was sinewy , and the dish did n't taste really fresh lack of freshness plagued a dish called macaroni a la crema , a layered pasta , beef , tomato and onion dish with bechamel sauce that resembled greek pastichio the problem was the pasta had an aged , leathery texture and taste several of the sweet baklavatype desserts were made on the premises the best

as is often the case these days , la colombe d'or , an engaging provencal restaurant on east 26th street , was cruising at the height of its success in 1990 only to have the chef leave for greener pastures wayne nish , who had propelled the restaurant to threestar velocity , departed to open his own place , called march , on east 58th street his toque was passed on to mark may , who had been the sous chef sometimes a restaurant goes through a long shakedown after such a jolt in the case of la colombe d'or , though , mr may grabbed the throttle with conviction on his current menu , several dishes from his predecessor s repertory are mingled with others that reflect his own style the main dining room , which is two steps below street level , is a bucolic lair with a wooden bar up front , terracotta floor , whitewashed brick walls and colorful fabricdraped banquettes a second dining room has a similar theme an upstairs room is available for private parties la colombe d'or is owned by the francophiles george and helen studley , who opened it in 1976 the current menu has plenty of dishes that evoke that herbperfumed countryside most typical are a sparkling ratatouille ringed with a julienne of carrots and a splendid combination of firm , bright fava beans , swiss chard , the roasting juices from chicken and duck , and heady truffle oil smoked skate , a special , is exceptionally good , too the quick hot smoking causes the flesh to compress , imparting a pleasing meaty texture the sweet and tart braised red cabbage and mustard greens make a fine foil salmon also benefits from the smoking process in this case , the fish is also quickly sauteed and served over mixed greens with roasted tomatoes one of the few disappointments among seafood was the lackluster salad of calamari rings with fava beans in a squidink vinaigrette when i am particularly hungry , the notion of tiny grilled quails hardly seems adequate but the rendition here is both substantial and savory the birds are stuffed with goat cheese , marinated in olive oil and rosemary , then grilled to medium rare and perched atop a delicious eggplant pancake another dish not to be missed is the thinskinned , mushroomfilled ravioli moistened with white truffle oil and garnished with threads of fried shallots it is always discouraging to see a striving kitchen undermined by slipshod service on all three recent visits , the dining room team made a trip downtown to the department of motor vehicles look speedy all meals dragged on excessively , the most extreme beginning at 7 45 pm and ending at 11 30 moreover , most of our waiters could not remember who got which dish , nor could they answer questions about how the entrees were prepared the lack of professionalism even extended to attire one

with fantasies of what can be sampled on the waterfront in marseilles as it turned out , this version could probably be found in milwaukee the broth had none of that upthenostrils headiness , nor any depth of flavor a fellow diner did much better with a special of moist swordfish with a supporting cast of crunchy fried artichokes , tomato and mixed greens with drizzles of tomato butter and olive

perfect , the coating this time aromatic of herbs and the meat dark pink a portion of light gnocchi in warm vinaigrette made with juices from roasted chicken was an unusual but harmonious companion crackling boneless grilled chicken was delicious in a light redwine sauce with rosemary and provencal olives and a haystack of julienned summer vegetables one dessert from the old days is aggressively

washington , sept 19 the senate intelligence committee produced new evidence today suggesting that robert m gates , nominated to be director of central intelligence , was warned earlier , more frequently and in more detail than he has acknowledged about key aspects of the irancontra affair the evidence , in written statements and new testimony , suggested that mr gates may have been advised before august 1986 that profits from arms sales to iran might have been diverted to nicaraguan rebels until today , august 1986 was the earliest date for which evidence of such a warning to him existed the evidence also included a fresh recounting of crucial meetings with mr gates in october and november 1986 , as the scandal was unraveling , which suggested that central intelligence agency experts had reviewed the prospect of a diversion with mr gates in some detail mr gates at the time was deputy director of central intelligence in his own testimony , mr gates , who is now deputy national security adviser , has characterized those discussions as worrisome , but extraordinarily flimsy excerpts from the depositions and new testimony are on pages a18 and a19 argument further strained the additional evidence further strained mr gates s argument that he had no reason to suspect that government money was being used to supply the contras with military equipment at a time it had been forbidden by congress , with oliver l north , the white house aide , directing the effort , and that he made an honest if inadequate effort to check rumors of wrongdoing but in a day filled with new information about the fiveyearold scandal , none of the new evidence appeared to directly and decisively contradict mr gates s own long testimony on the affair it is uncertain whether the new evidence swayed any members of the intelligence panel , who are debating whether to support his nomination to become director of central intelligence at the moment , the prospects for his confirmation appear good , with only a handful of democratic members of the committee openly opposed and eager to pursue the new information that has been obtained but the reading of part of a 1984 memorandum at today s hearing , in which mr gates proposed an extensive american military campaign to overthrow the nicaraguan government , led mr gates s predecessor as deputy director for intelligence , john mcmahon , to express surprise and say i do n't know what prompted bob to do that testimony is ambiguous the main witness at today s hearing , alan d fiers jr , head of the agency s latin american operations at the time of the scandal , offered testimony that could be read to either favor or damage mr gates s case mr fiers told the committee that he had never discussed the diversion of profits to the contras , with mr gates but he said that he had described some aspects of the military resupply operation for the contras with mr gates in a series of 1986 meetings bob gates understood the universe , understood the structure , understood that the operation was run out of the white house , that ollie north was the quarterback , he said i had no reason to think he had great detail , but i do think there was a baseline knowledge there mr fiers said that many government officials had a notion that mr north was somehow involved in arming the contras , and that a similar knowledge by mr gates would neither be surprising nor pejorative arming the contras in 1987 , mr gates told congressional investigators that he had not known that mr north was arming the contras , but only that he was holding the hand of the resistance leaders , offering them political advice and staying in touch with them mr fiers was the focus of television and photographers' cameras today , but much of the substance of the session came from a sheaf of written statements about the irancontra affair by current and former cia officials oddly , the statements most damaging to mr gates s case were submitted by two officials who otherwise praised his abilities and his behavior when the scandal was unfolding in the months of october and november 1986 one , charles e allen , was the cia s chief counterterrorism analyst who was involved daily in the armsforhostages deals the other , david doherty , was the cia s general counsel at the time the scandal became public in october 1986 mr allen said that in august 1986 he told richard kerr now the cia s acting director , then its chief analyst that he believed that the white house s national security council , where mr north worked , was mixing the iranian project with white house initiatives in central america mr kerr has testified that he told mr gates about this conversation with mr allen in late august mr gates has testified that he does not remember the conversation with mr kerr but according to an internal cia memorandum cited in a deposition of mr kerr by senator warren b rudman , a new hampshire republican , mr kerr told agency officials that mr gates had responded to his advisory by stating that he had already been made aware that rumors were circulating about a diversion of iran arms profits to the contras such a response could indicate that mr gates had been aware of the diversion earlier than august mr kerr said in the deposition that he could no longer remember whether mr gates made that precise response another question is whether mr gates was informed in any great detail about the diversion , either in august or later in his statement today , mr allen said that in his conversation with mr kerr , he told mr kerr at length about his suspicions that the arms profits were going to the contras

bill elliott , who came as close to dominating stockcar racing as is possible , is in a career sense about to restart from the middle of the pack as elliott prepares to compete in a 500mile race today in dover , del \( tnn , noon \) , he is considering a number of choices for next year , including driving for another team his familyrun team , which includes his brothers ernie and dan and is based in dawsonville , ga , is losing its main sponsor after this season and has undergone other turmoil in the last year mike beam , brought in as crew chief on nov 30 , 1989 , left for junior johnson s twocar team this season dan elliott , who used to be one of the tire changers in a crack pit crew , decided to stay home on race weekends to spend more time with his family and in the seasonending race last november in atlanta , mike rich , a member of elliott s crew , was killed when he was hit by another car during a pit stop caught in the grind whenever that many things happen within a racing team , elliott said last week , it s like gears in a transmission things do n't start meshing just right the idea of bill elliott s driving for anyone but his family s team would have seemed unthinkable in 1985 , when he won a record 11 superspeedway events on the winston cup tour and 2 , 433 , 187 , also a singleseason mark in 1988 , he followed that up with his first winston cup title but the problems began soon after practicing for the seasonopening daytona 500 in 1989 , elliott crashed and broke an arm although he came back that year to win three races , the season was essentially shot inconsistency in shop when beam came on to run things in 1990 , there was a natural period of adjustment elliott closed well last season to finish fourth in the final point standing , but was never a real title contender it s hard to maintain consistency on the race track when you 're inconsistent in the shop , he said now , the strongest rumor has elliott driving the junior johnson car that geoff bodine will vacate after this season elliott , speaking over the telephone last week , would n't say anything about that i really have n't made up a good decision of what i'm going to do yet , he said i 've got several options in the works , none i can really discuss at the moment whether he can remain with his brothers next season depends on finding a new sponsor , he said
college park , md the world may soon be able to use genetic engineering or special hormones to make fish grow to market size faster and to increase world food supplies , says a university of maryland marine biologist who is working to make it happen thomas chen , a biologist and professor in the biological sciences department at the university of marylandbaltimore county , says he already has rainbow trout and oysters growing at least 20 percent faster and sometimes as much as 50 percent faster than normal , depending on the method used dr chen said his project was one of several in which researchers are concentrating on fish , rather than cattle , partly because fish could be a readily available , economical food source for much of the world , and partly to reduce the united states' dependence on fish imports the united states trade deficit for fish products was about 4 billion in 1989 , he said the idea to make fish grow faster has been around for a long time , said dr chen , who has been experimenting at the center for marine biotechnology at baltimore community college , a twoyear college in the university of maryland system from a scientific standpoint , dr chen said , fish represent a good model system because there are several different species , from simple to highly evolved a pragmatic reason is the ongoing situation with population increases and awareness of nutrition fish show a great potential to feed people a gene for growth dr chen and two collaborators at other universities are experimenting with two different processes the first approach relies on a growth hormone cloned from rainbow trout fish are dipped in water that has the hormone dissolved in it for a minute and a half once weekly for four weeks the second approach involves altering the genetic makeup of a fish by transferring a gene for growth into the fish , which is passed on to subsequent generations unlike humans , fish continue to grow throughout their lives , but dr chen said he and his eight graduatestudent assistants are not interested in creating bigger fish they simply want fish to reach market size faster , thus getting more fish to market in a shorter time and saving fish farmers money dr chen has been working on fish growth since 1982 , starting at mcmaster college in hamilton , ontario he came to maryland in 1986 , when he began his collaboration with dennis powers at stanford university and rex dunham at auburn university the project is underwritten by grants from the national science foundation , the federal government and state grants from the department of natural resources and the maryland university sea grant need further testing the effects of both experimental processes need further testing , dr chen said he also said that he and his colleagues must research methods for producing large quantities of the growth hormone economically before they can make it available commercially the timetable will depend on the project s finances , dr chen said dr chen says rainbow trout and oysters have responded to both methods , growing 20 to 50 percent faster with the dipping process and 20 to 40 percent faster with the gene transfers but he said the researchers needed to determine which nutrients , and in what amounts , to feed to the fish so that they do not grow abnormally a trout usually takes two years to get to market size , which is about a pound to a pound and a half , dr chen said , adding that with the application of the hormones or using the genetransfer technique , the fish should reach market size in a year and a few months 'we only use a small dose' dr chen said he could not foresee any negative effects of the techniques on fish , humans or the environment we have done experiments with higher doses of hormones , and they wo n't make the fish grow faster , so we only use a small dose , he said and he said , because the hormone is a protein , the hormone will be degraded in the fish , unlike the growth hormone , estrogen , that was once used to increase growth in beef cattle , but was found to leave residues he noted , too , that we are not letting the fish run free we harvest every single one none are released into the environment to endanger the natural food chain with continued research , dr chen said he hoped that the hormone would be available for government approval in two to four years and the gene transfer in five to eight years the work we are doing is especially important for developing countries , said yan lin tang , a graduate student in biotechnology from china , who has been working on the project for three years while attending the college park campus after working on the gene , we can watch the process of evolution , and we can use this gene and this hormone to study

los angeles , sept 21 baseball s grandest rivalries barely flicker now somewhere , they vanished the dodgers and the giants , whose rivalry included arguably the sport s greatest moment bobby thomson s pennantwinning home run in 1951 once wore their disdain for each other like a prideful badge but they seem to have lost it same with the yankees and the red sox gone now , you see guys standing at the batting cages with their arms around each other , said roger craig , the former brooklyn and los angeles dodger pitcher who now manages san francisco in the old days , you would n't even speak to those guys and if you had to fight them , you 'd fight them but the sport s evolution , in a sweeping change that seemed to cover the distance between the polo grounds and candlestick park left the rivalry behind except in the stands , where it s as if time has stood still perhaps that s why the dodgers must surely view the final two weeks of the 1991 season as an uncertain venture , even though on sunday they are finishing their last series with the atlanta braves , the team they are battling for the division title of the dodgers' 11 remaining regularseason games , 6 are with the giants , and the last 3 of those are at cold , blustery candlestick park did someone say rivalry \? the giants' fans believe it still exists if i were a dodger player , said onetime giant joe morgan , i would not be looking forward to going up there , because there is a rivalry as far as the fans are concerned i 'd rather have it locked up by then this is how important those games have become will clark , the giants' first baseman , has said he will rest his sore right knee to save himself for the dodgers the braves , the team battling the dodgers for the national league west title , have offered to ship in 50 , 000 foamrubber tomahawks for the giants to hand out to their fans the giants are thinking about it when the giants were beating the braves last week at candlestick , the night s loudest ovation came when the scoreboard flashed the dodgers' score naturally , they were losing you know what people say to me now \? craig said they say , 'all i ask is that you beat the dodgers' none of this , however , has rubbed off on the players , who are no longer tied to one team as in the past to them , the rivalries that once existed no longer have meaning there s nobody around who could create a rivalry , said don drysdale , the hall of fame pitcher who is arguably the most hated dodger of them all the only true allegiance they have is to the treasurer of the ball club meet the spoilers today s giants harbor no outward animosity for the dodgers they simply view themselves as spoilers my only reason for wanting to beat them is to knock them out of the race , said outfielder kevin bass , who was born and reared in redwood city , south of san francisco if we ca n't win the division , our role is to keep them from winning it it s nothing personal clark said , having the kind of season we 've had , we just want to win but they are not immune to the fervor that drives the fans it was real obvious to me , ever since i was a rookie in 1986 , clark recalled the other day the dodgers came in , and there were fights in the stands people were throwing apples and oranges and bottles at kirk gibson don sutton , a former dodger , remembered making the long walk from the dugout to the visitors' clubhouse at candlestick once with his son daron by his side suddenly , a can of beer flew from the stands , missing daron by inches i think , by and large , a number of the fans did n't just want to beat you , said sutton , now a broadcaster for the braves they genuinely wished you harm but it was always a great place to want to beat them because you had to listen to all their taunts and barbs i would n't dignify those people by calling them blue collar a lot of them carried it too far no greater moment exists for giants fans than the miracle of coogan s bluff bobby thomson s home run against the dodgers in the third playoff game 40 years ago , which sent the giants into the world series but to some , joe morgan s homer in 1982 is a distant second 'the fans erupted' morgan , then on the downside of his brilliant career , homered off dodger pitcher terry forster at candlestick on the final day of the season to beat los angeles and prevent it from tying the braves who had lost earlier in the day at san diego for first place a playoff game would have been played in los angeles the next day the fans erupted , morgan said in recollection it was like we won the world series but i did n't hate the dodgers i just felt they were kind of hollywood dodger fans , who treat the giants as more of a nuisance than a rival , will never forget the 1965 game in which san francisco pitcher juan marichal struck los angeles catcher john roseboro on the head with a bat , setting off a brawl that angered fans from both cities i was in right field at the time , said ron fairly , who had been knocked down by a marichal pitch the previous inning sandy koufax threw a pitch that was a ball , and i looked down the next thing i heard was a roar from the stands , and when i looked up , guys were all piled up the rivalry \? that incident , fairly said , kept everything in line he also said this of the giants i did n't like them i loved to beat them , because if we did , it usually meant we had a chance to finish higher in the standings but i think a lot of it was a jealousy they had with la that stemmed from the fact we won a lot detecting the arrogance some of that exists everywhere when i was a player , there was always a rivalry with the good teams , said dusty baker , now the giants' hitting coach , who spent parts of his 15year career with the dodgers , the braves , the giants and the oakland a s nobody liked the dodgers i always said that if you lined up 10 kids in front of me , i could pick the one who was in the dodger organization he had the clean haircut , the good body and the arrogance nobody liked them because of that , and because of those pearlwhite uniforms as rivalries go , the dodgergiant games sometimes brought out the ugliest in everyone , from players to fans but on the field , it s virtually gone now you look down there , and it s like a high school reunion , drysdale said but it was n't that way in the past we 'd go to the polo grounds , and you knew you were in for a tough time the players still remembered that when we came out to the coast but it s gone by the wayside photos bobby thomson winning the pennant for the new york giants in 1951 \( associated press \) \( pg 1 \) giants' juan marichal swinging bat at dodgers' john roseboro in 1965 as sandy koufax tries to intervene \( associated press \) \( pg 7 \)
washington , march 18 republicans paraded their latest major convert , gov buddy roemer of louisiana , around the nation s capital today , touting him as a new standardbearer in a politically realigning south mr roemer was greeted with all the perquisites of a party in power a meeting in the oval office with president bush , a reception with top administration officials and a news conference in the shadow of the white house the governor , who announced last week that he was joining the republican party , said , i do not come to trash the democrats but he proceeded to describe the republicans as the party open to new ideas and said he had tried for years to bring economic sanity to the democrats republicans tried to cast mr roemer as the most visible of a wave of defections in recent years , saying that 237 democratic officeholders have switched parties since mr bush took office i think it sends a message that s been sent for quite a while about which party better represents mainstream america , especially the mainstream in the south , said b jay cooper , director of communications for the republican national committee clayton k yeutter , the republican national chairman , described mr roemer as an additional beachhead in the region but ronald h brown , chairman of the democratic national committee , scoffed at the claims and professed to be unperturbed by a day that seemed choreographed to torment the democrats the fact is there are more democratic elected officials at every level now than there were in 1980 and 1988 more governors , more senators , more house members , and more mayors , said mr brown so while they continue to talk about republican realignment , there s just no evidence of that the democratic chairman asserted that mr roemer s switch had less to do with party philosophy than simple ambition , an attempt to buttress his chances of reelection this year louisiana has an unusual open primary in which candidates of both parties run together if none receive more than 50 percent of the vote , the two top vote getters , regardless of party , face each other in a runoff many politicians have seen mr roemer s switch as likely to help him secure a place in that runoff by forestalling republican or conservative competition in the primary the other major candidates include former gov edwin w edwards , a democrat , and david duke , a state representative and former ku klux klan leader , who calls himself a republican although the party disavows him mr roemer said today that he expected to get the endorsement of the republican party in louisiana and that he did not dispute the idea that there were electoral considerations involved in his switch that could be true , he said i am a politician i do n't deny taking a political look at where i am he also said mr bush had agreed to visit louisiana mr roemer was one of the house democrats called boll weevils who provided a critical bloc of conservative votes in the reagan years , and he had long been courted by the republicans mr brown said he had telephoned mr roemer to try to dissuade him , but the governor had not called back still , the democratic chairman asserted that mr roemer s decision was made some time ago i think it was a done deal the louisiana governor said at the white house today that on a majority of issues , the republican party and i march together but he also said there are differences pointing to his record on civil rights , mr roemer said he might be able to add more sensitivity to his new party in that area asked if mr bush s popularity ratings played any role in his calculations , mr roemer replied it did n't hurt at all he is a great american you getting that down \? photo president bush at the white house yesterday with gov buddy roemer of louisiana , center , who switched from democrat to republican , and clayton k yeutter , chairman of the republican national committee \( associated press \)
the weather was dreary at yankee stadium last night , causing the game between the angels and the yankees to be delayed for just over an hour by rain with mark langston pitching for california , new york s outlook was just as ominous when things got under way in the end , the rain held off once the game began , but langston did n't he rained strike after strike down upon the yankees in leading the angels to a 51 victory langston pitched into the ninth inning in stopping new york on seven hits and , in doing so , became the second 14game winner in the major leagues the only dent the yankees made against langston occurred when hensley meulens hit a monstrous homer over the visitors' bullpen in left in the seventh they had two more singles in the inning , but langston wiggled free without allowing further damage in the eighth , the yankees put two baserunners on with none out , but mel hall s checked swing resulted in a double play mark langston really did a fantastic job , said doug rader , the angels' manager he s stepped in and really been the stopper for us 'i expect to win' langston , who was perturbed about being replaced by bryan harvey when he was an out away from a complete game , dispensed praise to his teammates after the game as freely as he piled up outs during it i'm on a good team and i had a lot of help from my friends , said langston every time i go out there , i expect to win with this team two crashes heard during the game had nothing to do with thunder they had a lot to do with wally joyner and his trusty bat as the first baseman smacked a tworun home run over the center field fence and a runscoring single both hits came off scott sanderson , who lost his third straight game it was the first time in 53 american league starts he has lost more than two in a row sanderson pitched a onehitter against the angels for his last victory two weeks ago and exited the clubhouse before anyone could ask him about last night s effort we faced him in the first day back after the allstar break and we were a little flat , said joyner he throws those slow changeups up there , so you have to be ready it s a matter of us doing the job as hitters third time is n't a charm facing langston was not a real pleasurable task for the yanks before last night , he had faced them twice this season and handled them with ease counting last night s game , langston has silenced the yankees on four earned runs and 18 hits in 26 and twothirds innings for an earned run average of 135 , and has compiled two victories and one nodecision langston gave up a double to steve sax with one out in the first but sax was left stranded after langston struck out don mattingly and retired mel hall on a groundout to first rarely does mattingly look silly in a time at bat , but langston puzzled him with an offspeed pitch and had him trying to check his swing in all , the yankees left nine runners on base in the game compounding new york s problem was the absence of jesse barfield and roberto kelly , two injured righthanded batters who might have fared better against the tough langston manager stump merrill knows the yanks are more vulnerable against lefthanders until the two players return our offense is not good against lefthanded pitching , said merrill after the yanks lost for the fourth time in five games if i was managing against us , i would try and throw a lefthander out there inside pitch mike witt had surgery on his right elbow thursday to replace an ulnar collateral ligament the surgery took place at centinela hospital in inglewood , calif general manager gene michael said doctors had told him it would take witt about a year to recuperate even after witt missed 55 games with a sore elbow last season , the yankees signed him to a 3year , 8 million contract he was 01 with a 1013 earned run average in two games this year jesse barfield s left ankle is still sore , so he did not play last night for the seventh time in 11 games barfield had been hampered by a sore right hamstring before the ankle injury roberto kelly , who has missed 16 games with a sprained right wrist , has not taken batting practice yet as long as kelly remains unable to play , the yankees can delay making a roster move that will probably mean sending hensley meulens to class aaa columbus today is old timers' day at the stadium with ceremonies scheduled to begin at noon photo the angels' mark langston pitching against the yankees last night at yankee stadium \( michelle v agins the new york times \)

america s research universities are under increasing pressure to find ways to strengthen the united states position in international trade , spur the nation s lagging economic growth and avoid giving the fruits of scientific and technological progress to foreign competitors to help america gain more commercially from its research leadership , should this country restrict foreign access to america s great research universities and laboratories \? at the massachusetts institute of technology , a faculty study group headed by a political science professor , eugene skolnikoff , and including professors from economics , the physical sciences and engineering , has just issued a report warning against the dangers to both the university and the nation of a shift toward intellectual protectionism the intense economic competition among nations , the report says , is increasingly driven by the growing strength of science and technology abroad , and mit s broad and open links with the international science and technology community are crucial to its ability to serve american society the group said mit must remain committed to the publication of all research and open to foreign visits and direct participation in laboratory work mit has long prohibited research tagged exclusively for industrial sponsors , although proprietory research was occasionally permitted before world war ii for special reasons classified research , in the big wartime laboratories , was accepted during world war ii and in the cold war atmosphere until the 1960 s , but no classified research has been accepted on campus since then the federal government still finances 75 percent of the research on the mit campus , with the biggest sums coming , in rank order , from the departments of energy , health and human services , defense and the national science foundation none of those studies are classified but classified research is conducted at the lincoln laboratory , in lexington , mass , which mit continues to operate largely for the department of defense lincoln , which is kept outside the academic structure and campus research budget , had a 4201 million budget in the fiscal year 1990 oncampus , unclassified research that year cost 310 million mit got only 3 percent of its oncampus research budget in 1990 from foreignbased companies indeed , while some critics argue that mit and other american universities are being biased by support from foreign companies or governments , others , like frank press , president of the national academy of sciences , and ernst bloch , former director of the national science foundation , contend that foreign beneficiaries should pay more to support american research they see cream skimming the mit report urges foreign companies and nations to help insure that the research base is maintained by adding money as well as knowledge to it foreign support is accepted at mit under the same conditions as united statessponsored research that it advances the research and education missions determined by mit , fulfills the faculty s research goals , is enriching for students and can be freely and openly published and discussed but foreign institutions appear to have been quicker and more thorough in developing opportunities stemming from american research to correct the relative weakness of united states companies in translating research to the marketplace , the faculty report says the president of mit should consult with industrial leaders to establish a continuing dialogue and mechanisms for additional action at his inauguration as mit s 15th president this month , charles m vest declared that when our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges , mit must reaffirm our responsibilities to american society at the same time as we continue to participate in the evolving international research community the institute already has several programs , like the industrial liaison program and leaders for manufacturing , to move new knowledge from labs to commercial applications the skolnikoff report suggests that mit faculty members should give american companies first crack at new research results mit already requires that licenses for inventions require substantial manufacturing of the licensed product in the united states , whether federally or privately financed mit has begun studies on helping particular industries , starting with autos and pharmaceuticals , and intends to establish programs on using information technology to accelerate american productivity growth , along with other large research projects that will overlap several industries helping america s industrial performance will also require reducing the cost of capital , to lengthen the timehorizons of american management and spur longrange investment and research remedy the shortage of venture capital improve labor relations , and strengthen the quality of american management and its alertness to new opportunities a closer and deeper relationship between american industry and the nation s great research centers will be a key element in the process drawing

saying he poses an imminent danger to the public , state officials yesterday suspended the medical license of the lower east side doctor charged with severing the arm of a fetus during an illegal thirdtrimester abortion it is only the fifth time this year that the state department of health has used its emergency powers to suspend the license of a doctor before a hearing is held state officials had previously said that while they had received many reports about dr abu hayat some of them as long as three years ago they deemed none of the reports serious enough to warrant action in ordering the suspension yesterday , the department cited eight cases involving dr hayat among them are severing of the arm of ana rosa rodriguez , who was later born alive perforating the uterus of a teenager , sophie mccoy , who later died stopping an abortion on one woman midway into the procedure because the patient s husband could not pay an additional 500 perforating the uterus and vagina of another patient who needed emergency hospitalization as a result , and fondling a patient during an examination the state s report noted that dr hayat denies treating most of the eight patients cited dr hayat and his lawyer , jeffrey rubin , did not return repeated telephone calls yesterday hearing scheduled dr hayat s case now goes to a hearing before the state office of professional medical conduct it is scheduled for dec 3 at 9 am at 5 penn plaza the board has the power to revoke dr hayat s license if it does so , however , he can apply to have it reinstated in one year in the first case cited in the suspension order , dr hayat was charged last monday with performing an illegal thirdtrimester abortion on 20yearold rosa rodriguez on oct 25 , the order said , miss rodriguez went to dr hayat for an abortion he examined her , injected her abdomen with an unknown solution and inserted a substance called laminaria to irritate and dilate her cervix , the report said the next day , he gave her another injection , which sedated her and , when she awoke , told her to return again the following day , the order said that night miss rodriguez suffered severe abdominal pain , fever and vaginal bleeding , the report said , and she was taken by ambulance to jamaica hospital in queens her baby was born missing a right arm the gestational age of the baby was estimated at between 30 and 32 weeks abortions can legally be performed in new york state only until the 24th week of pregnancy , unless the mother s or fetuses s health is at risk , and those abortions must be performed in a hospital the second case in the report involved a woman who went to dr hayat for an abortion on march 17 of this year after the procedure was under way , the review said , dr hayat went into the waiting room to tell the patient s husband that the pregnancy was further along than originally thought and that the fee would increase by 500 the man could not pay and dr hayat sent the woman home without completing the abortion , the report said she suffered pain and bleeding and was taken to st luke sroosevelt hospital the next day in the third case , ms mccoy , who was 17 years old , went to dr hayat for an abortion on sept 18 , 1990 , the report said later that night , the health department said , she suffered vaginal pain and difficulty breathing she was admitted to kings county hospital , where she was diagnosed as having a perforated uterus that had become infected she died eight days after the abortion abuse case cited in the fourth case , the patient s uterus and vagina were cut so badly that a tract developed between them , the report said when the patient arrived at north central bronx hospital on aug 3 , 1988 , more than two weeks after the abortion in dr hayat s clinic , doctors found part of a fetal skull still in her uterus , the review said the four other cases involve allegations that dr hayat failed to examine patients properly before performing abortions and failed to document the procedure after it was completed in one of those cases , dr hayat is also accused of inappropriately performing a simultaneous pelvic and breast examination of a patient dr hayat has been charged with thirddegree sexual abuse in that case dr hayat s lawyer , mr rubin , said last week that his client had not tried to perform an abortion on miss rodriguez , but he would not comment when asked if he had ever examined her peter slocum , a spokesman for the health department , said the action by the state was not a reaction to news reports this week showing that his office has been investigating dr hayat for nearly three years in 1988 , he said , the only allegations against dr hayat involved recordkeeping errors it was not until this april , he said , that the department learned of the death of miss mccoy at that time , he said , the investigation of dr hayat received steppedup priority to suspend a doctor s license before there is a hearing , he

at age 8 , i debuted as a decorator raised by two bachelor uncles who deferred to my sense of style , i had no doubts about what i wanted an orange , pink and whitestriped apartment , inspired by the design of a popsicle i maintained a strong lead in home decor into my teens , when i made another statement , redoing our junior four highrise apartment as a facsimile of the tomb of queen nefertiti \( to date , the only other person i have heard of who has chosen egyptian as a style for her home is cher \) for four years , we lived surrounded by tempera wall paintings depicting gods and goddesses walking a sideways path to our kitchenette today , i lack the decisiveness and the desire for such bold choices i have resorted to defensive decorating i lead a complicated life , commuting between a crumbling country house in the hudson valley and a cramped new york city apartment the country house is beautiful , but flaking the city apartment is a onebedroom , rentstabilized , no exit situation \( hell is another person in the living room \) faced with the decorating problems and possibilities these residences present , my response has been paralysis in its tiny way , the city apartment is easier to understand it had , and has , a definite identity 1928 when i moved in , in 1980 , i made a major decision to do nothing i went with 1928 , instead of fighting it that was a nice year , i thought before the depression nineteen twentyeight has something to offer in the living room moorish arches and a black marble fireplace a chimney that sucks updrafts with a 63yearold zest but in the kitchen , 1928 has become problematic there , the little 1928 oriole gas stove , without any temperature indicators , sits on its stubborn little wroughtiron feet a marital war was waged over and around this stove my husband hated 1928 and demanded a move up to at least 1968 i refused to get rid of the old stove , even though i was almost an unintentional suicide the first time i tried to heat up a muffin i pointed to the integrity and charm of the stove s porcelain knobs , to the warming ovens and to the fact that if i so desired , i could heat up an iron on the iron rack these qualities , i insisted , were more precious than a mere ability to cook a roast for 10 years we ate takeout and fought , in danger of living out some chekhovian tale \( the stove \) of a man and wife circling , for decades , the blackened incendiary appliance that had come to symbolize their marriage my husband could never put the stove out of his mind , even when we were in other cities touring the smithsonian institution , he dragged me to a replica of my stove , part of an exhibit on immigrant life in america see see , he taunted me no one keeps a kitchen like this anymore it s in a museum ! which was my point , precisely shortly thereafter , i encountered my building s superintendent in the cellar fat , breathing hard , the super pressured me to let him put in a new stove you 're the only one of the younger people to keep the old stove , he said and then , i knew i had become the literal keeper of the flame i had seen the old stoves , twins of my own , tossed like discarded dominoes into the gutter now they personified the elderly residents of the building , silverhaired ladies and gentlemen , who , like the stoves , eventually all disappeared i warmed to the larger theme and stood by my stove i was the protector of the past , the custodian of history the stove stays upstate , the problems are more complex the house does not know what year it is neither do i i wander its random floors , confused are we in the 1700 s , from which some workmen insist they found logs in your ceiling , yeah , that s colonial \?

washington , sept 19 requiring doctors and nurses to be tested for infection with the aids virus would be costly but useless because it would assure no additional protection from infection , representatives of the nation s leading medical organizations told congress today the risk of being infected by a doctor is so remote that it may never be measured , said former surgeon general c everett koop , one of the health experts who testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on health and the environment requiring the tests would be a worthless return to the darker days of the aids epidemic , dr koop said representatives of the centers for disease control , the american medical association , the american college of emergency physicians , the american nurses association , the american dental association and the service employees international union also spoke against mandatory testing many of the witnesses at today s hearing said they believed calls for mandatory testing of health care workers were being prompted by a single case and the emotional reaction to it the case is that of dr david j acer of stuart , fla , a dentist who may have infected five of his patients before his death last year but dr william roper , director of the centers for disease control , said the atlantabased federal agency was aware of about 60 cases of health care workers who are infected with the aids virus tests of 8 , 000 of their patients found none had been infected by a health care worker , he said it is not known how dr acer s patients became infected one of the five patients , 23yearold kimberly bergalis , has called for mandatory tests and has been bitterly critical of health officials for not pressing the matter in a letter to florida health officials that her family made public this summer , she said her life with aids has been sheer hell who do i blame \? miss bergalis wrote i blame dr acer and every single one of you bastards dr acer was infected and had fullblown aids , and stood by not doing a thing about it you are all just as guilty as he was you 've ruined my life and my family s since then , the senate has passed legislation requiring health care workers to be tested and to refrain from certain procedures if they are infected with the aids virus the measure would apply criminal penalities to health workers who do not tell patients that they have the aids virus before surgery rejecting 'the quick answer' representative henry a waxman , a california democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee that held today s hearing , said people must not focus on one emotional case we must focus on the known risks and true responses , not on the feared risks or easy responses , he said the quick answer is often not the right one dr koop agreed that public health policy should not be made on the basis of miss bergalis s case , and said the emotional response to the case ignored science , experience and common sense succumbing to the emotionalism , he added , will separate those who serve patients from those who use patients , those who throw water on the fire from those who throw gasoline on it he and other witnesses said the only method of effective prevention is for doctors , dentists , nurses and other health care workers to follow the precautions recommeded by the centers for disease control and to wear gloves , gowns , and other protective gear when working general guidelines issued in july the agency issued general guidelines saying health care workers should voluntarily be tested for the viruses that cause aids and hepatitis b , and that those infected should stop doing certain exposureprone procedures until they get permission from a panel of experts and have informed their patients it left it up to the professional groups to define which procedures posed the highest risks but several medical organizations have responded by saying that even these restrictions went too far , and refused to draw up lists of exposureprone prodecures by contrast , representative william e dannemeyer , republican of california , said it was an absurdity to rely on voluntary compliance there is a failure of leadership in public health in america , the congressman said too many people are treating aids as a civil rights issue criticizing the voluntary nature of the guidelines , he asked dr roper , are n't you placing the civil rights of the infected above the civil rights of the uninfected \? no , dr roper replied i think you are , mr dannemeyer responded representative bill richardson , a new mexico democrat , criticized dr roper and the bush administration for suggesting that doctors and hospital patients patients be tested for the aids virus but offering nothing to help them get counseling or treatment does n't it seem bitterly ironic to you that these recommendations are to test people to help them , but you do n't plan to help them with treatment \? mr richardson asked dr roper you just tell them they need help \? dr roper said he would check to see how much money would be in next year s budget for early treatment the aids risk from surgery boston , sept 19 \( reuters \) the risk of getting aids from a doctor during surgery is one in 21 million for every hour of the operation , about the same chance that a person will be in a fatal accident on the way to a hospital , two doctors have concluded the doctors , who described their conclusions in a letter in today s issue of the new england journal of medicine , based their prediction on the assumption that fourtenths of 1 percent of surgeons are infected with the virus , that there is a risk of eighttenths of 1 percent that a surgeon will be cut during an operation , and that there is a chance of 15 onehundreths of 1 percent that infected blood from the puncture will get into the patient the doctors , albert b lowenfels and gary wormser of the new york medical college in valhalla , said that even if a surgeon was known to be infected with the aids virus , the best estimate is approximately one chance in 83 , 000 hours of surgery they said their calculations were based on statistics from four previous studies
almost a year after he put the islanders up for sale , john o pickett jr said last night that he had agreed to sell a minority interest in the team to a group of long island investors who would take over active control of the operation pickett , who did not disclose the price , said the investors had options to acquire a half interest within five years i expect to be a passive investor , said pickett , who described the new owners as an outstanding group of young , very active and successful investors from long island he said he had no intention of selling the other half of the club the investors , two groups of rival bidders who came together to make what turned out to be the successful offer , are stephen walsh and jerome h grossman of the investment firm of walsh , greenwood company , situated in new hyde park , li , and robert d rosenthal and ralph palleschi of first long island investors pickett said he expected walsh and rosenthal to take the leading roles in the club with walsh serving as president torrey , arbour likely to stay although the formal announcement of the sale said only that it is anticipated that present islander personnel will continue to be involved where appropriate , the assumption among team officials at the long island coliseum last night was that general manager bill torrey and coach al arbour would remain in their positions for the forseeable future torrey , the club s first employee when it was organized in 1973 , was in montreal last night and unavailable for comment i feel very good that local people are going to be involved , said arbour this is what we need , a local flavor it s certainly the best thing for our hockey club his financial interest was here , but i do n't know if his heart was here , said goalie glenn healy of pickett , who was an absentee owner i'm happy that it s done although the sale is subject to the approval of the national hockey league , pickett , noting that he had introduced walsh to commissioner john h ziegler last week , said he anticipated no problems and expected the league s board of governors to give its formal approval in january in a telephone interview from his home in palm beach , fla , pickett declined to say how large a share he was selling initially or how much the group would pay for it or for the two further shares they may buy at set prices over the next five years to bring their interest to 50 percent pickett , who had engaged salomon brothers last winter to advise him on the sale , acknowledged , however , that he had abandoned his plan to sell the entire club when none of the 20 or so financially qualified bidders indentified by his investment bankers during the summer would meet his minimum price of 75 million not a dime less i would n't take a dime less , he said when a sale of the pittsburgh penguins was completed last month , the club s value was put in the 45 million range pickett , who said he had received several bids in the 50 s and 60 s but none in the critical 70 million range , said that after the 20 groups had been whittled down to six or eight serious bidders , including three from long island , two of them joined forces in september to negotiate what turned out to be the eventual deal i was very impressed with them , declared pickett , who said the fact that the investors were from long island had been totally important to him i could n't be happier , he said neither , perhaps , could islander players and fans , who have tended to blame pickett s increasing remoteness from the club for its recent decline pickett , who said the sale agreement included the team and all related rights , said the club had made a profit every year since he took over
the tone of mia westerlund roosen s installation at the sculpture center in manhattan is set by its bubbly and sarcastic title , american beauties the beauties are breasts of concrete , assembled into a long low machine that seems not so much installed as stored in this exhibition space the machine suggests the blades of a sexual reaper , or a battalion of baby pacifiers , or a stone age chariot of wrathful fire this beautifully lighted show is minimalist in its simplicity and geometry , yet very much postminimalist in its expressiveness like the minimalists , ms roosen works rigorously and impersonally with serial forms \( in this case a circle \) but this sculpture was not fabricated but handmade and intended to be experienced in terms of the female body american beauties is essentially one 20footlong sculpture with nine parts the material is concrete , which ms roosen modeled over a welded steel and mesh armature and then coated with encaustic each part is 23 inches tall and 23 inches wide , and suggests two breasts , or two pacifiers , back to back the nine parts are lined up nipple to nipple like a squadron of breasts on patrol although the dimensions of all the parts are the same , each has a surface energy of its own the point at which the two breasts in each part seem sealed together forms a rough sharp edge that brings to mind a wheel on an ancient chariot the aggressiveness of this edge , as well as the hardness of the concrete , contrasts sharply with the soft fullness of the breasts this pacifying , nurturing machine will cut down anyone in its path these american beauties are a comical but irrepressible force the way the breasts energize one another suggests a sisterhood whose members touch breasts instead of walking hand in hand because the nipples are maroon tinged with black , there is a hint of so much electricity running through them that it is in danger of causing a short circuit if american beauties is militant , it is also macabre the sculpture makes sense at the sculpture center , which in recent years has presented works by nancy fried and mary ann unger that have used breast imagery to communicate an experience of illness and defiance that the breast has never communicated in art by men the sculptural tradition into which ms roosen s work fits also includes louise bourgeois , perhaps the first sculptor to turn the nurturing breast into a symbol of vengeance and aggression , and ursula von rydingsvard , who has carved wood sculptures in which rows of craggy maternal shapes seem filled with menace the success of ms roosen s sculpture depends on its blend of wit and ferocity , improbability and authority it also depends on a complete lack of sentimentality working with this kind of imagery , it would be easy to fall into all kinds of cliches ms roosen s sculptural integrity is such that she falls into none of them the sculptures of mia westerlund roosen remain at the sculpture center , 167 east 69th street , through april 6 david reed max protetch gallery 560 broadway \( at prince street \) through march 23 it is clear from this show why david reed , who is 45 years old , has become one of the most respected abstract painters of his generation his belief in abstraction is complete his best work is independent in its response to the history of art , fresh in its approach to such categories as nature and style , and mature in its ability to communicate ideas through a sensual response to paint he paints with the canvas lying flat and works on several canvases at the same time using a brush and palette knife , he pushes paint around like a mason moving cement all seven paintings in this show the largest of them 14 feet long feature mr reed s signature brushstroke as smooth as lather , as flowing as a ribbon or film strip , as creamy as icing the brushwork holds , changes or builds light , occasionally glowing in ways that bring to mind 19thcentury american art or 16th or 17thcentury italian painting it is a special kind of light , one that manages to seem pure without ever suggesting nature indeed , the light manages to seem entirely believable , even holy , in a pictorial world of artifice and courtly gestures mr reed s sweeping , curling or racing brushstrokes often bring to mind drapes and curtains in grand manner painting the curtain is always raised it is never about to fall the paintings suggest stages , drawing rooms and makeup rooms in which courtesy , performance and dressing are the order of the day but these wellmannered paintings are always in some way abrupt or disjunctive in each work , there is at least one rectangle superimposed on the canvas that may repeat the gestures beneath or around it or be so different in size and color that it goes off on its own following the brushstrokes and colors from one section of the painting to another creates a sensation of recogition and surprise it also brings to mind a host of associations , from japanese screens to chinese mountains to renaissance annunciations to greek friezes in no 288 , the black gestures across the red canvas carry the memory of a mythological battle from which all signs of narrative content have vanished mr reed is an artist who wants to be both disorienting and complete david row john good gallery 532 broadway \( near spring street \) through march 23
washington , april 26 john h sununu , the white house chief of staff , has sometimes added political chores and recreation to governmentpaid airplane trips while on official visits , a magazine is reporting early this week the magazine , us news world report , and the washington post created a political stir when they published separate accounts of mr sununu s frequent trips , among them trips to ski resorts when mr sununu reimbursed the government for nonofficial trips , the amount was governed by commercial fares , which are a tiny fraction of the government s costs us news cited as one example of what it said was mr sununu s adding to governmentpaid trips his activities of last may 2527 the magazine said mr sununu , at the invitation of vice president dan quayle , flew to indiana in a government plane on may 25 to attend a gala ball opening the indianapolis 500 auto race weekend luncheon with contributors the next day mr sununu was flown to ohio , where he gave a commencement address at the university of akron after that he attended a luncheon of republican contributors , the magazine said , and then was flown to massachusetts , where he received an award at framingham state college on may 27 , us news said , mr sununu was flown back to indianapolis to watch the auto race the overall cost was more than 13 , 717 , none of which was reimbursed to the government by mr sununu or by the republican party , the magazine said the white house issued a statement tonight saying , we are comfortable with the official designations of john sununu s trips the bush administration has said mr sununu followed established policy by flying on government planes so that he could be in constant contact with the white house on wednesday , president bush ordered a white house review of the policy
next month , one of the most complex software packages ever designed will get a chance to prove itself in the middle of the sonoran desert near tucson , ariz there , in biosphere ii , a structure that looks like a combination greenhouse and futuristic shopping mall , eight scientists will seal themselves inside for two years their environment will be controlled by g2 , the most advanced of a new batch of computer programs , known as expert systems , that are designed to mimic human decisionmaking the longterm hope is that this experiment will show that human colonies in space or on other planets can be made both viable and selfsustaining the experiment will also give the field of expert systems a chance to prove itself over a long period of time and in an extremely complex environment the latest version of g2 , released last week , will supervise the monitoring and analysis functions of the environment inside biosphere ii , recording minute changes in its air temperature , weather and gas concentrations contained within the program is a wealth of human expertise about chemistry , biology and ecological systems the program will also monitor the experiment s computer network and will be responsible for avoiding crises that could threaten the experiment g2 will alert the scientist to such things as runaway carbon dioxide , something you 'd want to detect immediately , said lowell b hawkinson , chairman of the gensym corporation of cambridge , mass , which created the g2 system gensym introduced the first version of g2 in 1988 as a means of monitoring and controlling complex , rapidly changing processes of various types as they are occurring in what computer programmers call real time this use , called process control , has wide applicability throughout industry , especially in manufacturing and in areas like power generation where a number of companies are already using it g2 is designed so it can be customized since 1988 , 600 g2 packages have been sold to more than 250 customers including du pont , texaco , boeing , nissan , mcdonnell douglas , ibm and nynex the software , written in a computer language called lisp , runs on a variety of unixbased work stations and sells for 18 , 000 to 70 , 000 while other expert systems can monitor complex processes and other variables like changes in temperature , speed and rotation , most of them cannot do it in real time nor can these other programs handle as many different variables as g2 does at once g2 monitors and controls these thousands of variables each second by using rules that are derived from the way experts actually think and work a rule , for example , might be for a valve on an oil tank to open when pressure limits are reached and excess fluid or gas must be burned off g2 does this job for texaco with g2 , rules can be as simply phrased as as soon as x happens , do y g2 can be programmed with everyday language while most expert systems process only a few rules a second , g2 processes hundreds of rules a second its knowledge base can contain thousands of rules enabling the program to keep track of complex processes according to john girard , a senior analyst with new sciences associates , a computer consulting firm in southport , conn , both the international business machine corporation and the nec corporation of japan , two of the world s biggest computer makers , are looking closely at expert systems , including g2 , for processcontrol applications every large company in the united states employs process control to some degree , said harvey newquist , an artificial intelligence analyst with the relayer group in phoenix the potential for expert systems here is greater than anyone can imagine virtually every company is a potential customer according to the spang robinson report , a computer industry newsletter , the current market for expert systems for process control is about 40 million a year , while the market for ordinary processcontrol software which expert systems like g2 could replace is about 15 billion gensym , which has revenues of about 8 million , was started in 1986 by a group of engineers from the nowdefunct lisp machines inc , of cambridge , mass , a company set up in the early 1980 s to develop computers and programs that mimic human intelligence the rest of the market for expert systems is divided among a large number of companies , including such new entries as mitech in concord , mass , artificial intelligence technologies in hawthorne , ny , and real time systems inc in don mills , ontario , that have fielded programs to compete with g2 none of these other programs are as successful as g2 when biosphere ii begins its operation next month , g2 will control 7 million cubic feet of atmosphere that will circulate freely among the rooms of the structure according to mr girard , there is no room for error any breakdown in cooperation between environments could render the biosphere uninhabitable in a few days to a few hours norberto alvarezromo , director of cybernetic systems for biosphere ii , is not concerned about leaving these crucial tasks to a computer he does n't foresee a potential 2001 a space odyssey scenario in which hal , the onboard computer in the movie and book , malfunctions g2 is handling critical work , but it s not the supreme commander , mr alvarezromo said ultimate decisionmaking authority is still with the scientists the national aeronautics and space administration has been using g2 for several critical functions on its shuttle flights since october 1989 according to troy heindel , a flight controller at mission control at the johnson space center in houston , g2 monitors 16 , 000 data points per second , gathering such information as temperature , voltages , availability of jet thrusters , condition of onboard computers and instrumentation the system monitors the availability and control of 38 reaction control system jets , said mr heindel the jets let you move around in space and if you lose one , it s hard to know which one the expert system lets you know what you can do in real time it has the potential to really improve the quality of the decisionmaking a japanese consortium led by the ministry of trade and industry is incorporating g2 in a nationwide emergency response support system for all its nuclear power plants i see g2 as the best chance to avoid another chernobyl , three mile island or exxon valdez , said ed fredkin , a researcher in artificial intelligence at the massachusetts institute of technology and a gensym board member although earlier versions of g2 have been selling well , expert systems in general have been far less successful than had been expected when they were introduced in the 80 s the problem with expert systems has been a 'one size fits all' mentality , said mr newquist users of the early systems also found them difficult to integrate the programs into existing software enviroments g2 s success , is based on its ability to do its task in real time older systems , were just way too slow diagram space shuttle showing where g2 monitors are located

counsel to the president a memoir by clark clifford , with richard holbrooke illustrated 709 pages random house 25 as clark clifford reminds us early in his highly absorbing memoir , counsel to the president , it was dean acheson who first applied the phrase present at the creation to people like himself who helped to forge the internationalist policies that were to challenge communism in the era following world war ii well , mr clifford was also present at the creation , as a young special counsel to president harry s truman but unlike most other people who were there , he has stayed around long enough to be present at the destruction too , having witnessed the recent collapse of communism in eastern europe and he appears in the interval to have been a firsthand witness of every other event of any significance , from winston churchill s speech at fulton , mo , announcing the descent of the iron curtain , to truman s miraculous upset in the presidential election of 1948 , to the cuban missile crisis under president john f kennedy , and so on all the way down to the ordeal of speaker of the house jim wright of texas , who called for mr clifford s help when the house ethics committee began to investigate the congressman s conduct in 1989 mr clifford was even involved in less worldshaking events like the socalled blauvelt affair when the kennedy family asked him in 1962 to put to rest a rumor based on an incorrect entry in the genealogy of a family named blauvelt saying that the president had once been married to a woman named durie malcolm , mr clifford was more than happy to help out after all , he just happened to know durie malcolm from his native st louis so he called her up , exchanged a few pleasantries and got her to sign an affidavit stating that she had never been married to the president no problem for clark clifford what is astonishing is the way he seems to jump into the middle of american history here he is , a st louis lawyer until the outbreak of world war ii , and suddenly he moves to washington and everyone is asking him for advice a minor flaw of the book is that he never explains his intellectual background or how he developed such unerring judgment it s up to the reader to guess that he s smarter than anybody else , or quicker , or better connected , or maybe just taller all he says is that he was always right , except maybe on vietnam and about that tragic misjudgment , as he characterizes it , he suggests that he was less wrong than almost everyone else \( he does express anger and outrage over one area of his business life in a single , though very long , footnote , he mounts a defense of his involvement with a bank holding company , first american bankshares , that is now under federal and new york state investigation in essence , he says he may have been duped \) mr clifford s huge selfesteem is sufferable because he expresses it so compellingly not all of the book is up to the dramatic opening episode in which the author is called upon by president truman to face down secretary of state george c marshall in his strong opposition to the united states recognizing the new state of israel , an assignment mr clifford completes with graceful dispatch nor does the book even sustain the level of the amusing stories that follow about the author s experiences organizing and playing in president truman s regular poker games on the williamsburg , the presidential yacht there was none of the public sanctimoniousness that exists today about such matters as a little gambling with the boys when journalists asked what we were doing on the river , instead of presenting a false picture of a president hard at work , complete with rigged photo opportunities showing him behind a stack of briefing books , president truman simply would say , some of the boys and i were playing a little poker' if asked what we drank , the president would tell the truth 'kentucky bourbon' eventually the narrative even bogs down a little in the quagmire of vietnam , quagmire being the word , incidentally , that mr clifford apparently was the first to apply to the american involvement in southeast asia he saw the conflict up close as secretary of defense during 1968 , the final year of the johnson administration but not even his narrative skills can make anything better than frustratingly tedious the endless groping and miscalculating that characterized his administration s struggle to extricate itself from the unpopular war still , as accounts of vietnam go , this one is at least more focused and coherent than what such memoirists as lyndon b johnson or richard m nixon or henry a kissinger achieved in their respective volumes or perhaps the narrative skills belong to richard holbrooke , a former foreign service officer and author of one volume of the pentagon papers who collaborated with mr clifford on these memoirs it is n't clear who contributed what to the project , though the voice that comes through is clearly mr clifford s one other quality that makes counsel to the president irresistible is that mr clifford may be right about his crediting himself with being right summing up at the end he weighs the relative virtues of innovation and conservatism , as ralph waldo emerson called them when he wrote in the future of the republic innovation is the salient energy conservatism the pause of the last movement in describing how he found a middle way between extreme innovation and conservatism over the course of five decades , mr clifford inspires the thought that he is probably the last of the dying breed that has been variously known as the old washington hands and the wise men but if the thought of their end is a poignant one , mr clifford also offers hope that

washington since world war ii , the world has lived free of a nuclear weapons calamity but that does not mean the us remains safe from longrange ballistic missiles launched accidentally by the soviet union or deliberately by a third world country for example , a soviet submarine caught fire and sank off america s east coast in 1986 none of its missiles were accidentally launched earlier , in the 1980 s , a soviet submarine in soviet waters inadverently launched a nucleartipped ballistic missile that fortunately traveled only several hundred yards in 1988 , i proposed that the us explore the development of an antiballistic missile defense system against accidental launches in recent years , as soviet ethnic and separatist tensions have risen , my concerns have grown fighting in azerbaijan and the baltics has forced the authorities to move nuclear weapons out of these areas of strife our director of central intelligence has said this new concern lowers the level of our confidence in moscow s ability to control its nuclear arsenal an equally disturbing development is the spread of ballistic missiles to the third world the cia estimates that , by the turn of the century , 15 to 20 third world countries will have them many of these missiles could be armed with nuclear , chemical or biological warheads as a result of the gulf war , a strong consensus has developed in support of building missile interceptors superior to the patriots for defending our allies and us forces deployed in regional conficts i support this effort but why should tel aviv or riyadh be entitled to protection atlanta or new york city do n't have \? this month the senate armed services committee took a realistic step toward meeting america s missile defense needs its recommendation appears in the fiscal 1992 defense authorization bill , which the senate will begin debating today the committee voted to set a goal to deploy an abm system to defend against limited ballistic missile strikes the panel wants to deploy 100 abm interceptors , allowed under the treaty , at a reopened base at grand forks , nd , by 1996 but this will occur only if the deployment is affordable and its effectiveness can be demonstrated to the next president and future congresses while this system could not protect the entire continental us against all conceivable threats , given current interceptor technologies , eventually it could grow into such a defense against the most probable limited threats to make this a reality , negotiations with moscow are necessary to modify the 1972 abm treaty to permit more than the one groundbased missile site the treaty sanctions the committee emphasized groundbased systems instead of spacebased weapons it has dropped the administration s plan for deploying brilliant pebbles rocket interceptors in space , although research on this and other followon technologies will continue criticism of the armed services committee s action from some quarters , including the new york times , has been swift and sharp , but without merit first , critics claim that the committee s proposal would undermine strategic stability and force the soviets to tear up the justconcluded start treaty this is wrong how can the soviet union complain with a straight face about our deploying 100 abm interceptors when it has just finished upgrading its 100 abm interceptors around moscow and when it retains 8 , 000 strategic nuclear weapons under start \? the 1972 abm treaty is based on a philosophy of strategic stability in which neither side is given incentives to launch a nuclear first strike the pact prohibits defenses formidable enough to intercept and destroy the other side s retaliatory forces that survive the first strike the armed services committee requires that the the interceptor system it proposes be kept well below that mandated in the treaty second , critics say the proposal will lead america down a slippery slope toward eventual emasculation of the abm treaty this , too , is wrong the committee calls only for negotiations on modest amendments to permit a more effective us defense against limited attacks the treaty itself provides for an amendment process in light of missile proliferation in countries within missile range of the soviet union , moscow might well agree to amendments should it say nyet , there is no explicit or implicit commitment in the committee proposal to abrogate the abm treaty the us needs a twotrack policy of diplomacy and defense we must strengthen lax us and allied controls on arms exports and pressure the world s leading missile makers including china , north korea and the soviet union to halt their sales at the same time , we must have a strong us defense as insurance against the failure of diplomacy to restrict proliferation and against accidental launches drawing
washington , june 24 the white house sought anew today to dampen speculation that john h sununu , the chief of staff there , was in danger of losing his job because of embarrassing disclosures about his travels on unofficial business but despite another vote of confidence from president bush , mr sununu said for the first time that he planned to leave his job sometime after the beginning of mr bush s second term in january 1993 , presuming that the president is reelected next year mr sununu had said earlier this month that he hoped to remain in the white house for eight years as he left a ceremony in the rose garden , mr bush gave what seemed a rather perfunctory endorsement to his top aide , calling out to inquiring reporters , yeah , i'm going to support him the white house spokesman , marlin fitzwater , was much more emphatic he said of mr sununu , i have talked to the president , and his job is not in trouble nevertheless , there was little diminution in the controversy swirling about the chief of staff , whose use of government airplanes , his official limousine and corporate jets on private trips and political jaunts has reportedly angered a number of cabinet members as well as the president and his key aides baker is hardly an ally white house officials said today that mr bush had called one of his oldest confidants , secretary of state james a baker 3d , as long ago as sunday , june 16 , to express his exasperation with mr sununu s continuing troubles he has since expressed his displeasure several times , intimates report , most recently after mr sununu gave an incomplete and , in the president s view , misleading account of his use of a corporate jet to travel to chicago on june 11 mr baker , who opposed the selection of mr sununu as chief of staff in the first place , has carefully avoided any clash with him since , and he is not pushing within the administration s councils for his dismissal , according to those familiar with his views but he is reported to be among the senior cabinet members who have told the president that the former new hampshire governor has become a serious political liability asked whether mr bush was closer to asking mr sununu to resign , another old friend replied , i see no movement now but he added sununu will survive for the moment , because of george bush s extra sense of loyalty but a time will come , maybe after next november , when it will be convenient to move him along sununu must know that by now , after the president has sent him to the woodshed three times i call your attention to sununu s own comment this morning about his future plans , which was revealing tower s situation recalled in many of the comments by people within the administration , none of whom would speak for quotation , there was undercurrent of glee mr sununu s manner has offended many , and a lot of us , one senior white house figure commented , want our revenge from that perspective , mr sununu s case is similar to that of the late john tower , the former republican senator from texas who lacked defenders in his own party when he came under fire after mr bush nominated him as secretary of defense in 1989 mr fitzwater said at his daily briefing today that as far as the white house was concerned the sununu travel question was a closed book there does n't appear to be anything more to deal with , he said the spokesman said the white house counsel , c boyden gray , had issued two rulings about the disputed trip to chicago one to the effect that it violated no ethics laws , the other that it was not a violation of the rules for mr sununu to solicit transportation from stuart a bernstein , a washington real estate man , because mr bernstein had no substantial business with the government , and thus no conflict of interest 'i wo n't characterize it' but mr fitzwater , obviously uneasy , conceded under intense questioning that mr sununu , who is his superior , had told him last week that he did not solicit the use of the corporate jet when mr sununu had in fact done exactly that i wo n't characterize it , mr fitzwater said i'm a spokesman i 'll simply tell you what he said i have no explanation he said no then , and it turned out that he did after a brief , routine speech this morning in arlington , va , across the potomac from washington , in which he made no mention of his political problems , mr sununu shrugged them off in an exchange with reporters he said , look , i 've been in washington for a while now , so i realize that it s all part of the process it s part of being chief of staff referring to a statement on saturday in which he apologized for his mistakes , mr sununu said today , i think i made my statement on saturday , and i think it speaks for itself that statement , white house officials said sunday , was demanded by mr bush as a condition of the chief of staff s continuing in his job now , the officials said , mr sununu is on a kind of probation , with his job dependent on his avoiding any further travel controversies photo john h sununu , the white house chief of staff , waiting for president bush to return to the oval office from a ceremony

havana a substantial number of construction workers seemed busy as usual at the new aquatics center on a gray and unusually cool morning here last week but for all their efforts , one of the walls had still not been erected , a major support beam for the roof sat unattended on the ground , and not a shovelful of dirt had been removed from where the pool will be perhaps this one is our most difficult venue , said renaldo gonzalez lopez , the executive director of the committee organizing the 1991 pan american games but i am sure everything will be finished by may whether it s actually completed in may , june , july or even by aug 2 , the day of the opening ceremony , on this day gonzalez and other cuban sports officials expressed no concern that the center might not be finished on time or the games not proceed as scheduled in fact , most of the facilities under construction or renovation are well on target for completion , and the others are not far enough behind to cause alarm what seemed far more uncertain to outside observers is why a country with so many obvious economic needs would continue such massive efforts to organize an event of the magnitude of the pan american games for 30 years , cuba has endured under a trade embargo by the united states , which left the soviet union as the island s major economic benefactor yet with its own worsening problems , the soviet union began reducing its trade with cuba last year by limiting oil exports , demanding payments in hard currency and lowering price subsidies on sugar , cuba s major export other important trading partners , like eastern european countries once within the soviet sphere of influence , also started demanding payments from cuba in hard currency with the economic squeeze tightening , president fidel castro proclaimed in september that the country was entering a special period of austerity to most cubans , that simply meant more belttightening and sparse supplies growing sparser by last week , there was little to suggest otherwise , as local citizens stood in lines to buy bread and walked by other stores with few goods to sell all around were buildings in dire need of paint and repair , eroding sidewalks and clouds of carbon monoxide , spewed from sovietbuilt cars and bulgarian buses at the same time , preparations for the pan american games have continued , to a large degree , at the expense of these problems and others as a requirement of the special period , work on most projects has been stopped , and proposed ventures delayed just about the only other uninterrupted work has been construction of new hotels and resorts , as the government turns to tourism to generate additional hard currency we have a sacred commitment to the pan american games , and we will honor it , castro told a group of western journalists last week so the pan american games have been given a high priority , and they will continue to enjoy a high priority the pan american games were first held in 1951 in buenos aires , moving to another western hemisphere city every fourth year in 1987 , they were staged in indianapolis , where competition between athletes from cuba and the united states , countries without formal diplomatic relations , provided the games their highest drama this will be the first time for the games in cuba , which has been ruled by castro s communist government since 1959 most of the events will be staged here , with several others in santiago de cuba , a smaller city in the southeast corner of the country , 548 miles away the cuban organizers expect nearly 6 , 000 athletes , coaches and officials from 38 countries , not to mention hundreds of journalists and other visitors the united states olympic committee expects to send a delegation of 1 , 045 athletes , coaches and staff cuba has seldom had the opportunity to receive so many foreigners , especially such a large number from the united states for that reason , the 1991 games have become an important source of national pride , a chance to show off progress despite the onerous embargo from the north staging these games is a psychological question for cuba , said a european diplomat based in havana , who requested anonymity a cuban , in general , is not always a convinced communist , but he is a convinced nationalist he s proud to organize the games they assimilate national prowess the cost of the 1991 games is nearly impossible to measure because of cuba s socialist economic system outside of some items that had to be purchased with hard currency , like a synthetic surface for the track in the olympic stadium from germany and bowling lanes from japan , the havana games are homegrown cubanmade materials are being used for the 10 major venues under construction , including a 35 , 000seat olympic stadium , the aquatics center , a velodrome , a tennis center with 14 courts , a regatta course for rowing and canoeing in each case , the first of its kind in cuba plus a complex of 1 , 473 apartments for athletes and officials that will be turned over to the city after the games four years ago in indianapolis , where most of the venues had already existed , organizers spent nearly 90 million to stage the games castro put the cost at less than 1 percent of the current investment being made in our country but his failure to elaborate left hanging the questions of cost and proper emphasis these days , these questions are difficult to avoid with an increasing number of people using bicycles because gasoline has grown scarce and bus service has been cut back , oxen replacing tractors for farm work , horsedrawn carriages instead of taxis when they decided to organize the games , they had no problems with the soviet union and the exeastern bloc still existed , said the european diplomat , giving castro the benefit of the doubt so fidel had no more problems than any other countries then , all of a sudden , in one year everybody was surprised and everything changed castro alluded to that when he noted that none of our problems existed in november 1986 , when cuba won the right to stage the games and so his country has clung to its moral and ethical principles by forging ahead , he said , citing residual benefits that he suggests make the venture more valuable , like housing for 6 , 500 citizens in the village apartments , the availability of the venues for general use and a possible increase in tourism it s all in the way you look at things , said a former cuban government official , who asked that his name not be mentioned cubans may lack some of the necessities of life , but no one is starving compared to other latin american countries , our quality of life is much better we fought very hard to get the games they mean a lot to us it would be very hard for us now to renounce them photos the olympic stadium under construction in havana , where track and field events are to be held workers at the stadium ,

with real estate prices falling and buyers treating the newhome market as if it had a wet basement and no rooms with a view , many builders are struggling to stay alive until the next upturn in sales three home builders , operating in three different regions , have come up with survival strategies that seem to be working in new jersey , k hovnanian enterprises is pulling back from the overbuilt condominium market to concentrate on midpriced houses in the central part of the state for baby boomers who are building their families and moving out of apartments in southern california , ira norris has rethought his housing production system , from the first site plans to the last carpet tack , and is forcing supplier prices and his own profits down to where the market will buy in boston , tony green is working for the banks , finishing and selling developments that have been foreclosed this is strictly a holding action , mr green said we 're just trying to keep our team together until the market comes back in a decade the country s home builders have seen their business go from the richest of times , in the mid80 s , to some of the bleakest of times some builders have gone back to their old standby , the homeimprovement trade others are wondering what they will do after completing the houses on order , and many have failed , judging from the falling membership of the national association of home builders , which has tumbled to 158 , 000 , from 161 , 000 last april in 1986 , the industry s best year ever , 18 million singlefamily homes and apartments were built in 1990 , the industry put up 12 million singlefamily homes and apartments , the lowest level since the recession of 198182 and a drop in business from 1989 of 33 percent on jan 2 , the commerce department reported that residential construction spending in constant dollars had dropped for the eighth month in a row to the lowest level since 1983 we have worked ourselves into a real recession , said kenneth colton , executive vice president of the home builders group the terminology you will hear our members use is that suddenly the door slammed shut the white house has predicted a short and mild recession but with buyers already paying more for fuel and in taxes , and with war threatened in the persian gulf and lenders wary of making new real estate development loans , builders and industry analysts are pessimistic about an early upturn in their business they point to the baby bust as evidence that the golden age of residential real estate , just ended , is unlikely to return yet the market is not completely dead an estimated 12 million new households are expected to be formed each year in this decade , down from 15 million a year during the 80 s and mortgage rates , at a threeyear low , have begun to lift the rate of housing sales slightly in recent months a new formula mr norris , of upland , calif , looked at southern california s booming population but slumping housing sales and prices and decided that the traditional housing development equation had to be rewritten his new formula has made him a minor legend in the high desert east of los angeles normally , developers like mr norris secure the land and obtain construction permits and then ask for bids from subcontractors subcontractors then call door , window , plumbing and framing concerns for prices , add overhead , an allowance for breakage and theft , a profit goal and mail in a number mr norris , a big builder who has put up more than 500 houses a year since he formed inco homes in 1976 , decided to squeeze that process by forcing his subcontractors to negotiate for their materials the problem is that these subs are used to being quoted prices , and so they 're lousy negotiators , mr norris said a matter of survival for subcontractors , he said , this approach is a matter of survival we realized that housing contractors that do n't concentrate on reducing their overhead and cutting their costs are not going to make it through this recession , mr norris said so we told them that we would cut our profit and overhead if they would do the same , and that we would be able to build a house that the market would not pass by in addition , by putting 1 , 800 lots on 500 acres in the western mojave desert town of adelanto a hard , but not unheardof , 100mile commuting trip to los angeles he kept his land prices low the result of both strategies a construction cost of 27 a square foot , compared with the normal 35 to 40 a square foot , and a two to fourbedroom house that can be sold for 80 , 000 to 100 , 000 , compared with 105 , 000 and up in the adjoining community of victor valley , said mr norris , who has built more expensive houses in los angeles quick sales on oct 13 , he put his first 55 houses on the market , and by nightfall had sold 47 of them the remaining 8 were gone the next day , a sunday , he said within a week , all 127 houses in his first phase had been sold , he said he s selling them as fast as he can build them , said patricia chamberlin , the adelanto town administrator

everyone seems to hate vanilla ice except the seven million or so fans who ignited his rocket ride to the top of the pop charts with much verve and a bit of glee , the press has combed his past , uncovering inconsistencies in his official biography to many potential fans he s too teenybopper to be cool even macho auto buffs laughed when vanilla ice was near the first in line to plunk down more than 100 , 000 for a shiny acura nsx sports car but perhaps most stinging , rap purists refer to vanilla ice as the elvis of rap , a white performer who has capitalized on the most influential black music to emerge in the last 20 years vanilla ice shrugs off the comparison i do n't know who wrote it in the first place , he says i'm not elvis presley i'm vanilla ice i do n't know anything about him except that he made movies and was a superstar i never bought any of his records but influence is not the question his place in the pop world is in a society perceived as indifferent and even hostile to minorities , rappers like krsone and ice cube are the voice of an increasingly frustrated young black america vanilla ice , on the other hand , offers easily digestible raps about girls , cars and dancing aficionados know that vanilla ice cannot matchthe cleverness of l l cool j , the verbal gymnastics of brand nubian , the humor of digital underground but vanilla ice is white , sexy , palatable in the suburbs and thus highly marketable where many critically acclaimed black rappers struggle for exposure , the 22yearold vanilla ice has managed to become a huge star since the release of his first majorlabel album , to the extreme \( sbk records \) , in september his debut single , ice ice baby , was the first rap song to reach no 1 on the pop singles chart by november he had bumped m c hammer from his 21week occupation of the top pop album slot , and he has held that position since moreover , vanilla ice is in the midst of his first major tour as a headliner \( with a soldout appearance wednesday at the beacon theater in manhattan \) and has signed an endorsement deal with cocacola sbk is rushing a followup while to the extreme is still hot the new record , to be released in april , features live renditions of his hits and five previously unrecorded songs , including satisfaction , which , yes , heavily borrows from the rolling stones standard the rapper had wanted to include the number on to the extreme , but the stones organization balked no one s balking now at vanilla ice s ability to sell records , and generate royalties charles koppelman , head of sbk records and pictures , is banking \( literally \) on the hope that vanilla ice is an incredibly magnetic star who can be as important a film star as he is a music star after filming a cameo for the sequel to teenage mutant ninja turtles , vanilla ice signed a milliondollar contract with sbk pictures , formed specifically for his project although a script has not been chosen , the rapper will film an actionadventure this spring because of the speed and scope of his success , vanilla ice has been subject to considerable scrutiny the firestorm started on nov 18 , when a frontpage article in the dallas morning news reported inaccuracies in the life story he had been feeding the press the revelations , echoed and reexamined by many others , exposed vanilla ice , the toughtalking , quickfooted rapper who was supposedly raised in miami s mean streets , as robert van winkle , who spent most of his highschool years in an affluent dallas suburb the facts surfaced around the same time that the pop duo milli vanilli confessed to not singing on their own multiplatinum album in many minds , vanilla ice , with his sculpted hair and cheekbones , was the same kind of pretty pop figurehead although his publicist has since quietly revised his official biography , vanilla ice is unrepentant was his upbringing really rough and tumble \? i never said anything to beef up my background , he maintains i'm from the streets that s where i learned to dance and rap it should be obvious to anybody s eye that a white guy doing what i'm doing had to be exposed to the streets what about the discredited claim that he attended the same miami high school as luther \( luke \) campbell of the 2 live crew \? i never said i went to the same high school as luke that s impossible he s five or six years older than i am i did say that i went to one of the schools he attended about the national motocross championships , of which the press can find no evidence \? i won three national champions , he insists vanilla ice bristles at the suggestion that the media has put him on the defensive any rapper , but especially a white rapper , needs a street credibility that vanilla ice s suburban upbringing does n't automatically confer it does n't matter , he says , then manages to invoke and mangle two of rap s most tired phrases at the same time it ai n't where you 're from it s where you 're at bottom line do n't believe the hype
norman , okla , oct 10 anita faye hill , the oklahoma law professor who has ignited a firestorm over washington is a product of both a dusty farm at the end of a dirt road and the neogothic courtyards of the yale law school she worked for the reagan administration , yet she holds up eleanor roosevelt as an example of moral courage in the last hour on the last day of high school every one in her class was given a chance to stand up and say something her classmates mostly offered comic testimonials to each other she sang a gospel hymn that brought her friends to tears but when her education was complete , she relished a role in the cutthroat world of washington policy making now that the 35yearold professor has immersed herself in the academic life , some of her closest friends here at the university of oklahoma have trouble remembering any of her political beliefs beyond a deep commitment to the welfare of minority students on campus by all accounts she is an intensely private person who now finds herself in the most public of roles , a sometimes enigmatic individual who must now explain herself to the nation her family and friends point to her rigidly moral upbringing in rural morris , okla , that left her somewhat naive and more than a little idealistic sundays were spent with her family worshiping at the lone tree baptist church down the road from the family farm , where she is still known by her middle name it was n't no ifs , ands or buts , said professor hill s brother bill , a 54yearold horse trainer in tulsa , sitting outside the house in morris where he , professor hill and their 11 siblings grew up you were going to church it was n't a question of , 'are you going with us \?

seattle , may 6 he is not the first manager to go through this , but stump merrill has already begun to look like most of his yankee predecessors beleaguered and beaten with each mounting loss , growing older by the day and wary that somehow george steinbrenner is about to pounce again through the season s lows , merrill has gradually begun to show the effects of the constant losing , the 715record encouraged at the start of each day , he almost seems to age several years by the end of each night , looking weary and worn but prepared to offer small silver linings but when sunday s 16inning game was over , he was bent over in his chair and speechless reporters crowded around him , waiting for a word or two , then left when none came there is no real concern , of course , about steinbrenner , who was banished as the team s managing partner last summer but there is still an unmistakable sense that the 47yearold merrill , now a month into his first full season as manager , is conducting business like a man concerned for his future daily list of troubles he says he is not and he probably should n't be but the games make it clear that merrill is confronted daily with all sorts of troubles trying to keep players content , trying to overcome his pitching staff s deficiencies , trying to bolster the confidence of his young players and at the same time trying to win games he attempted to rally the yankees , some of whom have looked with skepticism at his managerial moves , by calling a closeddoor team meeting sunday afternoon but there was even some tentativeness to that decision because he first sought out two veterans , don mattingly and steve sax , to see if they agreed that a session was needed the intent of merrill s message was to shake the complacent attitude that burdened last season s team and that had already begun to permeate this club , which had the worst record in the major leagues as the week began and was 27 on its current trip to some extent , there were good things in the yankees' 54 loss to the seattle mariners that followed the meeting at least , that was the assessment of mattingly , the team captain outside of the physical things that happened , or did n't happen , he said , the way we approached the game was so much better we need to sustain that intensity as players that ca n't be done by anybody else if we play day in and day out like we did in this game , we 're going to win a lot of ball games it s coming but what of merrill \? certainly , he has made some debatable decisions , including several on sunday but robert nederlander , who now runs the team , said last week that merrill , a yankee loyalist for 15 years , was secure in his position and today , general manager gene michael bristled quickly , almost defensively , when merrill s name was mentioned 'way too early' look how early it is , he said sharply it s way too early the one one thing we do n't want to be criticized for is panicking the manager wants to win the players want to win panic is one thing i do n't want to be a part of but michael , who said he stayed awake through the entire 16inning defeat , surely must have wondered about some moves that transpired these , for instance why did merrill remove starter dave eiland in the sixth , after he had pitched five superb shutout innings \? and then why did he bring in greg cadaret , a lefthanded pitcher , to face lefthandedhitting pete o'brien after allowing eiland to give up a runscoring double to ken griffey jr , another lefthanded hitter \? why did he ask the third , fourth and fifth batters in his order mattingly , kevin maas and jesse barfield to bunt at various times \? their job is to drive in runs , not move runners over mattingly failed with a man on first base in the 10th , lined out to second and then retreated behind the dugout , where he could be seen throwing a chair why was jim leyritz playing third base in extra innings instead of the more capable randy velarde \? leyritz was guarding the line in the 12th , but a hard roller by matt sinatro still forced him to dive for the ball sinatro reached base on an infield hit and later scored velarde probably makes the play without diving in truth , merrill has left himself open to question for most of the season he promised the left fielder s job to hensley meulens in the spring , then did not finally give it to him until just last week in oakland and after uncertainty about his third basemen , he chose mike blowers to play every day but then suddenly put in leyritz , who had complained openly about a lack of playing time blowers s tryout lasted a full eight games the relief pitchers have wondered about their roles for some time steve farr and lee guetterman were supposed to be the team s closers , but there have been just two save opportunities in 22 games so they have often been called in with the yankees either tied or losing of the yankees' 15 defeats , 9 have come after the pitching staff failed to hold leads if he just used us in games where we could get a save , we would n't have pitched much , farr said but i know that if i was in a game where we scored and it was a save situation and i had already been used , i'm going to wish i was in that game right now , stump is playing like every game is the last game of the world series i do n't know if i blame him in the aftermath of his team meeting , merrill recalled telling the players that he believed the yankees could still win 85 games but at the rate they are going now , it is n't likely
the future belongs to freedom by eduard shevardnadze translated by catherine fitzpatrick 237 pp new york the free press 2295 last dec 20 , eduard shevardnadze , the soviet foreign minister , startled everyone including president mikhail s gorbachev , his close friend and fellow reformer by announcing that another dictatorship was looming and that he was quitting rather than defend perestroika the reformers have gone to seed , he told the supreme soviet dictatorship is coming i state this with complete responsibility no one knows what kind of dictatorship this will be and who will come what kind of dictator and what the regime will be like i want to make the following statement i am resigning let this be and do not respond , and do not curse me let this be my contribution , if you like , my protest against the onset of dictatorship it was a bizarre episode mr shevardnadze had not alerted mr gorbachev ahead of time of his decision it left the soviet leader embarrassed and faced with a barrage of questions mr shevardnadze had assiduously won the confidence of the two american secretaries of state he had worked with , george p shultz and james a baker , as an honest , courageous negotiator , and his resignation left mr baker without a close collaborator on the eve of the americanled air attacks on iraq yet his outburst had much less impact than he would have wanted , because it was so vague what dictatorship \? whom was he talking about \? he never amplified , even after he resigned so when it was announced that mr shevardnadze had written a book about his experiences as foreign minister , and was even rushing out a postcoup epilogue , it was fair to assume that he would flesh out the reasons behind his resignation in the epilogue , written just after the coup against mr gorbachev failed , he draws the conclusion that the dictatorship he warned about had actually occurred after my resignation , i reassured my friends and family again and again that i would be happy if my prediction did not come true , he says but it has , and i am anything but glad mr shevardnadze s reflections on the coup are similar to those of most liberals in the soviet union he blames mr gorbachev as he had by implication when he resigned for appointing the coup leaders to high office , and for not being true to his own ideals in putting down the growing band of conservatives and hardliners who finally struck on aug 18 when they launched their threeday putsch the future belongs to freedom shows the result of being written quickly it is not an easy book to read one tends to want to jump over the lengthy didactic passages for those dealing with actual events about which mr shevardnadze can write as a witness \( it has been competently translated by catherine fitzpatrick \) but unfortunately , the book lacks the kind of detail that would have made it something special often mr shevardnadze provides tantalizing hints that he could , if he chose , tell us something very useful about the behindthescenes maneuvering in the kremlin thus he explains how unhappy he was when he found out that the soviet military was violating the terms of the treaty reducing conventional arms , and he relates his irritation with those who attacked his acceptance of a unified germany and his cooperation with the united states against iraq but he does not bring us into the policymaking circles of the kremlin to learn how it was that mr gorbachev decided to let the berlin wall come down and germany be united , to pull the soviet troops out of afghanistan , to help settle the disputes in angola , cambodia and the middle east , to join with president bush against iraq and to agree to cut back substantially on soviet nuclear and conventional arms i should warn that readers will be disappointed if they expect this book to be the sensational story of the 'human factor' as exemplified by certain specific personages , he writes this book is not a political memoir the time has not yet come for that despite his reluctance to go very far inside the power structure , mr shevardnadze does provide some fresh material on his life in soviet georgia , that unique area of the caucasus whose history as an independent kingdom , and finally as a part of the russian empire , has always provided considerable grist for writers it was georgia , of course , that produced stalin , but as mr shevardnadze points out , stalin was not kind to his countrymen , and the purges were waged with just as much anger there as anywhere although his wife s father was a purge victim , mr shevardnadze s immediate family largely survived the bad times he rose to high office in the communist party , starting at the level of the komsomol , or young communist league he does not dwell on his time as head of the police in georgia but does acknowledge a cowardice in speaking out against injustice talking about the crackdown on dissidents in the soviet union that took place under leonid brezhnev , mr shevardnadze asks could i have prevented this or stopped it \? of course not but i was obligated to protest at the time , however , in the 1970s , i was not prepared to do so , either inwardly psychologically or politically he also criticizes himself for not speaking out when mr gorbachev instituted his antialcohol campaign soon after taking office in 1985 he says that he knew such a campaign would cause unnecessary hardship in georgia , which is the soviet union s largest producer of wines of most interest is mr shevardnadze s discussion about his relationship with mr gorbachev they both were komsomol leaders he from tbilisi and mr gorbachev from stavropol
warsaw , june 10 pope john paul ii used his nineday pilgrimage across his native poland to articulate a dynamic , evangelical vision for the roman catholic church in europe s postcommunist era in personal , often emotional pleas , he sounded a call to arms for a new crusade to reclaim territory lost to the communism of the soviet union and the secularism of western europe but as he concluded his visit with one last forceful exhortation in warsaw on sunday , it remained unclear whether this predominantly catholic nation of 38 million people was ready or even willing to assume its assigned role in moral vanguard the answer will not fully be known until later this year , when poland s first fully free parliamentary elections are likely to turn into a referendum on the issues raised by the pope , particularly a ban on abortion supported by the church and recently spurned by the legislators at issue will be nothing less than the soul of the polish church , and its future role in this nation where it played a pivotal role in the struggle against communism the debate rages well beyond intellectual circles , to the parishes in the countryside and industrial centers indeed , millions of catholic faithful are caught up in the question of whether their country should become the ireland of central europe , in which the law often supports the position of the church on social issues , or a more secular but still overwhelmingly catholic european nation like belgium or france in no uncertain terms , the pope has made it clear where he stands , as well as his fear that poland might be slipping from the church s grasp the man whose sonorous voice stirred the momentum for the solidarity movement in 1979 , and kept its spirit alive in 1983 and 1987 was transformed this year into a fistshaking warrior against western decadence when he spoke 12 years ago in victory square here , the theme was the biblical passages on spiritual renewal , and the target was the communist regime addressing a crowd of several hundred thousand on sunday , he aimed the same words at another enemy western consumerism 'think hard' about europe this humiliating argument is often raised that we are about to enter europe , the pope said we have to think hard over the reality of europe and europeaness 'let us live as if god did not exist at all , ' he continued this is part of the european spirit , a part of modern european tradition we have to think very hard about the multiple meaning of europeanism that is why we continuously talk about the need for a new evangelization a recent public opinion survey by poland s staterun television and radio suggests what has made the pope so angry , and why he chose the ten commandments as the text for his progress through poland the nationwide poll , conducted on the eve of the pope s arrival , received virtually no coverage from poland s newspapers , but its results were probably provided to the polish church hierarchy and perhaps even the pope himself the poll , which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three points , posed this question is it your opinion that the catholic church has the right to demand that people submit to it in the following matters \? eightyone percent of poles answered decidely no or probably no when asked about contraceptives 71 percent replied similarly about abortion 61 percent about extramarital relations , and 63 percent on divorces on the issue of abortion , 62 percent of those living in villages answered probably no or decidely no that rose to 81 percent in cities over 500 , 000 such as lodz , cracow or warsaw abortion has been a touchstone for this visit , one the pope returned to almost every day two weeks before the pope s arrival , the parliament shelved a churchsponsored bill that would have banned the procedure and imposed jail terms of up to two years on doctors who perform it the pope appeared to have been stunned by the rejection of legislation widely described as his welcoming gift the solidarity' perspective he likened abortion to the holocaust , and repeated the comparison after it drew criticism from european jewish groups speaking in the polish countryside , he directly assailed the polish parliament as was made clear by interviews with women pushing baby carriages in lodz , a grimy industial center about an hour from warsaw , there is a great deal of ambivalence and anguish on the issue in this country all the mothers said they were personally opposed to abortion , but none endorsed the abortion ban that had been sought by the church several women pointed to the wide gaps in the ages of their children as evidence of their commitment to the church s teaching on abortion one said she had been raised in an orphange and knew first hand the inadequacies of the alternative to abortion favored by the church although all but one of the young women agreed to be quoted by name , they spoke haltingly , and their faces often reflected the confusion and conflicting feelings stirred by the pope s emotional sermons one mother s view agata mastalerz , a 25yearold rigorous catholic who admires the pope , said she became pregnant last year abortion was out of the question she chose marriage , and four and half months ago gave birth to her daughter angnieszka he has an absolute right to talk about these matters , mrs mastalerz said of the pope s oratory i think poles needed something like this , she said everyone was in a good mood , everything was just fine , but it s not there are some cracks in the picture maybe this is something we needed we have all been taught about christ , who got angry and threw the moneylenders out of the temple maybe it is the same now but mrs mastalerz said she could not condemn women who chose abortion it s not something that should be legally restricted , she said the problem is in the soul , not the penal code
in my own private idaho , river phoenix plays the boy next door , except that next door is a ghetto where street youths sleep on the sidewalk as mike waters , a narcoleptic teenage hustler , mr phoenix s closest approximation to home is a ransacked , burnedout hotel his surrogate family is a rickety support system of street friends his knowledge of his real home consists of dim memories of his mother , a house whose color he ca n't remember , and a brother who lives somewhere in idaho in the film , which was shown at the new york film festival and opens today in new york and nationally oct 18 , mr phoenix wears no makeup , and there s a even pimple or two on his cheek his clothes are seedy , and his dirtybrown hair continually disheveled in other words , he strips mike of none of his grime in a performance that earned him the bestactor prize at this month s venice film festival he s put his lips as close to any streetgutter ooze as you can , mr phoenix says of his character his cutopen flesh is as close to a stone brick wall as anything he s part of the street he s like a rat mr phoenix s performance as mike , along with his role as an aggressive marine in the current film dogfight , represents a marked departure for an actor who has epitomized the more conventional version of the boy next door in the 1986 film stand by me he was a tough but tender smalltown teenager who goes on an adventure with three pals in the mosquito coast \( 1986 \) he played the earnest son of an idealistic inventor his portrayal of a brainy , sensitive piano student breaking free of his family in the 1989 film running on empty won him an academy award nomination even playing the young indiana jones in a bigbudget action film like indiana jones and the last crusade that same year , mr phoenix had the chance to grapple with the differences between right and wrong roles like these have made the 21yearold mr phoenix one of the most respected and popular young actors in hollywood the list of directors he has worked with includes sidney lumet , peter weir , rob reiner , steven spielberg and lawrence kasdan among his costars have been william hurt , harrison ford , christine lahti , kevin kline and sidney poitier river is the archetype of the young male lead , says gus van sant , the director of my own private idaho he had a slot that he was in , and that he s actually growing out of but at the time in hollywood , everyone with a project that had an 18yearold blondhaired , blueeyed kid would always say , 'we 're thinking of river phoenix in this part' in another sense , my own private idaho is simply an extreme , desanitized version of themes that have cropped up repeatedly in mr phoenix s films running on empty , the mosquito coast , little nikita and even stand by me addressed the meaning of family relationships and , in particular , the attempt to create a normal family situation under abnormal circumstances these problems are the primary motivation for mike waters , who eventually embarks upon a twisted , circular journey in search of his mother sitting in a japanese restaurant in the soho section of manhattan recently , mr phoenix at first dismisses these connections i do n't ever think of a project in reference to what i 've done in the past , he says it s isolated for me i ca n't think of it like that , because it becomes more of a format strategy any script is its own little time frame he stops short , momentarily diverted by a conversation between a man and a woman at the table next to him they 're talking about family , he adds , looking at the man he s talking about how this woman should leave the family and not be supported by her family , and get a job and not be like her older sister who s always coming back to the house for refuge it s just a universal thing mr phoenix grew up in a rather atypical household he was born in madras , ore , in 1970 a key location in my own private idaho , a long , flat stretch of road where mr phoenix begins and ends the film , is about 15 miles from his birthplace his parents were itinerant fruit pickers who moved the family to south america when river was 2 , while they worked as missionaries by the late 1970 s the family moved back to the united states , eventually winding up in los angeles it was there that young mr phoenix got his first exposure to movies before i came back to america , i thought features were kellogg s commercials and cartoons , he says then i saw a western , and i thought that companies paid people s families money to kill them i just believed it by the time he was 9 or 10 , his fascination with the mysteries of film making had inspired him to want to make them himself woody allen was the first time i really could not figure out how something could be so real , he says i was like , how can anything be this real yet contrived \? that question is what makes you want to find out mr phoenix made his film debut in the 1985 scifi adventure explorers , but it was stand by me and the mosquito coast the next year that brought him wider attention with the exception of a night in the life of jimmy reardon in 1988 , he has managed nicely to stay away from standard teenage roles throughout his career , mr phoenix has remained close to his family three years ago they settled in gainesville , fla , on what mr phoenix says is the first property my family and i ever purchased one brother , leaf , who is also an actor , recently accompanied him to the toronto film festival a sister , rainbow , performs with mr phoenix in a band called aleka s attic , which has played in new york clubs and appears on the compilation album tame yourself , made to benefit the animalrights organization people for the ethical treatment for animals i have much interest in why everyone thinks there s something uncanny and special about my family , says mr phoenix , when for me it was the norm i knew that something was terribly wrong in a general american way in america you do n't see honest bonding , you see a kind of politically correct family but you ca n't learn from reading selfhelp books you ca n't learn from reading parenting magazine it s taught by your parents unless you come from , like my parents , or my father especially , a completely abusive family but someone like mike , my character in 'idaho , ' he 'd probably be one of the best fathers , mr phoenix adds once he matures , he s going to have a family like no one s business photo river phoenixhis films are about trying to create normal families \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
milwaukee , july 23 for weeks , the residents of the oxford apartments , a beige cinderblock lowrise in a weathered north side neighborhood , knew something was terribly wrong in their building the stench of rotten meat wafted through the corridors there was the occasional hum of a buzz saw , and cursing and rumbling in one of the secondfloor apartments what the residents did not know and could not have imagined was that the tenant in apartment 213 had been storing the body parts of as many as 15 men in his onebedroom apartment in a macabre drama that played out late monday night and tuesday to a crowd of neighbors and gawkers , the milwaukee police removed three human heads stored in a refrigerator , boxes containing body parts , photographs of several victims and a barrel of acid the police said that the victims were black men and that the slayings , which they described as the grisliest murder case in the city s history , were related to deviant sexual behavior an escape and an arrest late monday night the police arrested a 31yearold white man , jeffrey l dahmer , after a man with a pair of handcuffs dangling from his wrists escaped from mr dahmer s apartment and told the police that mr dahmer had tried to kill him minutes later , mr dahmer allowed the police to enter his apartment , where the officers discovered a dresser drawer filled with photographs of mutilated bodies and a refrigerator with three preserved human heads no charges have yet been filed you think you 've seen it all out here , and then something like this happens , rolf mueller , one of two police officers who searched the apartment , told the milwaukee journal mr dahmer , until last week a worker at a chocolate factory , is on probation from a 1989 conviction for seconddegree assault of a 13yearold boy neighbors described him as a quiet loner who always wore the same dirty jeans and tshirt , rarely spoke to anybody and stood out as one of the few whites in a predominantly black and hispanic building he was often seen walking in the alley behind the apartment building , they said 'never looked you in the eye' until last week , when he was let go , mr dahmer worked as a laborer at the ambrosia chocolate company and once worked at a downtown blood bank he never looked you in the eye , said henry barnett , a neighbor he always looked down today , as the police and the county coroner and lawyers from a district attorney s office and the curious from all over the city took over their alley and backyard , neighbors tried to figure out how the unthinkable could have happened , even in a part of town that has grown accustomed to occasional gunfire pamela bass , who lives across the hall from mr dahmer , went over the apparent clues in her mind , the odd little things she noticed but then dismissed i would hear a buzz saw running in the early evening , mrs bass said i thought he was building something something s stinking again' she would hear cursing when she knew he was there alone , or thought he was then there was the stench , the smell of rotten meat or garbage , or , as one neighbor insisted , a dead rat in the vents the whole building complained of the stench but the smell was strongest near the back apartment on the second floor , and mrs bass repeatedly went to her neighbor to remind him to do something about it i would go tell him , 'jeff , something s stinking again , ' mrs bass said , adding that he was always polite he would say it was the rotten meat in his freezer he even bought a bunch of pine sol once like he was really going to get rid of it this time but it did n't help now she wonders if she could have helped prevent what happened maybe we should have thought something , mrs bass said but how could anybody know he was collecting dead bodies \? i did n't know what a dead body smells like all of the speculation offered little solace to the relatives of missing people who showed up at the crime scene hoping to get answers and finding none bernice lipsom came in search of clues to the disappearance of her 41yearold son aaron vickers , whom she last saw on june 10 she had dropped him off at the oxford apartments at his request since then he has not picked up his disability check and has not called her my heart dropped in the bottom of my stomach when i heard what happened here , mrs lipsom said either he s not able to talk or he s dead if he could talk he 'd call his momma if his body is in there , i want to know photo police officials in milwaukee examining a bag containing the remains of a human body yesterday outside an apartment where a large number of body parts were found jeffrey l dahmer , 31 years old , was arrested , and the authorities were investigating the possibility of as many as up to 15 deaths \( dal bayles for the new york times \)

mount vernon i do n't see why everybody s making such a fuss about us , said sarah delany , who turned 102 on thursday and was talking about herself and her little sister , dr elizabeth delany , who celebrated her 100th birthday on sept 3 the delany sisters , who live together in the house they bought here 34 years ago , are a little overwhelmed their birthdays have been recognized by the white house , gov mario m cuomo , mayor ronald a blackwood of mount vernon and even by willard scott , the weatherman on nbc s today show we 're not anything special , insisted sarah delany , who is called sadie we 're just two old maids maiden ladies , corrected her sister , known as bessie not old maids but if the sisters do n't see themselves as extraordinary , it is easy to see why others do for one thing , the sisters are as alert as 30yearolds they still maintain their finances and run the household without help on a recent afternoon , a visitor was welcomed into their victorianera living room , where crocheted doilies are draped across the backs of parlor chairs and a piano serves as the centerpiece of the room there was no date , name or other detail that the sisters could not recall about their centurylong lives and as for current events , the sisters read newspapers daily and watch the macneillehrer newshour on public television each weeknight they are women of considerable accomplishment , having had successful careers one as a dentist and the other , a teacher during an era when black women had very few opportunities how it was before jim crow laws the daughters of a slave , the delany sisters remember life in their native raleigh , nc , before the passage of jim crow laws that institutionalized segregation by race at the turn of the century as young women , they moved to new york city , living in harlem during its heyday in the 20 s and 30 s they have stories to tell the sisters attribute their longevity to their life style they perform yoga exercises each morning except sunday they never drink water from the tap without boiling it first they start the day with a swallow of cod liver oil and a chopped clove of garlic they attend st john , st paul and st clement episcopal church in mount vernon and hold daily prayer vigils at home and they enjoy each other s company the sisters added , in jest , that another reason they have lived so long is that neither one ever married we never had husbands to worry us to death , bessie delany said as for other secrets of longevity no drinking , no chewing , no smoking , said sadie delany , sweetly but firmly and always clean your plate the delany sisters were born on the campus of st augustine s college , a school for blacks in raleigh where their father , henry beard delany , was a teacher and administrator and their mother , nanny james delany , was the matron supervising daytoday operations their father was born into slavery in st mary s , ga , on the coast near the florida border his people were all 'house niggers , ' sadie delany said they never worked in the fields henry beard delany was 6 years old when the surrender came , she said , referring to gen robert e lee s surrender to the union at appomattox court house their mother was an issuefree negro whose ancestry was mostly white and who could have passed as a white woman if she had wanted to , the sisters said an issuefree negro was an individual who had some black ancestry but whose mother was a free person when their father was a young man , a white episcopal priest encouraged him to get an education and become a minister thus , their father began a long career as a distinguished theologian , eventually becoming the first elected black bishop of the episcopal church in america a strict upbringing the sisters recalled that their parents were strict and held high expectations there were 10 children as adults , they all enjoyed successful careers among them were two dentists , a doctor , two lawyers \( one of whom became a judge \) and three teachers besides sadie and bessie , another sister , 87yearold laura edith murrell of oakland , calif , is also alive the family was poor , the sisters said , and the siblings worked and saved to pay for college we had everything a family could want except money , bessie delany said we did n't have one cent as young girls , the sisters said , their lives changed abruptly with the passage , around 1900 , of the jim crow laws suddenly , everything was different , bessie delany said all of a sudden , she recalled , we were told we had to sit in the back of the streetcars before that , we sat anywhere we wanted to they remember the day when they went to johnson s drug store in raleigh for a limeade , as was their custom , only to be told they would no longer be served and they vividly recall the day they went to a spring to get water and found that a divider had been placed across the middle of the spring , along with a sign on one side that read whites only \( when no one was looking , bessie delany reached across the divider and dipped water from the white side we were children , after all , she said \) era of signs and lynchings
after nine years of strategic arms reduction talks , the us and the soviet union have nearly completed a 450page draft treaty that s half the length of the brothers karamazov , which took dostoyevsky only two and a half years to write but then dostoyevsky did n't have to get washington and moscow to agree on every comma three unsolved issues remain none has much military consequence all are politically nettlesome but agreement can surely be reached in time for a treaty signing this month one point in contention is access to data from missile flight tests these data are beamed back to earth in coded form to prevent eavesdropping in broad terms , the draft gives washington what it long sought , a ban on coded transmissions however , the devil remains in the details , which are secret the two sides have different means of transmitting data drafting more specific provisions to give each side equivalent access can be complicated but it s not beyond the wit of experts a second unresolved issue is how many warheads may be removed or downloaded from existing missiles missiles are now armed with as many as 10 warheads start usefully encourages a shift to missiles with fewer warheads an expensive way to do that is to build new singlewarhead missiles a cheaper fix is to remove warheads from existing missiles if the us removed two of the three warheads from its minuteman missiles , it could keep all 550 of the missiles , leaving more for the soviets to worry about both sides would also enhance stability if they reduced the warheads on their submarines that would allow them to keep more subs and still meet the ceilings the soviets have done just that by reducing the number of warheads on all 224 of their sublaunched ssn18 missiles they 've replaced the sevenwarhead front end of these missiles with a threewarhead model still , hardline critics , some of whom openly oppose the treaty , say the soviets could reinstall the sevenwarhead front ends but us satellites could easily detect soviet efforts to retrofit lots of missiles and even if the soviets did restore the warheads , the numbers involved would n't upset the military balance under a treaty that already allows each side to retain 9 , 000 warheads that has n't kept treaty critics from focusing on the risks of uploading instead of on the benefits of downloading the more downloading allowed , they contend , the greater the threat that moscow will upload later catching america by surprise to defuse that charge , washington seeks to limit downloading to 1 , 000 warheads moscow favors a lower quota , but one that does not count the 896 ssn18 warheads they 've already reduced the third issue is related another way to exceed the ceilings would be to modify an existing missile slightly , call it a new type and say it has fewer warheads even though it could be uploaded to bar that , the us wants to define a new type as having , among other things , 30 percent less payload than its predecessor moscow says 15 percent these historic talks have come far it would be folly not to split the few remaining differences
waikoloa , hawaii , july 10 although the solar eclipse on thursday will not be total anywhere on the united states mainland , people in most parts of the country will see at least a bite taken out of the sun in san diego , at 11 30 am , the moon will cover 78 percent of the sun , causing a noticeable darkening in new york city , the maximum extent of the eclipse will occur at 3 35 pm , but since the city is relatively distant from the path of totality , only 7 percent of the sun will will not been seen the path of totality , within which the sun s face will be completley obscured , will extend from the central pacific ocean across the island of hawaii to baja california in mexico and then through central america to brazil the eclipse will be at its longest 6 minutes , 581 seconds over the gulf of california and will be nearly that long over the southern tip of baja california weather conditions along the path of totality are uncertain , with the clearest sky forecast for hawaii and somewhat poorer prospects in central america experts warn that direct viewing of the sun without eye protection is dangerous , except when the sun is totally eclipsed cnn , the television news network , said it would probably show the eclipse live but did not know from which country it would be broadcast the three major commerical television networks said they would show tapes of the eclipse on their regular news programs some people will view the partially eclipsed sun by allowing its light to pass through a pinhole punched in aluminum foil on a cardboard box , projecting an image from white paper inside the box others will look at the sun through welder s extradark goggles or through blackened xray negatives photographers are warned that none of the usual camera filters can protect either a camera or the eye behind it from the sun s radiation , which can cause permanent damage in a matter of seconds camera lenses should be fitted with special reflective filters designed for solar photography , or covered with aluminized mylar plastic sheeting although viewers of the sun should take precautions to avoid eye injury , astromers lament the prohibition against eclipsewatching sometimes imposed by teachers on school classes dr jay m pasachoff , professor of astronomy at williams college in massachusetts , warned eclipsewatchers here against fears that can spoil the pleasure of an eclipse there have been sad cases in which teachers have locked their students in windowless cafeterias , lest the children be blinded by looking at an eclipse , he said this is the worst kind of ignorance

snieckus , lithuania , sept 1 it is thrilling to be a lithuanian these days , but not so comfortable to be one of lithuania s more than 300 , 000 russians for years , russians here enjoyed a feeling of absolute freedom , and at times even a sense that they were bosses lithuania was under the kremlin s thumb , the russian language was required in all schools , and many people believed it would ever be so but suddenly all that has changed lithuania is racing toward independence , and many russians fear that the good life they have enjoyed here for years may be threatened russians in the other baltic republics share the same concern in latvia and estonia , they form about a third of the population russians build a town russians make up nearly 10 percent of lithuania s population of 36 million , and their concentration is greatest in snieckus , 120 miles northeast of vilnius , where the soviet authorities decided in the 1970 s to build a giant nuclear power plant they sent more than 10 , 000 russians here as construction workers , engineers and technicians the area chosen for the plant is one of the most scenic and pristine in the baltic region forests stretch for miles in every direction , and deep blue lakes are filled with fish there was no town here , though , and the russians' first task was to build one they did a good job snieckus is a town of handsome apartment buildings separated from one another by large groves of trees there are movie theaters , restaurants , schools and other amenities life here is far more pleasant than in many parts of the soviet union the power plant itself is a couple of miles outside town only two of its projected five reactors are complete , but the plant already supplies energy not only to lithuania , but also to latvia , estonia , byelorussia , and even the region around leningrad few russians who live here want to return to russia they believe they will be treated well by the lithuanian government , but cannot escape a sense of unease better life was the lure i came here because i was offered a good job , better than i could have had back in leningrad , and because i had the chance to have my own apartment , said a worker who was strolling through an outdoor market with his wife today i feel at home here what the future holds , i ca n't say all of us have grown up with the bolshevik mentality , he continued i'm afraid that at some point , the people in power here will start using the old methods our greatest hope is that we will be protected by what is written in the yeltsin treaty on july 29 , the russian republic s president , boris n yeltsin , and his lithuanian counterpart , vytautas landsbergis , signed an agreement that guarantees that the russian minority here , as well as the lithuanian minority in russia , will not be discriminated against in any way most snieckus residents who voted last year on the question of lithuanian independence cast their ballots in favor so did most poles , who constitute lithuania s secondlargest minority but the poles , who make up about 7 percent of the population , face fewer problems than russians in the new lithuania they share with lithuanians not only the roman catholic religion , but also deep anticommunist sentiments no flag is raised the russian minority s uncertainty here is reflected in myriad ways in snieckus , as in the rest of lithuania , today was the first day of the school year at a welcoming ceremony at the largest of this town s four schools , the school authorities , not certain whether to raise the soviet flag , the lithuanian flag , the russian flag or some combination , discreetly decided to raise none at all most people who live in snieckus have been here for 10 or 12 years , said the school s principal , olga lachotskoyo it s a town of young families , with lots of children life is very comfortable some people ca n't change their attitudes and accept lithuania as an independent state , but most of us are calm i think relations will remain normal maybe they will even improve some russians here say that when they travel to other parts of lithuania , they are now afraid to speak russian in public others say they have been insulted on the street with taunts of occupier ! or worse but most agree that the average lithuanian is tolerant , and free of true antirussian prejudice changes are predicted outside the power plant , several workers sitting in the sun said they were now trying to learn a bit of the lithuanian language we 're not worried about losing our jobs , because there are n't many lithuanians trained to do this kind of work , one said but the situation here is going to change exactly how , we do n't know another change may be increased pressure from environmentalists the power plant here was built to the same specifications as the one in chernobyl , and although some improvements were made after the disastrous accident at chernobyl , some say it is still unsafe i'm not afraid that the lithuanians will throw us out , one worker said but if the green movement manages to close the plant , then we 'll all be in trouble map of the lithuania , indicating snieckus graphs the baltic states , showing a breakdown of ethnic makeup of the populations of estonia , latvia and lithuania \( source the europa world yearbook \)
houston , june 10 dwight gooden , who had done most of his suffering on the mound of late , tonight did it in the clubhouse the sounds of a teammate being taken apart and a game going to pieces with it were being manufactured at the other end of a long tunnel in the basement of the astrodome gooden , whose performance tonight represented a personal relief , if not a full recovery , from his recent pitching troubles , had barely exited before his efforts went up in the smoke coming off the bats of the astros the astros , blistering one of the game s premier relievers , struck for four runs off john franco in the eighth inning to reverse a tworun deficit and go on to a 64 triumph over the mets no excuses from franco franco , bothered by back spasms and haunted by an unending series of badluck and subpar appearances , gave up consecutive singles to steve finley and craig biggio before loading the bases with none out by walking mark davidson one out later , jeff bagwell hooked a ferocious double inside third off franco \( 15 \) to score two runs and rafael ramirez stroked a tworun single immediately thereafter as the astros earned a split of their fourgame series with the mets the back is no excuse there are no excuses , said franco my job is to be out there i had to be out there and what i did was a pitiful job gooden looked to be the probable victor after hubie brooks , whose homer in the sixth had made the score 31 , added a runscoring double to make it 42 in the top of the eighth gooden struck out five and walked none while being victimized for seven hits and two runs over seven innings of work 'not quite there' for gooden , the project of returning to form is not over first , he and the mets will have to rebound from a deeply disturbing loss , one that provided the sorriest sort of conclusion to a wildly turbulent 76 trip that wound up leaving them six games back of the pirates i'm not quite there , but i'm going in the right direction , said gooden i 'd never lost confidence or faith in myself tonight , i had more concentration from pitch to pitch and got an idea of what i wanted to with each of them i got ahead and hit spots and then came the eighth , which struck like a kick in the stomach gooden , who confessed he was tiring , said he had no argument with manager bud harrelson s decision to go with franco for the final two innings i do n't secondguess the move at all , said gooden , who had lasted just four innings in his most recent outing and who had given up 42 hits and 23 earned runs over his last 22 and onethird innings beforetonight it 'd been a while since i 'd been out there that long harrelson said he was confident franco s back was healthy enough to withstand two innings i thought it was the perfect spot for john , with the lefthanded hitters stacked up and a tworun lead , said harrelson the scenario turned out bad there was an infield single , a bloop single to right , a walk the rest is history and with it , a 13game trip full of turmoil , a trade , a dugout scrap , one freakish loss in st louis and several crushing defeats against the reds and astros the 76 record after a 40 start to the trip left a lot of room for varying perspectives perhaps the most frightening realization is that the mets could well have lost all four games here to the astros , a team with the worst record in the major leagues and the poorest pitching in the national league you look at 76 and say we could have gone 103 or we could have gone 67 , said dave magadan a lot of crazy things happened and john franco blowing a save is a strange thing and in that , a perfect ending to a long , strange trip inside pitch educated guess tom herr will be traded within the week herr , the veteran second baseman benched with the infield switch that sent gregg jefferies back to second , has n't started in weeks and is making 14 million he s gone , said a source familiar with the situation who requested anonymity you think they 're going to let him be a 14 million cheerleader \? garry templeton , in a move that underlined the team s concern with kevin elster s shoulder , started at shortstop again i'm not overly concerned with elster , but it s going to take time for full strength to return , said manager bud harrelson the gas is n't there sid fernandez , coming back from a broken left wrist , pitched batting practice to teammates for the first time today it s frustrating , said fernandez i thought it 'd be easier i thought i 'd be better photo mets' dwight gooden pitching in the second inning last night in houston gooden allowed two runs and seven hits over seven innings \( associated press \)
heaven and hell more americans now believe in heaven and hell than ever recorded before by the gallup poll consistent with earlier findings , however , americans are still far more likely to believe that they are going to heaven than the alternative in the latest such poll , conducted by telephone among 1 , 108 americans in november , 78 percent said they believed there was a place where people who had led good lives were eternally rewarded on the subject of hell , 60 percent said they believed there was a place where those who led bad lives and died without repentance were eternally damned the previous gallup records for these beliefs came in a 1952 survey , in which 72 percent said they believed in heaven and 58 percent believed in hell the poll is conducted annually of those in the latest poll who said they believed in heaven , 78 percent said their chances of getting there were good or excellent of those who said they believed in hell , only 4 percent said their chances of going there were good or excellent those who claimed no religion and those who did not belong to a church were most likely to express concern about going to hell the poll s margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points no new name for god the phrase in the name of the creator , redeemer and sanctifier is not so familiar as in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit , but some pastors prefer it when performing baptisms they say it avoids the malecenteredness of traditional christianity but the conference of bishops of one major protestant denomination says the new language is inappropriate we must be pastoral and sensitive in speaking to the issues of our time , said a recent statement adopted by the bishops of the evangelical lutheran church in america yet we must also be responsible in maintaining the integrity of our orthodox christianity the document , prepared by bishop william h lazareth of the metropolitian synod of new york , goes on to say that the use of both masculine and feminine analgies , similes and symbols can be appropriate but it adds , none of these diversified figures of speech may rightly be employed as exchangeable equivalents of god s name 'father , son and holy spirit' happy in their work roman catholic priests who were ordained in the early 1980 s say they are generally happy in their work and would enter the priesthood if faced with the decision again , a new survey has found but the survey s respondents did have some criticisms for example , among parish priests , an overwhelming majority faulted life in the rectory , saying they would like to choose their own living arrangements but the overall findings are in sharp contrast with many reports of low morale among catholic priests , said the rev robert wister , executive director of the national catholic education association , which conducted the study through responses to mailed questionnaires by 1 , 519 priests ordained from 1980 to 1984 about 62 percent of the questionnaires were returned seminary enrollments have drastically dropped in the last 20 years the survey appears to support the argument that candidates in the last decade , though fewer in number , are better prepared for the demands of the priestly life of those who responded , 90 percent said they were happy with their work , and 80 percent said they would join the priesthood again koran in tennessee priests , ministers and rabbis frequently lead the opening prayers in legislatures around the country but on march 7 , imam ilyas muhammad became a pioneer of sorts when he chanted from the koran before the tennessee state senate this marks a first for tennessee government and , to my knowledge , a first for america , that a representative of the islamic faith has been granted the opportunity to lead the senate or house in prayer , he told the legislators the 62yearold imam is the leader of the american muslim community center in nashville he was invited to the legislature by state senator thelma harper of nashville , after complaints from some lawmakers that there was too much jesus in the prayers of ministers who opened legislative sessions and that this was unfair to the diversity of tennessee religious life
washington , oct 15 in his last full day as the nation s senior banking regulator , l william seidman said he would have left more than a year ago had he not been assailed by the white house chief of staff , john h sununu absolutely no question about it , mr seidman said as he prepared to relinquish the chairmanship of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the resolution trust corporation referring to his visit to the white house in the spring of 1990 and the personality clash with mr sununu , who sought very publicly then to push him out the door , mr seidman said , i went over there with the purpose of arranging an amicable , friendly and smooth transition in an interview over sandwiches in his bare sixthfloor corner office overlooking the washington monument and the mall , mr seidman made these other points none of the nation s largest banks are in danger of failing in the first three months of next year , the fdic may be forced to consider another increase in the premiums it charges banks to insure deposits the administration s attack on bank examiners and regulators , accusing them of helping cause tighter credit , could lead to dangerously lax supervisory standards as long ago as 1986 , senior regulators , including himself , saw many of the warning signs for the crises now afflicting the banking and savings and loan industries but did not move vigorously enough to contain the problems if the economy grows next year at a rate slower than 35 percent to 4 percent , as measured by the gross national product , the costs of bailing out banks and savings and loans might be significantly higher than current administration estimates many economists have forecast a growth rate lower than that , but mr seidman stood by the administration s estimates today he did say , however , that the estimates might be revised based on a new fdic review that will be sent to the office of management and budget this month mr seidman leaves office as the bank insurance fund is on the verge of borrowing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars and regulators are seeking another 80 billion for the savings and loan rescue in his six years as its outspoken chairman , he has built the fdic from a backwater agency to one of the most powerful institutions in the nation , doling out billions of dollars in contracts and determining the fate of the country s most important financial institutions he also supervised the growth of resolution trust into one of the largest financial institutions in the world , but one that is struggling to unload a huge portfolio of real estate at points during the hourandahalf interview , the 71yearold regulator from east grand rapids , mich , recounted his ups and downs with the bush administration and his running battles with congress and its investigative arm , the general accounting office other times he was politely evasive , clearly saving his juiciest anecdotes for his memoirs a rough draft the first chapter on the administration , he said , starts out with the sentences 'if there was one thing i learned in my first tour of duty in washington , it was not to get in a battle with the president s chief of staff here follows the story of how i was unable to carry that out' he said he would disclose his future plans , besides writing the book , on wednesday he said that while the savings and loan bailout would probably wind up costing 250 billion , as a practical matter , americans would pay for it forever because of the longterm borrowing costs he said it would be unwise to pay for the bailout costs now by either raising taxes or cutting other federal programs , particularly as the economy struggles to rebound he also took a swipe at the general accounting office , which in recent months forced the fdic to drastically lower its valuation of the bank insurance fund from about 8 billion to about 4 billion and refused to certify the finances of resolution trust while acknowledging the accounting office s legitimate role as as auditor , he criticized it for issuing what he said were misleading news releases they should stop acting like they were a part of the ball game instead of an observer , he said in looking back at how the banking industry s troubles grew , mr seidman recalled that as early as 1986 he had spoken about how banks were making too many risky loans and that private and public debt was growing at unprecedented rates yellow light , red light i said in a speech in 1986 in san francisco that we must decrease high debt levels and proceed with care and that the flashing yellow caution light is operational , he said the mistake was that i should 've said the red light is flashing , not the yellow light recalling his speech , which denounced large debt levels , he said , what i'm saying is my greatest regret is that i did n't listen to what i said carefully enough of the economy and the weak condition of many large banks , mr seidman observed banks are so time sensitive because the longer recession lasts , the more capital is used up for those who are losing money if we see an estimate that s higher than 10 billion in losses to the bank insurance fund , then i think we will have to raise bank premiums photo l william seidman returned to his office in downtown washington after lunch yesterday , his last full day as the chairman of the fdic \( george tames for the

the atlanta braves will be the epitome of ubiquity this weekend consider this bravesastros schedule tonight s game will air on both tbs and espn tomorrow afternoon s game will be on cbs sunday s game will be on tbs , and if it means anything , espn will be there , too and if the braves and the los angeles dodgers tie after sunday , the playoff game will be carried on espn at the lovely hour of 10 30 pm in the east this kind of attention is naturally welcome in the land of the peach and fulfills owner ted turner s longtime boast on superstation tbs that the braves were america s team tbs s braves ratings reflect the turnaround the september 1990 to september 1991 nielsen ratings jumped from 13 to 27 the total 1991 braves rating is up to 20 from 17 in 1990 that s not a lot for a network with 58 million homes or compared with the 22 rating the braves recorded in 1988 , but not bad considering the glut of baseball on national tv this kind of turnaround does n't automatically generate a large advertising windfall that will happen next year for this season , any unsold commercial spots were swallowed quickly as the pennant race heated up it used to be i 'd ask someone to buy spots in september and they 'd hang the phone up , said david levy , vice president of sports sales for the turner broadcasting system , the parent company of tbs and the braves but we 've never been this sold out so late in the season company officials are expecting to raise their rates and sell at least 30 percent more revenues on braves games next year but it s hard to tell how much the increased tv revenues \( or doubled ticket sales at atlanta fulton county stadium \) will sweeten tbs s bottom line last year , the company reported a 162 million operating loss on 347 million in revenues from the braves the brotherly connection between superstation tbs and the braves allows the company to do some fancy accounting regarding what it pays for the rights to braves' games usually , a tv or cable outlet buys the rights from a team here , 34 million was transferred between company segments to the braves a mere 34 million for tv rights to a team that reaches nearly 60 million homes seems oddly low in light of the braves' renaissance and the much larger fees paid in other markets but as terry mcguirk , the executive vice president of turner broadcasting , says , with a chuckle , going into this year , what would you have paid to air braves' games \? that was then but this is now a pennant race so tbs and cbs and espn are capitalizing as much as they can tbs was n't going to carry the sunday game , but now it will , in the process shifting live coverage of the mello yello 500 nascar race to tape delay cbs juggled its saturday schedule to accommodate a split national schedule of the bravesastros and the dodgersgiants the new york market is not yet scheduled to see the braves game , but cbs will bring it in if the braves go up a game in the standing after tonight if the teams remain knotted or the dodgers are ahead , new yorkers will see the dodgersgiants espn will coexist with tbs tonight \( airing a bostonmilwaukee backup game in the atlanta market \) , possibly again on sunday and also has the rights to the possible monday playoff the monday game will begin at 10 30 largely because of the braves' crosscountry travel plans to los angeles if the braves and the dodgers are tied after sunday , the atlantans wo n't alight in los angeles until early monday , making untenable an afternoon game that would fit primetime needs in the east we have the option in our agreement with espn to schedule the games whenever it is best for baseball , said dave alworth , major league baseball s director of broadcasting it was best to schedule a normal night game an odd sidelight for the playoff game , espn is required to make its signal available to local tv stations in los angeles and atlanta to accommodate viewers without cable the game was sold in los angeles to the dodgers' tv outlet , kttvtv in atlanta , it was not sold to tbs \( because of complications surrounding its superstation status \) or to the cbs affiliate , waga , the logical second choice it will be on the nbc affiliate , wxia
arco will announce today that it has developed a gasoline as cleanburning as methanol that would cut some pollutants by more than a third the company does not plan to produce this more expensive fuel unless it is ordered to , but since it is certain to be ordered to do something , it clearly wants to take the initiative later this year california is expected to issue new fuel regulations , and the oil company s announcement is apparently an effort to shape those rules and head off requirements that would be more difficult for the company to meet while arco sells gasoline primarily in california , the fuel would have national implications if it is actually as clean as methanol , probably stifling the development of that alternative similar announcements seen airpollution experts said , however , that they were not surprised at the development , and some expected similar announcements from other companies as they try to avoid losing part of the transportation fuel market or being ordered to make fuels that would require extensive changes in their refineries one air pollution expert , michael bradley , director of the northeast states for coordinated air use management , said that oil companies were all of a sudden doing some very amazing refinements to gasoline , because they were faced with the possibility that methanol or other alternative fuels would be mandated in the last two years nine oil companies , led by arco , have introduced reformulated gasolines in selected grades , on a voluntary basis , to cut air pollution but the new fuel , which would not affect a car s performance , is a more radical change in formula , and would be for all grades arco said it would not actually sell the fuel unless required by new regulations , because it would cost 15 to 20 cents more a gallon to produce the company s earlier reformulated gasolines also cost more to produce , it said , but have been sold at competitive prices california , with the nation s worst smog problem by far , intends to adopt stricter gasoline standards later this year , but has not yet given details arco s chairman , lodwrick m cook , said in a telephone interview that making methanol would require a price increase three times as large as the company s new gasoline , and would require new refinery equipment , new trucks to bring the methanol to filling stations , new pumps and then new vehicles to burn the methanol in we have 180 million vehicles on the road that burn gasoline , he said by reformulating gasoline , he added , we can make an impact in the next 15 years at the california air resources board , in sacramento , william sessa , a spokesman , said the board s scientists were still testing the new fuel and that it is n't clear to us that it is as clean as m85 , a blend that is 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline , a combination favored by the oil and auto industries but he added , it s clear that they 're going in the same direction as we are the los angeles times reported major details about the announcement yesterday fuel is called ecx the new fuel is called ecx , for emission control experimental the company introduced ec1 , a replacement for leaded gasoline in old cars with no modern pollutioncontrol equipment , in september 989 , and a year later introduced ecpremium as a replacement for its premium grade since then , chevron , conoco , diamond shamrock , exxon , marathon , phillips , shell and sun have all announced reformulated gasolines in some grades in some locations other oil companies , notably texaco and mobil , have been waiting to see what new regulations will require some states have tightened their rules on fuel composition , and the clean air act is expected to result in changes in fuel in urban areas around the country some changes have already been made three years ago mr bradley s organization won agreement by the six new england states plus new york and new jersey to order the oil companies to reduce the tendency of gasoline sold in the region to evaporate before burning such evaporative emissions are a major cause of smog at the time , the oil companies complained that they could not comply , or that cars would not start on the reformulated fuel , or that prices would skyrocket and shortages would develop , none of which came to pass 'undergone a renaissance' the whole process of looking at gasoline has undergone a renaissance , he said , especially when there s regulatory goals set down and the oil industry is in a position where they may lose some of their market share california gave notice in september that it would issue stricter fuel standards this fall one california air official said , every oil company is in their chemistry lab right now trying to come up with some combination better suited to them than to somebody else in the highprofile world of gasoline , arco has shown considerable political savvy in recent years during the price runup in august , following the iraqi invasion of kuwait , the company froze its prices that created lines of cars in front of its stations , which were eventually pumped dry , but arco won nationwide attention mr cook is a friend of president bush and a major contributor to the republican party he has intermittently been rumored to be in line for a political appointment in washington available to all arco s ecx recipe , like the two earlier reformulated grades , does not include any proprietary ingredients in fact , mr cook said the technical details would be made available to anyone who wanted them while the new fuel is designed to meet california standards , the company says the fuel also meets the standards of the new clean air act that are due to take effect in 1995 , and the stricter standards scheduled for 2005 ecx cuts emissions of unburned hydrocarbons from the tailpipe by 28 percent , the company said , and evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons that is , releases before the fuel goes through the engine by 36 percent nitrogen oxide emissions are cut by 26 percent these three emissions , plus sunlight , are the ingredients of groundlevel ozone , more commonly known as smog the reactivity of the exhaust , or its ability to produce ozone , has been cut 37 percent , the company said the fuel also cuts carbon monoxide , which is a product of partial combustion , by 25 percent , and toxic compounds are cut by 47 percent these changes were achieved by making several alterations in the fuel , according to arco hydrocarbons can combine with sulfur to create pollution , so sulfur content has been cut oxygencontaining molecules have been added to reduce the production of carbon monoxide , and the reid vapor pressure , a measure of the ability of gasoline to evaporate , has been reduced
santa cruz , calif , april 4 while california lawmakers wrestle with a record budget deficit , the superintendent of schools in this beachfront city hunches over his ledgers , looking for programs to cut and teachers to dismiss from a nearbankrupt school system where fat has long since given way to bone the choices are grim , said the superintendent , dale e kinsley can he expect teachers who have been sent pink slips to continue to spend their own money for classroom supplies \? can he ask principals to give up weekends to paint dilapidated school buildings \? can he dismiss more custodians without leaving the schools unsafe and unsanitary \? can he trim counselors without abandoning abused or suicidal children \? can he cancel music lessons in elementary school , dropout prevention classes in junior high and sports programs in high school , which are among the few specials activities left for the 8 , 400 students here \? how far do you go before you say this is not an acceptable environment for students to learn in \? asked mr kinsley , whose district is one of two dozen in the state on the brink of bankruptcy there s not much more i can do here without closing the doors , handing the keys over to the state and saying , 'you guys run it' more and more of less mr kinsley could barely balance his budget when gov pete wilson was projecting a 7 billion budget shortfall for the state and calling for 2 billion in cuts in public education but now it is clear that the financial picture is far bleaker with a gap of 126 billion , a deficit larger than the general funds of all but four other states , public education is expected to lose even more how do we do the same with less , less , less \? asked dan cavanaugh , the principal of the bay view elementary school here , where the custodian already doubles as the playground attendant and the kindergarten teachers sell flavored ices to pay for art supplies public education was once a jewel in california s crown but the state that was consistently in the top 10 in the 1960 s and early 70 s has fallen to the middle or the bottom of the pack in indicators like perstudent spending and studentteacher ratio the precipitous decline in the last decade , experts say , is largely the result of a 1978 ballot measure that limited local property taxes , which are a major source of school financing elsewhere in the nation the current recession has plunged many other states into budget crises that are likely to squeeze the public schools , but none are shackled like california in ability to tax and spend locally for education california spends 4 , 598 a student , 24th in the nation , with new york in first place at 8 , 439 these numbers are for the 198990 school year , the most recent data available from the national education association and the federal department of education a city of new pupils a year complicating matters further in california is the staggering population growth , which has swamped a school system of 53 million with more than 200 , 000 new students a year , many of them poor , minority youngsters who speak little english and require extra attention the studentteacher ratio here is 227 , ranking california 50th in the nation , although actual class size is considerably larger because of the number of specialized teachers connecticut , with 131 students for each teacher , ranks first in this category california s public schools , excluding the public university system , gobble 40 percent of the state budget , or 253 billion out of 557 billion , a level guaranteed by another of the ballot measures that complicates governance here to cut the education budget below the 40 percent mark , as governor wilson suggests , the legislature must suspend that 1988 measure by a twothirds vote the alarming deficit projections make a suspension likely education advocates recognize that the budget crisis is unlikely to be solved without slashing school spending , but they argue that taxes should be raised to limit the damage i understand the governor is in a tough place , said bill honig , the state superintendent of public education and a defender of guaranteed school spending but it all comes down to choices the cuts that are contemplated will set this state back for a decade from one end of california to the other , educators are braced for a hard fight recent school board meetings have been crowded , rowdy affairs at a demonstration last week at the state capitol in sacramento , 8 , 000 protesters carried balloons saying save our kids and placards demanding schools , not prisons among the protesters were four teachers from bakersfield , with 80 years of experience among them the morning before the demonstration , they visited old sacramento , a riverside reconstruction of a frontier town , complete with a oneroom school with handpump and woodburning stove it s better than what i 've got right now , said pam baugher , who teaches fifth and sixth grade in a school where the pipes burst in december s freeze and have yet to be repaired such tales of woe have grown more common as districts consider the new round of cuts
washington , sept 4 two years after senator robert c byrd was named chairman of the senate appropriations committee , he declared that he intended to become a billiondollar industry what he planned to do , he explained in june 1990 , was use his new power to funnel a billion dollars' worth of federal projects and agencies into his impoverished state i hope to become west virginia s billiondollar industry , the senator told a crowd in clarksburg i expect during my term to bring at least a billion dollars to west virginia in projects that i put into the bill he has almost succeeded , much to the delight of his constituents , much to the sorrow of other legislators and much to the despair of some government employees who find themselves headed for work in the hills and hollows of west virginia rather than the bureaucratic warrens of washington true to his word in less than three years as appropriations chairman , mr byrd has steered more than 750 million worth of federal projects and agencies and more than 3 , 000 federal jobs out of washington and toward his constituents the federal bureau of investigation s new 185 million fingerprint center will soon be built in clarksburg , bringing in 2 , 600 new jobs his latest target is the central intelligence agency he wants it to shift 3 , 000 of its jobs to west virginia in all , mr byrd has shunted so many federal dollars and jobs toward west virginia that some of his capitol hill colleagues are gearing up to oppose further such efforts after almost four decades on capitol hill , including an 11year tour as the senate democratic leader before taking over the appropriations panel in 1988 , mr byrd , who is 73 years old , is demonstrating anew that he can play the congressional power game as well as anyone around , especially when it comes to pork barrel politics this nation is made up of local interests , he is fond of saying the sources of power the senate appropriations committee is one of the biggest repositories of project financing , or political pork , on the hill , and mr byrd has dipped into it without hesitation to aid friends in the senate and the people back home , thereby strengthening both himself and his state this willingness to use such power , along with seemingly tireless drive and a prodigious knowledge of senate rules and procedure , has enabled mr byrd to run the appropriations committee with a sureness not seen in years persausive , senator jim exon , a nebraska democrat , said after the softvoiced but intense west virginian recently persuaded him to vote in favor of an increase in congressional pay the bill languished until mr byrd took it up as one of his causes a oneman industry \? but nothing mr byrd has done since becoming appropriations chairman stands out so spectacularly as what he has done for west virginia he has become the most important economic factor in our state , said bob brunner , an aide to gov gaston caperton there s no way to overstate his achievements the expanded office of the bureau of debt is going up in parkersburg , where it will create 700 new jobs and the fish and wildlife service s new 25 million training center is in harper s ferry charleston is getting a new federal courthouse , at a cost of 80 million beckley is getting a new federal prison , at a cost of 50 million almost 200 million is being spent on water projects for state and country \? other legislators can claim , legitimately , that they funnel major federal projects and spending to their states but no one else can claim to have attracted 140 million in new highway projects this year a third of the new highway money put up by congress for the entire country what helps west virginia helps the nation , the senator often says he explains that the fbi fingerprint office ended up in west virginia after the bureau s director , william s sessions , complained to him that the office and its system needed to be modernized he says he offered to try to get congress to put up the money for the modernization and then suggested to mr sessions that the bureau consider west virginia for the new office byrd has shown himself to be one of the great masters at making the appropriatons process work for himself and for others by trading favors and building loyalty , said joseph white , a scholar at the brookings institution who is writing a book on congressional appropriations you do n't necessarily make great history doing this , but it s an inescapable part of the system slow this train down' mr byrd s latest fight , over the proposal to move the cia , could become politically ugly he has persuaded fellow senators that the switch is a good idea , but he has been unable to win over house members now the issue must be hashed out in a housesenate conference we 're going to slow this train down , representative dave mccurdy of oklahoma , the chairman of the house intelligence committee , said recently when his panel took a look at the byrd proposal mr byrd insists he did not use any of his considerable appropriations clout to pressure the cia and his senate colleagues into agreeing to the move rather , he says , he learned that the agency had planned to consolidate some of its temporary offices that are scattered about the washington area , outside its main headquarters in langley , va , and he suggested to agency officials that they take a look at west virginia as a consolidation site , along with sites in maryland and virginia the agency , the senator said , then found a suitable site in charles town , wva , 60 miles northwest of washington , along with a second site in prince william county , va , about 30 miles southwest of the capital at that point , the senator says , he took steps to clear congressional approval and money for the moves commuting and computing modernday communications and transportation systems , the senator contends , make it feasible to put federal complexes almost anywhere further , he says , many west virginia towns and cities are within commuting distance of washington representative frank r wolf , a virginia republican whose district is home for many federal employees , particularly cia employees , does not accept any of this explanation i do n't want to get into what the senator did or did n't do , if anything , he said , avoiding tangling with a man who has never been reticent about using political power to punish what i do know , mr wolf continued , is that the cia went to the trouble to hire a real estate consultant to give it a reading on 700 potential sites , and that the agency initially narrowed its choices from that list to 65 sites , none in west virginia then it cut that list to 10 sites , none in west virginia then it came up with a list of four sites and lo ! a west virginia site was suddenly present and , surprise of surprises , that west virginia site made the final cut according to mr wolf , the cia deleted the real estate consultant s criticism of the west virginia site from its final report why did a west virginia site that had been ruled out earlier suddenly appear at the end of the process \? we were not bound by the recommendations of any outside consultant , replied ceferino epps , an agency spokesman and what role did senator byrd play \? none , said mr epps none at all photo in less than three years as chairman of the senate appropriations committee , robert c byrd , shown in the committee chamber , has steered more than 750 million worth of federal projects and agencies and more than 3 , 000 federal jobs out of washington and toward his constituents in west virginia \( andrea mohin for the new york times \)
orrin hatch seemed peevish the republican senator from utah had determined that members of the judiciary committee had asked clarence thomas twice as many questions about abortion as they had asked david souter a year ago you 'd think from listening to what s going on here that that s the only issue the supreme court has to decide , he added right on both counts judge thomas has been questioned more closely than justice souter on roe v wade , and there are other important issues before the court in the terms to come it was the senator s affect that was wrong , the way in which he seemed to suggest that the issue of abortion was a pesky fly buzzing around the room , an annoyance that should be either ignored or eliminated there are many issues the supreme court will take up come october , but none other has thrown an entire american city into turmoil this summer none other has resulted in demonstrations and mass arrests in communities across the country none other addresses the bodily integrity of half our citizenry none other has become as controversial and as important as this one has whether senator hatch wants to slap it down or not , it is not going to fade away watching the confirmation hearings of clarence thomas has been a sobering , sometimes saddening , occasionally illuminating exercise a year ago justice souter was a cipher trying to take on intellectual flesh judge thomas has been exactly the opposite an opinionated individual with a rich and contradictory past and paper trail trying to present himself as a blank slate stripped down like a runner , in his own words the controversial writings and pronouncements on affirmative action , natural law , discrimination most , he suggests now , were misinterpreted , oversimplified , taken out of context in the weeks leading up to the hearings we heard often of the strongminded black conservative who disdained quotas and criticized his own sister for her dependence on a welfare check that man has been conspicuously missing , although from time to time behind the ohsointense eyes i suspect the clarence thomas with flammable opinions is yearning to bust loose then i see him sharing a few laughs with strom thurmond and think i am imagining things nowhere has the blank slate been more unsatisfactory and unconvincing than it has been on the issue of abortion , which is , for some of us , the issue of our lives it was not only that judge thomas repeatedly said he could not discuss the matter and maintain his impartiality , although he was strangely able to discuss other issues that will likely come before the court when he was asked to recount discussions he might have had in law school on the subject , he replied , i cannot remember personally engaging in those discussions , and perhaps there were even people who believed him he also thought for a long time when he was asked whether the fetus has constitutional status as a person i cannot think of any cases that have held that , he finally replied quite the contrary the operative sentence is the word 'person , ' as used in the 14th amendment , does not include the unborn the case is roe v wade there is occasionally a man at that table who might be capable of addressing this issue with humanity he is the man who has presented such a problem for liberals in recent weeks , a man who knows from experience what discrimination and disenfranchisement are all about he is the man who said thursday that from the window of his courthouse he could look out and see the buses transporting criminal defendants , adding , i say to myself almost every day , but for the grace of god there go i i wish i had any confidence that he considered those of us who feel that way when we see a group of desperate women in a clinic waiting room to watch as one of the most important issues of our times , an issue that affects the lives of millions of women intimately , is reduced to a political fandango in some cynical meansends construct and a peevish annoyance for a senator who will never have to think twice about who holds jurisdiction over the territory beneath his skin is worse than dispiriting it s insulting a man in robes who is capable of looking at men in handcuffs and seeing himself ought to recognize that
jerusalem , aug 14 now and again , tami arad said today , she catches herself just as she is about to slip into the past tense when talking about her husband , ron while lapses like that are unsettling , she said , they matter little compared with the hopes and fears that collide each day over the larger question of whether there is also a future tense for capt ron arad , an israeli air force pilot missing in lebanon since october 1986 they tell me that now maybe something will happen , maybe he will come back , mrs arad said but they also tell me to be careful , that this is just the first step and there may be more to come that seems guaranteed as the middle east hostage problem moves along uncertainly , its solution hinging a great deal on the fate of captain arad and six other israeli servicemen who have been missing in lebanon for years simple and intricate how the crisis will be settled if it is settled remains unclear but the israelis are now being seen as the key , and the rough outlines of a likely deal are considered relatively simple even if it may prove relentlessly complicated to bring them about a group holding western hostages in lebanon says it will let its captives go but only if palestinian prisoners in israel and europe are set free in turn , israel says it is ready to go along but first it wants an accounting of its missing men it would be better that they are alive and freed , israelis feel but officials say that simply getting solid evidence about those men , dead or alive , would be enough for them to release some of their arab prisoners a videotape would do , they said today there is no dearth of possibilities , said deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu an israeli negotiating team discussed the possible settlement today in geneva with the united nations secretary general , javier perez de cuellar , who has become a broker between israel and iran and , by extension , hostageholding groups of shiite muslims usually regarded as loyal to iran negotiator is optimistic while there was no apparent breakthrough , the head of the israeli delegation , uri lubrani , called the talks very fruitful and said that work would continue it was not clear , however , if more meetings with the secretary general were planned complicating matters was a statement today by the leader of a palestinian guerrilla faction , ahmed jabril , that he knows what happened to the israelis , some of whom disappeared nine years ago three are alive , he said , three are missing and presumed dead , and one is confirmed dead mr jabril , head of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , general command , told reuters in damascus that the three believed to be dead were members of a tank crew sgt zachary baumel , cpl yehuda katz and first sgt zvi feldman who disappeared in a 1982 battle after israel invaded lebanon another palestinian group has said that it could turn over the body of sgt samir assad , a druse soldier captured in lebanon in 1983 and killed , the palestinians say , in an israeli air attack that leaves pvt yossi fink and pvt rachamim alsheik , both ambushed five years ago while driving through the israeli buffer zone in south lebanon and then there is captain arad , a navigator whose plane went down over sidon , lebanon , nearly five years ago basis for skepticism of these men , only the 33yearold captain arad is generally thought to be still alive , probably in the hands of the iranianbacked party of god but israeli officials challenged mr jabril s credibility today , saying they have given up on none of the men and adding that is why they insist on a full accounting the servicemen s families are not about to let go either , even those whose hopes seem to be slender reeds to lean on we have never opened champagne and we have never started shiva , yonah baumel , the father of zachary baumel , told the israeli newspaper maariv he referred to the traditional jewish mourning period of seven days we have learned how to cope with many kinds of information about the hostages and prisoners , sometimes contradictory , he said now we have reached a moment of truth in which we cannot content ourselves with information we also need proof that demand is shared by tami arad , a slender , longhaired woman of 30 , who was married for four years before her husband disappeared in a way , she acknowledges , she is fortunate compared with the other families because she had word from her husband once , in 1987 a father s advice from the israeli authorities , and through channels she said she does not know , she received a letter and a photograph showing her husband with a new beard there was nothing dramatic in the letter , but he wanted to cheer me up , she said he s a very strong person he said it would end soon and that i should raise our daughter well the daughter , yuval , is now 6 and about to enter the first grade other children sometimes say to her that her father is not coming back , mrs arad said , but she is also strong and says she does n't care what they say ron will come back she calls him ron , she added how can she call him papa \? she does n't know him like the american relatives of hostages , mrs arad and some of the other israeli families have tried to keep their awareness of the missing men alive a year ago , she and other relatives put together a glossy brochure on captain arad , with family pictures and poignant comments from yuval and others several times , her campaign has taken her to the united states , where she has found to her annoyance that the missing israelis are little known everybody knows about your hostages , she said why do they not know about ours \? a nation of soldiers bringing home the servicemen or their remains is a preoccupation in this country , where virtually everyone is a soldier or a relative of one the faces of the missing are instantly recognizable here from newspaper photographs , and many israelis would gladly give up hundreds of arab prisoners to get the missing seven back although mrs arad has more solid reasons than relatives of the other servicemen to assume that her husband is alive , she concedes that her optimism is tempered by worry she has carved out a life of her own over the last five years , studying criminology and moving from quarters on an air force base to a house in herzliya , near tel aviv she receives captain arad s regular pay , and the military helps out in other ways , including guiding her to psychologists to help explain the problems in a possible reunion i'm a person who ca n't live alone , she said but i know it will also be very difficult to live together again photos they tell me that now maybe something will happen , maybe he will come back , tami arad said of her husband , ron , above , an israeli air force captain missing in lebanon since october 1986 \( micha baram for the new york times agence francepresse \)
the woman seemed like any other investor she mailed an application and a 5 , 000 check to open a mutual fund account a few weeks later , she switched money from a stock fund to a money market fund she called the fund , asking to take dividends in cash she filled out the paperwork needed to change her address after three months , she closed the account but this was no ordinary investor she had lent her name for a study by dalbar financial services , a bostonbased mutual fund research firm , to ferret out service problems in the mutual fund industry dalbar went undercover to find out which fund companies give the best service to investors , and of 22 big fund companies that allowed themselves to be studied , four winners emerged american capital , fidelity , oppenheimer and putnam \( dalbar , however , refused to say which companies did poorly \) the cost of providing service is a substantial part of fees that investors pay , said louis harvey , dalbar s president the question is what do investors get for their money \? until the late 1980 s , service was the last thing on most fund executives' minds frankly , we just did n't pay too much attention to it before , said the chief executive of one large fund group and neither did investors , whose pockets were overflowing with profits from the bull market but then came the october 1987 market crash thousands of frantic investors tried to call in sell orders but could n't get through funds are keeping that lesson in mind as they search for ways to cater to investors today now , fund groups are trying to grab market share with better service that s why dalbar persuaded 13 people to open an account in each of the 22 funds using those names , dalbar invested 120 , 000 of its own money in the funds for one year it studied more than 10 , 000 transactions designed to test 38 different aspects of service , ranging from routine matters , like checking fund share prices , to whether dividends and tax statements were received on time after making these investments , dalbar tested specific transactions it switched money from one fund to another in the same group and then changed addresses and the way dividends were paid it mailed letters asking for information and requested emergency withdrawals over the telephone other criteria how long the company took to mail a check or confirmation and how easy it was to close out an account what kinds of glitches did dalbar uncover \? in one case , it asked to withdraw 100 from an account instead , the company sold 100 shares worth more than 1 , 000 then dalbar was told that it would take two weeks to stop payment on the 1 , 000 check mailed in error and to issue a new one for the requested 100 and the investor would have to forfeit any profits that the fund earned in the meantime on the 1 , 000 other funds were eager to take investors' money but more grudging about letting investors cash out many asked for signature guarantees say , from a bank to liquidate an account , a demand that is hopelessly inconvenient for investors , mr harvey said there were instances of gross misjudgment for example , dalbar opened three accounts in each fund group under different names it asked one fund group to close the accounts and send the three investors their money the three checks with different names , although the same address were stuffed into one envelope dalbar also wrote letters asking the funds how to redeem shares but three funds actually made the redemptions you 'd have some very unhappy campers if the market had gone up after the incorrect redemptions were made , mr harvey said one pitfall dalbar stumbled over was a matter of policy , not an error the problem more than half of the fund groups refuse to process telephone transactions for some time after investors move , to insure that the change of address is not fraudulent so simply by moving , you can forfeit telephone privileges the period ranges from one week which mr harvey calls acceptable , to let the fund mail a letter confirming the address change to six months , which he says is going overboard from its study , dalbar gleaned advice for investors who want to know how to get the best possible service from their funds first , find out how you can get your money out of the fund most efficiently \( mr harvey recommends asking the company to give you a checkbook and checkwriting privileges so if you want cash from your account , you can simply write yourself a check \) find out beforehand what you must do to transfer money between funds or switch from reinvesting dividends to taking them in cash or vice verse \( sometimes you have to set up accounts or complete applications before the fund will process the transaction \) finally , find out whom to call for advice or help for example , funds should be able to tell how you can use your investment as collateral for a loan some will issue a certificate acceptable to the lender a stockbroker , if you use one , should be able to put your account on margin credit worries , spreading yields credit worries have pushed the spreads between treasury bonds and many lowerquality but still investmentgrade corporate bonds to unprecedented levels , says patricia zlotin , who runs the taxable investment grade bond section for massachusetts financial services , a large bostonbased fund group hardest hit is the financial sector , particularly banks , where many investmentgrade issues now yield as much as junk bonds , mainly because of industrywide troubles as the chart shows , the yield spread in this sector has widened dramatically this year but , ms zlotin says , the rating agencies are lagging investor perceptions none of the highyielding issues has been downgraded yet for investors , this could spell opportunity while ms zlotin does n't discount the possibility of another bank of new england debacle , if you 're brave , you take a look , she said tables the winners , listing the mutual fund groups that provide the best service to investors , as rated by dalbar out of 22 big companies surveyed \( source dalbar financial services company reports \) yield spreads between regional bank 10year bonds and 10year tresuries , in basis points \( source kidder peabody \)

of bcci s more than 14 , 000 employees the senator said that efforts to make an example of bcci by imposing unprecedented penalties for offenses which other banks have committed could be seen by some as discriminatory talks with lawyers in an hourlong interview today , mr hatch , a conservative from utah and the secondranking republican on the judiciary committee , said that mr altman and two of the bank s lawyers lawrence barcella and lawrence wechsler were people of impeccable integrity who told me the truth as they knew it they told me that thirdtier employees had done this , and that the

handley said he might be nervous starting the season with only five defensive linemen but i can live with it , the coach said the people i have there can play effectively i'm not going to keep a set number of players at a position because i have a set number in mind marshall , who is having a strong camp , said he could live with the situation , too there s a drop off after the first five defensive linemen , he said but if the five of us can stay healthy and keep performing at the same level , there should be no problem extra points after a day off , the giants returned to practice monday afternoon they welcomed back tight ends bob mrosko \( back \) and ted popson \( foot \) and outside linebacker anthony moss \( groin \) , all of whom had been sidelined because of the wet field , running back rodney hampton and wide receiver james milling , both recovering from strained hamstring muscles , were held out of practice until tuesday nose tackle henry blades sprained his left foot in saturday s scrimmage , and he will be out at least one day jay butler , a 306pound rookie offensive tackle , injured his right knee in monday afternoon s practice eleven players remained absent from camp eight are unsigned veterans washington at defensive end , johnson at inside linebacker , myron guyton at safety , reyna thompson at cornerback , jumbo elliot at offensive tackle , william roberts at offensive guard , mark ingram at wide receiver and dave meggett at running back one is the unsigned firstround draft choice , fullback jarrod bunch the two others are signed veterans who want more money eric howard at nose tackle and steve deossie at inside linebacker harry hulmes indicated that none of the missing seemed close to signing photo giants' rick fox , who has been playing at nose tackle , pushing past luis cristobal yesterday at practice \( vic delucia the new york times \)

teheran , iran , april 4 the revolution that transformed iran s westernoriented cosmopolitan society into a militantly islamic republic seems to be on the wane after 12 years of rule by radical islamic clerics , an eightyear war initiated by iraq , fierce internal repression of religious minorities and opponents , and a decade of economic drift and mismanagement , the revolution s repressive aspects are being relaxed , and ideology appears to be getting less attention fear is still pervasive once omnipresent in this capital , pictures of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , the much revered architect of the iranian revolution , have largely disappeared except in government buildings the teheran radio has begun occasionally omitting the words and path of the imam khomeini , short homilies from the ayatollah that once preceded every afternoon news broadcast nevertheless , fear and suspicion of foreigners and one another are still pervasive , although supporters of president hashemi rafsanjani say he is determined to end his country s isolation and bring iran back as a responsible regional force the efforts by mr rafsanjani , which continue as new power relationships form in the aftermath of the persian gulf war , have created tensions in iranian society because the partisans of the revolution are reluctant to let go iranian officials , in explaining the situation to foreigners , deny the revolution has lost its verve the fervor of the revolution is continuing , especially among the young , but in a more logical form , said ali asghar faramarzian , director general of foreign press for the ministry of islamic guidance but iranian citizens , officials , diplomats and foreign business executives interviewed here over the last 10 days said they detected important changes they cited the opening of iran to the west in foreign policy , its effort to rationalize and privatize major sectors of its economy and a loosening of political repression as indicators of a very cautious but determined effort by president rafsanjani to allow pragmatism and national interest to triumph over religious ideology in this nation of 55 million people this revolution is finally over , a diplomat here said it died a month ago when iraq bombed holy shrines in najaf and karbala , cities sacred to iranian shiites , without an iranian response it died when iraq began massacring iraqi shiites without a single protest march in this overwhelmingly shiite society , and only a belated peep from its leaders it died when this country decided to stop exporting its islamic revolution and concentrate on the mess inside it changing iran , a nonarab country that is 95 percent shiite , is no easy task , diplomats and iranian professionals agree the violence of the revolution , in which thousands were arrested , tortured and killed , remains just below the surface religious radicals have lost power , but they retain a veto through their impressive ability to bring militants onto the streets and their overwhelming dominance in the elected 270member parliament two months ago , for instance , parliament censured president rafsanjani s minister of health , iraj fazel , for replacing islamic militants at teheran university with people accused of being indifferent to the revolution the censure forced the president to remove mr fazel from his post , but he replaced him with a man handpicked by mr fazel who is said to be even more liberal than his patron one week after parliament s action , the president appointed mr fazel to the prestigious academy of science power consolidation seen while some indications of a power struggle remain , most analysts say president rafsanjani has consolidated control faced with a virtually stagnant economy and vast social problems , he has been making desperately needed changes he has a decade , two at the most , to reconstruct and reform iran , a western diplomat said if he does n't do it , iran , despite its enormous civilization , tremendous manpower resources and oil wealth , will become pakistan or egypt still pervasive is the government s once allpowerful komiteh , the heavyhanded internal security force set up after the 1979 revolution to insure compliance with islamic law yet there are contradictions changes among women women are still forced to cover every strand of hair with head scarves and wear shapeless overcoats in public , no matter how hot the weather but a cosmetic shop on valiasr street , two blocks from the ministry of islamic guidance , is doing a brisk business despite the fact that makeup is officially discouraged and at a nearby clothing store , one shopkeeper no longer sells the maghnaeh , the black head cover once routinely worn by women here it s outmoded , the shopkeeper said with a wave of hand , he dismissed the decal on his door a head scarf is purity , that the komiteh forced him to post years ago the changes are most apparent in government policy in the last year , mr rafsanjani has made enormous strides toward ending iran s isolation and , in one diplomat s words , removing the dead hand of islamic socialism that has sapped his country s vitality
an auction of preferred stock in a company controlled by the british publisher robert maxwell failed yesterday , the second time that had happened in less than two months the failure of the auction , which mr maxwell had forecast would succeed , led the company , official airlines guides inc , to announce that it would redeem the 75 million issue because the auction failed , official airlines guides will pay an unusually high dividend rate on the issue for the next seven weeks it also means that some holders of the stock , who had wanted to sell it at yesterday s auction , were unable to do so after the first auction failed , on aug 2 , mr maxwell blamed a communications snafu and dismissed as out of the question the possibility that investors were not willing to own the issue he had forecast in august that the auction held yesterday will be successful a spokeswoman for the maxwell communication corporation , the parent of official airline guides , declined to comment yesterday beyond saying that the issue would be redeemed in november she declined to comment on the failed auction or to say how maxwell would raise the needed cash in an auctionrate preferred stock issue , the dividend rate is set each seven weeks through an auction in which holders are able to sell at par , assuming buyers can be found if none can be located , the rate is automatically set at a penalty level , in this case at 15 times the commercial paper rate , or 8327 percent yesterday that is a high rate considering the tax advantages of preferred stock for corporate investors the preferred stock issue was originally underwritten by goldman , sachs and merrill lynch the firms informally retained the obligation of rounding up buyers at each auction wall street executives said the firms had tried to find buyers but were unable to persuade enough investors maxwell communication also announced yesterday that it had sold its maxwell macmillan professional and business reference publishing unit to the thomson professional publishing company for 565 million
hempstead , li , nov 13 for the first five games of the season , the jets were leading the national football league in rushing , and then they began to drop in productivity going into this sunday s game against the patriots at foxboro , mass , the jets' running game has fallen to sixth place at first , the decline attributed to injuries along the offensive line , especially to left guards mike haight and dave cadigan then the blame was shifted to a series of knee injuries to the team s three tight ends , a key to any blocking schemes blair thomas , the team s leading rusher , thinks the problem can be seen accros the line of scrimmage we 've just run into some good defenses who 've played us hard and tough , but that happens in the nfl , said thomas , who has had only two 100yard rushing games since he was drafted on the first round by the jets last year thomas had exactly 100 against the patriots last season and 125 yards this year in the monday night game in chicago , which the bears won in overtime the guys get paid to do it to us , to stop us and they just happen to have a good game plan that slows down our running game , he said had 620 yards in 1990 thomas , out of penn state , was the second player chosen over all in last year s draft behind jeff george , the indianapolis colts quarterback thomas was expected to make a big impact last year he finished 16th in the league with 620 yards on 123 carries last season , facts that were overlooked because his 5yardpercarry average was the best among all rookies he only scored two touchdowns last year , one on a pass and one on a run in the last two games of the season against , new england and at tampa bay this year he has scored none on the ground in the first 10 games , but does have a touchdown pass to his credit on a 16yard halfback option against cleveland he also caught a 6yard touchdown pass from troy taylor in a loss at seattle i did n't think it would take this long but things happen and you just have to go out there and do your job and try to get the most yards you possibly can , said thomas , who is not doing as well as a lot of other young running backs who were drafted after he was last year harold green of the bengals has 550 yards in 106 carries and a long run of 75 , which was for his lone touchdown compared with thomas s 524 in 135 carries with a long run of 25 yards and no touchdowns in the national football conference emmitt smith of the cowboys \( 878 yards on 198 carries and 8 touchdowns including a long run of 75 yards for one score \) and rodney hampton of the giants \( 680 yards on 146 catches and 7 touchdowns , plus a long run of 44 \) are also doing better than thomas going through the playbyplay also reveals that on 21 of his carries thomas has lost yardage for a player averaging 135 carries a game , 21 carries is like a game and a half 'it s frustrating' i guess you could say it s frustrating when you look at the film and see one little thing that stops you from taking it the distance , said thomas , who has also been the victim of defenses that stack eight or nine men up on the line of scrimmage against the jets the reason they put eight or nine men on the line is because we have a good rushing game now that we 're passing the ball better that s going to open things up for the running backs the problem with that assessment is the fact that the jets \( 55 \) really have n't been passing the ball much better ken o'brien is the jets' leading passer only because he is the only one coach bruce coslet has any real confidence in right now , while taylor waits on the shelf and browning nagle , the secondround choice this year matures o'brien , however , is only the fifthleading passer in the conference and is rated eighth in the league his six touchdown passes are the fewest since the six he had in 1984 , his second year in the league an indication of how badly o'brien has been performing is the fact that al toon , usually his favorite receiver over the years , also has no touchdown catches in 10 games this year and a streak of 11 games without a touchdown dating to last season the longest string of games without a touchdown catch for toon as a jet has been seven extra points freeman mcneil , who has been sidelined with an injury , has been added to the practice squad linebacker john galvin was put on waivers to make room for a possible move back to the roster by mcneil , the jets' leading career rusher , in time for sunday s game if al toon catches a pass against the patriots it will set a club record for consecutive games with at least one catch , breaking the mark of 86 consective games he shares with former jets tight end mickey shuler photo blair thomas and the rest of the jets' running attack have been stymied since the sixth game he has lost yardage on 21 carries and has yet to score a touchdown on the ground \( vic delucia the new york times \)
mayor david n dinkins s decision to order a blueribbon investigation of new york city s hospitals was driven in part by a private warning that there were systemic problems in the municipal hospitals , mayoral aides said yesterday the warning came from stanley lowell , a lawyer the mayor asked to look into conditions at kings county hospital , where a hasidic student , yankel rosenbaum , died in august after receiving what state officials described as inadequate care in the emergency room after two weeks of interviews with doctors and employees at kings county , mr lowell , a deputy mayor under mayor robert f wagner , told mr dinkins that a broader inquiry was needed , mayoral aides said mr lowell reported that the interviews had raised serious questions about whether medical schools were providing doctors who were qualified and whether the city s health and hospitals corporation had tight enough control of the procedures at individual institutions as each week has brought new revelations about apparent lapses in care at city hospitals , the mayor has come under tremendous pressure to take action on an explosive issue that goes to the heart of the city s financial and social troubles 'a hard look' at the system yesterday , mr dinkins promised that the commission he would name later this week would take a hard look at the entire hospital system we 're going to get to the bottom of it , he said some things may be systemic some things may be the fault of particular individuals underscoring the urgency of the situation , harlem hospital is facing a state inspection today that could cost it its national accreditation and cripple its ability to collect federal medicaid and medicare funds , the bulk of its revenue in recent weeks , harlem hospital has been the scene of two questionable deaths in addition , a woman in labor who was refused admission gave birth in a waiting room tough decisions for mayor among the hard decisions the mayor must make is whether to stand by the chief of the sprawling hospital system , dr j emilio carrillo the decision is fraught with ethnic politics dr carrillo is one of the senior ranking hispanic officials in the administration , and a move to pin the problems in the hospitals on him without the imprimatur of an outside commission might alienate hispanic voters , some political strategists said the perceived crisis also could carry over into the next mayoral contest already , city council president andrew j stein , considered by many to be mr dinkins s main political opponent , has seized on the recent incidents to criticize the administration over the years , mr stein has been a champion of improving the healthcare system and he would probably use the issue again in a mayoral campaign if he decides to run the mayor decided to appoint the commission late last week after it was reported that his old friend , william c chance jr , a civil rights lawyer , bled to death from an ulcer under questionable circumstances after spending 18 hours in a harlem hospital emergency room harlem is the mayor s old political base the results of a special investigation by the city s health and hospitals corporation into mr chance s death are to be given to the mayor today like the death of mr chance , mr rosenbaum s death had weighed heavily on the mayor s mind because he had visited the student at the hospital only an hour before he died , city hall aides said mr rosenbaum was stabbed during the racial violence in crown heights , brooklyn the mayor has become increasingly concerned , first deputy mayor norman steisel said how do you explain to people what happened to yankel rosenbaum \? to the average person it defies common sense judgments mr steisel said the makeup of the commission and the time it would take to write a report have not been worked out none of the members have been chosen , but city officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the administration has reached out to dr jeremiah barondess of the national academy of sciences and asked him to head the effort dr barondess could not be reached for comment yesterday at the heart of the inquiry will be how the central bureaucracy of the health and hospitals corporation administers the 11 hospitals , 5 nursing homes and 6 neighborhood clinics in the system , which provide most of the care available to people in poor neighborhoods the corporation has a 28 billion budget for the fiscal year , of which 171 million is from city taxes mr steisel said that , among other things , the commission would study how doctors in city hospitals are chosen , trained and accredited it will look at the management of the hospitals and the contracts the hospitals have with major teaching hospitals , like long island jewish , new york university and columbia presbyterian , which provide most of the medical residents at the city hospitals 'a more dramatic light' the commission will also examine how the hospitals corporation monitors conditions in the hospitals and clinics in the system this inquiry is emanating more from a series of questions that have hounded the corporation over the years , mr steisel said it seems to come up again now in what seems to be a more dramatic light there has been a lot of criticism in the past the mayor wanted to see the system reformed these recent events have gotten him to question whether in fact the corporation is handling it steven matthews , a spokesman for the hospitals corporation , said the incidents were not symptoms of a deeper malaise in the system but were a freak string of anomalies we 've had an increbibly bad streak of luck , he said we do n't think it s reflective of the quality of care but from the mayor s perspective , every time he picks up the paper , we 're killing another person the hospitals corporation was set up in 1970 to administer the hospital system and to partially wean it from city financing it put the administration of the hospitals and clinics under the control of a 16member board that includes several high city officials during the koch administration , the city gradually resumed controlling the corporation s budget at present , the city s office of management and budget oversees the corporation s spending the hospitals are supported largely by medicaid , medicare and private insurance payments , but the city taxpayers pick up the bill for people who are uninsured or who cannot pay , mr matthews said some of the institutions , like the harlem and kings county hospitals , consistently operate at a deficit because they treat many people who cannot pay , while others in the system break even or make a modest profit , which is put back into the corporation since being appointed in april 1990 , dr carrillo has tried to shift the focus of the hospital system away from emergency medicine toward preventive care he has also tried to revamp the arrangement between the city and the corporation to give the hospitals more independence in june , the city slashed most of its subsidy to the corporation , asking the hospital to cut 156 million in city tax money from its 28 billion budget dr carrillo , who is 40 years old , won some political enemies in the dinkins administration because after assuring the mayor the cuts would not hurt service , he went to the city council and painted a much bleaker picture
palo alto , calif no news was manufactured by the pentagon or the armed services during the persian gulf war none , period there was no real dispute about this statement by navy capt michael t sherman at a california forum of the first amendment congress , meeting this week at stanford university the former congressman and former marine pete mccloskey led the session but was manufactured news the real question \? carl nolte , a veteran reporter for the san francisco chronicle , thought not in his 10 weeks covering the gulf war , he said , the government succeeded instead in censorship by access and delay mr nolte explained that the military ground rules that really counted during operation desert storm were those that organized reporters into supervised pools , then provided access to operational areas only to the pools , and later imposed military review on the pool reports under such a system , he made clear , the military did not have to manufacture news to control information going out to americans at home a retired army colonel , darryl henderson , a decorated vietnam combat veteran and a graduate of the national war college , argued against the necessity for such censorship he said the reason most often given for the strict military control of gulf war information operational security , the need to protect military secrets , was false the actual reason , colonel henderson suggested , was a vietnam syndrome within the military that blamed the press for the erosion of public support for that earlier war as a result , he said , the military started years ago to study and train personnel in the techniques of marketing the military viewpoint , primarily by seeing to it that only upbeat reports went out to the public this planning , and the performance of public information officers trained in marketing techniques , paid off for the military in the gulf war , he said colonel henderson , a former commander of the army s research institute for the behavioral and social sciences , said he had himself undergone such training judith coburn , a reporter who covered wars in central america and the middle east as well as the vietnam war , and who now lectures on mass communications at the university of california at berkeley , disputed the validity of the military attitude toward the press s responsibility for defeat in vietnam she argued that press coverage of that war had been largely favorable until home front support for it began to wane in the late 60 s thus , she said , the public did not follow the press into disillusionment with the war it was the other way around ms coburn also addressed herself to the question of operational security she cited the fact that correspondents in vietnam , including herself , were briefed well in advance of the forthcoming ussupported invasion of laos by south vietnamese forces reporters in vietnam , she said , did not expose this military secret instead , officials in washington leaked the information to the press there ms coburn drew a distinction between british and american press performance in the gulf war british correspondents , she said , did n't enlist in the war effort as she said too many american reporters did she pointed out that iraqi refugees were questioned by british journalists in jordan , enabling them to arrive at iraqi casualty estimates more than 100 , 000 long before official estimates were available mr nolte also was critical of some american reporters in saudi arabia few tried to stretch pool rules and most took handouts and standard briefings from the military , he asserted he reserved his strongest criticism , however , for the american journalists who organized the press pools for the military mostly by favoritism , as mr nolte saw it captain sherman , who set up and directed the military s joint information bureau in saudi arabia , put much emphasis on what he called the incredible technology he said the military provided for reporters trying to cover the war he conceded that in some respects the information system had failed miserably but ms coburn , to applause from the audience , said the military had in fact done a brilliant job on its own behalf
the police and federal agents arrested 41 people in the bronx yesterday to shatter what they said was a major local heroin ring and seized one of the largest caches of weapons in recent memory the 41 were believed to be drug dealers in the ring , which lawenforcement officials said was run by a group of bronx men described as unusually young none were more than 23 years old and unusually violent some still lived in the south bronx apartments of their parents others used their earnings to buy property in puerto rico , condominium units in yonkers and latemodel mercedesbenz sedans together , they were selling about 25 million worth of heroin a year , the officials said and last month alone , detectives said , they were known to have been involved in at least eight shootings with automatic weapons machine guns seized the 16month investigation also netted drug dealers in baltimore , a gun smuggler in virginia and a clandestine factory that assembled submachine guns inside a united airlines hangar at the oakland , calif , airport twelve of the 56 guns seized in the operation were small , fully automatic machine guns banned by federal law officials said the investigation did not penetrate the ring s asian heroin suppliers some officials acknowledged privately that the arrests could hardly be expected to make a dent in new york city s overall flow of drugs we have yet to win the war , mayor david n dinkins said at a news conference at the 40th precinct station house in which guns and money were piled on large tables , but we clearly have won an important battle against those who would poison the citizens and thus the city of new york police detectives and federal drug enforcement administration officials said they guessed that the bronx ring was only one of perhaps two dozen or more organizations selling heroin to the estimated 250 , 000 addicts in the city and by the recent standards of new york , where drug agents seized 830 of the 1 , 6084 kilograms of heroin taken nationwide in 1988 and 1989 , the one kilogram of heroin about 22 pounds and the roughly 235 , 000 in cash taken in 26 separate raids yesterday morning were hardly extraordinary but officials said they were stunned by the arsenal the young men had amassed and the organization they had built day and night managers it had an overall manager , drug processors , money couriers , gun distributors and organization enforcers , police commissioner lee p brown said at one distribution point in the bronx , on melrose avenue and 167th street , they even had a day manager and a night manager detectives said the ring was run by a 22yearold yonkers resident , steven ramos , who they said had broken off from another heroin ring about two years ago and built his own , largely with friends from his old neighborhood in the melrose section of the south bronx the one kilogram seized yesterday and another , bought bit by bit in undercover purchases , averaged about 65 percent pure heroin , investigators said each kilogram has a street value of 150 , 000 to 200 , 000 , federal drug officials said experts surmised that the ring was supplied by importers in chinatown , who typically sell heroin from the socalled golden triangle of myanmar , formerly burma , and laos and thailand heroin found in new york in the 1970 s typically had a purity of 3 to 5 percent detectives said mr ramos s lieutenants oversaw a heroin mill , where the drug was processed , in a house at 380 balcom avenue in the throgs neck section and eight major streetsales locations , one in east harlem and seven in the southeast bronx at one apartment , they stamped brand names like pure energy and absolut on the glassine envelopes in which the drug is sold at others , the detectives said , they hid drugs , guns and money or made sales to larger buyers , including a drug ring based in baltimore officers from the drug enforcement task force , a cooperative venture of city , state and federal lawenforcement agencies , had heard of mr ramos from an informer more than a year ago , said robert a bryden , the heads the drug enforcement administration office in new york city months later , they learned that bronx narcotics detectives had been pursuing the same man , and the two investigations merged we were going after the same guy from different angles , said sgt richard bushrod , one of the main detectives on the case we had some information from the street it just turned out to be a lot bigger than we thought photo a bronx drug ring said to have sold 25 million worth of heroin a year was broken up yesterday when 41 suspects were arrested at the 40th precinct station house , sgt richard bushrod , left , and detectives scott fowler , center , and harry antoine showed guns seized \( john sotomayor the new york times \)
moody s investors service , a leading wall street rating agency , said yesterday that it was lowering its ratings of six of the country s largest life insurers john hancock , massachusetts mutual , mutual life of new york , new england mutual , the travelers and principal mutual what links the insurers downgraded yesterday is that they all have large exposures to commercial real estate , either to the actual properties or to mortgages backed by those properties moody s declared that real estate was a deteriorating asset and that it expected property values to continue to fall adjustments were small the changes in moody s ratings , which are the firm s assessment of the insurers' ability to pay the claims of policyholders , were very small the insurers downgraded yesterday ranked high in moody s 17notch rating system , and they fell only a notch or two but the move could have a big effect on all six companies because many policyholders , as well as brokers and agents , want to do business only with insurers rated at the top , or just a notch below aware that its changes come amid extreme policyholder edginess about the health of all insurers , moody s emphasized that the great majority of insurers , including those downgraded yesterday , remained strong but the agency said that property values , particularly of commercial buildings , had continued to fall in the first half of 1991 and that it thus had no choice but to conclude that the insurers' ability to pay policyholders had eroded moody s said additional downgradings could be expected if its prediction of further real estate declines proved true 'we have to do it' we do n't want people to think that the end of the world is coming , because we definitely do not believe that , said kenneth j h pinkes , director of financial institutions research at moody s and while it is difficult to make rating changes in situations like this , we have to do it because the risks have increased our sense is that real estate is deteriorating and will continue to deteriorate industry experts say the number of people expressing concern about insurance companies has increased in the wake of state takeovers this year of executive life , first capital life , monarch life , and most recently mutual benefit life insurance thus , these industry experts say , the downgrading will likely present a serious publicrelations challenge for the affected companies they were already receiving calls from policyholders , agents and brokers made nervous by the takeover this week of mutual benefit , based in newark no sooner had moody s made its announcement than the six companies began contacting agents and brokers , instructing them on how to keep policyholders calm david hurd , chairman and chief executive of the principal mutual life insurance company , said the moody s action does not give enough weight to our different approach , our foreign record , our excellent current status and our carefully projected expectations for real estate at massachusetts mutual , eustis walcott , a spokesman , called moody s move a reaction to the times he added that the downgrading was undeserved but that in any case the company had more than 6 billion in investments that it could easily convert to cash new england mutual life insurance seemed to take the downgrading in stride , emphasizing that moody s still left it with what it called an acceptable rating in a a poor economy , we are happy to be awarded a rating that says we have excellent financial strength , said peter n harrington , vice president of public relations he said new england life still expected a profit of 25 million to 30 million this year experts said the volume of calls from customers is likely to increase when the companies open for business on monday a small amount of capital could flow out of the affected companies to insurers whose claimspaying rating remains aaa you will get a few panicstricken customers who will react , acknowledged mr hurd of principal mutual , that company , formerly known as bankers life , is the nation s 11thlargest life insurer principal mutual s real estate portfolio is in extremely good shape in dollar terms , less than 2 percent of its loans have gone bad but that is not true at companies like the travelers its 25 billion in troubled mortgages now exceeds its net worth , or its cushion against losses the situation is only slightly better at companies like the john hancock mutual life insurance company , for which troubled real estate now amounts to 50 percent of its net worth moody s concern , in short , is that real estate values will continue to decline while the companies will continue to earn profits from insurance , those profits have been shrinking because of competition so one risk is that the impact of declining real estate values on the insurers' net worth will swamp positive developments , further diminishing the insurers' ability to pay claims details of changes the following ratings changes , none of which were to less than investment grade , were made by moody s late yesterday john hancock from aaa \( exceptional \) to aa2 \( the middle of the excellent category \) massachusetts mutual from aaa \( exceptional \) to aa1 \( the top of the excellent category \) mutual life of new york from a2 \( good \) to baa1 \( the top of the adequate category \) new england mutual from aa1 \( the top of the excellent category \) to aa3 \( the bottom of excellent \) principal mutual life from aaa \( exceptional \) to aa1 \( top of the excellent category \) travelers from a1 \( the top of the good category \) to a2 \( the middle of the good category \) the moody s downgrading poses an immediate question for the other leading insurance ratings , a m best and standard poor s , which will now have to decide whether to follow moody s lead and lower their ratings if they do not , it could cause confusion among consumers , since it is common to rely on at

madrid , oct 31 there they stood , on the fringes of the middle east peace conference today , an israeli and a palestinian , with nothing but history and a television camera between them you are not a threat to me , the israeli said if i'm not a threat to you , said the palestinian , why are you abusing me \? i want you to respect my identity as a palestinian i have a right to dignity the israeli answered i accept your right to define yourself as you want and i demand the right to define myself anyway i want to and so it went , with neither man saying what the other wanted to hear as words of greater and lesser moment poured forth in speeches and asides , the second full day of the middle east conference turned into a day of versions , of people talking past each other in the conference hall , in the lobbies and in the corridors , a day that split a shared past into two realities and sent arabs and israelis rushing to claim exclusive access to history s just causes and moral heights the encounter between the israeli , lieut col raanan gissin , and the palestinian , albert aghazarian , had been arranged by a french television reporter , but it was not the only occasion today when israelis sought out arabs to press the idea that they wanted peace while their adversaries did not israel s deputy foreign minister , benjamin netanyahu , for instance , called a news conference exclusively for arab reporters and about 25 turned up , none of them syrians it was n't hostile , but it was n't friendly , said an egyptian reporter who attended yoash zidon , a rightwing israeli legislator , thrust his way into the syrian spokesman s office with a phalanx of television camera crews to pursue his own conversation with mr aghazarian and to explain israel s attitude toward palestinians thus it s because i respect you that i was so stern such was the melee that the syrians , who shun all contact with israelis , called on an american official to ask the camera crews to leave when colonel gissin met mr aghazarian , the israeli pursued his country s argument that true peace would come only from direct talks in the middle east between arab and israeli direct negotiation is not a matter of form , it s a psychological prerequisite , said colonel gissin , who is a spokesman for the israeli army so why , he continued , should the two sides not meet back home \? mr aghazarian responded that perhaps it was because just to get to work i have to cross the roadblocks and i do n't always make it mr netanyahu captured the conflict succinctly there s a different battle here , he said it s a battle for peace but there s also a battle for truth charge and countercharge the way the conference worked today was this delegations gave their speeches in the ornate spendor of the royal palace then , at news briefings , they turned to denying and rebutting what the other had said thus , after prime minister yizhak shamir gave the israeli address , in which he called on arab negotiators to go to israel and was otherwise unbending , a palestinan leader , hanan ashrawi , registered tremendous dismay because mr shamir had not alluded to a palestinian identity he tried to negate our history , she said and after the jordanians and syrians had spokesmen speak , mr netanyahu went before the cameras to express pretty much the same dismay and level the same charges the arabs , he said , were trying to take away jewish history sometimes , arabisraeli exchanges ventured briefly into lightheartedness after mr aghazarian and mr zidon argued about the israeli closure of the university where mr aghazarian worked , mr zidon , a member of parliament from a small rightwing party , evoked wednesday s speech by secretary of state james a baker 3d let s stop crawling and start walking , go back home , sit there and talk to one another , he said i want to eat hummus in your place and you eat hummus in my place mr agharizian replied , well , i will eat maybe gefilte fish in your place kamal abu jaber , jordan s foreign minister , said he had been disappointed with mr shamir , too , and an israeli reporter told him he was disappointed that the minister had been disappointed i'm disappointed that you 're disappointed that i'm disappointed , mr abu jaber said and he had a rebuttal of the israeli demand that , should direct talks between israel and its arab neighbors begin , they not be held in the spanish capital why do n't we stay here in madrid \? he asked apart from other more earnest advantages that he listed , he added , the food s good in his address earlier to the conference , however , mr abu jaber had touched on a deeper point we cannot continue to inhabit two different universes in this small space of land with its limited resources , he said but the two universes seemed mutually contradictory today one history , two views in his account of the region s history , mr shamir evoked the early days of his country amid hostile neighbors a wave of oppression , expropriation and expulsion caused a mass exodus of some 800 , 000 jews from lands they had inhabited from before the rise of islam , he said not so , said farouk alsharaa , foreign minister of syria , which still does not permit its small jewish minority to leave as families and punishes those indidivual syrian jews who visit israel in his speech , mr sharaa referred to the tolerance with which the arabs treated the jews for hundreds of years , compared the israelis' treatment of palestinians with it unflatteringly , and spoke , in a hardline speech , of arab peacefulness that seemed to inspire mr netanyahu to suggest that the syrian official was rewriting history i suppose , he said , referring to the syrian government , that it opposed violence in hama recalling a slaughter with which a muslim fundamentalist uprising was put down in the early 1980 s by syrian government troops perhaps the most artful rewrite came from haidar abdelshafi , head of the palestinian side of the joint jordanianpalestinian delegation at the end of his speech , he quoted from yasir arafat s address to the united nations in 1974 , when the palestine liberation organization leader went before the general assembly with a pistol on his hip mr abdelshafi had the plo chairman saying , let not the olive branch of peace fall from my hands what history records mr arafat as saying , though , is i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter s gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hands somehow , today , the fighter s gun had hit the cuttingroom floor photo albert aghazarian , left , a palestinian , with lieut col raanan gissin , an israeli , in madrid yesterday \( reuters \) \( pg a8 \)
from h p lovecraft to stephen king , modern horror fiction has been concerned with the scariness of the unseen of evil spirits and the rustling sound in the back of a dark closet , of ghostly moans and overactive imaginations over the last few years , however , there has been a significant shift in horror fiction the genre s traditional jolt of fright now is provided by acts of violence described in elaborate , gruesome detail the results , at their most artful and bold , have included the serious popular fiction of thomas harris , whose novels red dragon and the silence of the lambs are full of a careful measured dread at its most snobbish and callow , the new horror has led to bret easton ellis s american psycho class animus as a slaughtering ground and with the rise of socalled splatterpunk fiction , an aggressively grubby underground movement now seeks to compete with more conventional horror writers like mr king , peter straub and dean r koontz most of this new horror fiction trades in the scariness of the seen , the notion that a reader will be frightened and entertained \? by the explicit depiction of horrific acts , including murder and every sort of mutilation of the body the writer commonly credited with coining the term splatterpunk , the novelist david j schow , put it this way , it s not enough to see the shadow behind the door people want to see what s making the shadow , what it looks like and how it comes apart in splatterpunk , ghosts have given way to serial killers boo ! has been replaced by yuck ! things do n't go bump in the night they emit wretched , agonized howls splatterpunk is a mocking echo of cyberpunk , the label applied to science fiction s hardboiled , hightech underground movement a decade ago it is also a conflation of splatter films \( the slang term for excessively violent movies like the friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street series \) and punk rock \( the willfully crude popmusic revolution sparked in the late 70 s \) in his anthology splatterpunks extreme horror , paul m sammon offers the movement s deceptively serene manifesto like surrealism before it , splatterpunk was a specific revolt against an artistic establishment in our case , the traditional , meekly suggestive horror story accordingly , splatterpunks is full of fiction unconcerned with spooky atmospherics or suspense most of the collection s stories are about cruel humans and the violence they commit here is a street fight in bath , england , as described in philip nutman s full throttle staff stumbled to his feet and kicked his foot hit hougan s chest , snapping the youth back , slamming his head to the pavement 'he s mine ! ' alex screamed , diving as he brought his right fist down like a piston , spreading hougan s nose across his face hougan was dead alex felt nothing no remorse , panic , no residue of the nausea he 'd felt earlier his head was unnaturally light and clear he 'd killed him as this suggests , a great deal of splatterpunk is not much more than a rougher , cruder version of pulp fiction and as befits a time when even every popculture phenomenon has its pretensions to respectability , most of the writers who create this stuff do not like being tagged as splatterpunks i like publicity for my fiction , of course , joe r lansdale , perhaps the genre s most interesting stylist , a texas writer with a healthy sense of black humor and moral outrage , has stated but i ai n't no splatterpunk and dislike the label i like to be thought of as my own label in his novels and short stories , mr lansdale condemns sexism , racism and the threat of nuclear extinction by setting most of his tales in a postapocalyptic landscape peopled by irradiated rednecks who loot , rape and murder with terrifying abandon mr lansdale s overriding idea is that we are becoming desensitized to violence , a problem he speculates will only get worse in on the far side of the cadillac desert with dead folks , he writes the last time wayne had been to law town he 'd bought a frontrow ticket to one of the executions and watched a chronic shoplifter , a redheaded rat of a man , get pulled apart by being chained between two soupedup tractors wayne had been put off by the whole thing it was n't organized enough and the drinks and food were expensive and the frontrow seats were too close to the tractors he had gotten to see that the redhead s insides were brighter than his hair , but some of the insides got sprinkled on his new shirt , and cold water or not , the spots had n't come out one reason splatterpunk exists is that it is horror fiction s natural response to what is going on around the edges of pop culture these days not only bloody exploitation films but also the hypedup world of rockmusic videos and the new raunchiness of many comic books \( the often all too aptly named graphic novels \) aimed at adults much of this work assumes that subtlety is pointless that part of the thrill of the esthetic experience is to be hit in the face by it splatterpunk is the print medium s latest attempt to compete with ever more sophisticated visual images , and if you take comfort from nothing else about this fiction , it is a measure of print s enduring vividness and power that violence seems even more punishingly assaultive and nasty in splatterpunk than it does in other media

albany , march 24 just one week before the legal deadline for a new state budget that must include 6 billion in spending cuts and new taxes , negotiations here have reached a bitter impasse brought on by the sheer magnitude of the task and especially deep divisions over what taxes should be raised rather than hammering away at a solution , top lawmakers and gov mario m cuomo seem more consumed with assigning blame for the standstill and the millions of dollars of costs incurred for local governments when , as now appears almost inevitable , they miss the deadline and on a weekend that would normally see a flurry of meetings and proposals , the state capitol was largely bereft of activity , save a few fans seeking refuge from a chill rainfall as they awaited a concert tonight by the grateful dead rock band some members of the democraticled assembly were at work , but mainly to draw up bills for their version of a budget , which includes a proposal to raise personal income taxes by nearly 1 billion and which both governor cuomo and the majority leader of the republicancontrolled state senate , ralph j marino , have already described as dead on arrival a feuding triumvirate the dissension here is not just partisan in fact , assembly speaker mel miller , the architect of the tax proposal spurned by mr cuomo and mr marino , has lashed out at the governor , his fellow democrat , at least as much as at mr marino for rejecting his ideas they are the triumvirate that fashion the budget i'm frustrated , mr miller said in an interview on friday the governor is basically saying , 'we 'll do it my way or no way' even president bush modified a position because he thought it was important to get an agreement on a national budget if george bush can do it , why ca n't mario cuomo do it \? i do n't understand it at all mr cuomo says that he is in fact open to alternatives to his 519 billion budget , but that he has yet to see any workable ones and he denounces both mr miller and mr marino for failing to agree between themselves on any spending plan they said they could produce an alternative budget without the governor , mr cuomo said in a telephone interview today they specifically said it would be easier to do it without the governor but it s too hard for them and so now they 've retreated into safe political trenches , and they 're ensconced there , waving political flags at each other the governor and mr miller have split most seriously over the tax issue mr cuomo has proposed a series of new fees and tax increases on everything from gasoline to snack foods , while the speaker says many of those measures are regressive in nature and should be supplanted by a broadbased , temporary increase in income taxes that would require wealthy taxpayers to pay more than poorer ones speaker miller s tax plan would also generate revenues to offset some of mr cuomo s spending cuts , restoring , for instance , about 200 million in proposed cuts in aid to new york city changes in these positions can eventually be used as bargaining chips for a compromise , but for the moment neither man seems inclined to yield while the governor and the speaker have at least offered specific approaches , mr marino has been less clear about what he wants he is as adamant as the governor in opposing incometax increases , saying they could hurt new york s competitive position relative to other states , but he has called for restoring many of mr cuomo s cuts in aid to local governments without detailing where he would alter the governor s budget last week mr marino also appeared to rule out raising the gasoline tax because , he contended , the assembly democrats had ruled it out in fact , mr miller did say he opposed using the gasoline tax as a way to balance the budget , but might not object to one that specifically provided extra revenue to repair roads and bridges none of the uncertainty has stopped mr marino or his fellow republicans from blaming the budget delay on mr miller and his 11thhour proposal , or from criticizing mr cuomo for being unyielding on his plan the costs of lateness are perhaps greater this year when the state fails to meet the april 1 constitutional deadline for a new budget , most state aid to local school districts and governments is frozen , forcing local officials to borrow the money this year , the state will temporarily lose revenues from whatever savings measures and tax increases it ultimately passes a tax increase passed may 1 , for instance , generates revenue for only 11 months of the fiscal year
the united technologies corporation is playing principal angel again at the yale center for british art in new haven the company , which had aided a major stubbs show , is now supporting richard parkes bonington 'on the pleasure of painting' and its 315page , 4 1 2pound catalogue , fully illustrated in color \( 3995 , soft cover \) for bonington , however , the show seems to be a first , at least in the united states the only other major retrospectives accorded the artist were in england in 1937 and 1965 this is where bonington was born , in 1802 , 15 days before the artist tom girtin died at the age of 27 turner is said to have remarked that if girtin , his contemporary and a formative influence , had lived i should have starved bonington , himself , survived 26 years , less one month , and , like girtin , died of lung disease the catalogue says that bonington was mourned in his birthplace , as a loss to english art , and in france , where he spent most of his life , as a loss to french art , with the additional honor of being compared to gericault , who had been cut off at 33 , a few years earlier this was the romantic era after closing in new haven , the exhibition , which is supported by additional grants from the national endowment for the arts and the federal council on the arts and humanities , travels to paris the organizer of the show and author of the catalogue , patrick noon , the center s curator of prints , drawings and rare books , seems to have combed the period for every detail pertaining to his subject and his associates , particularly delacroix his is a text that cannot be skimmed though popular in his time and for a few decades after , bonington went into history as just one of the many landscapists thronging england in the early 19th century brilliant talents all but none on the level of constable and turner it was rewarding to find one of his seascapes in an anthology and to reflect on the watercolor that he did of himself standing at the easel , back turned \( a late work at the national portrait gallery in london \) there were also the boningtons in the wallace collection in london but the revisionist wheel has turned , and now , at yale , the artist is a star there are 133 paintings , drawings and lithographs \( not bad for a career of less than 10 years \) , and they are accompanied by a score or so of works by delacroix , turner and other contemporaries most come from the center s collection and that of the louvre , but there are substantial reinforcements from other museums in the united kingdom \( excluding the wallace collection \) and the united states and from innumerable private collections the first impression is one of endless tranquillity smooth waters , pale yellow skies , fishing boats disgorging their catches , which seem always to be of skate or hake , and contented children in the pastoral scenes the trees are usually tall and slender , and their foliage is the sum of small dark strokes brushed over transparent washes of gray , green or brown here and there storm clouds gather , and a square rigger rides the choppy waters around dunkirk , along with small craft and bobbing buoys but mostly the weather is as calm as it is in near quilleboeuf , an especially beautiful scene of horses standing beside the water under a noonday sun those who remember bonington as a marine painter may be surprised at the amount of his history painting , a genre at which few english artists have excelled \( one , benjamin robert haydon , killed himself trying \) but as already indicated , bonington was not strictly an english painter for one thing , he studied with antoinejean gros , a history painter who was torn between the classical and the romantic and who also killed himself for art for another , he was breathing the same romantic air as delacroix literally , when the two shared a studio mr noon discusses this at length , noting gautier s contention that the modern revolution in french painting proceeded from bonington just as surely as her literary revolution proceeded from shakespeare he notes also that corot , in his youth , found the englishman an inspiration and regarded him as the first to approach nature with sincerity meanwhile , for baudelaire , bonington was the very embodiment of modernity beside the grotesquerie of much french art under napoleon for instance , ingres s grand but idiotic scene of a halfnaked thetis chucking an enthroned jupiter under the chin english painting must have seemed the proverbial dairy maid but in today s perspective classicism and romanticism seem to be two sides of the same coin of fantasy , except , of course , in their techniques in any case , bonington , like delacroix , was wont to take his history from novels , notably those of walter scott , and , predictably , the results are either anecdotal , theatrical or , in the case of quentin durward at liege , embarrassing the charm of these pictures , especially the one of henry iv s bed chamber , is in the color and texture of the drapery but when a comparison can be made between delacroix and bonington , as in the small oils that they did of seemingly the same man in greek national dress , delacroix wins the letter written by the french artist in 1861 is probably bonington s best requiem saying that he knew him well and loved him much , delacroix goes on to praise his lightness of touch , especially in watercolor , and to talk of the times the two shared he also recalls comforting him in his depression with the following \( wellchosen \) words you are king of your domain , and raphael could not do what you do do n't worry about other artists' qualities , nor the proportions of their pictures , since yours are masterworks other romantics may speculate about what might have been , but the one writing this review does n't dare on the pleasure of painting continues through jan 19 at the yale center for british art , 1080 chapel street , new haven talks are scheduled at the gallery on jan 9 and 16 at 11 am , and on jan 18 at noon photo beached vessels and a wagon near trouville , an oil on canvas by richard parkes

to the editor antinewsstand letters have appeared on this page jan 18 and feb 8 they may lead new yorkers to believe there is a proliferation of newsstands on our city sidewalks or that newsstands appear overnight with no rhyme or reason or that newsstand owners exceed the law by selling nonprinted merchandise none of that is the case the number of sidewalk newsstands has dramatically declined from 1 , 325 in 1950 to 298 today there has been a 25 percent loss in the number of newsstands since as recently as 1979 and newsstands outside manhattan have virtually become a thing of the past newsstands occupy less sidewalk space than ever the 298 newsstands could fit into the parking lot in front of city hall and leave room for free parking for our city s leaders newsstand placement and design is not haphazard , but governed by five city agencies , community boards and more than 20 pages of rules and regulations approval takes more than a year the designs must satisfy the operators' primary concern of safety in that newsstand workers and newsstand structures are constantly the focus of criminal activity newsstand operators must sell nonprinted merchandise if they are to survive the city council recognized this more than 22 years ago , when it changed the law to permit such sales the net profits to newsstand owners from the sale of newspapers is 4 cents to 5 cents a paper the average newsstand owner makes less than 10 , 000 a year from the sale of printed material would the writers of the antinewsstand letters be content with such an income \? i think not in general , the opponents of newsstands are real estate developers , landlords , powerful merchant groups and the professionals who represent them they do not speak for the average new yorker , who cannot afford home newspaper delivery newsstands were not the focus of such attacks when they were primarily operated by caucasian veterans and the disabled opposition began when the industry became dominated by asian immigrants sidewalk newsstands are a positive part of the city and are welcomed by new yorkers and tourists alike they are marvelous public conveniences and , as often recognized , newsstands on the sidewalks are beacons of safety in a crimeplagued city for more than 100 years , these were the needs that newsstands were designed to meet , not to act as revenue raisers for private business improvement groups or the city should the antinewsstand forces have their way , the city will lose much , for not only will newsstands go out of business , but also thousands of new yorkers whose jobs depend on a strong newspaper publishing industry will suffer so will the rest of us , from the loss of tax dollars generated by these jobs robert s bookman counsel , new york city newsstand operators association new york , feb 14 , 1991
northampton , mass so there he was , the president of the united states , preparing to lead by example , offering to show us the way out of our economic morass it was the day after thanksgiving the president had come to frederick , md , to go to the mall it was a typical middleincome , middleclass mall , filled with foot lockers and radio shacks , thom mcans and fashion bugs the president headed straight for j c penney he bought four pairs of tube socks and a toddler s sweatsuit he paid 28 none of the accounts i read mention whether he paid in cash or with a credit card i'm guessing cash you see a thing like this and you do n't know whether to laugh or cry tube socks \? twentyeight dollars \? this is how we 're going to spend our way out of the recession \? i do n't mean to suggest that we wo n't eventually spend our way into a healthier economy we always have before it s just that president bush s performance lacked a certain , shall we say , conviction he made no impulse purchases he did n't browse through the mall all afternoon and he did n't buy anything he could n't really afford , but figured , ah , i 'll use my credit card he may have bought , in other words , but he did n't shop the economists all agree that we 're not going to pull out of this recession until we really start shopping again it s a funny way to think about it , i suppose the economists usually prefer nicesounding phrases like an upswing in consumer spending , which lends a patina of respectability to the crass business of buying things consumer spending is shopping an upswing in consumer spending is more shopping shopping is the great american pastime myself , i think we ought not be so sheepish about admitting it out loud do you doubt me \? never mind rodeo drive or fifth avenue what about aspen , where , on a glorious midsummer s afternoon , sun shining against breathtaking mountains , the streets are lined with tourists , wandering from one pricy shop to the next \? santa fe \? freeport , me \( america s outlet capital \) \? haymarket square in boston \? ghirardelli square in san francisco \? the galleria in houston \? they 're all lined with tourists , wandering from store to store it can seem insane sometimes , this urge to shop , when there are so many other possibilities it can also be impossible to resist i had a free day in chicago this summer , so i decided to drive out to oak park and take the frank lloyd wright walking tour there were maybe a dozen other people on the tour then i went down to michigan avenue , the heart of the shopping district thousands of people were strolling up and down the street , in and out of stores they had this great , wonderful city at their feet and they were shopping then again , so was i as it happens , i live in a shopping town , though a small one our cute , revitalized downtown is lined with the kind of shops , as a writer once memorably put it , where you can get what you want , but not what you need on saturdays , our little streets are every bit as crowded as michigan avenue , as people come from miles around just to shop the oldtimers hate it , of course hate the way the hardware store has been preempted by a benetton s the newcomers sniff , the way locals always sniff at the tourist trade but i think we 're lucky our town has survived the massachusetts downturn much better than most neighboring towns we 've been saved by shopping the country has always been saved by shopping for better or worse , shopping is embedded in our culture it is what we do it has also been an engine of prosperity surely , the most important financial innovation in this century was the installment loan , which made it possible for americans to buy things with money they did n't yet have when the credit card arrived in the late 50 s to further propel the economy , it was simply a more convenient form of installment loan thirtyfive years ago , in the affluent society , john kenneth galbraith lamented the rise of the installment loan , the consumer society it was fueling , and the advertising that creates the wants it seeks to satisfy there was much truth in what he said , so much so that tens of thousands of americans went out and bought his scathing indictment of their behavior , pushing the affluent society onto the bestseller list and then they went right on shopping and the economy kept right on growing it s when we stop shopping that we get into trouble when we lose our zest for the sport , fearful that we wo n't have the money tomorrow to pay for the things we ca n't afford today so here we are , on a sunday in december , 17 shopping days till christmas \( and is n't that a phrase that speaks volumes about who we are \? \) i suppose we could plunk down 28 for tube socks as the president did or we could do something else we could buy something big , something we probably do n't need , something we 'll have to pay off over time we could shop till we drop what the heck that s what made this country great drawing

vilnius , lithuania , sept 14 at the sprawling flea market on the edge of this city , the old system , energetically represented by a police inspector , oleg orlov , today confronted the new entrepreneurial spirit , as personified by narine paciaviciene inspector orlov won today s round , but mrs paciaviciene retained seemingly boundless confidence that her views would soon prevail in this newly independent land it all began with two boxes of chocolate , an item virtually impossible to find on the scantily provisioned shop shelves of the city mrs paciavicience found the candy bars in moscow , and was briskly selling them for 10 rubles each considerably more than she had paid , and a goodly amount here when the police confiscated her supply on charges of speculation such laws against trading in scarce goods for personal gain were a cornerstone of the command economy imposed by the soviets , and remain on the books in lithuania the statute is among the many obstacles to a market economy that people here expect that the nation s parliament will soon repeal but lithuanian officials acknowledge that reversing sovietingrained hostility toward commerce will take longer the fact is she is buying it cheaper and selling it for more , inspector orlov declared as he spurned mrs paciaviciene s pleas for understanding that s speculation , and it s still against the law my personal opinion is that i do n't think we should change this law , said the inspector , a 17year police veteran , casting himself as defender of the common man an old lady that has money , she comes to shop and she ca n't buy anything , he went on on the other hand , a person with a lot of money can buy everything they have then the average person ends up having to beg for goods the clash between inspector orlov and mrs paciaviciene is an illustration of the long road ahead as the newly independent baltic nations try to undo 50 years of communism only a limited revolution indeed , the two weeks since estonia , latvia and lithuania became free from the soviet union have witnessed a revolution more of the mind than the marketplace none of the new nations has yet launched an economic reform program , and there have been few changes in people s daily lives here in lithuania , the staterun stores still offer a sparse array of goods fatty meat , occasional fresh vegetables and watermelon yet flea markets like the one inspector orlov patrolled are jammed with goods , as they were before the changes of the last few weeks inspector orlov said lithuanian independence had meant little more to his daily life than a new uniform emblazoned with new national emblems but mrs paciaviciene insisted that for her and many other lithuanians , the twoyear struggle for independence has marked the beginning of a journey from despair to hope for the future a 26yearold from the town of ukmerge , she was among the thousands of people who assembled early in january to defend the lithuanian parliament and government buildings against kremlin military attack last month , when the soviet coup against president mikhail s gorbachev failed and lithuania soon became independent , mrs paciaviciene said her thoughts turned to trade it s a big change , she said now we must not look only at the television news we must look after our homes and our families asked if she was downhearted at the lack of immediate improvement in her life , she replied we need time not everybody understands it like that but we need time her husband works at a dairy , and their combined income , including state payments for their two children , amounts to 460 rubles a month , about 12 at current exchange rates so , like many others in the baltic countries and the soviet union , she supplements her income by trade in scarce items bought through contacts in moscow and flowers grown on a small plot owned by her grandfather in the country the candy bars seized by inspector orlov who also had on his desk a number of bottles of brandy , razors and other items were a major investment mrs paciaviciene wept for a few moments at the thought of their loss but then her face brightened we will win , she said it s just a matter of time the gariunai market , where mrs paciaviciene was hawking her candy bars , is a swirling carnival of goods underwear , american cigarettes , eggs and even boxes of birthcontrol pills many of those who came out on this balmy saturday echoed the sentiments of loreta sulciaviene , 31 , who said maybe inside we feel very happy , but only inside otherwise the situation is still not too good here , you can see a lot of things we do n't have in the shops
madrid , oct 29 on the eve of his nation s first peace conference with all its neighbors in four decades of hostility , prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel said today that our quest for peace is unrelenting , and a palestinian leader praised the new tone emerging from israel their comments helped generate some initial guarded optimism that the talks opening here on wednesday morning , cosponsored by the united states and the soviet union , and arranged by secretary of state james a baker 3d in eight hard months of diplomacy , would prove less shortlived than the last middle east peace conference in geneva in 1973 , which met once and never reconvened despite the agreement of all concerned that weeks , months or years of work remain before any major results can be expected , and despite the fears of many that the effort will end in failure , the arrival of the delegations in madrid apparently signified that the effort was actually going to be made that is an accomplishment in itself , after so many disappointments and false starts , and one that makes further accomplishments at least conceivable uncertainty on direct talks but even on the eve of the conference there was still uncertainty about a key part of the conference the direct talks between israel and each of its neighbors , which are supposed to start on sunday in madrid not only is there still disagreement between israel and the arabs on where any talks after sunday s session in madrid should take place , but syria is also holding out for the presence of the united states and the soviet union in the room , a procedure that israel rejects president mikhail s gorbachev , speaking for president bush and himself , appealed to all the participants in the conference to act responsibly , with great understanding , despite a fresh outburst of violence in the middle east although most experts on the region say they believe that only an israeli agreement to yield occupied territory in return for arab acceptance of a fullfledged peace treaty would make real success possible , mr bush firmly declined after a luncheon meeting with the soviet president to embrace the land for peace formula , even by implication we 're not here to impose a settlement , we are here to be a catalyst , he said at a news conference i do n't want to give anybody reason to walk away or make additional conditions because of anything i say it has been assumed that the easiest set of negotiations between israel and its arab partners concerns the west bank of the jordan there already is something of a consensus that it is now time to negotiate an interim agreement as called for in the 1978 camp david accord by which palestinians would take control of their own domestic affairs , and could elect their own representatives , pending a final settlement of the issue a more difficult problem is what would happen next palestinian spokesmen say that they want this interim solution to be followed by creation of an independent palestinian state , which could become confederated with jordan but israel and the united states both oppose a separate palestinian state mr baker sought to reassure the syrians and others who have doubted washington s longterm commitment to the peace process by denying that he planned to name a special middle east envoy , as the state department s deputy spokesman , richard boucher , had said last week that he would the naming of such an envoy might have implied that mr baker and mr bush meant to turn their attention elsewhere after the opening phase of the talks this week israel , jordan , syria , lebanon and the palestinians will sit down wednesday along the shank of a tshaped table in the marble hall of columns in the largest royal palace in western europe , the eastern palace on the west side of madrid , about a mile from the prado museum francisco franco lay in state there , beneath tapestries and bronze statues , after his death in 1975 welcome from sponsors none of the principals will speak until thursday the speeches wednesday will be delivered by prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain , president gorbachev and president bush , and representatives from egypt and the european community mr bush , who arrived only this morning after an allnight flight , will head back across the atlantic shortly after the morning session ends mr gorbachev will travel to southern france for a meeting with president francois mitterrand the israelis agreed this morning that the palestianians and the jordanians would each be permitted 45 minutes for their opening statements , although both are theoretically part of the same delegation an israeli official said his government had no choice but to yield to american insistence on that point , because we 're not about to walk out on a technical point , and washington was n't budging there was no agreement , however , on the procedure for the facetoface talks between israel and each of its arab neighbors that will begin on sunday after an initial session here , confined to arrangements , israel wants to continue at sites in the middle east the arabs want to continue in madrid the syrians also want the united states and soviet union to be present in the direct talks the israelis do n't want them there , arguing that that would dilute the direct nature of the meeting , which they want to emphasize discussion of procedure
thornwood , ny , dec 5 people in switzerland who knew the childcare worker charged with setting a fire that killed a 3monthold baby here have expressed shock and incredulity at the accusations , a swiss newspaper said today the paper , blick , interviewed an administrator of juventusschulen , a school in zurich where the 20yearold nanny , olivia riner , had studied to be a medical assistant i do n't believe it at all , the administrator , margrit thoma , was quoted as saying olivia was one of our best students blick , published in zurich and switzerland s largest newspaper , also quoted a neighbor of miss riner s parents in their home town , wettingen it must be a mistake , the neighbor was quoted as saying anonymously the family is without blemish and works hard olivia was always friendly and caring it is simply impossible that this girl did such an atrocity the police in thornwood , a central westchester hamlet in the town of mount pleasant , say that miss riner was home alone with the baby of denise and william fischer when she deliberately set three fires in separate bedrooms the fire damaged the ground floor of the splitlevel house and badly burned the infant , kristie investigators said miss riner had used flammable liquids and had poured some on the baby the child s official cause of death was smoke inhalation 3 other fires confirmed we 're prepared to show that she did it , paul j oliva , the mount pleasant police chief , said today but miss riner s lawyer , laura a brevetti , said i do n't think it s as open and shut as one would think the cops do n't know what happened and she does n't know what happened there are alternative theories if this is , in fact , arson to the one that she is the perpetrator the police here confirmed today that at least three other suspicious fires have occurred this fall in the fischers' neighborhood , all of them before miss riner arrived the police said that the other fires in a barn , in a house and in a car were being investigated as possibly cases of arson all occurred in late september within a mile of the fischer home in thornwood miss riner did not begin working for the fischers until nov 1 the police were studying whether these fires and the one on monday were connected we have n't ignored that possibility , chief oliva said a hearing in the mount pleasant town court on friday morning will determine whether the case , as expected , goes before a grand jury only after an indictment would the question of bail for miss riner be discussed we 're doing everything we can to make sure she does get bail and is released , her lawyer , ms brevetti , said the nonprofit cultural exchange agency that provided the fischers with miss riner , e f au pair in cambridge , mass , is paying ms brevetti s legal fees she is a partner in a manhattan law firm , morrison , cohen , singer weinstein au pairs are usually young european women who live with a family while caring for children in the united states they are often visiting on oneyear cultural exchange visas ms brevetti was formerly the chief of the justice department s organizedcrime strike force in new york she has also worked in the brooklyn district attorney s office as an assistant prosecutor miss riner s parents , kurt and marlies riner , have arrived here from switzerland and have checked into a hotel not far from the fischers' house and the westchester county jail where their daughter is imprisoned repeated calls were made to the hotel today , but the riners could not be reached for comment an only daughter blick , the swiss newspaper , described mr riner as a regional chief of civil defense and mrs riner as a parttime worker in the office of an autorepair shop miss riner is their only daughter until going to the united states , she lived with her parents in their thirdfloor appartment in wettingen , a town in northern switzerland on the limmat river e f au pair said miss riner had been a baby sitter for a family for three years , had worked in the pediatric unit of a swiss hospital and had graduated from a twoyear college ms thoma , the swiss school official , was quoted as saying that miss riner had been near the top of her class parents continued to come forward today with complaints about e f au pair the agency has said that job candidates go through an eighthour screening process and that they are given little financial support once they arrive dr ruth striegelmoore , who is an assistant professor of psychology at wesleyan university and who lives in cheshire , conn , was one such parent in the contract , she said , you are told that the family gets called on a regular basis by the regional coordinator the au pair herself is supposed to have regular meetings with her local counselor , who should get together all the girls in the area for social support none of that happened , professor striegelmoore said the neighborhood around the fischer home here seems to be a study in suburban isolation virtually none of the halfdozen or so immediate neighbors knew the fischers personally , even though mr fischer , who owns an autorepair shop , has lived there for many years only one resident reported ever having seen miss riner since she arrived the fischers have told the police that they were pleased with miss riner s job performance and that they had detected nothing strange

in 1983 the new britain museum of american art celebrated its 80th anniversary with , among other things , a show of landscapes by allen butler talcott \( 18671908 \) the artist did not make it into either the statewide connecticut and american impressionism of 1980 or the 1982 traveling show of tonalism he was , nonetheless , the right choice for new britain , since the museum started out with a generous endowment from his uncle , john butler talbott , founder of the american hosiery company now the mattatuck museum in waterbury is featuring talcott but without mentioning the new britain show or any other that may have taken place in the interim these 27 canvases , which were recently discovered in storage , appeared earlier in the year at the cooley gallery in old lyme , where 17 of them were sold the mattatuck presentation could , therefore , be called a celebration of ownership there is nothing unusual about that the trouble is that in these cornercutting times such transactions tend to bypass the viewer who has no vested interest all that the cooley gallery catalogue provides is a brief biography and some blackandwhite reproductions with captions that sometimes border on the effusive the only quotes are two from the artist s obituary in the new york herald and one from a book titled representative citizens of connecticut though authorities on this period in american art abound , none have been invited to set the artist in context or comment on his work as a production , this exhibit , the poetry of light and land has a hitandrun air about it as a package of paintings , though , it is worth a visit born in hartford , talcott attended trinity college while following his natural inclination by taking classes at the hartford art society , then directed by dwight tryon after that , he proceeded to manhattan spending a brief period at the art students league before going on to paris he spent three years at the academy julian there , under jeanpaul laurens and benjamin constant talcott s biography , standard for an artist with means in those days , includes membership in the salmagundi club and exposure there as well as at the national academy of design , the carnegie institute and other salons he also particpated in the st louis exposition of 1904 , winning a silver medal talcott began summering at old lyme when its art colony , founded by henry ward ranger , tended toward the barbizon style when he bought property there in 1903 , childe hassam was introducing impressionism although dated canvases are few and far between in this display , it seems safe to surmise that , in the decade before his death , talcott , like many of his contemporaries , was moving from barbizon to impressionism street in martigues suggests that his progress was rapid , for it is a contrived scene , with a young woman posed picturesquely in the foreground , and seems to have been painted in the studio the subject of the painting , if not its quality , dates it around 1897 , the year that talcott rented with frank dumond van gogh s house in arles to no esthetic avail , apparently most of the pictures are painted on panels , and the russet tone of the wood shows through to advantage though some are sketchier than others tower by the bridge , for example few of these pictures want for spontaneity the color is often quite strong , as in autumn afternoon , in which reddened trees reflected in bluewhite water contrast with violet growth in the background normally the pigment is applied in small brisk strokes , but it seems sponged on in parts of this picture and in a twilight scene of 1902 , where the trees are greenblack , and the sky is clotted cream touched with pink and cerulean there are broad studies of trees with dark contours that have a cloisonne look and , in glimpse of lord cove , the handling of the foreground tree is almost art nouveau yet in the ledge , an unusually precise study of a rock with a tree growing out of it , the artist looks back to barbizon this pleasant but repetitious show , which is aimed at the seemingly insatiable public appetite for haveaniceday art , proves that talcott died a talented painter more talented than many of his contemporaries who went on to impressionist fame but there s nothing in the selection to indicate that he would have scaled the heights the poetry of light and land remains through next sunday at the mattatuck museum , 144 west main street in waterbury the last in a series of lunchtime lectures , the cos cob art colony , will be given at the museum at noon on tuesday by susan tritschler , director of the historical society of greenwich photo a glimpse of lord cove , an oil on panel by allen butler talcott \( the cooley gallery \)
albany in new york state , we have almost five times as many inmates as we did 20 years ago , and the state now spends well over a billion dollars a year on them with no significant decrease in crime as a result of criminal justice policies like new york s , the united states now incarcerates more people per capita than any other nation , and more black men per capita than south africa money is too scarce for us to continue to spend it so foolishly we should stop putting addicts who peddle small quantities of drugs in prison and use the resources made available more productively against the major distributors of drugs and violent criminals at least 80 percent of new york state inmates are substance abusers many of those are incarcerated for stealing , stabbing or shooting , and they certainly should be in prison but it is those who are serving time for the sale or possession of drugs alone now about 20 , 000 in new york state who have driven the huge expansion of our prison population a few of them fit the stereotypical image of the drug dealer they were brought in wearing gold chains and carried a thick wad of cash they owned flashy cars , and had access to a private attorney they belong in prison , too all the rest , however , had no gold , no cash , no automobile and no private lawyer they are lowlevel addicts , selling drugs in return for a supply of drugs for themselves streetlevel addicts are in prison mainly because we have been far more eager to build prison cells than drugtreatment slots and under new york state law , a judge must send a defendant to prison for a substantial term upon second conviction for a felony this was logical , at one time the drug dealer carrying a greater quantity of drugs felony weight was presumed , not unreasonably , to be in the serious player category the dealer who carried a lesser quantity misdemeanor weight was a minor player today , however , crack addicts generally carry felony weight , perhaps because a very small quantity of crack qualifies and perhaps because crack addicts have too little sense of reality to bother carrying smaller amounts therefore , the felonymisdemeanor distinction no longer serves its intended purpose the meaningful distinction today is between the entrepreneur dealer with money , a car and a private lawyer , and the addict with none of these things it may take two weeks or a month to replace the bigtime dealers in a neighborhood it may take 30 seconds to replace the lowlevel peddler the wholesale approach to streetlevel drug dealing trying to arrest all the perpetrators is ineffective because , even if caught , lowlevel players are quickly and easily replaced a targeted approach interrupting the supply of drugs to the street by focusing on arresting midlevel players would shrink the ability of serious drug dealers to recruit new users and petty sellers , and thus more effectively reduces street action and its attendant violence true , a targeted approach represents a compromise between decriminalization and our present policies of incarceration but while the arguments against decriminalization , whether or not they are correct , are at least rational , there is no rational argument for continuing current practices arrest and incarceration of lowlevel addicted peddlers directs scarce resources away from where they would best hamper the drug trade the present policy has overwhelmed our police , our prisons , our budgets and our souls our streets are more dangerous , not safer we can hardly do worse we can easily do better
chaska , minn to understand how the united states open assembles the 156 golfers who will tee off today at hazeltine national , you need only to know the story of the resigning united states golf association official who wondered what to do with his blue blazer you can keep the blazer , he was informed , but you have to send the buttons back at the open , the buttons seem more important than the blazer ever since francis ouimet stunned harry vardon and ted ray in a 1913 playoff , the open has thought of itself as the world s most prestigious golf tournament but judging by the absence of a few winning touring pros from around the world and the pga tour , if the open is to sustain its reputation , the united states golf association needs to increase its number of exempt players yes , all the marquee names are here but most of those marquee names now are europeans nick faldo , ian woosnam , seve ballesteros of the 10 leading americans on the pga tour s money list , only hale irwin , the threetime open champion who will be defending the championship he won at medinah last year , won a major title in the 80 s faldo , woosnam , ballesteros and irwin each emerged from at least one of the 12 categories of golfers exempt from local and sectional qualifying for various reasons , notably , winning the open in the last 10 years , winning the masters , british open or professional golfers association championship in the last five years , the 15 leading finishers and ties in last year s open but three winners on this year s pga tour are not here kenny perry \( the memorial \) , ted schulz \( los angeles open \) , jay don blake \( shearson lehman san diego open \) also missing are several of the european pga tour s best players , notably steve richardson and sam torrance of england , eduardo romero of argentina and david feherty of ireland blake , the 10th leading moneywinner on the pga tour , and schultz failed in the sectional qualifying perry chose not to file an open entry by the april 24 deadline if a touring pro is good enough to win a pga tour event this year , he s certainly good enough to win the open or at least contend , as blake did at oak hill two years ago and a winning touring pro surely deserves a spot in the open more than , say , an assistant pro from the metal woods country club who happens to qualify , then shoots 7878 to miss the cut of the 156 golfers here , at least 50 are virtual nonames whose chances of winning are slim and none yes , the open should be open to an assistant pro , but a spot should be preserved for a winner of a pga tour event who is not otherwise exempt from qualifying at the masters , the winner of any pga tour event during the previous 12 months is awarded an automatic invitation for the open , the usga reserves the right to issue up to three special exemptions this year only jack nicklaus , whose various exemptions had finally expired , was invited as for foreign golfers , the usga issued all seven of its exemptions this year but with the dominance of european golfers lately , that s not enough as the usga is aware we 're thinking about changing some of the exempt categories for foreign golfers , but not about increasing the overall total of exemptions , said david fay , the usga executive director there s been no thought of adding pga tour winners to the exempt list we have 64 exempt players in this year s open and any more than that would be troubling to us we want the open to remain open but unless changes occur , it will remain more difficult for an american to compete in the united states open than the british open in the british open , any american in the top 50 in the sony world rankings is exempt from qualifying , along with anybody among the pga tour s top 10 money winners not otherwise exempt until recently , the british open needed to attract as many american golfers as possible but now europe has most of the marquee players as the golfers themselves know better than anyone according to tom watson , whose current open exemption expires after next year s return to his triumph at pebble beach , 10 or 15 more exemptions for players around the world and in the us would still allow plenty of open spots faldo suggested that the four major tournaments \( united states open , british open , masters and pga championship \) get together on exemptions if you finish high in one major , faldo said , maybe you should be exempt in all the majors but for the usga , that might be too much like saying you can keep the blazer and the buttons
moscow , june 3 the chief soviet law enforcement officer denied today that soviet troops shot and killed civilians during a violent confrontation in lithuania last january , sharply contradicting accounts by western journalists and lithuanian demonstrators who witnessed the assault in a preliminary report to the soviet legislature on its investigation into the killing of 13 demonstrators and one kgb security officer during the seizure of the vilnius television tower , the soviet prosecutor , gen nikolai trubin , said the military s actions were justified , and he blamed the republic s leadership for the jan 13 attack the hardline report states that the victims had not been crushed by tanks or shot by troops , as lithuanians and westerners who saw the events described , but that they were shot and killed by lithuanian militants or crushed under their cars tensions have remained high in vilnius , where late tonight about 50 , 000 people gathered around the parliament building after soviet army troops were seen in the area examining the documents of young men and detaining some of them , several witnesses said fearing a direct assault on the parliament , which has been protected by antitank barriers and lithuanian militia forces since last january , lithuanian leaders urged everyone who could get there to come and act as witnesses , according to algimantas jokubenas , a journalist for lithuanian television i just walked around the parliament , and i only saw a few army officers with stubby machine guns like the ones paratroopers use , mr jokubenas said in a telephone interview he and other people interviewed by telephone in vilnius tonight said they had seen no evidence of tanks or largescale troop movements , but that many people would stand watch around the parliament all night soviet troops came to the lithuanian capital , vilnius , last january supposedly at the behest of kremlin supporters fearful of discrimination by the lithuanian government lithuanians denounce report lithuanian officials denounced the report as filled with impudent and boundless lies and said that soviet investigators had not witnessed the events or the autopsies on the victims and could not have the forensic evidence to support their conclusions president mikhail s gorbachev has denied that he approved the attack or knew of it in advance , but he has never disavowed the action and he , too , blamed the lithuanian government of president vytautas landsbergis for causing the bloodshed by refusing to renounce independence claims issued in march 1990 'no value is placed on truth' responding today to the soviet prosecutor s report , mr landsbergis said no value is placed on truth and justice and there are not even signs of evolution toward a lawbased state this document is a tragedy and gorbachev and his agencies have completely compromised themselves the prosecutor s report , which was commissioned by mr gorbachev , said that the troops took appropriate measures in defending themselves against attacks by lithuanian militants who assaulted them with a barrage of homemade bombs , automatic weapons fire , knives , sticks and rods the soldiers had to defend themselves with rifle butts and warning shots , according to the official findings , but it said that by and large , the troops used blanks when firing their rifles and tank guns source of fatal shots the report said that the results of forensic examinations disclosed that six people were killed by shots hitting them in the back from above , evidence that the report said indicated that they were killed by lithuanians holed up in the broadcast station or sniping from nearby rooftops an investigation by the lithuanian prosecutor s office earlier found that nine people were killed by military ammunition and four more were crushed under the treads of tanks the report issued today says flatly that there were no incidents of tanks running into protesters , and cites anonymous witnesses as saying that people from the crowd were pushed under the tracks of the tanks juozas gaudutis , the lithuanian prosecutor s investigator who conducted the earlier inquiry , said today that the official findings were groundless and that none of the soviet investigators took part in the autopsies on the victims or showed any interest at the time in examining the bodies it would be interesting to know what kind of forensic evidence they have , mr gaudutis said their findings are pure invention
west palm beach , fla , dec 7 the prosecution rested its case in the william k smith rape trial today after calling its 23d witness , and the defense got underway with the testimony of a bartender who says he met with mr smith s accuser only a few hours before she says the rape occurred judge mary e lupo barred the prosecution from calling an authority on rape trauma syndrome as its final witness the judge ruled that prosecutors had waited too long to declare their intention to call him , and that allowing him to testify would throw off the trial schedule because the defense would need a recess of several days to prepare she has promised the jury the case will conclude by dec 20 the day concluded with defense testimony from henry c lee , director of the connecticut state police crime laboratory , who examined the clothes the woman was wearing when she said she was raped he testified that none of her garments contained any blood , grass or soil stains or any other indications that a struggle had taken place on the lawn near the kennedy compound the defense began its case with anthony liott , a bartender who said he met with mr smith s accuser at a palm beach restaurant around 1 am on march 30 , three hours before she says mr smith raped her the restaurant , taboo , is in the expensive worth avenue section of palm beach , roughly 10 blocks from au bar , the chic club where she and mr smith met the woman made no mention of her visit to taboo in any of her statements to lawenforcement authorities about the events that evening asked about this during her crossexamination thursday , she said she recalled seeing mr liott around that time but could not recall the specific date mr smith s lawyers are expected to argue that this omission shows that even before the encounter with mr smith occurred , the accuser s memory was selective and unreliable the 49yearold mr liott , wearing a shirt with an open collar and jeans and acting with the casualness of one tending bar , said he had first met the accuser nine or ten years earlier , and had seen her intermittently since he said she had proposed getting together earlier in the week and called him earlier that evening to confirm the meeting it was n't a 'date date' type of thing , said mr liott he said their relationship had always been platonic on crossexamination , mr liott described the accuser as maybe on the shy side a little bit , and said he liked her very much he said she did not appear drunk that night and did not drink for the 15 to 20 minutes they spent together this meeting had nothing to do with drugs , did it \? asked the prosecutor , moira k lasch mr liott said it did not , but the question allowed the chief defense lawyer , roy e black , to hint at the woman s prior drug use , a topic judge lupo had previously ruled offlimits mr black asked mr liott whether she had asked him anything about cocaine , or about supplying anything he said she had not charles m sieger , an architect from miami , was the first of several experts the defense plans to call given the hard surfaces found throughout the kennedy home , he told the court , it is a loud house that is , one in which sounds from inside and out travel easily with the windows open , he said , sounds from fairly long distances could be heard inside clearly had the woman screamed as she says mr smith s assault caused her to , the defense contends , the sounds would surely have been heard inside mr sieger also testified that the house , designed early in this century by the noted florida architect and builder addison mizner , had never been fitted for air conditioning that suggests , mr smith s lawyers say , that on the night of the incident the windows were open , just as senator edward m kennedy and others have said mrs lasch challenged that assessment , noting that mizner houses were wellknown for their fine insulation that was why , she said , no air conditioning had ever been installed she established that mr sieger was not an expert in acoustics , then reminded him that the audibility of outside sound depends on wind and waves and she added acidly if this house were as noisy as you stated , no one would ever fall asleep , would they \? this morning the prosecution called its final group of witnesses stephen hatch , a professor of rangeland ecology at texas a m university , testified that the material found in the woman s underwear included a piece of bermuda grass of the sort that could be found on the lawn it was there , she says , that mr smith tackled her , held her on the ground , and forced himself on her questioned by mark seiden , a defense lawyer , dr hatch said that the wind could have blown the grass onto the beach , where the defense says a consensual encounter occurred , or the grass could even have been growing there a bruise and a tremor dr barry lotman , an orthopedic surgeon who had previously treated the accuser for back problems , testified that when he examined her on april 5 , six days after the incident , she had a bruise the size of a silver dollar , 3 to 10 days old , near her right shoulder blade he said he also detected a tremor in right arm , almost like a palsy , a fine shaking that he attributed to anxiety but he told mr seiden he saw no signs of scrapes or abrasions , and that her prior injuries would not have limited her ability to kick , scratch , punch , run , or scream before concluding her case , mrs lasch tried to call dean g kilpatrick of the medical university of south carolina in charleston , who has written extensively on the psychological effect of rape in barring his testimony , judge lupodid not preclude the prosecution from trying to call him during its rebuttal case photo jean smith , mother of william k smith , wishing her son well before his entering the courtroom on the sixth day of testimony in the rape trial in west palm beach , fla mrs smith is not permitted in the courtroom while it is in session because she is a potential witness \( the new york times \)

tapestries adorn the walls and helicopters carry officials to meetings , but these days the onceprosperous port authority of new york and new jersey is in the unaccustomed position of paring costs and pleading for money stagnant revenues , rising expenses , the travails of the airlines , shifts in trade and , to an extent , some of the authority s own initiatives have led it to seek a 1 increase in bridge and tunnel tolls only months after a similar plan was withdrawn in the face of opposition in renewing its campaign for higher tolls , the authority is trying to overcome its freespending image and stressing its role in spurring growth as the regional economy stumbles it asserts that 425 , 000 jobs depend on business sectors anchored by its investments and that another 166 , 000 construction and 20 , 000 permanent jobs will be generated by what it hopes will be 54 billion in new capital spending over the next five years and private investment that will accompany it 2 postponements but without higher tolls , the agency says , it will be forced to cut into plans to rehabilitate and expand not only its hudson river crossings but also the region s airports just as they face increasing competition from airports in other parts of the country and even with a rise , expanding the capacity of the goethals bridge between elizabeth , nj , and staten island , building a rail link to kennedy international airport and unclogging the alltoocommon jam in the bronx from the george washington bridge will have to wait the case that we must have an increase to continue the capital program is airtight , said richard c leone , chairman of the 70yearold bistate authority but despite a report from the accounting firm of kpmg peat marwick supporting its case , the agency has twice in recent days postponed a vote on raising tolls to 4 , from 3 , after failing to gain the support of both gov jim florio of new jersey and gov mario m cuomo of new york both have the power to veto the increase mr florio has already rejected a 25cent increase in the path fare that the authority had also sought mr leone acknowledged that a toll increase would be an enormous burden for the governors , given public antipathy to higher taxes and fees but the 130 million that such an increase would provide which could enable the authority to issue bonds to finance about 1 billion in new investments would also seem an enormously tempting sum for two men struggling to fill huge budget deficits in the negotiations , new york and new jersey are seeking to speed up some projects already in the authority s plan and to add others that could take some of the strain off the fiscally stressed states state s plans new jersey is interested in help for several expensive undertakings , including a masstransit link to newark international airport , a secaucus transfer station that would let some nj transit rail passengers switch to trains on northeast corridor tracks for new york city and a connection at kearny that would link the nj transit morris and essex line to northeast corridor tracks new york state is concerned about residents on staten island , who are surrounded by toll bridges and have scant masstransit options so far the changes being discussed by both states are said to affect about 400 million of the authority s plan but if the talks drag on , there is a danger of a tug of war that could push the figure higher , forcing the agency to cut projects that it wants , even with a toll increase this kind of interstate bickering is only going to lead to problems , said richard t anderson , president of the regional plan association he said the authority should raise tolls by 2 , pulling it even with the triborough bridge and tunnel authority , which charges 250 each way on its east river crossings past and present at odds but the automobile club of new york , in a letter to mr cuomo , called the port authority toll increase discriminatory against motorists , especially on staten island it questioned the agency s policy of using the suplus from the hudson crossings , which the auto club put at about 200 million a year , to subsidize the path system we know of no valid reason why bridge and tunnel users should be singled out to pay for a capital program that includes relatively little in the way of bridge and tunnel facility improvements , it said politicking over tolls seems almost out of character for an agency that had the savvy to outfox robert moses twice gaining control of the airports and building the bus terminal in midtown over his objections and the wherewithal to build what were once the world s tallest buildings , the twin towers of the world trade center very few people believe that we 're in need of a cash infusion , said stanley brezenoff , the authority s executive director that may be in part because of the authority s reputation for perquisites and salaries that mr cuomo has complained are too high of the authority s 9 , 480 employees , 49 are paid 100 , 000 or more a year the metropolitan transportation authority has 64 employees who are paid 100 , 000 or more , but has a payroll of 67 , 000

jelly roll morton group michael s pub 211 east 55th street through may 11 from the perspective of seven decades , it is now apparent that the most important jazz musicians of the 1920 s were louis armstrong and jelly roll morton armstrong was prominently active until his death in 1971 as his fame continued to spread but morton , who left an indelible mark on jazz as a composer , pianist and arranger , virtually disappeared after 1930 and when he died in 1941 was known only to close followers of jazz since the 1970 s , however , morton s music has inspired a cult following the attraction was usually based on the recordings of his red hot peppers in the late 1920 s , the peak of his recording career live performances based on these records have been of varying quality , but none have captured and extended the style and spirit of morton s performances as well as those being played now at michael s pub by a group assembled by the pianist terry waldo the ensemble playing , about which morton was very demanding , is crisp and confident , filled with the breaks , slurs , vaudeville idiosyncracies and variatons in tempo that morton loved the principal horn soloists peter ecklund , playing cornet with a variety of mute effects dan barrett , trombone , and joe muranye , clarinet are brilliant not only in their reproduction of the subtleties of the solos recorded by morton s groups but also in their ability to amplify on them within the spirit of the originals on the vocals , usually the weakest point in such revivalist bands , four members of this sevenmusician group rely on their knowledge of instrumental styles of the period rather than on morton s singing to create vocal choruses eminently suitable to the music this is as close as we 're ever liable to come to a valid , live representation of morton s red hot peppers
washington , april 12 the collapse of the executive life corporation , the largest failure yet of an insurer , will prod the house to try to impose federal regulations on the insurance industry , lawmakers and their aides said today but the senate is not likely to take any action quickly , with the result that federal regulation of insurers is likely to be years away it will have an enormous impact on us , representative john d dingell , the chairman of the energy and commerce committee , said today it cannot be said with the same conviction today as the day before yesterday that any insurance company is solvent , or even that the industry as a whole is solvent mr dingell , a michigan democrat , said legislation would be introduced later this spring imposing new federal guidelines as a trial balloon , his staff has begun circulating an outline of a bill that would create a federal agency to oversee the industry and state insurance regulators california regulators on thursday seized control of the first executive subsidiary , which had been among the largest buyers of junk bonds in the last decade the seizure left in doubt the company s ability to honor its obligations to the holders of policies and the hundreds of thousands of owners of its annuities and other investments around the country the senate has scheduled committee hearings on the solvency of the insurance industry and the adequacy of state regulation through the rest of the year , but the issue does have a champion with the influence of mr dingell in that chamber when asked about their approach , senators say that because they are already grappling with the highly unpopular rescue of the savings and loan industry and the potential bailout of the nation s banks , their colleagues are in no mood to create another federal bureacracy for insurance federal regulation hangs out there as a possibility , but not a reality , said senator howard m metzenbaum , the ohio democrat who leads a judiciary subcommittee that has been examining insurance issues savings and loan regulation has been such a fiasco that federal regulation does n't have a good image but the states have n't been doing any better and the industry has to be thinking about federal regulation even though none of us are saying that yet mr metzenbaum said there was a stronger possibility of setting national standards of solvency that would be enforced by state regulators asked for the likelihood of when such a measure could be adopted , he said , give us a couple more executive lifes and it will certainly accelerate the process under the dingell proposal , the federal government would accredit and monitor state regulators who would impose new national solvency standards if a company failed to meet the standards , the new federal agency could order corrective action or effectively shut it if a state regulator failed to enforce the national standards , the state s accreditation could be revoked , and the companies certified by that state would be given notice to move to another state the proposal has run into a wave of criticism from insurance lobbyists and some state regulators , and mr dingell said it was still being discussed with the industry

geneva , aug 12 following are excerpts from a statement by islamic holy war , the proiranian lebanese group that released a british hostage , john mccarthy , last week the statement , addressed to secretary general javier perez de cuellar of the united nations , was delivered to him on sunday and released in translation by the united nations today why has the united nations been given an effective and important role to play in solving the crisis that arose in the gulf while it has been prevented from playing any role in helping to find a just solution to the question of the muslim people in palestine in spite of the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the israeli enemy usurped the land of palestine \? why were the united nations resolutions implemented immediately after their adoption during the gulf crisis while none of the resolutions adopted in regard to the just palestinian cause have yet been put into effect decades after their adoption \? what has the united nations done to protect the human rights of muslim and other oppressed peoples and to prevent the barbaric massacres that are being committed against them throughout the world \? where is the right to selfdetermination in the case of the islamic and oppressed peoples in palestine , kashmir and afghanistan \? do the united nations conventions not make provision for the right of peoples to selfdetermination without tutelage or external colonialist interference , and do they not regard the struggle for selfdetermination by various means , including force , as a legitimate and justifiable act that is in no way related to terrorism \? when oppressed peoples and societies demand freedom , independence , justice , a decent life and deliverance from those who wreak havoc with their countries , their resources , their beliefs and the future of their children , can they be regarded as terrorist peoples and societies \? in this connection , we appeal to you , in your capacity as secretary general of the united nations , and to the world as a whole , to adopt islam as an ideology , a code of law and a system and to follow the teachings of the great imam khomeini , who expounded the principles and conventions on which peoples , movements and regimes must base their endeavours to achieve progress , to solve the problems with which they are burdened and to achieve happiness and wellbeing the slogan of the need to combat international terrorism , which has been raised by america and its supporters , is a spurious slogan designed to leave them with drawn swords in their hands , which they can use whenever they feel that their interests are being threatened by the actions of rebellious oppressed peoples on the pretext of an end to the terrorist threat to international peace and security however , the uprising of peoples seeking to achieve selfdetermination , recover their stolen freedom and independence , sever their links of dependence on the imperious states and insure that the principles of justice are put into practice is not terrrorism it is a legitimate right if the slogan of the need to combat international terrorism is an attempt to divert us from our course of holy war in the face of international arrogance , we will continue along the difficult path that we have chosen for ourselves without giving an inch if its purpose is to maintain the state of open warfare between us and them , we are fully prepared to pursue this confrontation until we achieve one of the two divine rewards victory or martyrdom if struggle , holy war and resistance against the superpowers is terrorism , we and the oppressed peoples throughout the world are proud to be terrorists combating injustice and striking terror into the hearts of the enemies of god and mankind as long as they interfere in the internal affairs of oppressed nations and peoples anywhere in the world we are part of the worldwide islamic movement the causes of the muslims are our causes , and we share their sufferings and jubilations by the grace of almighty god , we shall always remain in the vanguard of the defenders of the causes of islam and the muslims and , in the cause of god , we do not fear the reproaches of anyone the question of detainees and prisoners in the world today is one of the consequences of the confrontation between us and the forces of international arrogance led by america , the mother of iniquity throughout the world , and its offspring israel consequently , the question of the detainees was a reaction on the part of the muslim freedomfighters to all those practices and an endeavor to secure the release of our incarcerated fighters this reaction will continue as long as they remain incarcerated release all detainees in view of our belief in the need for action to secure the release of our freedomfighters from prisons in occupied palestine and europe and also to solve the question of the detainees whom we are holding and the problem of their families , we call upon you to make a personal endeavor , within the framework of a comprehensive solution , to secure the release of all detainees throughout the world in such an eventuality , we would be perfectly willing to complete the process that we began today and to release the persons whom we are detaining within 24 hours we are awaiting a practical response from you that will lead to the desired fruitful solution we are waiting and praying that our incarcerated fellow freedomfighters will obtain freedom with honor and that the peoples of the world will obtain the security and justice which we believe will inevitably prevail through islam at the hands of the expected mahdi , who will arise among the descendants of mohammed
washington , march 8 in what appears to be a serious setback for television networks , a majority of the fivemember federal communications commission now favors continuing to limit the ability of the networks to sell lucrative television reruns the development comes after weeks of deadlock on the issue , which has been the subject of an intense lobbying war between hollywood studios and the networks over the 3 billion market the commission is to decide the issue on thursday , but has thus far been divided two commissioners , the chairman , alfred c sikes , and james h quello , have favored repealing most restrictions two others , sherrie marshall and ervin duggan , want to keep many of the rules in place the political balance shifted on thursday , when the one undecided commissioner , andrew c barrett , circulated a proposal within the agency to continue restrictions on the networks the proposal was quickly obtained by lobbyists hollywood representatives quickly praised the plan as a thoughtful compromise , as did both ms marshall and mr duggan but network lobbyists denounced it , with one calling it reregulation at its worst syndication rights are the most profitable part of the television industry under rules imposed in 1970 , the three leading networks are barred from obtaining such rights the rules , adopted after the networks settled an antitrust case with the justice department , are intended to prevent the networks from using their access to primetime viewers to exert a stranglehold over producers and studios but the networks , joined by an array of government officials and experts , argue that the rules are outdated because network power has been eroded by the spread of cable television , videocassette recorders and independent stations regardless of what the commission ultimately decides , television audiences are not expected to see much difference in the programming the barrett proposal , as described by people on both sides , would allow the networks to produce only 40 percent of their primetime programming but would give them full syndication rights to that programming television networks can produce all of their primetime programs now but have syndication rights to none the networks would also be allowed to acquire passive rights to the remaining 60 percent of their programming schedule , which means they would be able to share in royalties but could not directly control distribution firstrun programs in addition , the proposal would continue to bar the networks from the market for firstrun syndications , which are programs like wheel of fortune that are created exclusively for the syndication market in effect , these provisions would make it difficult for the networks to acquire movie studios , because many of the studios syndicate far more programming than a network could under the proposal that is a major issue because much of the push for eliminating the rules comes from people concerned about the acquisition of many american studios by large foreign companies perhaps the most controversial effect of the proposal , if it is adopted , would be on the news corporation s fox inc , which owns both a large production studio and the fledgling fox television network it was the rise of fox s new network that forced the fcc to reexamine the rules all five of the fcc commissioners have said they want to encourage the development of a fourth network but fox , which is operating under a temporary waiver from the rules , will have to shed much of its syndication business if the proposal is adopted in another important concession to producers , the proposal would limit to two years the option terms that networks can demand when they buy firstrun rights for a program currently all three networks demand that producers of a new series give them the option to renew the program for four years by limiting the maximum term to two years , a producer with a hit series would be able to shop the program to competing buyers while the program was still fairly young as a result , the move would give producers a huge lift in bargaining power the plan would also keep the restrictions in place for at least five years , but would call for the fcc to review them at that time if it is adopted , the plan will be a big defeat for mr sikes although officials have refused to comment publicly , mr sikes is known to have circulated a proposal to phase the rules out entirely after three years supporters of the plan both ms marshall and mr duggan quickly endorsed the plan ms marshall called it a reasonable , very thoughtful plan that offered significant deregulation with selfenforcing safeguards , a top aide said today mr duggan issued a brief statement saying mr barrett had made a tremendously valuable contribution to this debate the networks immediately voiced their displeasure it s very , very troubling , said stephen a weiswasser , senior vice president for capital cities abc inc this proposal seems to constitute a move in direction of reregualtion and indeed , new regulation an executive at another network , who insisted on anonymity , called the proposal a major tilt toward hollywood he said , in terms of what we 've been told , several of the key provisions that purport to give networks extra freedom are almost canceled out by the fine print the adoption of the plan would put the bush administration in an awkward position two weeks ago , the white house chief of staff , john h sununu , signaled his support for eliminating the rules , and mr bush has strongly supported deregulation in general in addition , the justice department and federal trade commission have recommended repealing the rules
washington many wellmeaning people imagine there could be peace in palestine if only the us could browbeat israel into giving up its claims to yet another slice of the land promised to the jewish people in the british mandate they are deluding themselves and in effect preparing the way for another war that would threaten israel s destruction secretary of state james baker , back from the middle east , discovered that the arabs are as reluctant as ever to make peace with israel security council resolution 242 , approved after the 1967 war , stipulates not only that israel and its neighboring states should make peace with each other but should establish a just and lasting peace in the middle east until that condition is met , israel is entitled to administer the territories it captured the west bank , east jerusalem and gaza strip and then withdraw from some but not necessarily all of the land to secure and recognized boundaries free of threats or acts of force the practical reasons behind both halves of that bargain remain valid today the first requires no withdrawal without peace a rule often wrongly described as trading land for peace actually , it is quite different it prescribes that there should be no withdrawal until peace is made then there can be a complete withdrawal , a partial one , or none , depending on what the parties decide the second reason is that israel s new boundaries need not be the same as the armistice lines of 1949 this provision specifically addressed the problem of peace with jordan no state has title to the land between israel and jordan jordan s claim to have annexed the west bank , never generally recognized , has been abandoned the rulers of the ottoman empire were the last recognized sovereigns in the territory the jordanisrael armistice line , the green line , merely represents the position of both countries' troops when the fighting stopped in 1949 at arab insistence , the accords provide that the lines are not political boundaries but can be changed when the parties make peace from the viewpoint of security alone , it was obvious in 1967 , and still is , that israel must retain a substantial part of the west bank for defense , considering the uncertainties about future syrian , iraqi and iranian designs beyond security , there is the moral claim established by law israel has a stronger claim to the west bank than any other nation or wouldbe nation because , under the league of nations mandate , israel has the same legal right to settle the west bank , gaza strip and east jerusalem that it has to settle haifa or west jerusalem while this proposition is not seriously disputed , the united states has sought to block or limit such settlements on the ground that they would discourage the peace process , a dubious proposition , since only egypt has made peace with israel since 1967 this does not mean israel will or should insist on the entire west bank there is room for compromise israel has always maintained that it would make sacrifices for peace and wishes to remain a predominantly jewish state the west bank arabs are mainly jordanian citizens and should have the right to live in jordan if they wish today , jordan denies this right that issue aside , the soundest solution for the territories the solution widely discussed when resolution 242 was drafted involved separate states in palestine jordan and israel this would include special arrangements for the holy places in jerusalem and an economic union embracing the entire area israel , jordan and the disputed territories every dispassionate commission that has studied the palestine problem has recommended this approach it was the idea behind the general assembly s illfated partition recommendation of 1947 , and it was israel s policy for years after 1967 this should be the main goal of president bush s peace offensive and what he presses for when he visits the middle east the us should not seek only an interim autonomy plan for some arab parts of the west bank , however desirable it may seem for a transition period toward peace if mr bush s initiative fails , israel should put such an autonomy plan into effect temporarily but it should not lead to a separate palestinian state while israel , jordan , the west bank arabs and syria struggle with the problems of making peace treaties , the other arab states should comply with 242 they have no territorial disputes with israel and can normalize relations by diplomatic recognition such action could profoundly alter the atmosphere of arab politics and make israeli negotiations with jordan and syria much easier a peace conference of any kind should be avoided a large international parley would only be a forum for the stale rhetoric that has poisoned so many general assembly sessions on the palestine question the way to proceed , when the arabs and israel are ready to negotiate , is bilaterally , with the help of the us as conciliator if the parties wish perhaps mr baker will come to appreciate that resolutions 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973 \( which makes 242 legally binding \) provide the only possible agenda for negotiations because they constitute the only guidelines the parties and major powers profess to accept perhaps he also found in the middle east that what cannot work is a plan to achieve peace at the expense of israel s rights roman law has a wise maxim law cannot come of a shameful act in this case , betraying israel s rights wars can come , however drawing
jerusalem , sept 2 at the diplomat hotel , far from rundown but working on it , the biggest excitement today was a religion class it was held for the benefit of several hundred recent arrivals from ethiopia , who in a few days will celebrate their first jewish new year in a new land , and who israeli officials decided might benefit from instruction in unfamiliar holiday customs no such lessons were felt to be necessary for scores of soviet immigrants living at the same hotel in southern jerusalem they stayed in their rooms or lounged in the hallways while the ethiopian jews went to listen to a rabbi in its quiet way , this religion class underlined the oftendiffering treatment that israel gives to its two major groups of recently arrived immigrants those differences have bred tension and animosity , and in the last few days , they have prodded officials here to rethink the wisdom of allowing the newcomers to live under the same roof sticks , stones , second thoughts the doubts burst into the open after several dozen ethiopian and soviet jews battled each other last week at the diplomat , using , stones , iron bars and , some witnesses said , knives three men and a woman from the soviet union were hurt , none seriously it is not fully clear how the fight began , but a senior police officer blamed the soviet immigrants for having struck the first blows the ethiopians struck back , he said , and hard at first glance , and to the embarrassment of israeli officials , the incident seemed to reflect nasty racial divisions between the black jews from ethiopia and the white jews from the soviet union some former soviet citizens accused the ethiopians of being lazy , while the ethiopians complained that the people on the other side had not left antiblack prejudice at home at another jerusalem hotel shared by the two groups \( the hotel s name happens to be shalom peace \) the divisions are such that soviet and ethiopian immigrants use separate elevators residents there say it is only because the two sides live on different floors , and all the elevators do not make the same stops nonetheless , the feeling of apartness at both hotels is palpable they 're not our friends , said roman sigal , 18 years old , who arrived here a month ago from estonia , where he had studied computer programming we want to live here quietly , but they do not want to live together ethiopians say much the same thing , only they blame the soviet arrivals i think they are jealous of us , said a young ethiopian man who declined to give his name not racism , officials say israeli officials agree with him , insisting that the problems are rooted not in racism but rather in the different strategies that have been used to incorporate each group into this society the ethiopians , since arriving late in may in a spectacular airlift that brought 14 , 000 people to israel in 36 hours , have been sheltered in absorption centers , usually campus dormitories or hotels like the diplomat , where 600 of them live their food and rent are paid for by the jewish agency , a quasigovernment body that oversees immigration officials feel that the ethiopians , many from rural areas , have special needs in adjusting to a modern society , and therefore require greater protection the soviet newcomers fall into a category of direct absorption this means that they are given money by the government a rough average of 9 , 000 per family for the first year but then must pay their rent , buy their food and otherwise fend for themselves there are about 200 of them who have chosen to live at the diplomat , and some say they resent the more sheltered treatment accorded the ethiopians beyond that , many of the 300 , 000 or more soviet immigrants who have arrived since 1989 have had a difficult time finding housing and jobs this , while the airlifted ethiopians remain the darlings of many israelis who were moved by the romance of their newcomers' adventure and who still come to the diplomat bearing toys , fruit and other gifts envy of children the novelty of the ethiopians did n't wear out , said yehuda weinraub , a jewish agency spokesman , adding that this has fanned resentment among the soviet immigrants ilya gurevich , an 18yearold from soviet georgia who was strolling the diplomat s halls with his younger sister , noted , our little kids see that their kids are getting everything and they get nothing a few days ago , the jewish agency decided that the jealousies had become too great and that , in mr weinraub s words , cohabitation of the two systems under one roof is not the best way now the goal is to encourage immigrants to leave the hotels for trailer parks , where theoretically they will become more selfsufficient the hitch is that neither side seems eager to move , and there is no way to force anyone out so the black jews and the white jews are staying put for now , each sticking to their own kind , avoiding contact with the others it is sad , said david solomon , a 27yearold mechanic who joined the religion class for ethiopians the fighting last week was painful , mr solomon said when i saw the russians with bandages , i felt sorry we are all one family
like the chicken and the egg , it is hard to know which came first , traffic or roads since it was built in the 50 s under the leadership of robert moses , the long island expressway has been synonymous with traffic backups and delays an engineer who designed parts of the original expressway , harry wartur , recalled i said to moses 'this road is too narrow it will be over capacity before we 're done building it' but moses said , 'we take what we can get when we get it' what he was talking about was money and politics and now , less than 35 years since the expressway was completed , the state s transportation department , in the face of community concerns and budget problems , plans to widen what has been called the world s longest parking lot the proposed expansion would run between exit 30 in douglaston , queens , and exit 64 in medford politicians , environmentalists and residents are questioning whether the proposed construction , scheduled to begin in 1994 , will yield a net benefit opponents contend that the risks of cost , pollution and years of detours and construction activity will add to the problems , rather than solve them we have one preferred option and one alternative option , said the regional design engineer for the state , craig siracusa the high occupancy vehicle lane is our proposed action , and a general use lane is our alternate option under the proposals , the state would add one lane in each direction in the hov proposal , just cars with at least two people would use the new left lane under the generaluse proposal , the lane would not have restrictions the highoccupancy proposal received the best overall rating after initial studies of air , water and noise quality but the state estimates that it would be more expensive to build and take up more land for the federally required buffers needed between the lane and the generaluse roadway need for transition lane cited mr wartur said that he agreed that the proposal was best environmentally , but that the access might be dangerous you need a long transition lane between the main road and the hov lane , he said it takes so much more land to make a good transition lane than what they have experts disagree on the costs in 1988 , voters approved spending 147 million on expanding the expressway between exit 40 in jericho and exit 64 and that s the only money we have , mr siracusa said mr siracusa said he expected the first section , between exits 49 in melville and 57 in hauppauge , a 12mile stretch , to cost 100 million , leaving 47 million for the other 28 miles it is a high priority to the state for future funding , so we expect to get more , he added last week , gov mario m cuomo was expected to propose a plan to speed construction on the first section as part of a package to stimulate the island s economy the project manual puts the cost of the hov plan for exits 30 to 64 at 631 million , or 151 million a mile the estimates were based on 1989 figures inflated to account for 1990 prices they estimated how much it would cost to build in 1990 , mr wartur said it s already 1991 , and they 're not close to building this is too low they could never do it for this amount it will be three to four times these estimates requirements of air law a major consideration is meeting the requirements of the federal clean air act of 1990 the hov lane would help us meet new clean air act standards by encouraging car pooling and reducing the number of cars on the road , said ray cowen , regional director of the state s environmental conservation department the thinking behind the hov is that if regular traffic is stopped but the hov lane is moving , someone sitting in traffic will say , 'if i can get john jones to ride with me , then we can ride in the hov lane and wo n't be stuck here' and that s one less car on the road noise pollution is also a problem in areas without barriers , noise from the expressway exceeds federal limits the state has spent 16 million on barriers , according to the executive director of the long island regional planning board , lee e koppelman he added that residents gave conflicting signals about the noise problem at one time , he said , residents of communities near the expressway were howling and yelling because they were subject to too much noise when the state erected wood barriers , people squawked about the trees , mr koppelman recalled relandscaping expected that s not a virgin forest growing next to the expressway , he said a good deal of those trees were put in by the transportation department when the expressway was built they relandscaped then and they will relandscape this time the expressway barriers have already attracted graffiti some residents say that the walls are unsightly and that they would prefer natural noise barriers like trees the environmental director of the transportation department , darryl kost , said , if we planted 100footdeep woods of evergreens 15 feet high on each side of the expressway , we still would not meet the federal noiseabatement standards aside from noise and esthetics , the barriers are presenting concerns about possible water pollution treated with chemicals , the barriers contain an arsenic preservative arsenic is a known human carcinogen , a spokesman for the federal environmental protection agency , al heier , said but it s been used on almost every deck in america over the last 10 years the government approves the compound , chromated copper arsenate , for decks and patios , but not for preserving cutting boards or counter tops
vocin , yugoslavia , dec 17 when serbian irregulars withdrew last weekend from this picturesque hillside village 80 miles east of zagreb , they left behind a vista of death and destruction drunken men in uniform , backed by at least one tank , moved methodically through this community of 2 , 000 , blasting croatian houses , killing civilians , and blowing to pieces the 550yearold roman catholic church at the town center , witnesses say now that the serbian occupiers have gone , the local croatian authorities counting the bodies at a makeshift morgue said the toll in vocin and two smaller nearby villages had reached 43 , with many of the victims women and the elderly awaiting news with dread more than 30 people are still missing grieving residents of vocin and surrounding communities gathered at the door of the morgue , waiting for a local judge to tell them if missing relatives were among the dead the scene is a microcosm of the war in yugoslavia mindless violence of neighbor against neighbor , and civilians suffering at the hands of undisciplined killers pursuing a strategy of terror to frighten people into fleeing thousands of women , children and other civilians have died in this war , many from knife wounds or gunshots fired at pointblank range , according to autopsy reports and frightened witnesses vera doric , a 58yearold who hid in a cornfield with her 2yearold granddaughter , recalled i saw them set a house on fire , and they would n't let the people out there were local serbs going with them , showing them to the houses they had a list vocin , a village that despite its croatian geography is 80 percent serbian , according to a local official , is part of a serbian enclave in the freezing papuk hills four months ago , local serbs and serbian irregular troops seized control and held the area without any support from the yugoslav national army the serbs began falling back from the region last week , forced to retreat by a croatian offensive with more than 20 , 000 serbian refugees streaming out of the towns and villages , the croats took over as a light snow dusted the tangled rubble that was once the church of our lady of vocin , the rev nikola sankovic surveyed a neatly typed list of 34 parishioners who died he said he had identified each body as a croat the list included 17 people over the age of 60 , 15 of them women this is apocalyptic , he said , standing before the remains of his church it s pure hatred a man who identified himself only as pioro said he was warned last week that the serbian irregulars were about to cleanse vocin , using a euphemism of the nazis to describe ethnically motivated massacres of civilians by midday friday , the shooting had begun over the next 12 hours , the houses in this village were attacked by infantrymen with heavy weapons , including antitank guns the condition of the houses establishes that this was not routine battle damage none show any signs of machinegun or rifle fire about 3 am , several witnesses agree , the town was rocked by a tremendous explosion the local church , which father sankovic said had been used as an ammunition depot by the serbian forces , was blown to bits a jagged outcropping of wall jutting skyward is the only part of the rock structure still standing strewn in the rubble were pieces of shells , mines and detonators bearing the markings of the yugoslav national army martin puharic and his wife live in a house overlooking the church they were hiding in their basement when the blast went off , and the clock on the wall stopped a few minutes before 3 bears witness to the accuracy of the villagers' recollections at the morgue , a team of pathologists worked to formally establish causes of death their chief , who declined to be identified by name , said his preliminary finding was that all had died by violence , either from gunshot wounds , incineration or blast in one case , he said , death was caused by an ax wound bodies covered with blankets lay on the floor , faces frozen in openmouthed agony my family is in there , and diplomacy and the european community are partly responsible for this massacre , said marko lukic , an office worker whose uncle died in vocin serbs are getting killed on television , croats in reality , he said , referring to recent reports of attacks against serbs in the region all of these killed are croats , he continued on belgrade television , it will be presented as serbs croatian villages are being burned croats are being presented as serbs they just change the text a belgrade tv report last week said that 120 serbs had been massacred by croats in this region , which was the scene of particularly brutal interethnic fighting during world war ii there has been no independent confirmation of this report , and so it was not immediately clear whether the violence in vocin was an act of spite or of revenge indeed , it is difficult at a glance to tell a serb from a croat the two groups look very much the same , speak close variations of the same language , and are only sometimes distinguishable by religious symbols serbs wear the eastern orthodox cross , croats the catholic cross one way to distinguish serbs from croats is to ask neighbors
for the better part of the off season , the silence in the bronx has been deafening free agents have come and gone in a lively market , but the yankees , except for a dabble here and there , have for the most part sat it out , allowing most heavyweight players and heavyspending teams to pass them by was the team still trying to find its footing in the wake of george steinbrenner s departure last year \? not at all , said robert nederlander rather , steinbrenner s successor as the team s managing partner has opted for a cautious , more traditional approach as he attempts to lead the yankees back from a decade without a world series championship , signaling not only a change in the team s leadership but also in its character although i am a sports fan , i have to remember that it is a business , nederlander said during a recent interview in his manhattan office it s a franchise which is probably the most famous of all franchises , so you want to see if you can bring it back , for fans , for the city but you also have to look at the tools that you have you look at the freeagent market , where the prices are skyrocketing you look at your budget you look at your talent , your young people you look at your inhouse personnel and you say to yourself , 'how can you combine this mix to provide the best team possible \? ' thus far , nederlander has attempted to answer that question in a different fashion than did steinbrenner , the man who handpicked nederlander as managing partner after steinbrenner admitted to an association with a gambler and gave up the post last august nederlander is as understated and softspoken as steinbrenner is brash and aggressive though he eschews the spotlight , when it has found him he has proved to be most congenial nederlander has even found humor in a nefarious and , nederlander said , an erroneous tale that has taken on a life of its own it seems that once while with a group of fellow limited partners of the yankees , nederlander mentioned reggie jackson in a discussion he thought centered on alltime great yankees hitters it turned out to be a conversation about that presentday roster and jackson was no longer on the team it was a mistake , but now that ridiculous story is everywhere , nederlander said with a laugh nederlander has brought more than a sense of humor to the yankees he has brought business instincts honed as president of his family s theatrical organization nederlander now splits time between his downtown office and yankee stadium when not at the ball park , nederlander speaks to gene michael , the team s general manager , on a daily basis thus far , nederlander knows enough not to presume to know all i 've watched a lot of baseball over the years , nederlander said however , being a sports fan does n't necessarily mean that you should make trades i think you have to rely on experts that s the advice you should follow when a major decision is to be made , nederlander said i ask a lot of questions , of stick , bill bergesch a veteran and old pro and george bradley they usually come up with some logical explanations as to why they want to do something \( stick is michael s nickname \) thus far , the philosophy , he said , is that we do not want to give away our young players and , to the extent that we have vacancies or voids , we may have to secure the services of a free agent , he added but it s very important for us to keep our young players and , two , not lose draft rights to upandcoming people with no major wheeling and dealing , the yankees wo n't sacrifice those young prospects or draft choices but the worst team in the american league in 1990 is also vulnerable to charges of not doing enough and its management is all the more scrutinized as the team heads towards a new season such was the case during the winter meetings in rosemont , ill , last month it was during those meetings that dave righetti signed a fouryear contract with the san francisco giants after failing to persuade the yankees to scrap a new policy of limiting pitchers' contracts to three years it was in rosemont that michael appeared stunned when the team extended the contract of its second baseman , steve sax , a deal negotiated by bradley without the general manager s knowledge lastly , it was in rosemont that the yankees were said to be leaving player agents dangling joe sroba , representing zane smith , a pitcher the yankees had said interested them , reportedly left a dozen messages with the team that week none were acknowledged , sroba said smith eventually resigned with the pirates nederlander believes many of the perceptions of the team s activities that snowy week in illinois were unfair first , nederlander said , it is untrue that michael threatened to resign unless frontoffice roles were more clearly defined the day after sax s contract was extended , michael announced that a meeting on policy put the executives on the same page more than we were michael is now primarily in charge of major league operations while bradley , vice president for baseball operations , oversees the minor league operation as for the team s approach , nederlander pointed to pitching as proof that there has been activity obviously , one of our goals was to sign steve farr , which we did , he said we wanted to resign mike witt and tim leary , which we did and we signed scott sanderson nederlander said some of the signings by other teams astounded him because of the amounts of money spent but that s business and you have to deal with it , he said besides , nederlander added , the club s overall approach remained intact despite the hyperactive market we went to the winter meetings to try to find out who was available , nederlander said we did n't want to be the first ones out there making bids , which traditionally the yankees have done , being the first , setting the price so we were careful we were trying to get information people might have gotten the wrong impression , but just because we did n't make some bids did n't mean we were afraid if nederlander has his way , players and their agents wo n't ever be able to use the yankees to boost the markets again we do n't want to be used , he said the results have had their critics most notably , steinbrenner lashed out after righetti s departure , saying it would not have happened if he were still able to negotiate with free agents although he is still the largest shareholder in the team , he is prohibited by the agreement he reached with fay vincent , the baseball commissioner , after the investigation into his activities , from taking any part in discussions about baseball activities if the blunt assessment bothered nederlander , he did not let it show george steinbrenner is an enthusiastic supporter of the yankees , he said he loves the yankees he wants a winner it s very important to him i do n't blame him so nederlander chooses to understand why steinbrenner , even in exile , can still be a tough taskmaster , just as he chooses to go his own way in business and baseball is a business people will make mistakes , he said but i 've told stick and the rest that i 'll never criticize them , as long as the decision was discussed in detail in advance in logical terms they do n't have to be afraid to do something secondguessing is not part of the way i operate photo yankees' robert nederlander although i am a sports fan , i have to remember that it is a business \( eddie hausner the new york times

new york city would benefit by concentrating less on trying to retain existing manufacturing jobs , and instead focusing more support on emerging businesses , a report released yesterday by the office of deputy mayor sally hernandezpinero recommended the report s conclusions indicate that the city is considering recasting its economic development strategy it is not clear whether ms hernandezpinero will accept all the recommendations we wanted this to serve as the factual underpinning for whatever we do in the future , said the deputy mayor , who heads the office for economic development the report said that manufacturers benefit less than other companies from being in new york , making it harder to justify a general effort to retain them moreover , the report concluded , none of the manufacturing industries forecast to grow rapidly at the national level in the 1990 s have any meaningful presence in new york city 'we should n't pull our hair out' instead of supporting companies and industries that have been around for decades and are struggling , the report suggests that the city focus on those that are new and emerging the message is that we should n't pull our hair out of our heads whenever somebody leaves , because that s not necessarily the most important thing for the economy , ms hernandezpinero said she cited figures in the report showing that between 1976 and 1986 , new businesses generated nearly 464 , 000 jobs by contrast , companies that moved to new york city from elsewhere produced only 37 , 000 new jobs
becket , mass , sept 1 bring together 10 teenage soviet ballet students with their american counterparts for 3 weeks then teach them rarely seen choreography by masters like leonide massine and antony tudor plus that of a young experimentalist , and you have anything but the usual handsacrossthesea exchange the ballet repertory project presented at the jacob s pillow dance festival here on saturday night is pure joint venture after this splendidly polished workshop performance \( repeated today \) , the combined group of dancers is to follow up its debut in the berkshires with the same program this week in moscow voronezh and perm , the two russian cities whose ballet academies sent their students , are to be visited later the kiev ballet school in the ukraine also sent two students to the pillow the recent revival of massine s famous symphonic ballets , once intensely controversial because of their avantgarde aspects in the 1930 s , will counter his reputation as solely a character choreographer in these ballets , the neoclassical massine comes to the fore and it is this side that was visible in the excerpts from les presages \( 1933 \) and choreartium \( 1933 \) that were so vibrantly performed by the ballet repertory project dancers david eden , the american producer who collaborated with viktoriya pavlova of the ardani theater agency in moscow on the project , selected massine and tudor as the kinds of classical choreographers who would be new to the soviet dancers the truth is that this kind of massine choreography , combining sharply detailed toe work with a stylized nonclassical torso amid choral groupings , is new to american dancers too tatiana leskova , who came from brazil to stage the massine excerpts , with nelly laport , drilled the group to perfection none of the costumes , lighting or powerful sets in the ballets could be reproduced for the performances in the festival s studio theater the students were in leotards the classical side and the bones of the ballet s structure were more visible than ever les presages , set to tchaikovsky s fifth symphony , was represented by its first movement , accompanied by john sauer on the piano the ballet s allegorical significance could not be visible but olivia burcham from california , with a strong stiffarmed profile , was aptly cast as the action figure dancing in counterpoint to the ensemble and a trio three temptations visited upon man in his battle with destiny the final section of the second movement and the beginning of the fourth movement of choreartium gave a hint of massine s more abstract treatment of brahms s fourth symphony natalya budina from voronezh had a serene carriage in her solo , set against the inventive female ensembles these could come to rest in pyramidlike patterns or flow into a chain of women , limping steadily with arms joined and heads askew the fourth movement brought in the men , erupting into a diagonal of double airturns , and a lyric solo by nadezhda melnikova from perm an overlapping series of lifts for five pairs , led by tatyana zhuravel of kiev molded the ensemble into a final sculptural basrelief like massine at the time , the britishborn tudor was influenced by german expressionist dance maria grandy , who staged tudor s continuo with fine nuance , had the dancers demonstrate how the skip and slide of the chasse step in ballet would be performed 'more into the ground in a tudor work yet here again there was a surprise stereotypes that associate tudor with psychological dancedrama could fall away in this 1971 gem danced to pachelbel s canon in d set for three couples who enter in a canon form and then literally take off in unexpected directions , the work is a puredance piece that points to the tudor of

jason duff for a change of pace , samuel a miller , the pillow s executive director , had invited amanda miller \( no relation \) , the associate director of the frankfurt ballet , to restage portions of her experimental piece no wild ones miss miller used all the dancers \( they also include konstantin kuzyakin , cynthia d'angelo , christine kessler , aleksandr izilyayev , adam miller , michelle

honolulu , dec 7 amid solemn ceremonies honoring the americans who died in the japanese surprise attack on pearl harbor 50 years ago today , president bush told an assemblage of more than 2 , 000 survivors that the time had come to put aside their animosity toward japan i have no rancor in my heart toward germany or japan none at all , said the president , a former navy pilot who was himself shot down by the japanese in the pacific in 1944 i hope you have none in yours this is no time for recrimination mr bush added world war ii is over it is history we won we crushed totalitarianism , and when that was done we helped our enemies give birth to democracies excerpts , page 24 the president s words were the climax of nearly a week of emotional events marking the 50th anniversary of the attack , which drew the united states out of its isolationism and into the war he spoke from a podium in a huge shed on pier 8 at pearl harbor behind him , across the calm , sunlit waters , stood the gleaming white monument that straddles the sunken remains of the battleship arizona , on which 1 , 177 americans died during the attack docked to his left , in a gesture that could only irritate modern japanese sensibilities , was the battleship missouri , aboard which the japanese formally surrendered on sept 2 , 1945 words of reconciliation but mr bush s words were clearly meant to foster reconciliation he praised the veterans for their valor and restated american regrets over the internment of thousands of americans of japanese ancestry in the hysteria that swept the nation after the attack on pearl harbor and he warned against any relapse into political or economic isolationism we stand here today on the site of a tragedy spawned by isolationism , the president said and it is here we must learn and this time avoid the dangers of today s isolationism and its economic accomplice , protectionism to the leaders of japan in particular he said , this solumn occasion should reinforce our determination to join together in a future energized by free markets and free people he spoke on a day much like the sunday morning in 1941 when the attack began the sky was bright , a 10mileanhour breeze wafted in from the east , and soft nimbus clouds hovered over the volcanic mountains of central oahu , over which the japanese naval bombers and torpedo planes swept out of the sky and wreaked death and havoc on the american forces and fleet the attack , which came in two waves and lasted nearly two hours , killed 2 , 335 soldiers , sailors and marines , and 68 civilians twentyone ships , including eight battleships , were sunk or damaged , and 188 navy and army air forces aircraft were destroyed the ceremonies today spoke volumes about the complex relationship that has since developed with japan the aged veterans who returned to the scene of their youthful terror and herrorism carried japanese cameras , and the television monitors they watched were made in japan the veterans' last hurrah for the veterans , now mostly in their 70 s , it was a last hurrah , certainly the last time they would ever gather in such numbers the reactions of the assembled veterans varied vern ray arnet , a retired air force colonel from baltimore , who lost an older brother , ray , on the arizona , called the events a wonderful thing i'm glad to see the american public rallying to the support of the military bill keyes , a 72yearold veteran from wethersfield , conn , near hartford , who was an infantryman at schofield barracks , said of the events , it takes you right back a navy veteran who would not give his name became upset when questioned and said , i 'd rather not talk it s too depressing the events began with a daybreak ceremony at the national cemetery of the pacific in honolulu , where 776 victims of the attack on pearl harbor are buried mr bush , accompanied by his wife , barbara , was introduced by gerald glaubitz , the national president of the pearl harbor survivors association at that ceremony , too , the president spoke against the racial animosities that the anniversary has aroused in some people americans did not wage war against nations or races , he said we fought for freedom and human dignity against the nightmare of totalitarianism and , as he did at every place he spoke , the president lauded the japaneseamericans who fought in the american armed forces during the war and expressed regrets to those interned innocent victims who committed no offense but he also called for eternal vigilence , lest there be another pearl harbor the cause of harmony among nations is not a call for pacificism , he told the veterans at the cemetery from there , the president went to pearl harbor , about five miles east of downtown honolulu , and went by barge to the arizona memorial , where the names of the 1 , 177 men who died in the sunken battleship are engraved in marble together , he and mrs bush solemnly dropped flowers into the water above the sunken hull at 7 55 am , the exact time at which the japanese bombers first appeared 50 years ago , there was one minute of silence as a new cruiser , the chosen , glided past the memorial then , in a thunderous roar , three fighter jets of the hawaii national guard flew over
tampa , fla , jan 27 the second one was sweeter , said mark bavaro , the giants' tight end why \? because i never thought i 'd get back here again , he said after his team had won its second super bowl in five seasons with a 2019 victory over buffalo tonight bavaro , bothered by a bad left knee after two operations last year , said his knee feels great , and he said he was n't thinking about retiring despite speculation that his knee problems would prompt him to end a career that is only six years old i 've never said anything about retiring , he said i do n't plan on retiring but i do n't know what the future holds none of us know what the future holds let s just say i hope i'm here next year bavaro said he did not watch the final fieldgoal attempt by scott norwood , which if successful would have won the game for buffalo he said he was sitting down , praying and hoping for the best i was praying for victory and saying , 'may god s will be done' did it bother bavaro that buffalo had to miss a field goal for the giants to win \? when we get that ring , he said , it s not going to say , 'won on missed field goal'
boston brice marden s show here at the museum of fine arts is one of the most beautiful small exhibitions in recent memory mr marden is the latest participant in the museum s connections series , for which artists juxtapose their own works with works from the permanent collection in collaboration with trevor fairbrother , curator of contemporary art at the museum , he has organized a display as intelligently composed as one of his paintings on view \( through july 21 \) are about three dozen of mr marden s abstract canvases and works on paper and marble , and as many objects belonging to the museum the latter include neolithic chinese jars and 20thcentury chinese scrolls , a 700yearold andean textile , and canvases , prints and drawings by the likes of manet , gauguin , goya , ensor and zurbaran some of the objects had special significance for mr marden when he was a college student in boston some 30 years ago others speak to his achievements of the last several years , when he has turned from the painting of monochrome panels to the design of calligraphic images a few objects from the artist s own collection of chinese jades and porcelains fill out the display in certain hands , an exhibition like this one might embalm an artist s work but mr marden and mr fairbrother accomplish something else entirely through such simple gestures as removing zurbaran s paintings of st cyril and st peter thomas from their frames , and hanging manet s execution of the emperor maximilian low on the wall , at eye level , they have made artistic icons more approachable the result is to encourage a viewer to see these works as mr marden does , with admiration , but also with an artist s eye toward the practicalities of putting paint to canvas or pencil to paper the exhibition is both an explication of the sources of his paintings and homage to the art that he holds in high regard it is a statement of purpose and a measure of his aspirations it is also a small but solid retrospective of his career and by making transparent in almost every case the relationship between his own works and the others on view , mr marden also justifies the presence of contemporary art in this museum that is no small accomplishment in a place where the art of today has historically been kept at arm s length mr marden s work has always been distinguished by its subtleties of surface , material and color what may look at first like nothing more than a plain black canvas can reveal itself , after patient scrutiny , as an image rich in associations suggested by the texture of the paint , the direction of the brushstrokes , the tints of color hidden in the darkness the show encourages the sort of slow , sensuous gaze that is essential to an appreciation of his work a viewer s eye is attracted to minute but telling details the waxy surface of an unfinished canvas by daumier the greenish residue at the base of a white chinese stoneware cup of the seventh century the creaminess of a jade disk from the 10th century bc , whose coloration is very much a part of the artist s palette mr marden s painted marble fragments reflections of a romantic s taste for antique ruins fit perfectly in a room with ancient chinese objects the show is full of similar comparisons none is more intriguing than the comparison of the manet with several monochrome canvases from the 1960 s through the early 80 s mr marden and mr fairbrother have hung the execution at one end of a long wall , at the other end of which , far away , they have hung a small black abstraction of mr marden s called earth i the lush surface of earth i echoes the rich blacks and grays that are to be found in the manet but the relationship between these works is more than formal mr marden suggests that the tragedy explicit in the execution is somehow implicit in his abstractions works in the same gallery by goya , giacometti and zurbaran underscore the idea and at the same time they emphasize the figurative implications that mr marden seems to hope a viewer will see in his spare designs to see star \( for patti smith \) , with its canvas divided into three vertical sections , next to the two zurbaran portraits is to sense the portrait in mr marden s work only in a few instances do the connections appear vague or contrived a cezanne still life looks oddly out of place by itself in a corner of one gallery , despite the ruminative and deliberate qualities that link mr marden with the french master and a grim depiction of skulls by the german expressionist max beckmann , although related to the gauguins nearby , strains the notion of morbidity beyond what mr marden s elegant and more elegiac imagery can bear cheekbyjowl juxtapositions of the rubbings and prints by gauguin with ink drawings on paper by mr marden seem just as forced and unfocused but there is no mistaking the bonds between mr marden s recent paintings and the examples of chinese calligraphy presented beside them a pair of hanging scrolls is interposed between two works , couplet no 4 and diagramed couplet no 1 , both of 198889 it is not simply the network of interlacing forms in these images that brings to mind the chinese characters in the scrolls there s also a stateliness to mr marden s designs , a luxuriance of technique that has its counterpart in the chinese paintings mr marden makes similarly expressive use of white space , of tiny variations in the tone , width and weight of his lines discernible erasures add depth and texture to his simple grounds the paintings signal a broadening of his visual vocabulary , a breaking with strict geometry , that has considerably enriched his art the precedents for these works are not solely chinese mr marden s recent paintings hark back to the monochrome canvases just as star can be read as a portrait of the pop singer patti smith , diagramed couplet can imply two standing figures the lines of his paintings can also be related to the crackles in the glaze of a porcelain vase , and to the brushstrokes in a painting of seashells by ensor mr marden s own spirited drawings are yet one more source for his paintings but the show , which is notable for the presence of so many fine objects , so exquisitely displayed , is also notable for what is not here examples by jackson pollock , franz kline and jasper johns , to whom mr marden

japan , be warned america has an enemy habit it has just spent a quarter of its lifetime cultivating this habit and , with soviet communism dead , it is suddenly like the cigarette fiend in need of smoke you know how desperate a smoker may be \? you 've seen those antismoking films where he wakes in the night craving smoke , only to find his pack empty what does he do \? gets up , dresses , gets the car out and in history s worst blizzard , too and goes hunting cigarettes it s really like that when bad mr cigarette gets claws into you he is your friend , your comforter , the nasty fellow you ca n't live without he is part of the strength that sees you through life s hardest trials in the same way our hostility to bad mr communism strengthened us to endure the korean war , the vietnam war , the overthrow of the mossadegh government in iran and the arbenz government in guatemala , the grenada invasion , the bay of pigs fiasco , the cia s nicaraguan war and all those other secret wars and coups we sponsored and financed , as well as the rebuilding of europe and japan , the witch hunts and assaults on our own traditions , the blacklists , the paranoia , the arms race , the atomic flirtations with doomsday , the squalid political campaigns , the squandering of national treasure , the spy fictions and comic strips and movies and television sitcoms and melodramas that became our national cultural staples it has been hard giving up that familiar old communist devil yes , it was terrible , dangerous , awful that communist enemy the smoke addict feels the same fear and loathing for his cigarette habit , yet it remains his friend , his comforter who can make him rise in the howling blizzard and go heroically into the night giving up the soviet enemy has been so hard for americans that many simply refused for the longest time to believe what mikhail gorbachev was telling the world that the old monster was on the ropes , knees buckling , in danger of never getting up again washington people awesomely credentialed in anticommunist wisdom refused to be fooled leave us not be lulled gorbachev was very likely up to those old commie tricks , they said these were people who talked to people who had spent billions and billions of oncegood american dollars to learn everything knowable about the old evil empire , yet their enemy habit was so powerful they refused to believe what any tourist might have concluded after a weekend stay in moscow the place was falling apart even now , with gorbachev fallen , you find washington types reluctant to quit whacking him for having been a communist party operator throughout his career one might suppose that , having managed the liquidation of such a vast , heavily armed and dangerous nation without bloodshed , he might deserve praise for pulling off something like a miracle but no , he is the last soviet communist left to gratify our habit , and he gets no mercy for americans who need their good old enemy fix , gorbachev is the last store still open at 3 am selling cigarettes there are still a few communists left , of course there is fidel castro in cuba , a truly ruthless bunch in beijing and the mysterious kim il sung regime in north korea none of these can fill the enemy bill for a superpower with a serious habit who is going to lose sleep over castro after reflection that while we can hit havana with hbombs , all he can do in retaliation is dump sugar on the american market \? north korea will never do to satisfy an enemy habit most americans ca n't find it on a map , and those who can remember that we 've already fought a war there to defeat communism , with results that make them eager to forget it china \? possibly , but it s governed by such old men , and americans do n't really take old people seriously , with their inability to grasp the power of rock 'n' roll which leaves japan poor japan it makes such a splendid enemy for a country in need of a longterm fix all that money the japanese are making , and treating us ungenerously too after all we did for them , the ingrates ! what s more , they are starting to publish unflattering criticism of us how is that for insolence \? japan must watch its step america needs an enemy fix
tel aviv , feb 9 as the 31st iraqi missile hurtled toward a quiet neighborhood in the tel aviv area early this morning , the most persistent civil defense warnings being broadcast to israel s people were admonitions against complacency if president saddam hussein of iraq is hoping that repeated scud missile attacks will so anger and exasperate israelis that the government has no choice but to respond , then it would appear that he has seriously misjudged the israeli people after 11 rounds of missile attacks in 22 days , at least 4 deaths , 300 injuries and 1 , 000 homes damaged or destroyed , most israelis seem to be facing the continuing threat with relative good cheer and hardened resolve that they will not let iraq goad them into doing something it is not in their interest to do twentysix people were hurt in this morning s attack , none of them seriously nine remained in the hospital today about 150 homes were damaged no one 'is sad or angry' but bensi , the 28yearold owner of a coffee shop whose home 20 yards from the point of impact was heavily damaged , smiled as he said , when it happens to you , i would n't say it is routine but no one here is sad or angry military censorship regulations prevent publication of his full name or a precise description of the area hit but as bensi waited to file a damage claim this morning , he waved down the street toward the area of greatest damage and said you do n't see people not smiling we do n't feel like something so terrible has happened , because we know we will be here tomorrow nearby , carmela , a sales clerk in a damaged store , said , if saddam hussein wants us to strike back , we are not going to let him bring us down to his level for the first few days after the missile attacks began , israelis seemed traumatized many cowered in their homes , with gas masks at their chests , listening to the radio and keeping their children close at hand for most people the threat was new , and it was aimed at tel aviv , in the nation s heartland but now , the missile attacks have become just one more danger among the lethal , unpredictable threats that israelis face almost every day most see it as the price of living in this land for example , when they turned on the news friday morning , israelis learned that three soldiers had been wounded when jordanian gunmen sneaked across the border and threw a hand grenade at a military bus a few hours later , an israeli guard in jerusalem shot and wounded a palestinian who attacked him with an ax two days earlier , an arab traveling on a bus got up and attacked a soldier with a knife and on the northern border in the last 10 days , residents have spent most nights sleeping in their bomb shelters because of repeated missile attacks by palestinian guerrillas based in southern lebanon it s a scene that has become a familiar one after the last three and a half weeks or so , an israeli radio reporter summed up , standing at the site of the latest attack early this morning once again , after a few nights of quiet , a friday night , the jewish sabbath has become the traditional day , it seems , for saddam hussein to throw scud missiles at israel damage , then quick repairs certainly , while the fires still blazed at 3 am and those hurt were still being dug from the rubble of their homes , some residents of the quiet residential street expressed panic , shock even nearhysteria but by late morning , workers had filled in the crater in the street where the largest piece of the missile fell residents were taping large plastic sheets , distributed by the city , over broken windows and blasted doors workers from dedi and yoel s moving company were already loading furniture and belongings from damaged dwellings into the backs of vans and while residents sorted through the debris in the living rooms and kitchens that lay open to the street after the missile blast blew down walls , most were philosophical i was afraid last night but not now , a young girl told the radio reporter miriam , an 84yearold woman who was at home alone when the missile fell , destroying her house , said you know , it s funny i am not very afraid , and i really do n't know why it just happens , that s all civil defense authorities are growing more and more concerned that many israelis are becoming too relaxed about the continuing threat just after the airraid sirens stopped blaring at 2 45 this morning , a radio announcer chided the people , saying there are people out there who are acting as if there is a state of emergency , but as if the danger has passed we , the citizens of the rear , all that is asked of us is that we protect ourselves we 've been given the best possible equipment for this purpose , and it s a shame not to use it this afternoon , the streets surrounding the point of impact were thronged with relaxed sabbath strollers most carried their gas masks with them but by now , people had taken the plain brown boxes with civil defense warnings stenciled on all sides and covered them with bright drawings , wrapping paper or exaggerated caricatures of mr hussein and at the attack site , a shopkeeper s sign , plastered over a display window shattered by the missile blast , illustrated the a confident , defiant mood despite saddam hussein , the sign said , we are open for business as usual saturday evening photo apartment buildings and cars that were destroyed or damaged yesterday by an iraqi scud missile that struck a quiet neighborhood of tel aviv twentysix people were wounded , none seriously , by the missile \( associated press \)
as the soviet union struggles on the brink of economic collapse and political dissolution , the urgent question facing the united states and its partners in the group of seven industrialized countries is what posture to take on foreign aid to the nation and its seceding republics president bush is still holding to the cautious approach to soviet aid that western leaders agreed to during the london economic summit conference in july in the midst of the incredible events that began 10 days ago with the attempted coup against president mikhail s gorbachev , president bush said he had seen nothing to make me change my mind about the group s agreement not to give moscow direct financial aid until more fundamental steps are taken to establish a market economy the western leaders also agreed to offer the soviet union only technical assistance and associate membership in the international monetary fund these 10 days have been the obverse of the 10 days that shook the world during the russian revolution in november 1917 , and have reversed that revolution yet , the bush administration is holding firm , waiting for the dust to settle prime minister john major of britain , visiting mr bush at kennebunkport , me , said he sided with mr bush on the aid issue but the leaders of germany , france and italy are calling for a big package of money to help speed soviet economic reform and recovery some congressional leaders are also pressing mr bush for a more forthcoming response to the soviet crisis representative les aspin , the wisconsin democrat who is chairman of the house armed services committee , proposed this week to cut 1 billion from weapons spending to provide humanitarian aid , declaring , we do not want the first winter of freedom after 70 years of communism to be a disaster for the soviet union mr bush told reporters on wednesday that he had not yet considered the question of food aid but added , we want to do our part on that the group of seven yesterday pledged urgent help to prevent famine this winter but held to its cautious line on other aid for the sinking soviet economy the question of providing longterm aid to help rescue that economy is far more difficult prof abram bergson , a distinguished sovietologist at the russian research center of harvard university , said in an interview , the situation is too fluid to permit the construction of meaningful plans for longterm aid but he favors immediate aid with food , medicine and spare parts for factories the soviet gross national product dropped 10 percent in the first six months of this year , and before the attempted coup , the soviet statistical office predicted that gnp would fall 6 percent further before the end of the year the disorder of the coup is likely to compound the decline , rather than offset it , professor bergson said hunger looms , he warned , not only because of falling farm production but also because of the brokendown distribution system he characterized the bush administration as being prudent to the point of stultification and robert d hormats , a former assistant secretary of state for economic affairs who is vice chairman of goldman , sachs international , urged the united states and other western countries to do more to reward the democratic forces in the soviet union and eastern europe by opening western markets wider to their exports he said a successful completion of the uruguay round of trade negotiations would help the east greatly by liberalizing trade in agriculture , textiles and other manufactured goods the economic problems in eastern europe have been aggravated by the splitting up of the comecon trade bloc and the inability of the excommunist countries to export to the west a breakup of the soviet union into separate republics , with no center to hold their economies together , could have like effects none of the republics , mr hormats said , have yet developed economic plans yesterday , russia and the ukraine , the two most populous republics , agreed to form a temporary economic and military alliance and invited other former subjects of the ussr to join them but if such efforts at sustaining integration fail and the economy collapses , there could be devastating political consequences even civil war hardpressed on every side , mr gorbachev is struggling to hold the soviet union together some may see parallels to the american civil war in the issues of saving the union , preserving economic strength and winning the struggle for freedom but there are vast differences , too mr gorbachev is no lincoln he is unsure of his direction , and as he made clear when he returned to moscow from the crimea after the coup , he was still trying to save the communist party and the marxistleninist revolution he speaks in the name of political and economic freedom , but the republics oppose him , demanding their own freedom still , there are opportunities as well as hazards for the west in this tumultuous and complex situation the possibility of helping rescue the soviet union and its constituent republics from economic collapse and of achieving democracy , arms reductions and a secure peace are of vital importance to the world a safe transition from communism to democracy and economic freedom could be the greatest benefit of the end of the cold war for the united states , it would save the peace dividend and help provide the budgetary relief , savings and investment capital needed to establish the basis for stronger and more stable economic growth , both at home and abroad drawing
patenga , bangladesh , may 3 four days after a cyclone of unimaginable fury swung across the flat coastal plains of southeastern bangladesh , swallowing up villages and sweeping away food crops , almost no emergency supplies have reached the newly destitute , relief officials and villagers said today more than 92 , 000 people have died in the storm , by official count national newspapers say the toll may reach 200 , 000 , and waterborne diseases and starvation are likely to kill thousands more squalls continue to lash grotesquely disordered and devastated coastal settlements like this one as well as offshore islands in the ravaged bay of bengal landscape of suffering officials in chittagong said the drownings in that city alone , bangladesh s secondlargest , could be as high as 90 , 000 unless a huge international relief operation can be organized quickly , tens of thousands of people who survived the storm will die the crisis has gone far beyond anything bangladesh can manage prime minister khaleda zia appealed again today for foreign help to house and feed up to 10 million of the country s 115 million people the united states , japan and western europe , overburdened by the kurdish and african calamities , have pledged millions of dollars in aid , but the money is far short of the billions that bangladesh says it needs the first foreign aid flights began arriving today empty hands , sad faces here in patenga , at the heart of the storm s path , the landscape is seared with suffering tiny children with empty water pots and plastic bags were stationed along a bayside road , their distraught families busy elsewhere building shelters the numbed and holloweyed children had been told to wait for relief supplies or handouts of any kind none came empty plastic bags and sad faces told the story thousands of children are collapsing of dehydration , and diarrhea ravages neighborhoods of families trying to survive among the scraps of their former lives babies are the first to die everywhere on the muddy shoulders of roads , in the remains of bamboo houses , on empty windtorn patches that once were shelter there are weeping mothers and fathers clinging to infants too weak to hold up their heads , cradling their children in the desperate hope that love might save their lives hungry children sent away journalists who flew to chittagong today on a bangladesh air force plane loaded with rice , unrefined brown sugar , highprotein biscuits , potable water , matches , candles and cooking oil , watched as hungry air force enlisted men unloading the antanov24 transport planes broke into a few parcels of food and held an impromptu picnic children who had come to the airfield in the hope of a slender meal were shooed away we had a biscuit and some rice yesterday , said 9yearold mizana rahman as he clutched an empty shopping bag that he had hoped to fill with food for his six brothers and sisters he left emptyhanded the bangladesh air force is trying to fly supplies including waterpurification tablets from the united states into chittagong airport around the clock to supplement shipments trucked by several government and private groups in an effort that apparently has not been coordinated but the pilots are battling hunger , fatigue and violent weather that makes every takeoff and landing a daredevil stunt today , vice marshal mumtaz uddin ahmed , the air force chief of staff , relieved an exhausted crew and piloted one of the flights himself from chittagong , parcels must be ferried by one of the helicopters to islands still partly submerged in an ugly , churning sea the detritus of towns and of lives is tossed around on the waves , threatening small boats deliveries of supplies are difficult to track because all telephone lines are down in the chittagong area and other means of communication are severely disrupted , a spokeswoman for the international relief agency care said tonight care has been working around chittagong and on hatiya island surrounded by death some lifesaving supplies are being inadvertently wasted a helicopter swung out over offshore islands today with officials hoping to drop drinking water and other supplies on high ground when the thin plastic containers of water landed , they exploded on impact the stench of death hovers over patenga and drifts in and out on the winds that torment drenched people with no dry clothes to wear the fields and beaches are littered with the decomposing bodies of cattle , goats , birds and people who were thrown violently against seawalls , buildings and trees people came in buses today to see the bodies piling up , clutching hadkerchiefs to their noses and mouths to mask the smell they gawked at the dredging barge the size of a city block that had come to rest astride the narrow road that once connected chittagong airport to the town at the airport , not far from the remains of this waterside settlement of patenga , a fishing trawler is lodged between trees and smaller boats rest on the taxiways about 40 f6 training jets have been tossed around and deposited like models made of balsa brick walls have fallen buildings have been swept up and thrown down elsewhere ships docked in fields on the road that traverses patenga , ships once moored in chittagong bay are crazily perched in fields , one still connected to several hundred yards of anchor ropes and a distant anchor a woman named sakina , who is 30 , was helping to reassemble some family possessions today on the road that passed by the sodden , empty space where her house once stood her father and brother died on tuesdaymorning when the water came she stayed alive by clinging to a tree as the cyclone struck with winds of 140 miles per hour sakina s story of why the family had not moved out of the path of this very destructive storm was a common one they had no radio or television , she said , so they had not heard any warnings but the way people talked , we assumed nothing much would happen , she said they went to bed at dusk on monday the rain and wind started coming at about 10 , and then the waves ! the waves would n't go down waves on this coast surged to 20 feet or more , submerging the airport chittagong harbor is still blocked with sunken ships no escape for bangladeshis , cyclones and floods are annual events many said today that they were not too concerned about the special ferocity of the storm until it was too late yet they had been warned for several days , and on monday by prime minister zia , who appeared on television to tell people to seek shelter on safer ground for many , such warnings were pointless they had nowhere to go to escape the flooding in mizana rahman s family , that call went unheeded because , the boy said , by then , the electricity had gone off and no one could see anything on television the government never ordered people to move forced evacuations are uncommon in this part of the world , where temporary shelter is very difficult to find bangladesh does have some sophisticated cyclone shelters concrete buildings on threestoryhigh columns but local people say that to go to them means leaving their homes , which many are loath to do tajolislam chowdhury , who works for the air force and speaks english , said that , like his neighbors , he had decided to stay home and see how bad the storm would be by midnight on monday , he said , he knew this was no ordinary cyclone he sought shelter in a twostory airport building but next door to me , in the house alongside , they all stayed , he said all 10 of them are gone , all dead photos residents of kutubdia island in bangladesh surging toward the cargo bay of a helicopter bringing supplies \( reuters \) \( pg 1 \) the body of a child

millburn as soon as a chorus line closed on broadway last april after 15 years , it actually did the inevitable blitz of smallscale reproductions followed now it s time for a bigtime chorus line once more and what theater is better endowed to produce one , with all the technical trimmings , than the paper mill playhouse \? for those who were lucky enough to see the show during its prebroadway beginnings , after a historic twoyear workshop process , the urgency , power and immediacy of those three months of performances in 1975 , at the new york shakespeare festival s public theater , in a 299seat house , cannot be recreated still , chorus lines , big or small , must somehow convince us of their integrity , while blending spareness , showmanship , sentimentality and toughness , without excess or mawkishness , and with perfect timing baayork lee , a member and dance captain of the original production , has restaged that s the program designation the musical for the paper mill , as she has , for years , for theaters all over the world by all accounts , ms lee has restaged it like the big musical it is n't considering her matchless credentials as the musical s prime mover , one is distressed by the current production s impersonal air , insistent tone and blunt lighting perversely , since there is more mania than momentum during the imprecise opening , one waits for the thrills to begin do n't worry they do , they do , but the staging suffers from a curiously mechanical case of delayed buildup granted , the demands of the first number , i hope i get it , during which 10 hopefuls at an audition are going to be eliminated , are fiendishly difficult to pull off as intended , this is a startling juxtaposition of competitiveness and ensemble everyone is pushing to stand out and to fit in , thus establishing the builtin contradiction of the piece , which purports to be a paean to the gypsies , one of whom then declares in her blase fashion everyone wants to be a star \( in real life , it was clear that none of the show s original cast would continue to be content as a chorus member \) throughout , michael bennett s conception remains extraordinary a chorus line is the musical that changed musicals how they evolved \( previously unheardof elaborate and intensive workshops became standard show business procedure as a result of this musical \) and how they unfolded on stage \( as a seamless , overlapping , interweaving fusion of all elements \) during the mirrorturning climax of hello twelve , in this production , all that is in place , and the result , one of the great moments in musical theater , is heartstopping from then on , the exactness established by ms lee s company , however slow in getting there , is unstoppable , or pretty near it is only the gutwrenching , truthtelling monologues , culled from composites of the original cast members obviously , a bit much for an audition that grow weary , but on a performance level , such encountertype sessions are validated for they induce the sort of highintensity performance made possible by shattering defenses , exposing nerve endings and threatening complacency in casting , ms lee has made some interesting choices , with variable results altogether , the ensemble does not quite live up to the directortaskmaster zach s requirement for people that look terrific together and can also work together in a group but matt zarley \( as mike , who sings i can do that \) is one of the more distinctive dancers , and frank kosik is goodhearted and streetsmart as al , the husband of kristine , the one who ca n't sing , played by an endearingly jumpy michelle chase lydlyd gaston is a gleaming connie , ms lee s original role even though the part of paul , who has the teary confessional about being gay , guilty and finally acknowledged by his parents , is usually surefire , eric paeper , an eloquent dancer , has to be one of its best delineators paul is the musical s one complete story taken from the life of nicholas dante , the book s coauthor , who died two weeks ago and , by now , for all its accuracy about obsessive ambition , the soap operaish story of zach and cassie can hardly be less riveting , but jane lanier s performance as cassie is so genuine and intelligently timed through and through that one at least cares for the performer , if not for the character contrarily , michael danek s dull , outofsynch zach makes one wonder why he really has to be included in the glittering finale finally and successfully , a chorus line is a testament to theater to having to be there forget the film as a musical conception , it remains a marvel , at once truthful and transporting deferred as the pleasures of the paper mill production are , the musical creates goosebump time that it can still do a chorus line , conceived by michael bennett , with book by james kirkwood and nicholas dante , music by marvin hamlisch and lyrics by edward kleban , at the paper mill playhouse , brookside drive , millburn performances are wednesday through sunday at 8 pm , thursday at 2 pm , and friday and saturday at 3 pm , continuing through june 30 box office \( 201 \) 3764343 photo members of the paper mill playhouse production of a chorus line \( gerry goldstein \)
declarations of independence crossexamining american ideology by howard zinn 341 pages harpercollins 25 howard zinn s declarations of independence was written before iraq s invasion of kuwait and president bush s decision to send hundreds of thousands of american troops to saudi arabia books are not newspapers they cover not yesterday s events , but what happened months or , more likely , years ago in light of the persian gulf crisis and the debate over who has the constitutional responsibility to declare war , professor zinn s book has a certain remote and theoretical air yet the author s wellknown ideas against the use of force to settle international disputes he was one of the most visible opponents of the vietnam war while teaching political science at boston university are not without relevance today he is aware that some of the views in his book , which is subtitled crossexamining american ideology , may sound impractical , but he seems more than willing to be accused of idealism as he puts it those of us who call for the repudiation of massive violence to solve human problems must sound utopian , romantic so did those who demanded the end of slavery but utopian ideas do become realistic at certain points in history , when the moral power of an idea mobilizes large numbers of people in its support this may then be joined to the realization , by at least some of those in authority , that it would be realistic for them to change their policy , even perhaps share power with those they have long controlled professor zinn believes that military victory may no longer be possible he notes that many of the wars since world war ii have ended in stalemates the united states in korea iran and iraq , and the soviet union in afghanistan in vietnam , first the french , then the united states were forced to withdraw even the victories , like the one israel achieved in its 1967 war , have brought neither peace nor security stones have turned out to be dangerous weapons against uzis a story that goes back to david and goliath civil wars become endless , as in central america , and after much bloodshed the participants turn to negotiated settlements in his chapter on just and unjust wars , professor zinn gets personal although he served as an air force bombardier during world war ii , he raises questions about what studs terkel , in his prizewinning oral history , called 'the good war' \( mr terkel made sure to put quotation marks around his title , aware that the word good was incongruous when mated to the word war \) i flew the last bombing missions of the war , got my air medal and my battle stars , he writes i was quietly proud of my participation in the great war to defeat fascism but when i packed up my things at the end of the war and put my old navigation logs and snapshots and other mementos in a folder , i marked that folder , almost without thinking , 'never again' in a similar way , he quotes a passage from mr terkel s interview with adm gene larocque , retired , now director of the center for defense information in washington you could argue that world war ii had to be fought , the admiral said hitler had to be stopped unfortunately , we translate it unchanged to the situation today the chapter on just and unjust wars is disappointing it lacks original explanations or solutions professor zinn is certainly not convincing when he tries to find a certain similarity between the organized german concentration camps for killing men , women and children and what the allies did in response to the london blitz and other nazi atrocities with their saturation bombing of german cities the enormously difficult subject of just and unjust wars demands legal and historical answers , if possible , not simply moral and personal outrage in his most important book , a people s history of the united states , professor zinn offered a highly original view of the nation from the point of view of blacks , indians , other minorities , women and disadvantaged classes echoes of his concern for these groups of americans can be heard all through declarations of independence , and they are worth heeding among the many citations professor zinn offers to support his views , none come closer to his thoughts than remarks made by leonard bernstein to a graduation class at johns hopkins university a few years ago the composer said only think if all our imaginative resources currently employed in inventing new power games and bigger and better weaponry were reoriented toward disarmament , what miracles we could achieve , what new truths , what undiscovered realms of beauty ! professor zinn concludes that the struggle for justice should never be abandoned , whether by blacks in alabama and south africa peasants in el salvador , nicaragua , and vietnam or workers and intellectuals in eastern europe and the soviet union and he says that all of history s excuses for war and preparation of war can no longer be accepted photo howard zinn \( harpercollins \)

moscow , march 28 a fresh snow began falling , bolstering the vast street crowd s remarkable serenity in the face of a show of kremlin police power that the marchers first took as an insult , then finally mocked as a burlesque of the terror that once made the kremlin fearful today , it proved not fearful enough as ordinary muscovites packed into the streets by the scores of thousands , emboldened , if not enraged , by the ban of president mikhail s gorbachev against political protest rallies the gift of protest a snowdusted paradox was on the move through the city the people were using the great gift of protest first secured for them by mr gorbachev himself , and they were loudly , publicly protesting what they fervidly saw as his attempt at snatching back the gift democracy ends at that line ! a marcher shouted , pointing at one of the corridors of waiting troops on the sideline it s shameful ! cried an old man , scrambling to keep pace with the protest parade not since stalin s funeral have i seen such a shameful use of troops to control the people a grinning marcher wore a sandwichboard sign saying is communism done yet \? or is it going to get worse \? a man eyeing the troops all about said we 're defenseless only our selfdiscipline will save us and it did , by the end of a day that , were mr gorbachev not lately otherwise inclined , the soviet leader might be entitled to mark as a further sign of popular democracy making its mark on this tortured land in rhythm with their own determined tramping , the marchers shouted slogans in defense of their champion , boris n yeltsin , the russian president , who has scandalized the kremlin and elated his evergrowing group of supporters by calling for mr gorbachev s resignation the day s tension and its climactic , ebullient , peaceful rally were much involved with the endless political feuding of mr gorbachev and mr yeltsin but far more , the people who moved through the falling snow were savoring the simple act of public assembly they took pleasure in circumventing an armada of water cannon , military trucks , and combat troops and police of every description in the center of the city , a stunning gathering assembled by the kremlin in fear of public disorder plugging routes to kremlin this force plugged all routes to the kremlin , parked and packed into alleyways and courtyards as if in expectation of the resurrection of napoleon s army rather than a mere show of muscovites and rather than march into it , the throngs of civilians marched smartly away from it , as if there were better places to gather for denouncing mr gorbachev than right outside his kremlin walls this is what shows gorbachev is a loser , all this force , said a ruddyfaced woman wearing a big photo over her heart of mr yeltsin and his cocky smile gorbachev is afraid of us the crowd moved by the tens of thousands through the snow down kalinin prospekt , their backs to the kremlin they maintained a strut , their russian flags and protest signs bristling colorfully through the large snowflakes soothing the gray city get your yeltsin news ! a newspaper dealer cried on the sidewalk , demonstrating the fact that for all his obvious , sometimes hamhanded attempts to diminish the role and power of mr yeltsin , his nemesis , mr gorbachev was only stoking the yeltsin bandwagon with fresh fuel the crowd , the biggest piece of an ad hoc rally that eventually flooded from three directions into mayakovsky square , marched on kalinin prospekt up to the city s major ring road there , a traffic policeman was on duty , with none of the walltowall trucks , buses , troops and water cannon to be seen elsewhere the policeman a member of a city force from which the kremlin interior ministry took over moscow law enforcement this week , calling it unreliable saw the marchers coming through the snow he nonchalantly stopped traffic and gave the people the right of way horns sounded in solidarity stalled drivers beeped their horns in solidarity one stuck his hand out his car window , and the traffic cop , walking escort now with the front rank of the marchers , smiled and shook hands more horns sounded yeltsin ! yeltsin ! the strutting throng responded even as the crowd marched , the kremlin was putting out the word that mr gorbachev s ban openly defied by the insurgent government in city hall was not really being violated a quiet compromise had been worked out with rally leaders , officials announced , in a bit of news that came far too late for the assembled public and its sense of risk in marching thus did the kremlin , after inviting the world s wonder by assembling an enormous singleday task force to guard against its own people , try to deal casually with a facesaving issue what to do about such an impish violation by such a large crowd of mr gorbachev s initial demand that there be no rallies at all in this city for the next three weeks shortterm denouements and thus did this nation maintain its knack for inventing shortterm denouements in the midst of its longterm crisis that the crisis remains longterm was implicit in the rally speeches democratic legislators drew cheers from the crowd with vows that the communist party must once and for all turn back its vast property holdings to the public but similar cheers were sounded a year ago at a rally , and the party still has its holdings the demonstrators were hostages of their situation , the television news controlled by mr gorbachev s ministers contended darkly tonight , offering pictures that avoided the sight of the great crowd strutting through the snow as the news was received at home by this skeptical , marching public , roads leading from the city were clogged with military convoys retreating from the kremlin the last words at the rally were a mention of how long and strange a day the troops had to put in well , we forgive them , said a speaker and the rally cheered that , too photo more than 100 , 000 demonstrators marched in moscow to protest president mikhail s gorbachev s three week ban on political rallies a woman jumped on the front of a military truck and refused to move \( reuters \)
washington , june 14 in remarks suggesting he was deeply skeptical that the guilty verdicts against oliver l north could be salvaged , the federal district judge who presided over mr north s trial in the irancontra affair said today that prosecutors might have no alternative but to abandon the case the judge , gerhard a gesell , said that if he found that any of the witnesses in the north trial had been influenced by the testimony that the former aide to the national security council gave to congress under a grant of immunity , he would throw out the remaining criminal convictions against mr north mr north s conviction has stood as one of the main accomplishments of the special prosecutor , lawrence e walsh , in the fourandahalf year inquiry into the irancontra affair change in judicial tone you must realize that there is a very slight possibility that the ablest group of lawyers in the world could meet the standard of the court of appeals , judge gesell said at a hearing , referring to an appeals court decision that forced prosecutors to seek another hearing to prove that mr north received a fair trial i do n't believe there s anyone i know of who could the judge s tone seemed dramatically changed from two years ago , when he sentenced mr north saying that the former security council aide under president ronald reagan failed to understand how public service has been tarnished by his acts today , the gruff whitehaired jurist expressed admiration for mr north i'm sure you realize that the defendant has not only been long under the gun of the existence of this litagation , the judge told michael r bromwich , a member of the prosecution team who was representing the irancontra independent prosecutor s office but he has served part of his sentence , he served it early , with distinction , conscientiously and it s highly to his credit , said the judge he was referring to mr north s performance of the 1 , 200 hours of community service at a washington antidrug program mr north , a former marine corps lieutenant colonel , was not at the hearing mr walsh asked for today s hearing after the supreme court last month refused to consider whether to reinstate the criminal convictions against mr north 'witness by witness' review the justices let stand a ruling by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in 1990 that ordered prosecutors to conduct a witness by witness review of the testimony against mr north to assure that none of his statements at a congressional hearing into the irancontra affair in 1987 was used against him the ruling means that prosecutors , in order to uphold the conviction of mr north , must now demonstrate that the testimony that he gave at the hearing in no way affected the grand jury that indicted him or the outcome of his criminal trial in 1989 judge gesell s comments today indicated that he would apply the appeals court s decision in the strictest possible manner , throwing out the case if he found even one trial witness who had been influenced in any way by mr north s testimony at the hearing in light of the judge s comments , legal experts said it would be exceedingly difficult if not impossible for the prosecutors to prevail before the start of the north trial , judge gesell had ruled that the indictment was not tainted at the conclusion of the trial he denied a defense motion to dismiss the case on grounds that the witnesses had been affected by mr north s congressional testimony but today , in the wake of the appellate court ruling , the judge seemed to take those issues far more seriously , saying this is a pretty big can of worms he said later if one witness is disqualified under the standard set by the court of appeals , that s the end of the matter i have no obligation to go further several defense attorneys said today that judge gesell s comments confront the prosecutors with nearly insurmountable problems given the number of witnesses and the number of people who testified before congress on national television it would appear it will be almost impossible , said robert plotkin , a washington defense lawyer who specializes in white collar crime cases and if the judge is saying that taint of any witness is sufficient to taint the entire proceeding , it appears the case is at the end of the road mr north s nationally televised testimony before the irancontra congressional committees , which took place over a period of six days in july 1987 , was given on the condition that none of his statements would be used against him in any subsequent criminal trial in violation of his constitutional right against compelled selfincrimination at the time , mr walsh objected to the grant of the immunity , asserting that it would make any prosecution of mr north exceedingly difficult , precisely because of the issues that appear to have left his case dangerously close to collapse mcfarlane to be questioned mr north directed secret white house efforts to supply the nicaraguan contras in 198586 at a time military aide had been barred by congress , using some money from the sale of arms to iran he was found guilty of three criminal charges on may 4 , 1989 , including aiding and abetting in the obstruction of congress , accepting an illegal gratuity in the form of a 13 , 800 home security system and destroying government documents he was fined 150 , 000 and ordered to perform 1 , 200 hours of community service and placed on two years probation on july 20 , 1990 , a divided panel of the appeals court overturned mr north s conviction for destroying documents and set aside the other two guilty verdicts pending the review of the fairness of mr north s trial judge gesell said he would begin the review of the north trial witnesses by questionning robert c mcfarlane , the former national security adviser and mr north s superior at the white house , who was a government witness against mr north at his trial he s a coconspirator , said the judge , referring to mr mcfarlane he s all involved in every way with the immunized testimony why do n't we take a look at his testimony the judge said the hearing would be held in september mr mcfarlane testified to congress before mr north , but after mr north s congressional testimony , it was apparent that mr mcfarlane had closely followed mr north s dramatic account of his actions in the covert operation to sell arms to iran and divert some of the profits to arm the nicaraguan rebels after mr north testified , mr mcfarlane requested and was granted a second appearance before house and senate congressional investigating committees in his second appearance he revised some of this previous statements and testified more fully about some events later , he pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from congress mr mcfarlane was fined 20 , 000 and ordered to serve 200 hours of community service mr bromwich , the prosecutor , suggested that even if some witnesses were familiar with mr north s testimony the judge could find that the exposure amounted to harmless error but the judge , citing mr mcfarlane as example , said it seems to me there s no way his testimony could be said to be harmless error his testimony covers massive parts of the case mr mcfarlane testified in mr north s trial about a wide range of events , including the alteration of documents and the preparation of false chronologies in the arms sales to iran that were part of the charge of abetting the obstruction of congress the judge asked mr bromwich if the prosecutor s office had decided to seek another trial of mr north if he dismisses the case mr bromwich replied that the he had not yet discussed that option with mr walsh later , the judge told mr bromwich , people lose cases there s a lot to be said for accepting the loss and going ahead photo federal district judge gerhard a gesell , who said he might have to dismiss oliver north s remaining criminal convictions \( associated press \) \( pg 10 \)
sweet i remember that first trip through harlem like it was yesterday september 1968 morgan state playing grambling in yankee stadium in the first whitney young classic both teams undefeated , each loaded with future pro football players and me just turned 18 , one of nine freshmen to make the morgan state team had come to baltimore from chicago on my first jet ride had gone from a high school team that won four games in two years to morgan , which had not lost a game in more than two seasons on game day , our team bus headed up to yankee stadium through the heart of harlem via st nicholas or amsterdam can remember looking around the bus at ray chester , a future oakland raider frenchy fuqua , pittsburgh steelers ed hayes , drafted by the denver broncos mark washington , dallas cowboys george nock , new york jets the guided tour through harlem was presented by our coach , earl banks , a legend in black college football circles along with eddie robinson of grambling , big john merritt of tennessee state , and jake gaither of florida am in the preaching tradition of black college coaches , banks was second to none ca n't remember the context of the question , but someone said something about prostitutes coach banks advised , you can tell the prostitutes , 'cause they wear white boots stored the information looked out the window at harlem our first warmup was with no pads at 1 pm , the crowd beginning to trickle in for a 2 30 game recall coming out for the real thing nervous , walking through the tunnel , hearing a deep rumble grow louder stepped out of the dugout , looked up , stopped in my tracks at the sight of 65 , 000 people 64 , 500 had to be black grambling s gold and black , morgan s orange and blue bands playing yankee stadium fuqua caught a pass on morgan s first series and took a tremendous hit i remember thinking at that precise moment that this was a whole different level of ball charlie joiner was grambling s split end , frank lewis was the wingback , james harris was the quarterback , although he was injured and not expected to play billy newsome and john mendenhall were defensive linemen delles howell was in the secondary ca n't remember the halftime score , just that coach banks went off he was upset that the 46 power and 44trap breadandbutter running plays were n't working he banged against the blackboard as he drew raggedy x s and o s we 're making no 81 an allamerican , i remember banks saying angrily , referring to newsome he drew up a new blocking scheme and declared that we were going to run 46 power until it worked he implored bruce caraway and bobby smith to stick their head in newsome s gut and , with his voice rising with emotion as he diagrammed the play , he said , i want this 'lame' out of here ! earl drew the line all the way off the blackboard and the chalk broke in half \( coach banks often used this adjective as a perjorative noun \) with grambling down by two points with two or three minutes left to play , coach robinson went to the well he motioned for harris in one of the most dramatic moments i 'd ever been involved in as a participant , harris limped onto the field and ducked into the huddle as the grambling fans went wild we immediately saw why zip , to lewis zip , to joiner zip , zip , to lewis and joiner suddenly , grambling was at the morgan 5yard line , then the 3 , then the 2 , and the 1 with three seconds to play fourth down no field goal robinson was going to win like a man fullback plunge into the line pileup they did n't make it morgan wins 97 the stadium erupts in cheers and music i could n't believe it 28 straight victories remember walking toward the locker room , looking at my teammates and thinking these cats are bad reality twentythree years later , the topography of college sports has changed dramatically the failure of black colleges to anticipate integration and understand its implication was nearly catastrophic as predominately white schools , driven by the need to maintain a competitive balance , began raiding the pools of talent that had gone to historically black schools but the financial woes that hit black schools 15 years ago are now hitting all but the wealthiest athletic programs at larger schools advertisers , faced with a choice between college and pro football , are choosing the pros notre dame is ahead of the game , having already looked out for its commercial interests , as it has done for the last 30 years beyond that , everyone is watching and waiting the golden goose is definitely sick , but is not dying and will never die college football is too intertwined with the maledominated ethos of american society and need to revisit lost innocence , to vanish there will be a dramatic restructuring , however , resulting in fewer scholarships and fewer coaching positions that s unfortunate , because the only redeeming element of bigtime college sports as currently structured is the opportunity they offer for a subsidized education i think about those shrinking opportunities as each september approaches , and feel sad

who had been in office since 1969 he ran in manhattan , where no republican had won a council seat in 25 years he defeated councilwoman carol greitzer in district 5 on the upper east side of manhattan the district has supported republican candidates for other offices in the past , but mr millard and others in his party saw in his victory a sign of hope that republicans can begin to loosen the democratic hold on the council by appealing to liberal voters people voted for me , even though they may not like my party , because i represent change , and people are tired of what they have been getting from city government , mr millard said broad support like other republican candidates , mr millard ran on a platform of reducing both taxes and government bureaucracy , but he also expressed concern about social issues like homelessness and drug abuse although he has little experience in government , he won the support of the liberal party , editorial boards at five city newspapers and council president andrew j stein mr millard said yesterday that residents of district 5 had been hit hard by rising taxes , declining property values and a reduction in city services and that he would work to reverse this trend by making city government more efficient this city is bloated beyond belief , and we have to find ways to work more efficiently , he said asked what areas of city government are inefficient , mr millard pointed to the education system and the human resources administration mr millard said that he hoped to continue in the tradition of republicans like senator jacob k javits of new york and state senator roy goodman of manhattan he described them as liberally compassionate on social issues but fiscally conservative political leaders and strategists said yesterday that mr millard s victory demonstrates that many new yorkers are unhappy with the present city government and will support a republican candidate who pledges to help the middle class but also displays a social conscience mr millard won early support for the council seat from senator goodman , whom he approached nine months ago about running he was very bright , sincere , idealistic and interested in helping the city , mr goodman said he also impressed me with his ability to write clear and lucid prose that s very unusual for young people these days a graduate of columbia law school , mr millard has been an associate at the law firm of davis and polk , where he did pro bono work on behalf of prisoners' rights he has worked as a community organizer in crown heights , brooklyn , and a vista volunteer in chile he was also an aide to millicent fenwick , the former new jersey congresswoman mr millard s district covers most of the upper east side , from 49th street to 86th street and from the east river to second avenue district 5 , where democrats outnumber republicans 2 to 1 , has sent republicans to congress and the state senate in the past representative bill greene and mr goodman among them but none to the city council the district also showed strong support for rudolph w guiliani , the former federal prosecutor , when he ran for mayor as a republican in 1989 these victories signal a major change in attitudes , said councilman alfred c cerrullo 3d , the republican minority leader , who was reelected in district 51 in staten island voters are choosing republicans not only because they are frustrated with the status quo but also because they like what our candidates stand for other republicans who won council seats are michael abel in district 19 in queens ,

no more friendly enemies for all the attention in albany on the war between gov mario m cuomo and the republican leaders of the state senate , whom mr cuomo has blamed for blocking a budget agreement and for keeping him out of the presidential race , there has been something of a sideshow struggle between the governor and another republican united states senator alfonse m d'amato although they come from different parties , the governor and senator d'amato were on distinctly friendly terms for years , sometimes using words like superb \( mr cuomo did \) and super , just super \( mr d'amato did \) to describe each other s work but not now the first real signs of hostility surfaced two weeks ago , when mr d'amato announced that he would go to snowy albany to issue some thoughts about the state budget oh , we 'll make sure to shovel the capitol steps for him , a sarcastic mr cuomo told reporters at a news conference \( yes , before and after , piped in his chief of staff , andrew j zambelli , as the room dissolved in laughter \) the next day mr d'amato , who had never before taken such a public interest in state budget matters , did show up , declaring that if mr cuomo could n't handle his own state s budget , obviously people will wonder how you can handle that situation nationwide mr cuomo lashed back at the senator as a lackey sent by republicans in washington , calling him bad a bush attack dog that provoked an expression of outrage from mr d'amato your decision to respond to my economic ideas with personal vitriol is wrong , he wrote in a letter to mr cuomo i demand an apology none came from the governor , who later predicted that mr d'amato , who is expected to face a tough reelection battle next fall , would be a severe drag on the republican state senators who will also be campaigning it s going to be like running through the mud with a 900pound sumo wrestler on your back , he said people close to both men say there is genuine irritation between the two that could well harden into permanent ill feelings on the other hand , it is certainly not impossible that all the nasty words served other purposes than just an exchange of slurs for mr cuomo , the d'amato appearance did bolster his contention that there might be a national republican plot against him and for mr d'amato , an attack on a governor who has sagged in the polls , along with the publicity surrounding the theatrics of their falling out , may well have given a boost to his reelection bid you wanted it angry democrats last week turned the table on new jersey s largest teachers' union , the new jersey education association , using an assembly appropriations committee hearing on tax repeal to deliver a stern public lecture the teachers' union unmistakably added their voice to the chorus of repeal , repeal , repeal , said assemblyman bernard f kenny , a democrat from hudson county now that the legislature is considering a sunset and review of the tax package and programs , the njea is doing an aboutface i'm perplexed the 137 , 000member association put its money and votes behind republican candidates in the nov 5 election the teachers' union , one of the most powerful unions in the state , was angry with democrats over a section of the quality education act that tried to shift teacher pension costs from the state to local schools in richer districts monday s hearing was the first facetoface meeting between democrats and njea representatives since the election , and the democrats seized that opportunity to give the union a tonguelashing when the njea panicked because the qea shifted teacher pension and social security costs to the local level , the democrats stepped in and delayed the shift for a period of two years , said assemblyman john a villapiano , another democratic member of the appropriations committee but the union still balked , then worked to defeat the democratic legislators who crafted the 1990 tax program to suggest now that the program is fine and should be left alone is at best an about face and at worst , hypocrisy wayne s dibofsky , the associate director of government relations for the union , bore the brunt of the democrats' anger as he sat before the committee arguing against repeal of the entire 28 billion tax package the democraticcontrolled legislature approved 18 months ago we 're concerned about the growing deficit , the quality of life in new jersey and the quality of schools , mr dibofsky said all could be drastically hurt by this suggestion that we start from ground zero and a spokeswoman for the teachers' union , karen joseph , accused the democrats of distorting our message the njea has never opposed taxes , ms joseph said taxes are what pay for public education from erie to albany jim kelly , the buffalo bills quarterback , is arguably the bestknown person in western new york right now but a new survey of community leaders by business first , a magazine that covers the area , cites somebody else as the most influential person in the region dennis t gorski , the erie county executive mr gorski , a democrat who soundly turned back a challenge in november from mayor james d griffin of buffalo , is about to start his second fouryear term he is the only democrat ever elected to the post although buffalo and the new york metropolitan region are so far apart that some people have suggested they belong in different states , the 47yearold mr gorski is expected at some point to try to parlay his influence into a bid for statewide office one of his predecessors as county executive , edward v regan , a republican , is the state comptroller , and another western new yorker , stan lundine , the former mayor of jamestown , is the lieutenant governor directory assistance what a difference a year makes crotty , davis , forsythe , dullea , fryer , poklemba , reads the speeddial listings on the telephone in governor cuomo s conference room in the state capitol apparently the budget chaos has kept mr cuomo s staff so busy that no one has had a chance to change the names , which represent the people who held six of the highest positions in the cuomo administration last year all six men who were , respectively , the governor s chief of staff , counsel , budget director , director of state operations , press officer and criminaljustice director left following mr cuomo s november 1990 reelection , for jobs in either private business or higher education the changeover has been cast as a way to bring on a new team for mr cuomo s third term , although some officials in the capitol also took it as an early sign that some of those closest to mr cuomo , who might not have left if they thought he were headed for the white house , did not believe he would wind up running for president just for the record , when things calm down it s time to change the labels on those buttons to \( andrew j \) zambelli , \( elizabeth d \) moore , \( patrick j \) bulgaro , \( mary ann

washington , june 6 in the first statebystate comparison of how public schoolchildren do in national academic tests , the federal government released data today showing that the highest scores in eighthgrade mathematics came from students in the upper midwestern and northwestern states , which in general have few large cities and less poverty than other regions the federal survey also indicated that only one out of seven eighth graders nationally reaches the proficiency in mathematics expected at that grade level the survey , part of what is called the national assessment of educational progress , compared eighth graders' scores in mathematics in 37 states , the district of columbia , guam and the virgin islands thirteen states declined to participate for 20 years , the national assessment surveys have tracked student performance in a number of areas , including mathematics , but states historically were opposed to statebystate comparisons , fearing unflattering results 'huge differences' none of the states are cutting it , and there are huge differences among the states , said education secretary lamar alexander , who characterized the survey results as an alarm bell that ought to ring all night if our aim is to be first in the world in math and science by the year 2000 , there is an enormous challenge ahead of us , he said led by north dakota , 9 of the top 10 states , ranked by the average score of their students , were in the midwest or northwest new hampshire ranked seventh states in the south and notably poor states did worst , with louisiana earning the lowest average and washington , dc , scoring even lower new york fell squarely in the middle , 20th , while connecticut and new jersey ranked 11th and 12th over all in the average score of their students california , a state known for educational innovation , ranked 29th of the 40 participants participants in the news conference releasing the findings today repeatedly cautioned against using the data as a simple ranking because of the many variables involved in the calculations and the overlapping performance of many states some who rank in the middle in overall average , for example , nonetheless have groups of students who score among the highest in the nation listing these statebystate figures 1 through 40 is , among other things , inaccurate , mr alexander said the most appropriate use of these results is to establish a 1990 baseline for each state to set about making progress toward proficiency by the year 2000 he added that even in the highestscoring states , only about one in four eighth graders is proficient in simple algebra and beginning geometry , which is something eighth graders should know and be able to do mr alexander also used the release of the test results as an opportunity to promote the bush administration s proposed american achievement test , noting that while statebystate results were helpful , they are not nearly as useful as would be schoolbyschool and childbychild results under the bush proposal , students in the fourth , eighth and 12th grades would be tested in math , science , history , english and geography richard a boyd , chairman of the national assessment governing board , a federal agency that conducts the tests released today , said , it would be incorrect to treat this as a horse race california s poor performance but a few generalizations could be made mr boyd said the results show that higherperforming states tend to have fewer students in large city schools and fewer students living in poverty , whether urban or rural he also noted that the top 10 states in student performance were also the 10 lowestranked states in the percentage of students who reported watching more than six hours of television a night there were also some surprises in california , only whites in the state performed above national average in proficiency blacks , hispanics , and asians were below average for their respective groups francie alexander , associate superintendant for the california state education department , said california was already revamping its general mathematics curriculum she said the state had designated 100 schools that would stress more innovative mathematics teaching methods , including the use of computers and group work south ranked worst regionally , the south did the worst , with white achievement conspicuously poorer than that of whites in other regions of the country , while southern blacks did slightly better than blacks in the midwest approximately 2 , 500 students in about 100 public schools in each of the participating states and territories were tested in february the rating system placed students at level 200 if they performed simple addition and problem solving with whole numbers they reached level 250 if they performed simple multiplication and twostep problem solving level 300 was achieved if students could reason and solve problems involving fractions , decimals , percentages , elementary geometry and simple algebra level 350 was achieved when a student could do algebraic equations , beginning statistics and probability , reasoning and problem solving involving geometric relationships the test was threequarters multiple choice and onequarter openended questions in north dakota and montana , all of the eighthgrade students mastered the first level , and 88 percent mastered the second level iowa had 100 percent at level 200 and 84 percent at level 250 nebraska and minnesota had 99 percent at the first level but 81 percent and 82 percent at level 250 crosssection of eighth grade statebystate data on student performance has been available in the past through the results of tests like the scholastic aptitude tests and the american college testing program , but these tests are taken only by those applying to college today s test results represent a crosssection of all eighthgrade students in a state the national assessment agency , whose surveys are known as the nation s report card , also surveyed math performances in grades four , eight and 12 , but did not provide a state breakdown the results are expected to give educators and policy makers a tool to assess what needs to be done to improve the generally low mathematics performance of american students and help to reach the national education goals agreed upon by president bush and the nation s governors in 1989 the 13 states that did not participate in the survey released today are alaska , washington , nevada , utah , south dakota , kansas , missouri , tennessee , mississippi , south carolina , vermont , massachusetts and maine emerson j elliott , acting commissioner of education statistics for the national center for education statistics , said states declined for reasons ranging from the 100 , 000 cost of the test to an inability to get legislative approval in time the great plains states north dakota , montana , iowa , nebraska , minnesota and wisconsin whose students had the best performances , are also states with the lowest proportion of families headed by single parents other areas where student performance was relatively high included new hampshire , wyoming , idaho , oregon and wealthier suburbs of other states virginia was the only state to have any students in the top level of the threelevel rating system students

new delhi , may 23 sonia gandhi , the widow of rajiv gandhi , rejected an offer today by the congress party to succeed her husband as its president , leaving the nation s largest political party in turmoil and deepening the political crisis here two days after mr gandhi , who was prime minister from 1984 until 1989 , was killed in a bomb blast in the south , his widow said that because of the tragedy that has befallen my children and myself , she was declining the party s offer to become president friends and associates said the italianborn mrs gandhi , 43 years old , was too shocked and bereft to step into the political limelight after years of playing a relatively subdued role in the shadow of her husband but a few party politicians and diplomats , none of whom had spoken directly with mrs gandhi about her future , said they thought she might yet reconsider and make herself available if the congress party , riddled by factional differences , failed to find a leader with india in the midst of national elections , now delayed until midjune , the killing of mr gandhi has stunned the nation mr gandhi , 46 , had hoped to emerge once again as prime minister , rebounding from his defeat in 1989 tamil militants suspected thousands of indians , standing in the pulsing heat , lined up today beneath tamarind trees and royal poinciana near teen murti house , where mr gandhi s coffin rested on a raised platform mr gandhi will be cremated on friday afternoon at the site where his mother , former prime minister indira gandhi , was cremated in november 1984 after she was shot to death by her sikh bodyguards the government s law minister , subramanian swamy , said that although there was no proof , leads on the assassination of mr gandhi pointed to a sri lankan militant group , the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , or tamil nation the group is fighting for independence in the north and east of sri lanka , an island republic off the indian coast dominated by its sinhalese majority indira gandhi supported the tamil call for independence , and her son followed suit at the beginning of his administration in 1984 , arming and training the rebels but in his last years in power , mr gandhi aggressively sought to crush the tamil rebels , who have used as a base the southern state of tamil nadu , where mr gandhi was slain on a campaign stop on tuesday in 1987 , mr gandhi sent indian soldiers to the island as peacekeepers , but they became embroiled in the civil war in a statement in london , a spokesman for the tamil militants denied any role in the assassination suicide mission the government said an official inquiry into the killing was under way the authorities now say a woman on a suicide mission , carrying a bomb wrapped in a waist belt , may have bowed down to touch mr gandhi s feet as a gesture of homage and in the process set the timer that triggered the bomb at least 18 people died in the explosion , including the woman , the authorities say the face of the woman believed to have set off the explosive was intact , the press trust of india reported , quoting home ministry officials the special investigating team is comparing her photograph with those of suspected militants , the officials added the decision by the congress party on wednesday to name mrs gandhi its president prompted speculation and even derisive comments that the party was seeking sympathy votes by exploiting mrs gandhi s name and widowed status there was more explicit commentary today than on wednesday , the day mr gandhi s body was returned to the capital ramakrishna hegde , vice president of the janata dal , a strong rival of the congress party , said today that the selection of mrs gandhi was a joke other candidates considered rajmohan gandhi , a grandson of mohandas k ghandi and a candidate for a parliamentary post as a member of janata dal , said in an interview the congress party very much wants to generate sympathy as a result of the assassination i did expect a great deal of support for mrs gandhi on the other hand , she was not born indian she is of an alien background frankly , said bhabani sen gupta , a wellknown political analyst , the majority of people did not like this idea they did not like the idea of being ruled by a foreign lady who knows very little about indian politics the decision by mrs gandhi has left the congress party , which has dominated indian politics since independence in 1947 , in disarray the party includes numerous powerful political figures , but it has been shaken by factionalism in large states , allegations of cronyism and corruption , and an inability to agree on how to deal with india s severe economic problems and religious tensions party officials say several prominent politicians are now being mentioned as candidates for president , a post that will probably be filled later in the week they include p v narasimha rao , a former cabinet minister and onetime chief

washington , jan 18 difficult as it is to imagine , the gyrations in oil prices that began even before the assault on iraq would probably have been even wider without a new rumorsquelching communications link between the government and the markets in the last week or so , for example , word circulated that terrorists had shut down a refinery in abu dhabi , that the saudi export terminal at ras tanura had burned , that an important pipeline had been hit and that tanker insurance for the persian gulf had become virtually unavailable none of the reports were true and all were officially knocked down with dispatch under the new system , energy secretary james d watkins has checked two dozen such rumors directly with the saudi petroleum ministry , saudi aramco or the american embassy in the case of the insurance rumor , the call went to lloyd s , the london insurance market then , with the story straight , the secretary or an aide informs the new york mercantile exchange , the main arena for oil trading , which will then circulate the information to members' display screens the commodity futures trading commission may also be informed
maastricht , the netherlands , dec 9 already committed to forming the world s largest trading bloc in 1993 , the 12nation european community took a major step toward economic unity today , agreeing to create a single currency and a regional central bank no later than 1999 britain , which has consistently tried to slow the community s moves toward greater economic and political union for fear of losing some of its sovereignty , refused to promise that it would one day give up the pound sterling but it made no effort to block its partners' decision with the british people still opposed to abandoning the pound , prime minister john major s delegation is expected tuesday to issue a separate statement reiterating its right to opt out of a singlecurrency arrangement and reasserting its position that any decision to participate in monetary union must be made by parliament in london the agreement is on but the practical effect of today s proceedings is that britain is going along with the community s decision the complex agreement on a new currency , thrashed out today by community finance ministers , is still subject to endorsement by european heads of state and government they are meeting for two days in this southern dutch city , seeking to accelerate processes of integration first set in motion 34 years ago european officials cautioned that acceptance of monetary union might still depend on progress in other areas but the agreement on a timetable for creation of a single currency and a central bank nonetheless lifted the mood here , after earlier signs that the summit meeting might be heading toward a deadlock major matters remain after the first day of negotiations , britain still stood in the way of agreement on ways to establish common policies on foreign , security , social , industrial and police issues there was even speculation that the talks might drag on into wednesday but mr major told his colleagues that significant success is within our grasp as a way of nudging mr major to make greater concessions tuesday , other governments signaled tonight that were ready to drop a planned reference to the community s federal character mr major had warned that he would sign no union treaty that mentioned it although germany insists that federal means decentralization and holds up the example of its own relationship with its regions , britain says that acceptance of the word implies endorsement of the idea that europe is headed toward a single government unlike britain , many nations here are eager to see the community adopt common foreign and security policies as a way of giving the prosperous economic bloc a greater political voice in world affairs they also favor strengthening the european parliament and harmonizing many domestic policies for one , chancellor helmut kohl of germany has demanded significant progress toward political unity if his government is to agree to abandon the strong german mark in favor of a new european currency whose name german officials said had not been decided first you have the baby , then you christen it , a german official said tonight the only european currency in existence now is a theoretical unit of account , the socalled ecu , or european currency unit , which does not exist in banknotes german officials said mr kohl viewed the package of proposed economic and political measures as a whole and was convinced that the movement toward a new currency was irreversible french officials , who led the campaign for a single currency , also saw as irreversible the decision to create the new monetary system before the end of the century for europeans as well as foreign visitors , the quick effect of a single currency will be that businessmen and tourists no longer need to line up outside exchange houses and pay handsome commissions to brokers every time they cross a border but from economic and financial points of view , the effect will be much greater trade within the single regional market of 340 million consumers to be formed in 1993 will in time be greatly assisted by the absence of exchangerate fluctuations and simplification of accounting procedures a sort of supermark \? further , since conditions for the creation of a single currency include convergences of inflation , interest and exchange rates , as well as budget deficits , the new currencty should automatically become one of the strongest in the world as strong , germany insists , as the mark indeed , the main reason that the single currency will not come into force immediately is that most governments need time to push their economies to meet the required standards at present , only france , luxembourg and denmark meet all the criteria under the broad agreement reached today , the community s first chance to create a single currency will come in 1997 but the economies of a majority of members 7 of 12 at present must meet the conditions for monetary union if there is to be such a critical mass , as it is known , the members of the community will have to approve the creation of a regional central bank , to be formed on jan 1 , 1997 , and the printing of a single currency some months later a successful vote on this will require twothirds of however many members the community might have at that time if those terms prove impossible for economic or political reasons , a second set of rules will go into effect to insure automatic creation of a single currency and central bank in 1999 by all countries that meet the criteria even if they number fewer than seven talk of discipline other countries would then adopt the currency once their economies were considered strong enough to handle the financial discipline required britain , though , would not be obliged to replace the pound without parliament s approval even if its economic performance permitted it to do so the threestage plan to create a single currency and central bank was first spelled out in 1989 by jacques delors , the president of the european commission , the community s daytoday administrative agency , as a way of maintaining momentum toward economic unity the first stage , which began in july 1990 , is to more closely coordinate economic policies the second stage , beginning in january 1994 , will include creation of a european monetary institute , a forerunner of the central bank , and require minimal exchangerate fluctuations the process of monetary union will then be completed either in 1997 or 1999 with the establishment of the single currency and the regional bank however , because some countries will not be ready and some new members may join the community in the 1990 s , a single currency may not be in place across europe until well into the 21st century none of this will become a certainty , though , unless major disagreements on social and political issues are ironed out on tuesday , the second and final day of the summit meeting this is how it always goes , a french official said of these meetings people fight the first day and get together at the end britain nonetheless remains divided from most of its partners by its reluctance to see the community , other governments , the european parliament , or the brusselsbased executive commission making decisions on its behalf in many contentious areas , it is therefore demanding unanimity before community policy is approved britain is also suspicious of moves led by france to build an independent european military capability photos prime minister john major of britain , right , at european community meeting with norman lamont , his chancellor of the exchequer \( reuters \) \( pg a1 \) french officials heralded what they called the irreversibility of the decision of the european community to create new currency by 1999 they said president francois mitterand s position was basically adopted mr mitterand , left , spoke with the finance minister , pierre beregovoy , at the meeting in maastricht , the netherlands \( associated press \) \( pg a20 \)
new york state has 13 times more cows than imprisoned criminals in florida , california , michigan and 12 other states , a larger proportion of the population is in state prison five states , california included , have a higher percentage of welfare recipients new york is less urbanized than connecticut , california or maryland and more american indians live in new york than in wyoming , colorado and indiana combined mention new york to most people , though , and cows are unlikely to come to mind first in fact , some people believe that if new york has more cows than imprisoned criminals it is only because so many criminals who ought to be in prison are roaming the streets instead preconceptions and the welter of comparative statistics on spending , taxes , the economy and crime that gov mario m cuomo marshals in rebuttal may be overshadowed by other variables , ranging from the state s fragile credit rating the third lowest to mr cuomo s appealing television presence but which stereotypes the state evokes instead may be pivotal to the governor s appeal in a presidential campaign nobody , not even mr cuomo , refers to goingson in his home state as the new york miracle but do outofstaters generally view new york as a nightmare , as vice president quayle suggests \? or , as mr cuomo maintains , as a microcosm of america , warts and all \? if the nightmare perception prevails , mr cuomo may be placed on the defensive and dismissed as part of a problem that is largely unique to the state of new york and to the city of the same name that has typically defined the state s reputation nobody wants their state to be like new york , said roger ailes , a republican media consultant if the governor persuasively argues that new york s social and economic problems are shared by most americans and that new york has done more than most states to resolve them , then he stands a better chance of shifting attention , and blame , to washington s domestic agenda it would be an excellent defense and a great offense , the governor said of the strategy he has already begun testing against the republican white house there is no way they can attack new york without admitting their own abject failure the cuomo administration flaunts the fact that only 10 inmates escaped from new york prisons last year far below the national average and that new york has the highest ratio of correction officers to inmates of any state with more than 40 , 000 inmates some analysts cite that very same ratio , though , as evidence that the state payroll is bloated pointing out , as the governor does , that new york has grown safer compared to the rest of the nation is also a reminder that the rest of the nation is becoming as unsafe as new york \( although the facts may get in the way of republican efforts to transform arthur shawcross , who murdered 10 women upstate following his parole in 1987 , into mr cuomo s willie horton \) the economic record , according to mr cuomo new york s incometax rate has declined from the nation s highest to 12th highest during his tenure the average growth rate of taxpayersupported spending has been lower than the national average more than twothirds of general fund spending is for local assistance spending on state operations grew slower than the inflation rate the number of employees paid from tax collections has declined state debt , swollen by the cost of road and prison construction , is still less per person than in eight other states federal debt , meanwhile , increased by virtually every measure rising , unlike new york s taxsupported debt , as a percentage of personal income , too the annotated record , largely according to cynthia green of the citizens budget commission yes , new york s incometax rate and state tax burden have declined , but what about the rise in local taxes caused in part by state welfare , medicaid and other mandates \? the effective incometax rate incometax revenue divided by total income is second only to oregon s , which has no sales tax yes , state revenue increases were half the national average , but they might have been higher without budget gimmicks whose record is it anyway \? republican legislative leaders share responsibility , ms green said , because their priorities varied but their proclivity to spend has not historically , new york has been emblematic of things that some other americans love to hate mr cuomo , himself , would set a political precedent as an italianamerican candidate \( his middle name was anglicized to matthew his first and last names are often mispronounced it is kwomo , not like the lake or the crooner , and mahreeoh , as in mark , not mary \) while many urban problems have become more ubiquitous , the state still ranks first in the proportion of violent crime , abortions , jewish residents , lawyers and other categories that have tended to distinguish it from the rest of the country , the south in particular i would never be running for the senate from mississippi , said geraldine a ferraro , who hopes , instead , to run for the senate from new york next year and who was the last new yorker on a national ticket , for vice president in 1984 none has been nominated for president since 1948 none has captured the presidency since 1932 not since then , when america was less urbanized but just as concerned about the economy , has domestic policy been so high on the nation s agenda
the streakbusters were at work again last night the phoenix suns , who this season have stopped a boston celtic winning streak at 7 games , a portland trail blazer run at 11 , a detroit piston streak at 13 and the los angeles lakers at 16 , ended the knicks' modest fivegame streak , winning by 107102 at madison square garden but phoenix got help from a combination of patrick ewing being in foul trouble and the fouls the knicks committed in the final period , which sealed a loss that dropped new york s record to 2732 after a strong first half , the knicks were able to build a 6860 advantage midway through the third quarter but by the time the quarter was over , the suns had regained the lead , 8280 much of that was because ewing was forced to leave the game with four fouls with 3 29 left until that point , he had dominated four different centers and scored 26 of his 36 points a brief tie the knicks never regained the lead again the best they could do was catch the suns , 9090 , midway in the final quarter on a 18foot jumper by john starks it was about that time that maurice cheeks fouled kevin johnson , sending the knicks over the foul limit in the fourth period , the knicks committed 11 fouls that sent the suns to the line for 16 free throws they made 13 , which was 1 more point than they accounted for via field goals in the quarter johnson finished with 29 points , 12 in final quarter and 6 from the free throw line when cheeks was unable to keep up with him key turnover with the suns ahead , 103100 , and 482 seconds remaining , the knicks committed a grievous turnover that sealed their fate gerald wilkins , racing down the court , lost the ball with 235 seconds left , brian quinnett , trying to inbound the ball , threw it away our execution was n't as good , said john macleod , the knicks' coach the motion offense was n't as good we went around in circles instead of setting picks then , speaking of coach cotton fitzsimmons s team , macleod added that club is very deep and talented they are legitimate contenders for the nba crown referring to the prospect of ending the knicks' streak , the suns' tom chambers , who had 32 points , observed , when you play 82 regularseason games , any incentive helps you get pumped up a worried coach despite the success the suns have had against streaking teams , fitzsimmons expressed concern before the game with the knicks' turnaround from bad to good why me \? he asked why did it have to happen to me why could n't we have been in here a month ago when the knicks were getting beat in the garden by every dog team in the league the suns beat the knicks , 11294 , last jan 26 those were the knicks who stood around and did n't move the ball they were also the knicks who failed to play defense and box out but those shortcomings were gone in the first half last night , and the knicks led most of the way in building a 5752 lead at halftime while the knicks continued to play defense and take care of the basketball , committing only six turnovers , 45 of their 57 points came from the starting front line of ewing , charles oakley and kiki vandewghe nothing helps the suns tried mark west , andrew lang and tom chambers against ewing but none could stop the knicks' center from piling up 21 points in the half , 9 in the opening quarter oakley was just as unstoppable he bettered his 109 season scoring average with an 11point first period in his matchup with xavier mcdaniel , oakley hit on his first four shots and was 5 for 7 at halftime with 14 points with the exception of ewing and oakley , the knicks did not shoot well vandeweghe , who scored 20 or more points in 7 of his last 11 games , had 7 points on 3for12 shooting while wilkins , who had scored 20 or more points in the last five games , had 8 points \( 3 for 9 \) mark jackson did not play for a third game in a row starks played ahead of him again , backing up cheeks , who got in early foul trouble in 30 minutes , the rookie guard had 8 points and 7 assists he had three steals in the last quarter and committed only one turnover photo trent tucker of the knicks , right , driving on xavier mcdaniel of the suns in the first half last night at the garden \( g paul burnett the new york times \)

from where coach bill fitch sits , which is on the bench of a pretty bad basketball team , the nets' drafting of kenny anderson looks as if it may have been a mistake that is what he said yesterday , when he was quick to add that he was n't in such a great mood and was therefore exercising his right to 2020 hindsight you have to think about all the things you could have done , fitch said after the nets finished a threehour workout at their practice site in north bergen , nj if i had known i was n't going to have the guy in camp , sure , anyone would say they wonder if they would 've made the same decision i'm human , too i'm sitting here after us getting routed in detroit , syracuse and ottawa we have n't had anything good happen in a few days he was talking about the nets' last three exhibition losses , all lopsided , to the pistons , the philadelphia 76ers and the milwaukee bucks after the 76ers beat up on the nets saturday night , charles barkley , as always , spared none of their feelings if we played them every night , barkley said , we 'd be 820 the nets' big picture , which is important to see , will eventually show anderson in a nets uniform , smoothly leading their fast break since there is still no contract , and with last week s optimism strangely disappearing , the chances that the nets will open their season saturday night in charlotte against the hornets , who have n't signed no 1 pick larry johnson , without the former georgia tech star appear greater than ever the nets' last offer , a fiveyear 1425 million contract , was rejected by anderson because it included a nonguaranteed 4 million payment in the fifth year even if he were to sign within the next few days , fitch said , anderson could expect to see nothing more than garbage time as the point guard for the foreseeable future the guys that have been here want to win , fitch said they 'd probably secondguess me if i put him in a tight game someone says to me , 'is he going to be as valuable to me now as he would 've been 30 days ago \? ' not now not this year high hopes that s the part eating away at fitch the nets , with or without anderson , are a long way from contending for anything , so what s the difference \? fitch , after 43 victories and 121 defeats in his first two seasons with the nets , said he cheerfully greeted the passing of summer last month he was looking forward to more than 26 victories now i'm sitting here without my firstround draft pick and my leading scorer from last season , he said he meant reggie theus , who took his 186 scoring average to europe after the nets decided they could use the room in their salary cap the hindsight picture fitch occasionally paints is a nets team with theus and another rookie in camp from the start it is no secret that fitch was not a strong proponent for drafting anderson he believed the nets could have gotten by with mookie blaylock , whom he cited yesterday as improved in all areas , as their point guard on the other hand , fitch s choice would have been billy owens , who appears even more alienated from his team , sacramento , than anderson is with the nets what s a coach to do but decry the system \? i still do n't plan to write a book as an expert about it , fitch said but i think it s something we should try to put a halt to
a quartercentury of bloodshed financed in large part by the united states , the soviet union , cuba and south africa preceded the handshake yesterday between jose eduardo dos santos , the president of angola , and jonas savimbi , the longtime leader of the angolan rebels and with memories of a generation of violence still vivid in the minds of angolans , the peace accord has laid to rest none of the questions about the country s future it is not at all clear from this what government will emerge , said michael clough , senior fellow for african studies at the council on foreign relations in new york if the people of angola had their way , they would probably vote out savimbi and dos santos both angola is one of africa s richest countries in natural resources , including huge reserves of oil and diamonds but that untapped wealth did little to ease the welter of ethnic , personal and ideological conflicts that fragmented both the struggle for independence which began in the 1960 s and was won from portugal in november 1975 and the nation after independence independence as byproduct even independence was won not so much as a product of successful rebellion but as the fallout of a coup d'etat in lisbon , which set portugal on a course toward democratic government and led to its hasty pullout from angola in 1975 in the months after independence , mr dos santos s party , the popular movement for the liberation of angola , or mpla , which had received most of its arms and money from the soviet union and its allies , moved swiftly against its two principal rebel rivals one guerrilla organization was destroyed the other , the national union for the total independence of angola , or unita , which was led by mr savimbi , retreated in disarray into the desolate southeast , despite the covert backing of south africa and the united states in 1976 , after the extent of american clandestine support for mr savimbi was exposed in press reports and congressional hearings , congress enacted the clark amendment , barring further assistance to unita only south africa , on the pretext of insuring security in neighboring namibia , which it controlled at the time , continued military actions against the angolan government soviet and cuban aid to the dos santos government remained at a high level american involvement deepens american involvement in angola deepened under president ronald reagan , who condoned cooperation with south african forces in 1985 , the clark amendment was repealed and the united states began supplying military aid to mr savimbi in the 1980 s , unita and the south africans made gains on the ground , only to lose them to counterattacking cuban troops , who had been invited into angola as a bulwark against south african forces stationed in namibia the war dragged on , although washington s appetite for underwriting unita weakened after several independent authorities , including human rights watch , a new yorkbased agency , documented ritualistic killings and policies of forced labor and conscription under mr savimbi ultimately , the inability of either side to win a decisive victory had as much to do with yesterday s ceasefire agreement as did namibia s independence from south africa settlement from exhaustion' what finally happened is that the mpla and unita just basically ran out of options , said mr clough it s a settlement from exhaustion the soviets were tired the us was tired the south africans are basically out the analysis is , 'nobody is going to pay us to keep fighting , so let s settle' last week , the final contingent of cuban troops left angola as part of the 1988 accord that assured independence for namibia despite washington s support for unita and its refusal to establish diplomatic relations with the government in luanda , the capital , angola remained washington s thirdlargest trading partner in subsaharan africa almost all of angola s crude oil is exported to the united states , making up about 90 percent of the country s revenues other untapped and potentially vast mineral reserves offer still greater potential for exploitation , including uranium and copper years of war have left angola s roads , railways and rural electrical sytem in shambles and while the country s economic potential remains considerable , its political future is still largely uncertain some analysts , however , are optimistic about the country s future , while at the same time hinting that yesterday s handshake in lisbon will not necessarily define angola s political shape in an article to be published next week in the center for strategic and international studies africa notes , sean mccormick , a specialist on angola , writes that the competition between the mpla and unita for support from the electorate over the next 15 to 18 months could be fractious , but the entry of new political forces into the fray suggests that the contest will be truly multiparty , rather than two party in nature
to the editor we in the south have been justly criticized in the past for our treatment of and disapproval of blacks who held liberal views and who did not agree to think as we did now i see some of our leading critics practicing what they once decried just because a man is black and holds a conservative philosophy they treat him as wrongly as any southerner ever treated a black who wanted to change things simply because his ideas differ from theirs they jump to accept a liberal s allegations of wrongdoing and immediately dismiss his rebuttal what is the difference between nasty old southern whites mistreating blacks and ruining lives , and white senators allowing the horrible pain and public humiliation of judge clarence thomas \? none this process would not have gone forward in a similar manner for a liberal candidate accused of the same misdeed , or for a woman candidate it is disgusting to watch our lawmakers not only allowing the process to get out of control but also encouraging it marcia mcrae statesboro , ga , oct 11 , 1991
moscow , jan 26 president mikhail s gorbachev today granted sweeping powers to the kgb and the police to search private business premises and confiscate documents to combat economic sabotage the presidential decree , which was published by tass , the official press agency , and read on the television news program tonight , also gave the security forces powers to demand any information from banks and credit institutions , and to freeze the assets of any business the decree was announced the day after the government declared that armed soldiers would join the police in patrolling major cities as of feb 1 , and four days after it ordered 50 and 100 ruble bills to be withdrawn from circulation restoring central control these measures , together with the bloody military crackdown in the baltic republics , amounted to a broad and powerful campaign to restore central control over the chaotic and disintegrating economy , society and nation after several years of experimentation with elements of free enterprise and democracy though none of the rights granted to cooperatives and joint ventures were specifically touched , the onetwothree punch culminating in tonight s extension of new powers to the kgb was certain to discourage fledgling moves toward free enterprise , both among soviet citizens and foreign investors many of the new cooperatives founded by soviet entrepreneurs were in fact covers for black market operations , which drew on scarce state supplies through illegal channels but even enterprises that sought to work within the law often found themselves compelled to improvise in the absence of clear guidelines or laws after four years , a chill given the late hour and the weekend , there was no immediate public reaction by businessmen but already the currency reform announced tuesday and the military patrols decreed friday have sent a chill through western businessmen and soviet entrepreneurs whose enterprises had developed in the four years that mr gorbachev had appeared to be moving toward a market economy at the same time the measures were likely to be favorably received by the population at large , which has become increasingly resentful of the soviet nouveau riche and has come to believe that the growing shortage of virtually every consumer product is caused in part by the foreign and domestic entrepreneurs the presidential decree said the crackdown was intended to facilitate the battle against economic sabotage and other crimes in the economic sphere , and to regularize the supply of the population with food products and other consumer goods the measure declared that the police and kgb had the power to enter and search the offices of any organization , except those of foreign diplomats , with or without the presence of the owners from there , the list of new powers seemed almost deliberately designed to intimidate any entrepreneur by seeking to leave nothing beyond the reach of the state the security forces were empowered to demand and receive from any enterprise , including joint ventures , corporations and organizations that include soviet and foreign legal persons and citizens , any documents relating to the matter under investigation the specific inclusion of businesses in which foreigners were involved seemed intended to warn the foreigners , since legally they would be covered by the decree in any case inventories can be checked the security forces were further empowered to check all inventories and to inspect for violations of all regulations they were granted the power to receive from banks and other financecredit enterprises the current and accounting information about the credit and monetary operations and foreign economic affairs carried out by enterprises , institutions and organizations , regardless of the forms of ownership the authorities were also given the right to freeze assets and documents tonight s measure was the latest in a quickening series of actions that have traced a sharp turn to the right by mr gorbachev in december , he ordered the kgb and the police to cooperate with worker vigilante committees he established to monitor the food industry and punish those involved in theft and speculation since october , he has replaced virtually all his liberal economic and political advisers with a new circle of tough hardliners these include the prime minister named this month , valentin s pavlov interior minister boris k pugo , a former kgb chief from latvia , and vice president gennadi i yanayev , a colorless party functionary the chief of the kgb , vladimir a kryuchkov , and the defense minister , dmitri t yazov , have also become considerably more prominent warning by shevardnadze before the latest series of decrees , the most dramatic evidence of mr gorbachev s new course was the resignation of foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on jan 20 , with a warning that the country was moving to dictatorship , and the bloody attacks by army and special forces in lithuania and latvia this month with mr gorbachev s evident approval western diplomats believe that mr gorbachev is probably guided by the belief that the situation in the soviet union has degenerated to the point that the priority must be the restoration of order and an end to the separatist momentum in various republics , most notably the russian republic under boris n yeltsin and the three small baltic republics the transcaucasus region has also been the scene of almost constant internecine bloodshed but some soviet and foreign commentators also speculate that the kgb , the military and the old communist party apparatus may also have prevailed over mr gorbachev by threatening action against his rule the president , however , has steadfastly insisted that his basic goals are intact in an unusual appearance last week , he told foreign and domestic press correspondents that the achievements of perestroika , democratization and glasnost were and remain eternal values , which presidential power will protect he declined , however , to answer any questions at the session
nueva germania , paraguay a century after its start as a germanic utopia , the former colony of nueva germania now languishes as the least german of all german settlements in paraguay paraguayans of latin and guarani indian stock long ago intermarried with most of the descendants of the german colonists who settled this place in 1887 , led by bernhard forster , a racist theorizer , and his wife , elisabeth forsternietzsche , sister of the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche spread out on the baking hot plains of paraguay s interior , the settlement s 500 families live in isolation seven hours by bus from asuncion , the nation s capital sixteen of the colony s houses have electricity , and there are 11 telephones none of the roads are paved , and the hospital is supported by a german charity on a recent afternoon , when a singleengine plane circled to land here , a man pedaled his bicycle down a red dirt road and shooed horses and cows from the town s seldomused airstrip an influential minority without being unfair to the people there , nueva germania ranks in last place in the range of german colonies in paraguay , said heinz schneppen , germany s ambassador to paraguay at least 100 , 000 paraguayans are of german descent and they are an influential minority in this nation of 4 million people for 35 years , from 1954 to 1989 , paraguay was ruled by gen alfredo stroessner , the son of a bavarian brewer and a paraguayan woman we are supporting 54 germanlanguage schools in paraguay , said the ambassador , who visited here last year there is not one any more in nueva germania it was n't always so 'paradise on earth' we have found the nearest thing to paradise on earth , elisabeth forsternietzsche wrote home to her brother of the budding republic but reality never matched the glowing notices that the colony s organizers sent back to germany on the road to bankruptcy , forster committed suicide in paraguay in 1889 but , in need of myths , the nazis airbrushed the pioneering experiment when elisabeth forsternietzsche died in germany in 1935 , hitler attended the service but to the handful of blond and blueeyed inhabitants here , race is not the deciding factor for success in the heart of south america emma laura zschage fischer , 98 years old , stood at her window and recounted the disappointment of her father , who came here from saxony they planted corn and manioc , but there was no way to sell it , she said , speaking a mixture of the only two languages she knows german and guarani , paraguay s indian language no way to get crops to market her son , hans , swatted gnats as he translated into spanish , and added that the boats were too big for the river here indeed , the colonization society had built boats in hamburg that were able to navigate across the atlantic , up the parana river and up the paraguay river but in the dry season , when temperatures rose over 100 degrees , the boats got stuck on the last leg , the aguaraymi river from the paraguay river to here was 11 hours on horseback through thick forest , feasible for the settlers , but not economical for taking harvested crops to distant markets my grandfather was a shoemaker we do n't really know why he came to a farming area , mr fischer said as a twomonthold foal nibbled grass beside his family s woodframe house indeed , many early settlers were new to farming the smallest group of the settlers were farmers , and that s why nueva germania did n't work out , said gerhard ratzlaff , a historian in asuncion who has studied the 37 german agricultural colonies formed in paraguay since 1881 german interest dwindles with disaffected settlers abandoning the colony , the survivors jettisoned first the founders' socialist ideals , and then their racist doctrine it was every man for himself , said mr fischer , who , like most german descendants , is married to a paraguayan with only 70 families of german origin left , german interest in the colony has sputtered i know germany only through magazines and pictures , said alberto kuck , administrator of the local lutheran school , recalling issues of bunte , stern and der spiegel that once circulated here west germany s foreign ministry stopped sending the magazines in the late 1960 s rare contact with outsiders a private german foreign aid group , bread for the world , supports the local hospital but it was only last october that nueva germania inaugurated its first lutheran church before that , services were conducted in private homes today , most residents' contact with

brussels , dec 19 with the formation of a new commonwealth of former soviet republics expected to be approved this weekend , the bush administration signaled today that it did not plan to rush into recognizing those new states immediately while administration officials say privately that recognition of the independent republics is inevitable over time , they are trying to use whatever time they have before granting such recognition for two purposes to encourage the republics to cooperate in forming the commonwealth as much as possible and to test whether they will live up to promises they made to secretary of state james a baker 3d last week to control or destroy their nuclear weapons on the commonwealth issue , american officials accompanying mr baker here for a north atlantic treaty organization meeting say the united states would prefer to withhold recognition for a few days or weeks , while the commonwealth is being negotiated , on the assumption that the key member republics will be more willing to engage in cooperative defense and economic arrangements if none of them comes into the negotiations with american recognition already in its pocket recognition is a factor in the development of the commonwealth , said a senior administration official i am not suggesting that recognition is something that we can string along for months but we can hold it up for days or weeks in order to make it easier for them to sort out common understandings among themselves the nuclear question as president bush told a white house news conference today when asked when he would recognize the newly independent republics and their commonwealth these people are elected , now they sit down with each other and sort it out they do n't need the united states to intervene in the internal affairs of a republic , or in relations between the republics themselves so it is just going to take a little bit of time on the nuclear question , the four soviet republics that have nuclear weapons aimed at the united states on their soil russia , ukraine , kazakhstan and byelorussia gave mr baker certain assurances last week regarding the safety , control and destruction of their nuclear weapons mr baker stressed at a news conference today that he believed the republics would live up to those commitments , although he had nothing in writing from them if they do adhere to their promises , mr baker said , ukraine , kazakhstan and byelorussia will all eventually become nuclearfree states , leaving russia as the only nucleararmed soviet republic to test their sincerity , and to avoid wasting any time in their getting a firm handle on their nuclear weapons , mr baker offered to send american nuclear experts to each republic in early january to begin helping them with control and elimination of nuclear weapons , in accordance with previously negotiated sovietamerican arms agreements all four republics agreed to accept those technicians to the extent possible , the administration would like to see each of the four republics engaging with the american technicians in january , before it grants formal recongition although that is not a stated precondition no 'exact date' certain steps have to be taken , particularly in this nuclear question , which is vital and where the united states is uniquely qualified to lead , said mr baker therefore , he said , the administration ca n't give you an exact date for recognition i feel a certain custodial responsibility on the whole question of nuclear weapons and nonproliferation , he said i think we have a disproportionate responsibility for that , so we want to see these questions resolved or well on the way to resolution before recognition is granted another factor that will undoubtedly drive administration decisionmaking on the recognition issue particularly if washington does drag it out for a while will be domestic and nato politics ukrainian americans , for instance , are already pressing the white house for recognition of an independent ukraine , while germany s foreign minister , hansdietrich genscher , told a nato news conference today that it would be wrong to leave a time delay on recongition , because it would cause uncertainty over the long term , once the inevitable recognition is granted , say american officials , the quality of relations between the united states and any former soviet republic as well as the extent of economic and humanitarian assistance will depend on the degree to which those republics engage in democratic , freemarket practices and adhere to the helsinki final act humanrights principles oral assurances detailed nevertheless , for now their behavior on nuclear questions is paramount and american officials are tying to gain as much leverage on that issue as possible by withholding recognition for a short time as one official traveling with mr baker put it obviously , we want to see the commitments that were made to us by the republic leaders on the nuclear question translated into action the importance of our sending teams of experts over right away is that it provides a practical mechanism for following up on the assurances we were given during his news conference today after the annual winter gathering of nato foreign ministers , mr baker for the first time laid out exactly what oral assurances he received from the leaders of the four republics that have longrange nuclear missiles he said we have asked that we be assured that those republics with nuclear weapons commit to maintain them in a safe , secure and responsible manner and under reliable control , with one single collective authority we were assured that would be the case dispute in kazakhstan mr baker said he requested that byelorussia , ukraine and kazakhstan agree to eliminate all the nuclear weapons on their soil eventually and leave russia as the sole inheritor of the soviet union s status as a nuclear power with respect to byelorussia , ukraine and kazakhstan , said mr baker , we asked that they would join the npt as nonnuclear states and that they would agree to full scope iaea safeguards , and each of them told us they would do this npt is the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and the iaea stands for the international atomic energy agency
london , july 20 through four days of high diplomatic drama , prime minister john major of britain played the unflappable , selfassured host to this week s london summit , a performance that added color to his profile as the gray man of british politics but with president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union and the other world leaders now gone , mr major and his advisers must confront a more difficult challenge transferring his new burnish on the international stage into the domestic political arena sometime over the next 12 months , mr major , a 48yearold former banker whose dark suits and gray ties are as plain as his language , must call a national election , and ask voters to support once more the conservative party , which has held power in britain for the last 12 years for many here , it will probably make very little difference at the ballot box that mr major handled himself with aplomb at summit news conferences , or that he won rave reviews from his fellow world leaders , or that he emerged as one of the key spokesmen on behalf of stronger global intervention to protect the environment rather , the key issue in the coming election will almost certainly be the sour state of the british economy , which remains mired in a recession though interest rates have dropped recently , unemployment has remained at high levels and has cut deeply into consumer spending still , mr major s cool performance has helped to give him new weight as a figure in his own right , and to move him beyond the long shadow cast by former prime minister margaret thatcher , his combative , largerthanlife predecessor we are not relying on it to make a surge in his popularity , a key aide to mr major said this week of mr major s profile during the summit but we are quite pleased with what we got out of it , and we think there are some mild positives , politically in an editorial thursday , the guardian , a leftleaning newspaper , gave mr major credit for demonstrating a sense of command at the summit and for not trying to hog the show , as , the newspaper suggested , mrs thatcher might have done none of this stuff , in the world of practical politics , matters much once the global circus has moved on , the paper said but , it added , mr major had proven that he may be gray , but he is not uninteresting among other things , mr major also used the summit to affirm the growing trust between britain and its european neighbors , in particular germany relations between bonn and london were badly strained in the thatcher era among other things , mrs thatcher was deeply suspicious of plans to integrate britain s economy with europe s , while mr major is willing to push it forward , on terms acceptable to britian only a month ago , allies of mrs thatcher in parliament were raising doubts about the leadership of mr major , even though he was mrs thatcher s personal choice to succeed her as party leader , after she was forced to resign last fall by a challenge in the conservative party mr major s critics say the party has been drifting under his leadership among other things , conservatives were badly beaten twice this year in special elections for parliament , and mr major appeared unable to decide when he should call a national election , as the economy seemed only to worsen but at a party rally thursday , mr major said he was now leaning toward an election next year , when he predicts the economy will begin to show signs of recovery and even some thatcher loyalists were giving him high marks for his summit performance meanwhile , recent polls suggest that the party s skid in public favor may be slowing while the conservatives are still running slightly behind the labor party , when voters are asked to choose between them , the margin makes the race almost too close to call robert m worcester , a political analyst and public opinion polltaker here , says mr major s showing at the summit did enchance his image of dignity and authority it ca n't do him anything but good , mr worcester said
dickens by peter ackroyd illustrated 1 , 195 pp new york harpercollins publishers 35 this new biography of dickens waddles along like a maudlin elephant that has attached itself to us against our will when it speaks , it is liable to say things like this there are certain people who seem doomed to buy certain houses the house expects them it waits for them or this can we not say that dickens captured the soul of the english people \? or this familial love can find an echo in our own hearts just as it did in that of charles dickens all in all , maybe not the voice we were hoping for , even if we were hoping for another life of dickens peter ackroyd is a novelist and biographer of considerable talent , but why he turned that talent in this direction is not clear of course , the dickens story is a great one the driven , uproarious genius caught in a psychic drama of misery and injustice he is also enjoying and exploiting but we have heard the story before , several dozen times over the years and even within the last decade to make matters more peculiar , mr ackroyd s is not exactly a dickens for the 90 s , at least not the 1990 s mr ackroyd lumbers along with no concern at all for 20thcentury modes of understanding the self poststructuralist suspicions have made no inroads , and even freud causes no alarm instead , he works in the old style and with the old tools , recalling the boozyfamiliar tone of g k chesterton at the turn of the century and the sturdy unsubtlety of john forster , dickens s first biographer as they say in the rocky horror picture show , let s do the time warp again ! sane people do not attend rocky horror or seek out time warps , and there would be little reason to tolerate this biography if it were no more than peculiar but , though it is maddening in its smugness , arises from a field of vision almost preposterously narrow , seems relentlessly selfabsorbed and is couched in prose that often slithers and simpers , the book still finds a way to insinuate its importance it does so , i think , not because it is itself peculiar but because it is so open to the peculiarity of its subject mr ackroyd s dickens demands our attention precisely \( and only \) because it is so open to the strange on one level , this openness manifests itself in mr ackroyd s willingness to let his own uncertainty out of the bag , admitting that for all the research he has done and it is massive he cannot hope to domesticate his subject , cannot properly understand him one senses , he says , the essential strangeness of the man , a strangeness that mr ackroyd allows to take center stage he never realised how strange a writer he was we find ourselves with such mysteries on our hands for several obvious reasons dickens was an unusually selfenclosed and secretive man much is lost in the way of information the intimate details that count are never recoverable mr ackroyd is open about that sort of thing , lamenting the fact that we cannot even guess at what has been so completely erased by time even when he has material with which to work , it is often dubious hearsay , gossip that he can only say rings true or has an air of authenticity about it it s all a bit like bram stoker s dracula , where the story is constructed with the aid of hardly one authentic document but mr ackroyd s own evocation of the bizarre produces more than bats by refusing to shoo away the strangeness in his subject or in his project , he provides for us a variety of possibilities for understanding that are engaging just because they remain uncontrolled , even unexplained his treatment of dickens s broken marriage is a fine example there he can only point again and again to what he does not understand about its basis and its collapse , blocking easy explanations but matters are never simple in any marriage , let alone that of dickens we are , of course , given a great deal of data , all that exist , one supposes but still we do not know , and that not knowing , paradoxically , keeps us from closing off the issue with easy judgments similarly with dickens s mother , whom dickens has traditionally been supposed to despise mr ackroyd suggests , gently , that one might just as well construe the evidence we have into a portrait of one who cared deeply for her son and attended to him with affection , providing the boy \( and man \) a part in a complex drama where he could play out , with great and painful satisfaction for himself , a script of guilt and rejection combined with a kind of hopeless love best of all , mr ackroyd presents us with the oddest explanation yet of dickens s strange and long alliance with the actress ellen ternan , suggesting that he idealized her as he did his wife s dead sister mary hogarth , brothersister friendships and a whole host of saintly virgins in his fiction and that it is therefore almost inconceivable that the two became sexually enwrapped he means it has become far too easy to think in terms of adultery , the terms presenting themselves to our common sense and common experience what we gain by allowing full oddity to dickens , in this matter and in others , is the capacity not simply to refigure the ellen ternan affair but to reach outside our own secure common conclusions and find again a strange uncertainty mr ackroyd s great achievement is that he reinvests dickens , that familiar figure of hearth and home , with an alien , slightly repellent mystery
quick , now what do these great writers have in common tolstoy , ibsen , proust , joyce , strindberg , hardy , colette , valery , malraux , nabokov and rilke \? the answer none was deemed worthy of a nobel prize in literature by the parochial swedish committee that doles out what is still alas ! the world s most prestigious literary award the most conspicuous of latterday nonlaureates was graham greene , by common consent the supreme fictional stylist in english until his death at 86 on wednesday the apparent reason for his nonrecognition was the opposition of a single swedish critic , reputedly hostile to roman catholicism , who reportedly said that only over his own dead body would a prize ever go to the catholic author mr greene pretended not to care very much the same defense was adopted by the argentine author jorge luis borges , who was passed over year after year despite his prodigious influence on younger hispanic writers mr borges liked to say i'm the latin american writer who never got the nobel prize those people in stockholm thought they 'd already given me one such consistent negligence by the prizegivers has not diminished the stature of mr greene or the other formidable figures repeatedly ignored by myopic swedish academicians but it does diminish the nobel prize , which too often is bestowed on obscure writers for inscrutable reasons when those denied the award cast so brilliant a light it is surely time for the stockholm committee to examine its own lusterless performance
gaithersburg , md , nov 13 in a strong indication that the government will act to end or sharply limit the sale of silicone gel breast implants , a food and drug administration panel voted overwhelmingly today to reject the safety data of the leading manufacturer , the dow corning wright company , and a second producer the panel said the data were not enough to prove that the implants were safe the panel voted after hearing a day of testimony from company experts about safety studies it had conducted on women who received the implants either for breast reconstruction after cancer surgery or to enlarge the breast for cosmetic reasons the hearing continued into the night as panel members heard evidence from the three other implant manufacturers panel to advise commissioner but dow corning wright had the most data , agency officials said they said it was unlikely that the panel would be more impressed by the other companies' data on thursday the panel is to vote on whether to advise the commissioner food and drugs to remove implants from the market the commissioner , dr david a kessler , is to make his decision by jan 6 one possibility would be to allow sale of the devices only for breast reconstruction after cancer surgery and not for cosmetic uses another possibility would be to allow their cosmetic use but only under sharp restrictions that would prevent a manufacturer from profiting from sales and require close monitoring of each woman receiving an implant dow , which produces nearly a third of the breast implants , manufactures two kinds of silicone gel implants the vote against data for both was 9 to 1 , as was the vote against data by the mentor corporation in voting to reject the data , the panel was not saying that the devices are unsafe but rather that the manufacturers had not provided the data the law requires to show they are safe enough to be approved for sale more than 2 million american women have had breast implants , 80 percent of them for cosmetic reasons about 150 , 000 women a year have surgery for breast implants , and the number has been increasing the most common side effect is the hardening of scar tissue around the implant dow said today that its data showed at least 12 percent to 15 percent of implants resulted in this problem critics of implants have linked them to autoimmune disorders and the obscuring of mammography xrays besides dow corning wright and mentor the other companies presenting data were the mcghan medical corporation and bioplasty not enough information earlier this year , bristolmyers squibb removed its polyurethanecoated breast implants from the market because of questions about the polyurethane coating in that company s model dr nir kossovsky , a nonvoting member of the panel from the university of california at los angeles medical center , said today what we are primarily concerned with is the longterm safety and effectiveness of breast implants in this application , i do n't believe there is sufficient information we do n't know how long they remain intact in the body we do n't know how frequently they rupture we do n't know what kind of degradation of the device takes place in the body he said there was also not enough information on the biological effects of the implants on the body for example , he said , it is not known whether implants might contribute to autoimmune diseases and it was uncertain whether they interfered with cancer detection , he said breast implant makers have been officially on notice since 1983 that they would be required to submit largescale studies of the safety and effectiveness of the implants the devices have been sold for 30 years , but until 1976 when a federal law required the drug agency to decide if all medical devices could be used , their marketing did not require government approval but dr robert r levier , technical director of dow s health care businesses , said it was not clear to the company just what studies should have been carried out until 1988 , when the fda put breast implants on the list of most stringently regulated medical devices and gave the companies a list of needed studies he said the company now recognized the need for more data and would work with the fda to carry out studies on the safety of the implants he said that the devices were safe and the data proved it , but that to assure confidence in them the company would be willing to undertake more research agency officials have said they believed that the devices were safe in general terms dr daniel mcgonigle , an agency official , testified today that none of the clinical investigations demonstrate that the devices are a health hazard he said the data did not portray a hazardous device posing a threat to the longterm user but , he said , the clinical data had limits today , dow presented data on about 900 women but the data were primarily reviews of their medical charts and did not deal specifically with cancer , autoimmune diseases or other side effects dr john b lynch , a professor from vanderbilt university medical center who is a nonvoting member of the panel , said the data needed to tell us about cancer or autoimmune diseases cannot be produced in the six months or one year that the company had to do it he said the data were vitally needed
in an era of hyperbole and hoopla , it is welcome to find a restaurant that lets its food speak for itself such is the case at brookfield bistro , a small storefront restaurant in brookfield everything about the place is understated upon arrival , you are greeted by lace cafe curtains on the front windows , knotty pine wainscoting around the dining area walls and a glass display case near the entrance \( full of desserts and quiches that may be ordered to take out \) at the rear of the small room are two blackboards one lists several beers and wines available by the glass , at 250 to 3 each the other lists the day s menu the simplicity is immediately apparent there is n't an inch of menu hyperbole dishes are described as loin of lamb with rosemary and mustard , chicken with sauteed shallots , and so on no verbal flourishes , no culinary poetry , just straightforward descriptions of what to expect this was as surprising as it was refreshing yet the food itself is anything but basic each plate looks inviting dishes are garnished prettily to whet the appetite the marriage of good fresh ingredients , knowledgeably prepared and served in graceful , not trencherman , portions sounds easy , but anyone who dines out often can attest that such an achievement is rare , and not nearly as simple as it sounds once we were seated , orders for drinks were taken promptly \( wine and beer only \) , and the waitress brought a small breadboard with two kinds of freshbaked bread and a small butter crock the bread was delicious , especially the herbed cheese bread flecked with scallions and dill there are few appetizers on the menu , but each sampled was satisfying country pate , in this instance a loosely textured mixture of chicken and pork in a terrinelike slice , was subtlely seasoned and totally successful , enhanced by slices of french bread served with it ravioli enveloped by an aromatic tomato basil sauce was especially winning also refreshing as a starter was the goat cheese and avocado salad , with small chunks of cheese , a few avocado slices , lightly dressed greens and fresh tomato slices tomato basil soup , while light and summery , needed more basil bite the house salad , a spring medley of greens and tomatoes embroidered with a light vinaigrette , was refreshing it and the other starters did what they were supposed to do tease and spark the appetite for the courses to come entrees scored equally high , though one must keep in mind that the menu changes every friday judging , though , by the high ratio of success , the choices should be just as appealing softshell crabs , sauteed with brown butter and a plethora of capers , added a welcome seasonal touch equally rewarding was pork with shiitake mushrooms two tenderloins , smothered with browned mushrooms in a luscious sauce , enhanced by veal stock and a suggestion of garlic sea scallops with lemon dill sauce were nicely browned and lemony in a gently herbed sauce grouper with sundried tomatoes our only disappointment was served in oddshaped , surprisingly tough chunks , with a minimum of sundried tomatoes dessert is a must at brookfield bistro like the other courses , it is served in ample , but not gourmand portions , just right for the normal appetite even a chocolaphobe among us extolled the flavor and feathery texture of the flourless chocolate cake , served with fresh whipped cream and a smidgeon of fresh raspberry puree every bit as good was the lemon raspberry tart , with a lemon filling topped with fresh berries , also with whipped cream and raspberry puree its crust and that of an apple tart was buttery perfection creme caramel was silky and satisfying as well prices are surprisingly moderate for the quality of the food served a threecourse dinner

there may be people who will remember this week because of a few movie awards , but you can be sure none of them were lunching in the grand ballroom of the waldorfastoria yesterday oscars may be fine for some folk , but what counts for this smiling new york crowd is a 24karat gold ladder encased in lucite the ladder represents election into the american advertising federation s advertising hall of fame , the highest tribute in the trade yesterday two agency founders and a former advertising columnist were inducted into the hall of fame they were carl j ally , founder of carl ally inc and former chairman of ally gargano , inc sam r bloom , founder of the bloom companies , and philip h dougherty , advertising columnist for the new york times for 22 years until his death in 1988 the advertising community turned out in full force to heap praise , crack jokes , relate stories and distance itself for a few happy moments from the doldrums of the industry mr ally , the only one of the three who is alive , was honored for his campaigns for pan am , federal express , piper aircraft and hertz when avis captured the popular imagination by saying that as the no 2 car rental company it had to try harder , mr ally counterpunched his campaign noted that hertz had a rival whose motto was that they tried harder probably because they ca n't talk about anything else ally gargano was noted for its battle on behalf of america s corporate underdogs and helping unknown companies like federal express and mci communications become household names mr ally was also credited for winning a change in the television networks' rules against mentioning the competition in commercials in 1971 , his campaign for fiat actually named the competitor s name volkswagen mr bloom , who died in 1983 , was remembered with a particular poignancy in these times when middleaged advertising executives suddenly find themselves jobless and badly need to be consoled with stories of people who started again in midlife after a successful 32year career in the newspaper business , mr bloom opened his own agency with three employees in dallas in 1952 when he was 48 today , known as bloom fca , the agency has annual billings approaching 200 million mr bloom believed firmly that advertising could change the way people looked at things he turned his efforts to promoting integration and developed campaigns for dallas , miami and memphis both president john f kennedy , who named him to the white house conference on equal employment , and president lyndon b johnson sought his advice during troubled times in their presidencies mr dougherty , known throughout the advertising community for his irreverence and wit , had a reputation for his lack of tolerance for pomposity john o'toole , president of the american association of advertising agencies , remembered that whenever he was interviewed by mr dougherty , i would find myself waiting with sweaty palms for his column , knowing that if i had been pretentious it would come out in a videotape filled with tributes from heads of agencies and other top advertising leaders , jerry della femina , the chairman and chief executive of della femina , mcnamee , said that mr dougherty would have made the greatest advertising writer if he had gone into advertising instead of newspapers he understood our business , he said

paris , dec 11 the longawaited autopsy report on robert maxwell , scheduled to be released this week , says the british publishing tycoon apparently did not die of drowning but probably suffered a heart attack , even though the autopsy found no evidence of such an attack , according to the forensic doctor who prepared the report dr carlos lopez de lamela said in a telephone interview today that the spanish autopsy team had found that mr maxwell had a chronic lung disease and a heart ailment , including severe narrowing of the arteries we are saying that he probably died of ischemic heart disease , said dr lopez , describing a condition in which not enough oxygenrich blood reaches the heart he said detailed studies performed in madrid had found no proof of a heart attack they had also produced no evidence of poison , alcohol or significant doses of medicines , he said the new report seems to deepen the mystery surrounding mr maxwell s death at sea on nov 5 because it does not identify the exact cause of death , it leaves open questions of whether mr maxwell accidentally fell overboard from his luxury yacht , the lady ghislaine , or whether he took his life by jumping off it we cannot confirm absolutely whether he was alive or dead when he fell into the sea , dr lopez said that is the most difficult point we say that we cannot rule out that he was alive when he reached the water but , dr lopez added , he did not have the classic signs of drowning in the frantic weeks before mr maxwell died , his global publishing empire was rapidly coming unraveled since then , the two big maxwell holding companies , which owe an estimated 336 billion , have sought bankruptcy court protection in britain and investigators say mr maxwell transferred more than 1 billion to his private companies from pension funds and two private companies controlled by the maxwell family even before it was issued , the autopsy has been under attack informed of its contents , dr bernard knight , president of the british association in forensic medicine , said there is still no objective evidence of what happened what we have here is a man with a heart disease and a lung disease found in the sea the fact that he has these diseases does not mean he died from them he added they ca n't prove he drowned they ca n't prove he did n't drown they ca n't prove a heart attack they ca n't prove there was n't a heart attack so they are assuming we would call this unascertained death the british are critical dr knight is one of several british pathologists who have criticized spanish forensic medicine as backward these pathologists have based their assessments on the condition of bodies that have been returned to britain from spain and the canary islands , which are visited by more than a million british tourists a year spain has the worst system of forensic medicine in europe , dr knight said in the interview today , dr lopez said he was a forensic doctor who did the maxwell autopsy with two other colleagues this was followed by prolonged tests at the institute for toxocology in madrid a final ruling about mr maxwell s death is expected this week from the investigating magistrate on the basis of a 100page police report and dr lopez s 45page autopsy report dr lopez said mr maxwell , who had half of his left lung removed more than 30 years ago , had extensive hardening of the lung tissues , which would have impaired his intake of oxygen he also suffered from a condition known as cor pulmonale , which he described as a weakening of the right side of the heart due to lung disease mr maxwell evidently knew about these conditions 'even more serious now' dr lopez said he had had access to results of checkups made in a hospital in nancy , france , and tests from 1982 , 1985 and 1988 showed that his oxygen intake was progressively diminishing it was well below average in 1988 , so it must have been even more serious now , he said yet the greatly overweight entrepreneur apparently followed no diet or regular treatment , and appeared to have been as impulsive and disorderly in caring for his health as he was in his business dealings family members told dr lopez that mr maxwell had no regular physician but saw different doctors in different places , he said he followed no single treatment or strategy , there seems to have been little medical discipline as serious perhaps , the three main arteries of the heart were partly obstructed by arterosclerosis or hardening of the arteries , dr lopez said in some sections , he said , the main arteries were between 60 and 70 percent clogged and one of the lesser arteries was even 95 percent closed but we think that the impaired functioning of his lung and heart were the most relevant , dr lopez said it is possible that he felt short of air , that he had pain around the heart we are saying that the cause is probably the heart , probably a heart attack we cannot call it a heart attack because he did not show any of the damaged tissue or classic lesions which can take up to two hours to develop he probably was not alive long enough to develop them contested interpretation dr knight , contested this interpretation you do n't need to find the lesions to speak of a heart attack , dr knight said two thirds of the people who die of coronary artery disease do not get positive , visible signs of a heart attack dr lopez also said the team did not find any classic signs of death by drowning he said there was no foam in the nose , mouth or lower air passages and no sign of waterlogged lungs there was only a small amount of fluid in the lungs , he said in response to this , dr knight said that drowning is one of the most difficult diagnoses in forensic medicine there is socalled dry lung drowning where you get no froth in the lungs or the air passages members and friends of the maxwell family have ruled out suicide as being out of character for the entrepreneur , despite the fact that his global business empire was in deep trouble dr lopez said he could not rule out suicide , but given the pathology , a natural death seems more logical dr lopez denied a report in the spanish newspaper el pais that he had found traces of an expectorant medicine in the body , presumbly taken by mr maxwell for decongestion the medicine he found , dr lopez said , was an antihistamine that is taken either for an allergy , nausea or seasickness if mr maxwell felt nauseous , an internist explained , this could either mean that he suffered seasickness or the nausea that often accompanies heart attack dr lopez also firmly denied published reports that a perforation of the skin had been found behind mr maxwell s ear , suggesting that the mark was made by a needle injecting a toxic substance there was no perforation behind the ear , dr lopez we found a small superficial scratch on the right ear there was another one on the forehead it could have happened during the rescue but they meant nothing asked whether the forensic team had any doubts about the identity of the body , he said none at all this was not our area , but the family identified the body there were known marks on the body , including the scar of an earlier operation and the blood group matched
jo jo in today s marketplace the concept of a winsome bistro that serves dynamically flavorful lowfat food at moderate prices seems a sure bet add to that formula jeangeorges vongerichten , the chef who left the fourstar lafayette to open this establishment , and it s no wonder the place resembles epcot center during spring break in four visits to the twomonthold jo jo , i had the impression that something seminal was happening jo jo is fueled by an ineluctable logic mr vongerichten serves food that looks and tastes great and is built on lowfat flavored oils rather than butter and cream this is cooking for the 90 s it may not be entirely guiltfree dining , but at least the sins , when committed , are venial the townhouse setting has a congenial parisian feel with its yellow walls , dark polished wainscoting , beveled mirrors and red banquettes with paperdraped tables the upstairs is less frenetic , especially the backroom parlor with its victorian couches and tables facing a tall fireplace jo jo s menu is limited to six appetizers and six main courses those who frequented lafayette during mr vongerichten s tenure there will recognize the style a crowdpleaser among appetizers is the mild , fresh goat cheese enveloped in thin ribbons of potato with mixed greens on the side and a puddle of tart arugula juice tuna tartar is glisteningly fresh and sandwiched between potato gaufrettes \( freshly made latticed potato chips \) with aromatic chive oil the undisputed winner at my table was perfectly cooked shrimp in a wonderfully complex carrot juice bolstered with shrimp stock and lime leaves from thailand a sweet sensation of carrot hits the tip of the tongue first , followed by a fusillade of peppers , then finally the cleansing lime a newwave ravioli is constructed with two unattached sheets of pasta enclosing wellseasoned and moist minced rabbit , all ringed by ripe tomato oil jo jo has a wellconsidered wine list with some uncommon french labels that go especially well with this challenging food prices are inexpensive across the board mr vongerichten has assembled a sharp young service team he even recruited his brother , philippe , from strasbourg , france the staff has to hustle to stay ahead of the crowd pouring in , and somehow things run smoothly main courses are characterized by the same deftness with seasonings cod is sauteed until golden brown and garnished with minced vegetables and capers a sauce combining soy , sherry vinegar and homemade ketchup adds a sharp edge herbspeckled polenta on the side , though , needed salt on a second visit , the polenta tasted of harsh raw herbs salmon is cooked to perfection in rice paper and served under a brittle lid of potatoes salmon caviar contributes salinity while a citrus sauce with pink peppercorns adds zest roasted chicken is sublime , with accents of ginger , black olives and coriander a side dish of chickpea fries is more dense than potatoes and tasty lamb chops are equally good , the succulent baby chops served alongside rich confit of lamb shoulder basil oil is a vernal match , as are delicate eggplant pancakes garnetcolored slices of duck breast are exceptionally tender in their heady sauce of truffle juice the bird s gizzards and leg meat are stuffed into phyllo packets and served on the side on a recent sultry evening , watermelon and cantaloupe sorbets , each in the shape of its fruit , were irresistible ripe strawberries in strawberry cream between layers of wafer cookies are equally delightful , as is a cold soup of blueberries , strawberries and cherries topped with a dollop of frozen creme fraiche finally there is an awesome chocolate cake that oozes lavalike warm chocolate mousse with each forkful so much for venial sins jo jo is indeed breaking new ground in its unassuming way perhaps not since le bernardin opened new yorkers' eyes to new ways of preparing seafood has a restaurant had so much potential impact beyond its doors mr vongerichten is not aiming to create a grand , allencompassing fourstar establishment he simply wants to serve his style of food in a casual setting , and at sane prices in only eight weeks , he has succeeded splendidly restaurant raphael restaurant raphael is a lowkey french establishment in the heart of midtown manhattan that has been quietly catering to its conservative clientele for nearly 14 years its inconspicuousness adds to its romantic allure , for chances are slim that you will run into chatty acquaintances , chummy coworkers , or former spouses as for the food , it could be described as attractively executed , middleoftheroad bistro fare again , subtle and undistracting the stepdown dining room has a pretty little bar in front , pale yellow walls alternating with pastoral murals of france , stenciled ceiling beams and a fireplace adorned with a splendid painting of wildflowers in the back is an inviting little trellised garden that is open in warm weather summery starters on the

washington , may 27 federal health officials are looking into whether there were unnecessary delays in searching for recipients of organs and tissues from the body of a virginia man apparently infected with the aids virus in 1985 , doctors at the medical college of virginia gave four people organs from the dead man his heart , liver and both kidneys the liver recipient died almost immediately from complications of surgery the three others were infected with the aids virus when they died the question is should the hospital have told state officials that these three were infected and should it have been suspicious sooner that the cases were related to the transplanted organs \? besides the organ recipients , about 50 patients received tissue from the man at least three tissue recipients are known to be infected with the aids virus it is not yet known whether they could have avoided the virus because investigators are still trying to determine if the tissues were transplanted before the organ recipients were found to be infected doctors say it is important for people to know as early as possible if they are infected so they can be monitored in case they need drug treatment to delay the onset of symptoms questions on notification food and drug administration officials said last week that they are trying to determine whether a more effective , faster notification system will be needed to prevent future episodes the questions are valid , and we do n't have an answer , said jeff nesbitt , a spokesman for the food and drug administration the organ donor died in 1985 , after he was shot in the head there were no signs of the aids virus in his blood , which was tested in two laboratories , officials say , possibly because he had been infected shortly before he was shot and his body had not yet developed the antibodies that aids tests detect there was no way to prevent infection among the organ recipients other tissues , like bone marrow , skin or connective tissue are processed in different ways , some of which seem to kill the aids virus no infections have been detected among recipients of tissue processed in these ways mr nesbitt said the potential for transmission from donors is a significant public health problem , because tens of thousands of people receive organ or tissue transplants each year but newer tests make it more likely that aids infections in donors will be spotted the same tests are also used with donated blood the government is also looking into the need for legislation and guidelines for the organ and tissue industry bill anderson , the chief executive officer of lifenet transplant services in virginia beach , the company that processed the tissues in this case , said his organization was voluntarily cooperating with the food and drug administration we 'd like to have known about the problem much sooner , and we do n't know why we did n't , mr anderson said in an interview last week mr nesbitt said that if the virginia episode had come to attention earlier , a mechanism might now be in place to set off immediate notification in future cases spokesmen for the medical college of viginia said that they did not want to discuss the case until the inquiry was completed further , they said , federal officials had asked them not to talk about it mr nesbitt said the fda had not asked the medical college to refrain from discussing the cases the heart and kidney recipients were known to be infected with the aids virus by the time of their deaths and presumably the infections resulted from the transplants , mr nesbitt said , although they probably also received blood transfusions dr martin cader , an official of the virginia state health department , said none of the three cases were reported to his office if the deaths were not determined to be caused by aids , notification would not have been required asked last week , the medical college would not disclose the causes of death the three organ recipients might not have been reported as aids cases because , at that time , the official definition of an aids case excluded patients who had a known cause of immunosuppression , like medical treatment to prevent organ rejection experts said that although it was known that the donor had tested negative , they wondered why doctors at a research institution like the medical college of virginia still did not become suspicious about the puzzling aids infections

the sara lee corporation said yesterday that it had sold its european antacid and pain reliever business to roche holding , the swiss pharmaceutical giant , for 821 million , a rich price that surprised some analysts the buyer , formerly f hoffmanla roche company , the world s 12thlargest drug company , is based in basel , switzerland the businesses sara lee sold , known as the nicholas nonprescription line , involve several european and australian cough , stomach and headache remedies , the largest of which are rennie , an antacid , and aspro , a pain reliever the high price illustrates the premium that branded products can command in the newly integrating markets of europe established profit makers heavily advertised overthecounter drugs , like the lines roche is purchasing , are attractive because they carry 30 to 50 percent profit margins they are also established brand names whose wide market recognition are difficult to match by competitors' new brands without even costlier advertising spending moreover , nonprescription products contain active ingredients , like phenylpropanolamine in decongestants and appetite suppressants , that are already cleared by many of the world s regulatory agencies and thus require little further research and development spending prescription pharmaceuticals , one of roche s principal businesses , carry even higher profit margins than overthecounter drugs , but they require heavy research and development spending and could meet regulatory delays leader in smaller countries none of the nicholas products is a best seller throughout europe , although they lead markets in smaller countries , like the netherlands and belgium i'm a little perplexed by roche s willingness to pay so much , said david h talbot , a pharmaceutical analyst at arnhold s bleichroeder inc but samuel d isaly , a principal with mehta and isaly , a pharmaceutical investment concern , said that the high purchase price , about 41 times annual sales of 200 million , implied a premium for high profits he estimated that nicholas earned as much as 40 million , meaning that roche was paying about 20 times earnings by contrast , a joint venture of johnson johnson and merck company paid 36 times sales in 1989 for the american drug businesses of imperial chemical industries plc of london much of that 450 million purchase was for mylanta antacid , one of the bestknown stomach remedies moderately large drug businesses , like nicholas , rarely come on the market in europe , said john h bryan , the chairman and chief executive of sara lee , which is based in chicago almost never , in fact , he added four months of negotiations more than a dozen large pharmaceutical companies had made serious inquiries about nicholas products sara lee s negotiations with roche lasted four months if we had had only one company looking it over , mr bryan said , we would n't have gotten such a nice price eric j larson , an analyst who follows sara lee for first boston , said sara lee had to either get bigger in europe and spend a lot of money on expansion or else sell the business proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down part of sara lee s 25 billion debt , as well as for other corporate purposes , presumably including future acquisitions for sara lee , which posted about 116 billion in sales in the 1990 fiscal year , the nicholas businesses represented less than 2 percent of annual sales that are concentrated mainly in such brand names as hanes underwear and panty hose , jimmy dean sausage , kiwi shoe polish , as well as sara lee cakes and pastries for roche , however , the nicholas product lines will add substantially to its pharmaceutical business , which makes up half of its 65 billion in annual revenue because of the difference in time zones , officials at roche could not be reached for comment in basel sara lee s stock dropped 1125 , to 3925 a share , yesterday on the new york stock exchange , but analysts said the fall was unrelated to the roche deal mr larson of first boston attributed the drop in the stock of many food companies , like sara lee , to profit taking
maureen weiner , a 9yearold fourth grader in new york , has seen the addams family twice with her pals on her recommendation , maureen s 13yearold sister , jenny , took their parents they all liked it that is a movie studio s dream a film that appeals to both children and parents and keeps some youngsters going back paramount pictures is reaping the benefits of such a hit the addams family , a spoof based on the charles addams cartoons , has taken in about 73 million at the box office since it was released just a month ago but while hollywood may be trying to control its production costs , even a hit like the addams family requires a huge advertising and marketing budget to keep it in the public consciousness in an era where the battle for the leisuretime dollar is more intense than ever following a recent trend , the promotional strategy depended heavily on television advertising industry experts estimate the studio will spend 15 million or so to market the film in the united states alone there are no public figures for advertising and promotional costs of individual films , but experts say that 15 million for a successful film , given how long the campaign must go on , is not unreasonable the addams family has been a hit from day one the weekend of nov 22 , when it opened , with 2 , 400 prints in release , the film took in 242 million at the box office it was the biggest fall opening ever , superseding home alone , which opened in the comparable weekend of 1990 and did 17 million at the box office it clearly has what hollywood calls legs , or the staying power that will let it outlast its competition for instance , sony entertainment s hook took in 142 million the first weekend , when it opened at about 2 , 100 screens , trailing the addams family by a significant amount even on its fourth weekend , the addams family held up , bringing in at least 48 million at the box office the competition has never been more intense , said barry london , paramount s president of worldwide marketing you have to make sure your message is received in a manner that motivates people to see the movie the marketing process began last may with a trailer that accompanied other paramount releases the short showed a woman on the screen staring out at someone and screaming , mr london said the camera then cuts to what she is seeing , and it is the addams family in the audience a second trailer , introduced in july , was more descriptive of the movie itself and the kind of humor the addams family possessed a cable spot ran in september , and the network television campaign began in november the addams family is what the industry calls a crossover film , one that both adults and children can enjoy , so paramount wanted to reach as broad a market as possible , using network television as well as newspaper and cable television advertising mr london said the film was advertised on shows like cheers , whose viewing audience is mostly 18 to 34yearolds , and who s the boss , which is watched mainly by 12 to 24yearolds paramount also did a major campaign on mtv music television that campaign was helped by a song based on the movie , by m c hammer , that was played frequently on mtv in addition , word of mouth on the addams family has been very good paramount had other marketing advantages because the television series , although it was only on network television for two years in the mid 1960 s , remained popular in syndication and of course , the cartoon characters are well known the studio , however , bought the film from orion pictures when orion was having severe financial problems we paid about 21 million for the rights and another 9 million to finish the film , mr london recalled that means its investment , with marketing , is about 45 million , and it is already close to breaking even , since it will keep roughly half the boxoffice gross in all , it looks as though paramount will make a great deal of money on the movie but paramount did not get the rights until march by then a host of advertising and marketing opportunities were already past the annual toy fair , for instance , takes place in february , and there is a yearanda half lead time for new properties the window of opportunity was behind us , mr london said otherwise , we would have attempted something the odds are nevertheless good that the film will hold up because the only films still to open this christmas season are jfk , prince of tides and father of the bride , none of which are likely to erode young audiences strikingly
if a modelt ford were to roll up to the starting line side by fender with today s technologically complex racing machines , it would be greeted by querulous looks someone would surely suggest that it was nothing more than a publicity prank and if anyone hoped to win a chess game by trotting out the exchange variation of the french defense , just as many eyebrows would be raised yet in the second round of the interpolis international tournament in tilburg , the netherlands , this very same obsolete array was put on the board by none other than the world champion himself , gary kasparov of the soviet union it s anybody s guess what the most harddriving attacking player of our time had in mind in choosing such a sterile , symmetrical method there is a false clue in that his opponent was viktor korchnoi , a former challenger for the world title who now makes his home in switzerland korchnoi is an aggressive counterattacker who needs no provocation to create an interesting battle that could mean that kasparov was dabbling in the psychological ploy of luring the opponent to overextend himself but the clue does not hold up when one learns that kasparov tried to defeat nigel short the identical way in round 6 he got only a draw the second time perhaps kasparov s motive was purely that of aiming for novelty anyway , it s not something he can expect to get much mileage out of here is how he won from korchnoi on oct 18 the exchange 3 ed ed gives away white s spatial superiority , lets the c8 bishop develop and produces a symmetrical position best fitted for a dull draw but korchnoi could not resist livening things up by 5 c5 to avoid getting an isolated pawn by a timely dc , korchnoi thrust 6 c4 , but , as kasparov would show , the d5 pawn is immobile , cannot be protected by another pawn and can come under fire from white pieces on 14 b3 , the consequence of 14 cb would be that white might be able to regroup and achieve the central advance c4 on the other hand , after 14 b5 15 bc bc , kasparov obtained the option of playing his rooks to either the b or e open files though korchnoi appeared to have unobstructed activity for his pieces , it was difficult for him to form a plan to provide a permanent defense for his d5 pawn kasparov did not mind giving back one of his bishops with 20 bf6 bf6 , the point being that the black king knight was defending the d5 pawn , whereas the black bishop could not take over that function korchnoi was probably looking ahead to his 25 bg5 , hoping that this would prevent the white knight from ever reaching the key e3 square on 29 re5 , shooing the rook away with 29 bf6 would allow an attack on the black king with 30 rh5 , but of course 29 f6 also represented a weakening of the king position kasparov s 34 f4 ! forced 34 gf 35 qf3 rd6 , after which he arranged to win a pawn with 36 re5 ! after 38 qd5 , korchnoi could have put up considerable resistance in the endgame arising from 38 qd5 39 bd5 bc1 ! 40 bc4 bb2 41 be6 bc3 42 d5 f5 instead , he erred with 38 qa4 \? and allowed kasparov to bore in with 39 qb7 kg6 40 bc6 ! , which quickly drove the black king into a mating net after 45 qg2 , korchnoi gave up just in time to avoid 45 kg4 46 qe2 kh3 47 qh5 mate french defense white black kasp'ov korchnoi 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ed ed 4 nf3 nf6 5 bd3 c5 6 oo c4 7 re1 be7 8 bf1 oo 9 bg5 bg4 10 h3 bf3 11 qf3 nc6 12 c3 qd7 13 nd2 rae8 14 b3 b5 15 bc bc 16 rab1 bd8 17 h4 re1 18 re1 re8 19 rb1 h6 20 bf6 bf6 21 g3 ne7 22 qd1 g5 23 hg hg 24 bg2 g4 25 nf1 bg5 26 rb2 kg7 27 qb1 rc8 28 re2 rc6 29 re5 f6 30 re2 rb6 31 qd1 nf5 32 re1 nh6 33 qe2 kf7 34 f4 gf 35 qf3 rd6 36 re5 kg7 37 rd5 rd5 38 qd5 qa4 39 qb7 kg6 40 bc6 qa5 41 be8 kf5 42 qh7 kg4 43 qe4 kh3 44 bd7 f5 45 qg2 resigns diagram
prized possessions by avery corman 320 pp new york simon schuster uppermiddleclass manhattanites at least as they are portrayed in avery corman s novel of date rape and its consequences , prized possessions are a curious lot they seem to have a catalogue out of which they order everything from their couches to their destinies they are relentless in their quest to extract the best out of manhattan living the best italian restaurant , the best sale on linens , the best children s mattresses they suffer agonies when they apply to admit their 5yearolds to prestigious private schools and continue to suffer until the children are safely admitted to ivy league colleges remorseless in pursuit of success , they groom themselves and their children unceasingly they are often , in the words of mr corman a very knowing writer whose other novels include kramer vs kramer and 50 on the cutting edge of parental overcontrol one of their children has taken so many afterschool 'enrichment' programs that the child was nearly burned out at nine what these people want is perfection , which , in their terms , is defined as an unbroken chain of successes \( in the world of prized possessions , success is oddly but persistently linked to media attention the masons believe that they have got their daughter , elizabeth , into chase academy because their apartment was featured in an article in new york magazine as ben s fortunes soar , so does the publicity he receives , until the ultimate tribute is his mention in the new york times the magazine that laura publishes , second home , succeeds because so many people want to be profiled in it \) failure , when it enters their lives , is promptly converted into success when laura mason loses her job at the magazine she helped build , she immediately starts her own magazine , which prospers her husband , a collector and retailer of folk art , never encounters failure at all but goes from success to success real failure does not touch them mr corman s privileged manhattanites are reminiscent of a character in greta garbo s first american film , the torrent , who exclaims , thank god for tragedy ! it gives us an opportunity to succeed ! the masons are , of course , ripe for disaster , and they find it when elizabeth , a bright , vivacious music major who gives sparkling performances , enrolls at the small , prestigious layton college and , during freshman orientation , is raped by a senior , jimmy andrews , a star of the college tennis team for the first time , ben begins to question the assumptions that have governed his life he begins to recite this refrain this is the affluence that bought the lifestyle that needed the private school that fed into the college that led to the rape of my daughter if prized possessions had continued exploring the connections among an affluent life style , family values and the character of the children raised in such homes if it had become the novel of manners , means and morals it promised to be it would have been a far more interesting book than the hotissue , very flawed consciousnessraising effort we have here indeed , prized possessions does n't portray its characters in any depth , and inevitably this limits the reader s ability to sympathize with them , much less understand them we never know , for instance , how two highly materialistic , socialclimbing parents like the masons have succeeded in raising an admirable child like elizabeth we do not know how jimmy andrews s parents could have raised a son who would rape elizabeth did his parents , two unhappily wedded wasp s , fail to instill moral values in him because they have none of their own \? were their own values destroyed because his mother married beneath her social class \( as mr corman seems to imply \) \? we know that ben mason has a nervous breakdown after learning of his daughter s rape , but we do n't know whether he changes as a result of his experiences in fact it is not too much to say that no character has a thought that is not filmable we are simply not privy to the inner lives of these characters this will have serious consequences later , when mr corman asks us to understand the decision elizabeth makes about the fate of her attacker elizabeth , inexperienced and trusting , seems initially a prototypical victim of such a crime a classic case of acquaintance rape in all its ambiguity , as one character puts it at first she suffers in silence \( literally , since in her grief and humiliation she gives up singing \) , but then , with the help of her friends and counseling from the head of the women s center , she comes to understand that she is a victim of a crime for which she is not responsible she stops accusing herself and instead accuses jimmy andrews in her pursuit of justice , in her desire to see him punished for his crime , she brings jimmy before the college grievance board here she is defeated by the usual obstacles insufficient evidence and the college s unwillingness to admit that such a crime could occur on their perfect campus in spite of her lawyer s argument that she is the eyewitness to the crime , the case is dismissed
mielec , poland poland s passion for democracy has cooled considerably in the two years since this nation triumphantly voted the communists out of office recent publicopinion surveys indicate that less than 50 percent of poles will vote on oct 27 in the country s first fully free parliamentary elections , mirroring the trend toward political apathy in other eastern european nations turnouts of 20 percent or less are being forecast for younger voters national political parties have failed to gain any discernible momentum , and the polls are predicting that none of the nearly 100 parties on the ballots will come close to achieving a majority in the new legislature , which would mean that whatever government is eventually formed would have to be a coalition , most likely one that is delicate , volatile , and hard to maintain one recent poll reflecting the mood of prevailing cynicism found that only 4 percent of voters between 18 and 24 years old acknowledged watching any of the nightly television programs devoted to parliamentary candidates pivotal elections despite that apparent lack of interest , the elections are highly significant and pivotal they will offer poles their first chance to choose an entire parliament with no seats set aside for people who had first been elected under communist rule moreover , the coalition that emerges will have to face major and potentially painful or even disruptive decisions about how to privatize poland s staterun industries or whether to revise the country s pioneering program for economic change given those looming issues , mielec , a town of 60 , 000 in eastern poland , is the kind of place that political scientists might easily have chosen to watch democracy in action the main employer , a giant staterun aircraft factory , is insolvent , and has already cut its 19 , 000person workforce by more than 6 , 000 , with an additional 5 , 000 facing dismissal next month the abstruse debates in warsaw about whether the government should bail out flagging industries are hardly theoretical in places like that , where they cut close to the bone loss of job and faith but there were few who were ready to declare themselves as prospective voters , angry or otherwise , in the cavernous downtown auditorium to which krzysztof kozlowski brought his reelection campaign on a recent saturday night mr kozlowski , a former cabinet minister in the government that introduced the politically unpopular economic reforms , showed little surprise , and said later that he has frequently encountered such apathy in the campaign a man who loses his job also loses his faith , especially in candidates for parliament , he said people have stopped believing in democratic mechanisms that s a great danger to democracy this campaign is weak because people do n't believe that it s going to result in anything good for them people are waiting for a miracle worker , a strong man a few miles away , at the aircraft factory , the gates were draped with a handlettered banner proclaiming an occupation strike that is a recent innovation by the polish labor movement in which union leaders at failing companies set up housekeeping in a nonessential building while coworkers continue production on this evening , the solidarity leaders slouched around a color television in a conference room , watching a latenight movie workers here say they are at the mercy of economic forces far more powerful than their elected legislature the aircraft industry , for example , has been crippled by the collapse of trade with the soviet union and the end of the cold war soviet and military cuts until 1989 , this company s best customers were soviet civil aviation and the polish army the soviets have caused a major part of the problem in mielec by failing to pay for several hundred million dollars in aircraft delivered earlier this year and the polish army has cut procurement to the barest possible minimum , leaving mielec scrambling for contracts in the third world jan drozdz , a member of the union s negotiating team , said he saw little reason for factory workers to attend electoral meetings just as it was in the communist years , the company s fate is the hands of ministries in warsaw most likely , the turnout in the elections will be very weak , mr drozdz said the anger here is very high this town lives for this factory it s the only one we have the confusing array of parties also appears to have dampened voters' enthusiasm in addition to the political parties emerging from the solidarity movement , poles will able to chose among candidates from the beer lovers' party , ecological party , christian action , christian democrats , communists and peasants , german minority doubts on stable coalitions aside from a general attack on the economic program , the campaign has had virtually no issues , and senior strategists said their main goal was to get voters to remember their party s name a recent national publicopinion survey found democratic union , the centerleft remnants of solidarity , running first with 23 percent , the solidarity trade union second with 19 percent , and the centeralliance , the rightcenter remainder of solidarity , in third with 9 percent if those percentages hold on election day , the formation of the next government would be tricky , since the center alliance appears to oppose a coalition with the democratic union , while solidarity s leaders have said they do not want to formally join any government with these rules and this electorate , it s very unlikely we are going to be able to come up with a parliament that could create stable one or twoparty coalitions , said jan olszewski of the center alliance party of former solidarity members we are in very serious danger of fragmentation photo surveys indicate that less than 50 percent of poles will vote later this month in the country s first fully free parliamentary elections

tudors , stuarts , hanoverians and a saxecoburg , followed by saxecoburgsturnedwindsors in a rare show of solidarity , the kings and queens of england are giving audience together at the yale center for british art it is an incomplete lineup , with the houses of normandy , plantagenet , lancaster and york missing , and only a passing mention of the first tudor , henry vii but then this is an exhibition about royal patronage of art and there was not much of that until after england had joined the rush for colonies and virtually none at all during the puritan hiatus hence the show s title crown pictorial setting the scene is a painting attributed to lucas de heere that establishes the arriviste tudors as royalty a canvas remarkable for the freshness of its colors , particularly red , it features henry viii seated on a canopied throne in a room open to the air he is flanked by the three children it took so many wives to get this tudor had his share of treasures , mostly from italy , and retained holbein the younger as court painter but the eye is drawn to the work of art that is his daughter , elizabeth , the good protestant queen who was reigning when the picture was done all but obscuring her young halfbrother , edward vi , she stands wearing a crown and a dress encrusted with jewels , and she is accompanied by personifications of peace and plenty more soberly attired is bloody mary , elizabeth s half sister , who stands opposite with her husband , philip ii of spain , representing the twin dreads of catholicism and foreign intervention , and attended by a diminutive mars the england that had been joined with france in norman and plantagenet times is now an entity unto itself and ready to go elizabeth is the subject of numerous portraits , not a few of them anonymous , like the one in this display that shows her , again , in full fig the pearls in her headdress , the exhibition label says , cost a penny apiece in the late 1550 s , which may reflect the success of the english buccaneers native miniaturists like nicholas hilliard and isaac oliver flourished during the elizabethan and jacobean eras , but apart from william dobson , the painters of fullscale likenesses were expatriates , usually from the low countries or german states anthony van dyck and sir peter lely were the most prominent of these , but the first is represented only by engravings of charles i and the second by a single portrait of charles s nephew , prince rupert this is a glamorous work in which the light focuses not on the subject s face but on the voluminous white sleeve thrusting out from under a lush pink satin cloak more noteworthy , however , is rubens s peace embracing plenty , of the early 1630 s , a small sketch for the paintings commissioned by charles for inigo jones s banqueting house in whitehall charles was by far the most discerning of the monarchs , but he had his equals among the aristocracy , including the earl of arundel , who was responsible for introducing both jones and van dyck to england this was a golden age for patronage and collecting and had the king retained his head , english panoply might ultimately have rivaled that of bourbons and hapsburgs but the show does not bring this out any more than it emphasizes the heyday of portraiture , in the 18th century the reason , presumably , is that most of the works come from the center s collection , which , though astonishingly rich , cannot compete with its counterparts in england , particularly the collection belonging to queen elizabeth ii nevertheless , there are high points , namely gainsborough s sketch of the thenduke of kent , benjamin west s flattering portrait of queen charlotte , and a fine marble bust of george iv by sir francis chantrey a follower of the french expatriate , louis francois roubiliac , chantrey did so well with his portraits and monuments that he was able to bequeath a fortune to the royal academy with the georgian takeover , the atmosphere becomes steadily more prosperous and less aristocratic , although full respectability does not arrive until the accession of victoria there is an abundance of 18th and 19thcentury prints and watercolors , many of them views of the various royal residences , but the emphasis is on memorabilia this includes an educational game about british sovereigns from egbert to george iii as well as medals , coins , a panorama of victoria s coronation and a telescopic peep show of the crystal palace , to name a few of the objects despite the show s excellent labels , it is a miscellany to make even an anglophile s head spin coronation mugs , tea caddies and biscuit tins are among the 20thcentury souvenirs \( the industrial revolution has a lot to answer for \) , and , from the beinecke rare book and manuscript collection , no less , a copy of the story of 'timmy , ' princess elizabeth s siamese kitten in a catalogue essay , linda colley , a professor of history at yale , takes a knowing political view of the royal saga , seeing it mostly as the outcome of political manipulation the terms propaganda and image recur in her essay but this is to overlook the issues of class and religion , not to mention patriotism and chauvinism whoever described the country as a group of islands off which lies the continent of europe , the channel tunnel notwithstanding , was not altogether joking the hollywoodization of the royal family began in the late 30 s with cecil beaton s photographs note the 1942 picture of princess elizabeth in an eminently civilian suit that is described in the caption as the uniform of the grenadier guards' colonel in chief but though the transformation proceeds apace with the young royalty , it seems that the feelings the people have for their figureheads are the same as ever a mixture of affection , mockery and , perhaps , contentment at the sheer predictability of their doings royal portraiture , which started to decline in victoria s time and reached a photographic low in the present century , seems to be picking up having seen an exhibition by tom wood , prince charles commissioned a portrait of himself , and the result , together with studies and drawings , has a section to itself though mr wood used photographs , he has achieved something that can be called a painting the subject , looking preoccupied , sits in shallow space accompanied by a stylized tree casting shadows , a carnation in a jar and two mysterious silhouettes of another male figure colors are muted but strong for those who have strength left , there is also philippe mercier and the five senses , a show at the center organized by jennifer ullman , a graduate student in yale s art history department mercier was a huguenot who went to london in 1716 , taking with him a portrait of the thenprince of wales as a child , which he had painted at the german court upon moving to york , he produced works of the imagination that bore on daily life and pointed to a moral an artist affected by watteau and by the new notions of science and philosophy , mercier , in turn , affected english painters including francis hayman , arthur devis and joseph wright of derby works by or after these contemporaries , also drawn from the center s collection , make up the balance of the five senses crown pictorial continues through feb 17 at the yale center for british art , 1080 chapel street , in new haven philippe mercier and the five senses remains at the center through feb 3 photos temperance enjoying a frugal meal , 1792 , an engraving colored by hand by james gillray \( the lewis walpole library \) above , richard littlewood right , yale center for british art h r h the prince of wales , above , an oil on panel by tom wood , and queen

albany , jan 31 as the opening move in albany s annual budget tournament , gov mario m cuomo s budget proposal gave him a quick tactical advantage it makes him look like a tough leader in times that seem to demand hard decisions and it boxes state lawmakers in , forcing them to choose openly between two politically unpalatable options raising more taxes or slicing programs sacred to their constituents so grim are the spending cuts mr cuomo has proposed that many in albany said today that they believed that even the governor himself would prefer to see them restored through higher taxes as long as he did not have to take responsibility for raising them i think his basic strategy is not to propose major taxes and then to force the legislature to run in with money for education and basic services , said eve brooks , executive director of statewide youth advocacy , a nonprofit lobbying group a timetested strategy mr cuomo s opening gambit is fundamentally not a new one his budget recommends deep cuts in programs , like school aid , that have always been ferociously guarded by the legislature , and it leaves it up to lawmakers to come up with the money to restore these programs governors have employed this strategy for as long as there have been lawmakers , and mr cuomo himself has used it before on more than one occasion but what distinguishes this year from previous years is that mr cuomo and the state s dire fiscal circumstances have left the legislature little room to outmaneuver him lawmakers cannot , for example , propose to cut mr cuomo s favorite programs in order to restore their own mr cuomo has already cut his own programs nor can lawmakers insist that the governor is hiding money that could be used to increase spending without taxes there is a general consensus in albany that the state s fiscal situation is likely to grow worse , not better , in the months ahead the governor s message is , 'look , if you ca n't live with this budget , the only other way is revenues , ' assembly speaker mel miller said little room to maneuver mr cuomo has not left himself much room to maneuver on the subject of revenues , even if the legislature comes forward to take responsiblity for them today the governor said that even if they were proposed , he would reject increases in the state s three major taxes personal income taxes , sales taxes and corporate taxes this leaves only a few possible sources of revenue , none of which is large enough to offset the severity of the proposed spending cuts they include the gasoline tax , which mr cuomo has already proposed raising by 10 cents a gallon other user taxes , which have been raised sharply over the last few years , and an extension of the sales tax to cover more goods and services i think what the governor is saying is that he s willing to live with the cuts if the legislature is , said cynthia green , a senior analyst for the citizens budget commission , a watchdog group financed by business with his budget proposal , mr cuomo seems to have wanted to burnish his somewhat tarnished reputation as a fiscal conservative , and at first blush he seems to have succeeded in doing this shifting the burdens his proposal has spared few areas from cuts in fact , he has balanced the budget at the expense of some of his own most cherished commitments he has , for example , proposed a delay in the program that he is most closely identified with , the liberty scholarship program , which was supposed to award its first grants to poor students this year the scope of the cuts prompted many advocates for the poor to accuse the governor of balancing the budget on the backs of the state s most needy residents , and led many local government officials to accuse him of shifting the state s burdens onto municipalities educators said the 10 percent cut in school aid that he proposed would devastate their school systems lawmakers seemed unsure today just how to react to mr cuomo s proposal and to stark choices it presented them their response illustrated just how skittish albany has become toward new taxes since the election last november , when state voters defeated a 19 billion environmental bond issue the defeat of the bond issue was widely seen as a sign of frustration with the rising cost of government 'beyond our means' although mr cuomo proposed 45 billion worth of cuts today , the state senate majority leader , ralph j marino , republican of oyster bay , li , still accused him of spending and taxing too much while the governor now seems willing to contain state spending , i am disappointed that this effort could not have eliminated the need for new taxes , especially a 10 cent increase in the gas tax , mr marino said today the senator insisted that he had always been for greater spending restraint , saying , the budget crisis new york now faces is the result of continued spending beyond our means the assembly speaker , mr miller , a brooklyn democrat , also took an i told you so approach many of our problems could have been avoided if we 'd enacted the fiscal reforms i proposed three years ago , he said instead of calling for higher taxes , mr miller said he planned to review the governor s budget , looking for ways to deliver the same services for less money at least , he said , that was the stance he planned to take for for the next 45 days but , he acknowledged , the deadline for the budget april 1 is 59 days away photo gov mario m cuomo as he presented a budget that included the largest package of cuts in new york s history

cairo , feb 12 in more than two decades as leader of the palestine liberation organization , yasir arafat has survived crises , setbacks and challenges to his leadership but senior policy makers in the middle east say his support for iraq in the persian gulf war may have finally ended his effectiveness as the foremost palestinian leader the decision by mr arafat to back president saddam hussein has estranged the plo from supporters in the arab world , particularly those taking the lead in the antiiraq coalition , and has eroded sympathy for mr arafat s organization among western nations as a result , prospects for the creation of a palestinian state have become ever more remote , the officials said these views expressed in a monthlong canvassing of officials in egypt , israel and the gulf , and within the plo itself suggest that once the war is over , the best the palestinians can hope for is to achieve some form of autonomy in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip under the control of israel , jordan or possibly egypt such assessments were advanced by ranking government officials primarily from the antiiraq coalition of nine arab countries led by saudi arabia , egypt and syria nations that have always had an ambivalent view of mr arafat and the plo but similar sentiments are increasingly heard from some close associates of mr arafat , from arab journalists who have frequent access to him , and from palestinian academics in the west one of those , a close friend of mr arafat for more than 40 years , conceded that as long as the old man is at the head of the organization , none of the gulf arabs will speak to us again link to khalef killing they are of bedouin stock and they will not forget he stabbed them in the back , said the plo aide , who asked not to be identified others in the movement , including saleh khalef , who was shot to death last month by a palestinian gunman , are known to have differed with mr arafat over his unqualified support of president hussein the iraqi leader has gained support among palestinians in the occupied territories , jordan and elsewhere by linking a resolution of the gulf crisis to the palestinian cause the view among officials in egypt and elsewhere is that it is time for new palestinian leadership to emerge , perhaps from the occupied territories , to negotiate a settlement of the israelipalestinian impasse mr arafat s predicament has been further complicated by growing disarray within his organization s ranks assassinations and sporadic fighting have erupted between palestinian factions in lebanon and in the occupied territories and factions like the muslim fundamentalist group hamas contest the plo s authority there was much speculation within the plo and from outsiders who know the organization that the killing of mr khalef in tunis was ordered by iraq after he took the position that iraq must withdraw from kuwait to end the gulf crisis the gunman apprehended in the attack belonged to the breakaway palestinian faction led by the terrorist abu nidal , who is assumed to be living in baghdad despite the growing pessimism about mr arafat , his top lieutenants and steadfast backers in the plo maintain that the setbacks to his leadership are temporary they argue that while the palestinian movement is indeed in serious trouble , the plo will emerge from the crisis as an important factor in the arab world and they point out that the 61yearold mr arafat has in the past overcome serious challenges to his leadership we are in a situation of high risk , but , so are all the other arab participants in this war , said nabil shaath , a political adviser to the plo leader to date , not a single palestinian faction intends to defect from supporting him because they know that arafat has really made the only choice possible , mr shaath said it was impossible for him to back any side in which the united states and israel are fighting an arab country in contemplating the outlook for the palestinians , many mideast experts say their attainable goals are fast shrinking , as the region changes dramatically , with a new balance of power in the gulf and new alliances that appear to leave little room for palestinians as significant partners they say that if peace talks are undertaken between arabs and israel , they will be conducted by arab nations like egypt , syria and jordan with the backing of arab nations of the gulf region the palestinians would be relegated to a minor role in such talks the officials said , and their demands for an independent state would likely get short shrift in addition , major gulf allies of the united states , especially saudi arabia and kuwait , would reject dealing with mr arafat personally , the officials said after the war , the palestinians will discover two things that the plo s involvement in interarab disputes was a strategic mistake and that they are back to square one , having squandered all the gains of diplomacy and of the intifada , said a senior foreign policy adviser to president hosni mubarak of egypt , referring to the threeyear uprising against israeli control of the west bank and gaza

washington , april 30 trying to end the recession , the federal reserve cut interest rates today , noting as it acted that the latest data showed the economy to be still quite weak in an earlymorning announcement , the federal reserve said it had lowered the discount rate , the rate it charges on loans to banks , to 5 1 2 percent from 6 percent a few hours later , the central bank pushed down the important federal funds rate , which is what banks charge each other on loans , to 5 3 4 percent from 6 percent both rates affect what banks pay for deposits and other funds , and what they can then charge when they lend out this money for mortgages , home equity loans , car loans and the like benchmark rate at 9 with their cost of funds lower , banks are now under pressure to reduce their prime lending rate , currently at 9 percent , but no large bank moved immediately this rate is the benchmark for many commercial and other loans the federal reserve s move came after treasury secretary nicholas f brady had failed to persuade germany and the other major industrial nations to lower their interest rates to help give the american economy a lift the timing suggested to some economists that the federal reserve had acted today at least partly in response to the bush administration s call for lower rates all signs point to the fed trying to bail out the brady position after the unsuccessful meeting of the group of seven industrial nations on sunday , said david jones , chief economist at aubrey g lanston , a wall street investment firm this is armtwisting by the administration , successfully a different explanation but the federal reserve offered a much different explanation the announcement accompanying the discount rate cut said the fed had acted because data released in the last few days , including some figures published today , showed continued weakness in economic activity industrial production and factory orders have declined , spending for new machinery and other equipment has fallen more than expected , employment costs have edged down and consumer confidence a measure of the willingness of americans to spend fell in april i am reasonably confident the economy will turn up , said lyle gramley , chief economist at the mortgage bankers association and a former federal reserve governor , reflecting a view held not only in the bush administration and the federal reserve , but also among many private economists still , he said , you have to make adjustments , and the latest numbers are softer than i and others would have expected the credit markets seemed to agree that the economy was quite weak , and interest rates on bonds fell today the federal reserve s action praised by the president did not come without opposition among its policy makers alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve , and the four other sitting governors control the discount rate , and they voted 4 to 1 to lower it by half a percentage point , the third such reduction since last december although it is the least important of the two rates , since banks borrow very little directly from the fed , changes in the discount rate serve as a very public signal of the central bank s latest concerns about the economy one negative vote the negative vote came from wayne angell , a governor who has said that he believes a recovery is imminent and that lowering rates now might make the recovery too robust in the initial months , risking inflation a similar view among some of the federal reserve s other policy makers the chairman , the 4 governors and the 12 regional bank presidents has led to debate over whether the federal funds rate should have declined as sharply as it has since last december , when it was more than 7 1 2 percent as the rate that banks charge each other on very shortterm loans , the federal funds rate more than anything else helps to determine what banks pay for funds that are then lent to consumers and businessmen all 17 policy makers play a role in determining its level mr greenspan agreed in late march to consult in advance by telephone with the other policy makers when he wanted to move the federal funds rate at the same time that the federal reserve changed the discount rate , officials said this new procedure , called enhanced consultation , was used this morning the fed policy makers spoke on a conference call , before the discount rate announcement rate lowest since 1987 some policy makers asked questions , but none reportedly objected to the fed funds rate cut some objections could come to the surface , however , at the policy makers' next meeting , on may 14 , if the economy turns out to be stronger than it appears today , federal reserve officials said the discount rate is now at its lowest level since 1987 the discount rate announcement came just as horst kohler , under secretary of finance for the german government , was winding up a news conference at the conclusion of the international monetary fund s spring meeting here , and he greeted the news enthusiastically wonderful , he said we gave them the advice to lower their own rates that is what we thought they should do
ask any player ask the coach in the case of the 199091 islanders , an obituary seems more appropriate than a review and none of them will deny that they buried themselves we started off on the wrong foot right off the bat , but we had time later to regroup ourselves and get going and we never did , said coach al arbour , who wo n't return to this club next season unless its owners , whoever they might be , spend freely in the freeagent market and purge significantly from the present roster apparently long forgotten , are the four islanders' stanley cups earned with arbour behind the bench their last pair of victories , at home against boston and on the road against playoffbound new jersey , merely dumped them one rung lower in the pecking order of the june entry draft there , instead of selecting third , they will be fourth in line behind quebec , the expansion san jose franchise , and toronto \( whose draft pick belongs to the devils \) last season the islanders squeaked into the playoffs this season they had nailed down last place in the patrick division by midseason , and had it not been for this weekend s backtoback victories that brought their record to 254510 , they would have finished the year ranked 20th of the league s 21 franchises they scored just 223 goals , the fewest in the national hockey league , and behind their unhappy superstar pat lafontaine , whose 41 goals led the club in scoring for the fourth consecutive season , there was no player who scored more than 25 goals the outlook for 199192 is grim lafontaine has petitioned for his walking papers and has indicated that he neither wants to play for , nor be paid by current ownership lafontaine s quarrel with the club stemmed from his deadlocked contract negotiations \( he earned 425 , 000 this past season \) he is finishing the 199091 season 20 points off his careerhigh scoring pace of 105 last season then , scant hours before the march trading deadline , islander general manager bill torrey informed the team that the owner , john pickett , had decided to decorate his franchise with a for sale sign the islanders reportedly have had inquiries but no offers from a dozen interested buyers whether torrey , arbour , lafontaine and , quite possibly , the entire islander franchise will call nassau coliseum home in 199192 is , like the team s record , unpromising
st louis , june 16 the opera theater of st louis , which has developed a reputation as one of america s more adventuresome small opera companies , took a slightly conservative artistic turn this spring it also grew a bit larger physically the growth is permanent at a cost of some 200 , 000 , the company enlarged the orchestra pit of its theater in the lorettohilton center on the campus of webster university though the pit remains small , with a capacity of perhaps 50 players , the expansion affords them greater comfort but the conservative turn in repertory , with richard strauss s ariadne on naxos \( 1916 \) the most recent work represented , is evidently temporary the opera theater , which typically presents a fairly contemporary work if not a premiere each season , has already announced its four operas for next year , and they include benjamin britten s midsummer night s dream and gillian weir s vanishing bridegroom still , this season s varied repertory holds some adventure along with ariadne and tchaikovsky s eugene onegin , it includes two relative novelties , mozart s mitridate and leoncavallo s boheme and only the tchaikovsky is presented in a thoroughly traditional production , the other scenarios being , in varying degrees , updated as it happens , colin graham s conventional onegin proves the most satisfying staging overall , but ken cazan s innovative mitridate runs a close second not incidentally , perhaps , these productions also offered the greatest musical rewards this weekend 'eugene onegin' onegin , with its russian vistas and grand balls , might seem unpromising material for the tiny lorettohilton stage but mr graham , the opera theater s artistic director , has obviously become expert at dealing with the space constrictions he and his set designer , neil peter jampolis , open each act with an evocative picture , achieving a marvelous illusion of depth with the help of a scrim in the dance and peasant scenes , mr graham and his choreographer , pam kriger , move the crowds though close quarters with an easy grace that uncannily enhances the sense of spaciousness michael stennett s costumes are lovely , and the characterizations struck few false notes at saturday afternoon s presentation musically , too , the performance was sound , with excellent work from the leads dwayne croft sang onegin with solid , pleasing tone gwynne geyer , as tatyana , showed good staying power in her wellpaced letter scene , and her warm sonority took on an appropriate edge in the third act paul groves was an undistinguished lensky , pinched and nasal in his upper register , and he had difficulty holding pitch in dynamic shifts wanda brister sang with unassuming natural tone as olga , and laurence albert rendered gremin s aria passably the opera theater uses two orchestras drawn from the st louis symphony , with each assigned two operas john nelson , the company s music director , drew vibrant and balanced playing from the onegin boheme contingent , but kept it from swamping the singers the strings sounded as lush as they could in such numbers , and the woodwinds bandied tunes about charmingly david lloydjones s english translation registered well in all , this was as fine a pocket onegin as could be hoped for 'mitridate' mitridate poses staging problems of a different sort an opera seria that mozart wrote at the age of 14 , it comprises almost nothing but recitatives and arias there are few characters in all , and fewer still onstage at any given time the directorial danger was exemplified in a splitlevel production in aixenprovence , france , a decade ago , in which characters repeatedly entered upper left and circled around to exit lower left , as though the set were a sort of giant shooting gallery in contrast , mr cazan manages to wring a good deal of dramatic truth from the frenetic comings and goings in a bold stroke said to have been conceived before recent hostilities in the persian gulf area , he has transposed the action from the kingdom of pontus \( now part of turkey \) in the first century bc to presentday yemen but he has worked thoughtfully and unobtrusively , without the japes that typically accompany such updatings tom hennes s lively set designs and martin pakledinaz s gorgeous costumes contribute to a strikingly compelling production , sung in andrew porter s excellent english translation the cast seemed well balanced this evening , though female voices prevailed , some in roles mozart wrote for castrati brenda harris s vulnerable tone grew increasingly fragile as she seemed to tire a bit martin thompson sang mitridate strongly and acted believably the women in the trouser roles alison england as sifare , patricia spence as

new york state leaders are seriously considering ending or sharply curtailing spending to open new group homes for the mentally ill for the next 15 months a moneysaving move that city officials say would mean more disturbed people on the streets , in homeless shelters and in hospitals the proposals are part of broad cuts to close an estimated 5 billion budget gap through the end of the next fiscal year state senator ralph j marino , the majority leader , advocates a 15month moratorium on expansion of communitybased housing for the mentally ill , including 1 , 616 apartments promised for the homeless mentally ill in new york city top officials in the cuomo administration have also called for deep cuts , though they have not been specific michael dowling , the governor s senior adviser on human services , said the administration will try to keep its commitment to the city , but he made no promises state lags on beds the city estimates that about 20 , 000 homeless mentally ill people live in the city a year and a half after gov mario m cuomo and mayor david n dinkins signed an agreement to open 3 , 300 new beds by june 1993 , the city has delivered 700 and the state , 284 each bed costs about 60 , 000 to develop and 14 , 000 to 28 , 000 a year to operate , depending on the level of social services provided , state officials said the senate estimates that its proposal would save 30 million to 40 million the governor s proposal has not been broken down if the state does not deliver the remaining 1 , 616 beds of the 1 , 900 it promised , sick people will continue to live on the streets , in the city s huge treacherous homeless shelters and to be hospitalized in crises , said the city s mental health commissioner , dr billy e jones the city promised to deliver 1 , 400 beds it costs 15 , 000 a year to house a person in a city shelter , compared with 103 , 000 for a year s stay in a state hospital , which leads mental health experts and city officials to call the cuts fiscally shortsighted dr jones said he does not know what the city will do if the state breaks its promise under the august 1990 agreement , called new yorknew york when you see people hallucinating and talking to themselves on the street , that s a problem for all of us , mr jones said how would i feel if the state welshes on the agreement \? i would feel betrayed the current debate on budget cuts in mental health care comes when the state has been making slow progress in creating alternatives to homelessness and hospitalization for the mentally ill the transformation of the system is far from complete in the 1950 s , 88 , 800 people were in state hospitals , many of them locked away for lifetimes now , 12 , 600 people are institutionalized but the growth of the state s ability to care for the mentally ill in group homes and other types of supported housing in communities has not kept pace with the need the state estimates about 48 , 000 mentally ill people statewide are homeless it s unfortunate that the simplest and fairest approach is to freeze everything at existing levels , said john mcardle , a spokesman for mr marino , the senate majority leader none of us are happy with the cuts , particularly in mental health , but these are not normal times the senate s position is that the state can continue building the communitybased housing that is now in the pipeline , but it cannot spend money to operate the projects once they are ready to open , mr mcardle said 'i'm just numb' the state has about 3 , 500 communitybased beds for the mentally ill planned , has already spent 15 million to develop them and has obligated another 20 million in bonds and loans to finish the projects , according to the state office of mental health some of the projects are almost completed , while others are still without sites many of the planned beds will be ready to open in the next 15 months , said the state commissioner of mental health , richard c surles i'm just numb , said mr surles , long an advocate for communitybased mental health care the senate would basically shut me down i'm hoping for a better outcome from the governor nicolas a spano , chairman of the senate mental hygiene committee , said he has has asked senator marino to try to finance the new yorknew york agreement the homeless mentally ill in the city feel safer in a refrigerator box under the brooklyn bridge than in a city shelter , he said so there s something wrong with the way we 're treating the homeless mentally ill michael dowling , director of health , education and human services in the governor s office , said the administration s goal is to cut 66 million from community services in four areas mental health , mental retardation , drug abuse and alcoholism many of the men and women who live in new community residences opened under the agreement say the programs have helped them turn their lives right side up sal valente , who is 28 years old , was homeless for five years before he landed at the wanaque , a residence for 36 people run by fountain house , a nonprofit group it s formed into a tightknit family , said mr valente , as he rocked back and forth in a chair the most important thing is to have a bed i also have my own doctor and the director bought me new shoes and clothes mr valente s roommate , roberson paul , who is 36 years old , said the staff at the wanaque have helped him get his manic depression under control it makes you feel like you do n't have to climb the walls by yourself , he said 'everyone was fighting' for years , mr paul said , he was homeless , living on subway platforms , sleeping on rooftops and drinking rum he stayed awhile in one of the city s armory shelters it was like a football game with no coaches , he said everyone was fighting plus they hustle wine money all day one guy he was high sat next to me and took a big bite out of me , like a playful dog since he moved into the wanaque a year ago , a pleasant , wellkept brownstone at 359 west 47th street in manhattan , mr paul has gardened and worked parttime as a messenger he used the money he earned to pay for piano lessons the snowballing of your personality starts to balance when you have your apartment and a job , he said this place is so appealing , spending another five years here may not be a bad idea advocates for the homeless mentally ill say group homes make a tempting target for budget cutters unlike education , which has broadbased public support , community residences for the mentally ill are often an unpopular addition to neighborhoods but they warn that a freeze on opening new community residences statewide would halt progress for the mentally ill and further degrade life on the streets for all new yorkers it s a throwback to the 19th century either the asylums or the streets , said kim hopper , president of the national coalition for the homeless that s exactly the kind of thinking we spent the last half century trying to undo
azzurro just when the plethora of northern italian restaurants in manhattan suggested that everything south of florence was gastronomically primordial , along came the sindona family , offering expressive , sunripened sicilian fare the mother , maria , and her sons , marcello and vittorio , opened their first restaurant on second avenue in 1985 in a space so narrow that when one party rose to leave , diners at adjacent tables had to inhale deeply yet neither a cramped space nor echoing noise deterred swarms of azzurro fans they came for food that was authentic , uncommon and unpretentious for the same reasons , they are packing the family s new , larger venture , around the corner on east 84th street , formerly the site of al bacio the handsome rectangular dining room , with tan walls and soft lighting , is decorated with antique maps and charts blueandwhitestriped banquettes flank one wall , while french doors open onto the sidewalk the design conveys both formality and casualness , which the disparate dress code reflects those who have traveled in italy know how exquisitely simple appetizers there can be an antipasto plate of vegetables , assorted bean salads , marinated fish and the like at azzurro , you can start with a snappy fennelandorange salad in which the cool , sharp fennel flavor is mellowed by the sweet fruit artichoke hearts sauteed in sizzling olive oil are brittle and delicious , as are grilled shiitake mushrooms also compelling is a salad of red potatoes , green beans , tomatoes and red onions , all brightened with vinegar but a deep bowl of giant new zealand mussels was blemished by two offtasting ones it is difficult to assess service with any confidence on two occasions , the amicable waiters were hawkeyed and fleetfooted , never leaving a customer searching for help on another evening , though , orders were confused , dishes were slammed on the tables , and getting a waiter s attention nearly required rescue flares wines at azzurro are intelligently in tune with the menu white wines from tretinoalto adige and friulivenezia giulia , many in the 20 to 27 range , are fine choices with appetizers reds have ample good selections in the same price range the chef tosses around garlic as if it were confetti , which is no problem for me orecchiette with broccoli , garlic and fennel sausage had chunky , rustic appeal , as did a special of linguine tossed in a mildly salty olive paste and garnished with black olives , and terrific penne in a ripe tomato sauce with slices of sweet grilled eggplant on one occasion , we had an order of sauteed spinach with big chunks of garlic on the side , and , on another , pleasantly bitter broccoli rape pumped up with garlic among the other creations is a splendid spaghetti with big , fresh clams on the half shell , garlic , olive oil and herbs plump ravioli are stuffed with spinach and ricotta , then glazed with luxurious sage butter grilled salmon came two ways on separate occasions thinly sliced , well seasoned and served over arugula and basil , and under a mound of sauteed red onion , but unfortunately overcooked split cornish hen was nicely charred and moist , but bland grilled lamb chops with fingerthick steak fries hardly constitute adventuresome sicilian fare , but they certainly were good habitues of azzurro know and fear the towering napoleon , which packs so much pastry cream that you need a calculator to count the calories pear slices with a wellbalanced zabaglione is a somewhat lighter option meringuetopped ice cream pie reminds you of the best birthday party you ever went to , and tiramisu is heavy on sambuca and light on espresso the sindona family , which also owns baci on the upper west side , has pulled off a feat that can be as tricky as nailing spaghetti to a wall moving and expanding without a diminution of quality for that , it is well worth a visit mi cocina for many of the eight years he was executive chef at the three cinco de mayo restaurants \( in soho , at tudor city and at the citicorp center \) , jose hurtadoprud'homme hungered for his own place where he could cook the spirited foods of his native queretaro in central mexico and beyond this year , he and his wife , marzena , found their opportunity in a dilapidated former carpentry shop in the west village they have made the threemonthold mi cocina one of the most genuine and welcoming mexican restaurants in town floortoceiling windows open up the slender rectangular space at one end , the sparkling little kitchen is framed in colorful tiles , and nearby is a zinctopped bar from which splendid margaritas flow dustyrose walls take on a soothing hue under gentle indirect lighting the casually clad staff is prompt and affable , even when the room becomes cramped and tricky to navigate mr hurtadoprud'homme s menu runs from the most humble peppery tripeandhominy soup to the more urbane grilled salmon with a lively sauce of chipotle peppers and sour cream a superior starter is the empanaditas de picadillo , little turnovers filled with shredded beef , raisins and olives sopitos con queso de cabra are cornmeal crusts topped with goat cheese , a peppy salsa , onions and cilantro you ca n't go wrong with those ingredients
in trying to increase the allure of its troubled charge card business , the american express company yesterday announced a new service of plush , prepackaged events for holders of its platinum cards the new service by invitation only offers events ranging from a film festival at robert redford s ranch in utah , to frontrow seats at knicks basketball games , to a concert and dinner party with the violinist isaac stern and the cellist yoyo ma in miami the service comes as american express tries to fight stalled growth in its creditcard business and growing disenchantment , analysts say , with the high fees it charges cardholders and retailers platinum card holders pay a 300 annual fee , while american express s gold card costs 75 a year and its standard green card 55 since mastercard and visa have offered consumers lower annual fees , or none at all , analysts say american express has had difficulty expanding its customer base
moscow , nov 8 the new chairman of the soviet intelligence and security agency , appointed two months ago to reform one of the world s most feared organizations , said today that the number of soviet agents working abroad should be cut at least by half , and that the number of people directly answerable to him would be reduced by more than 90 percent i know our intelligence activity should be cut sharply , the official , vadim v bakatin , said in an interview in the agency s imposing gray headquarters off lubyanka square this is a budget question we do n't have the possibility to support an enormous apparatus in some countries , soviet intelligence agents should be withdrawn entirely , and in others there should be a quantatitive reduction , mr bakatin said he declined to give the number of secret agents now working abroad under the external intelligence directorate now headed by yevgeny m primakov , but asserted that their activity has already fallen off since he was appointed to the post after the failed coup in august mr bakatin , who for two years had served as interior minister , is now presiding over the breakup an organization that until recently had kept an iron grip on soviet society , smothering dissent through a network of agents and informers whose main purpose was to preserve and protect the ruling communist party kgb s new name but in the months since mr bakatin took over from vladimir a kryuchkov , who was implicated in the failed coup , much has changed no longer is his agency called the state committee for security , whose initials , kgb , had become synonymous with repression now it is known as the interrepublican council for security , or msb , and has been given the job of coordinating and assisting the local security apparatus cropping up in the newly sovereign soviet republics a protocol on interrepublic cooperation on security matters has already been signed by all 12 remaining soviet republics that degree of cooperation , mr bakatin noted with some pride , exceeds the muchdebated interrepublic economic agreement , which so far has been signed by only 10 republics of the halfmillion people who once worked for the kgb , only 39 , 000 are expected to remain employed by the new agency , mr bakatin said dozens of kgb officers were dismissed for their involvement in the coup , others are being offered early retirement but mostly , mr bakatin said , the sharp reduction is a result of the breakup of the kgb s old functions , including the creation of a new independent borderguard force to replace the force that accounted for about half or 240 , 000 of the old kgb separate agencies have also been created to handle security for top government leaders , and for the maintenance of government communications mr bakatin said today that about 20 , 000 former kgb personnel have gone over to the russian republic s newlyformed kgb , rflecting a trend seen throughout the mammoth soviet bureaucracy as it is gets swept up in the devolution of the center s authority to the republics lee harvey oswald file as he tries to get a grip on the agency , which he once described as state unto itself , mr bakatin said he would leave the job of unearthing the kgb s dark past to others at the request of american press representatives , he said he looked through the files for any evidence of kgb involvement in the assasination of president john f kennedy , and he said he found none but he said he found extensive records on the activities of kennedy s assassin , lee harvey oswald , during the time he spent in the byelorussian capital , minsk he was followed , of course , said mr bakatin every step he made was known though he has not made a recent investigation of the files for evidence of a kgb role in the attempt to kill pope john paul ii , mr bakatin said a search had been made before president mikhail s gorbachev visited rome we did n't find anything there , he said
the old inlet inn in bellport has an impressive pedigree the last time it was reviewed , on feb 7 , 1988 , it received a rating of excellent that reputation , combined with experienced new owners , joyce roe and david bernatzky , sounds like a winning team mr bernatzky was well known a few years ago as the owner chef of jdave s , a popular cajun restaurant in patchogue the old inlet inn is now jdave s old inlet inn and it looks terrific this victorian beauty on south country road has been on the national register of historic places for more than a decade now , it has been redecorated , newly papered and painted to a sparkling sheen but in spite of good looks , pleasing prices and talented , experienced restaurateurs , the inn , at this early stage , is failing to live up to its potential the first disappointment is the restaurant s noreservations policy that policy may work in a casual storefront , but diners who plan a special evening out do not appreciate beginning the night with an hour s wait in a smoky bar even when seated , patrons find that service is neither swift nor sure the majority of the abundant staff are inexperienced busgirls they are sweet , but provide little real help to overwhelmed waiters the nights i visited , their primary functon was whisking away dirty plates while other diners at the table were still eating the last person to finish was made to feel selfconscious although the food is better than the service , there are pitfalls here as well jdave s followers will zero in on the cajun specialties that made his reputation the blackened prime rib is sensational with a juicy pink interior and a crusty exterior that was seared in a justright blend of spices a cold horseradish moussaline sauce is a perfect foil shrimp etouffee

appetizers succulent chicken etouffee , with the same great sauce and sidekicks , makes a fine , sticktotheribs starter shrimp cocktail , labeled cajun hot , lives up to its billing in both temperature and fire power more routine are the standard clams casino and the oysters stilton , small roasted bivalves topped with melted cheese oysters on the halfshell are larger and better soups are a mystery one evening , a bland cream of winter vegetable soup served in a small cup cost 175 on a return visit , a zesty manhattan clam chowder in a large soup bowl was also 175 all three salads deserve praise the house salad is a large bowl of greens topped with sprouts , plum tomatoes and endive it is a best buy at 275 the favorite at our table was the spinach , aglow in its warm bacononion dressing the third salad , a hot seafood gathering bathed in a warm sesame seed dressing presented over cold spinach , is a treasure trove of contrasting temperatures and textures two specials join the cajun hits as top entrees one was marinated calamari , grilled to smoky goodness , with a host of grilled vegetables in attendance the other features sea scallops in a lipsmacking curry sauce from

describing its results as unsatisfactory and vowing to take steps to bolster sales , r h macy company yesterday reported a loss of 1009 million for the quarter ended may 4 it was the largest quarterly loss for the company in nearly three years in the corresponding quarter of last year , macy s loss was 631 million macy said sales in the latest quarter declined 67 percent , to 139 billion from 149 billion that decrease was somewhat smaller than the declines earlier in the fiscal year for the nine months , sales fell 9 percent , to 513 billion from 564 billion sales in stores at least a year old were down 63 percent , while for the nine months they were off 92 percent such same store sales are considered a truer barometer of a retailer s performance than overall sales , which include results from new stores in a letter to its investors , released yesterday by the company , macy s management said it considered our results to be unsatisfactory , and added , while the sluggish economy in the northeast and unsettled conditions in the middle east were contributing factors , we recognize that increased sales volume holds the key to improved bottomline performance a macy spokesman said that besides the sales decline , the loss reflected the cost of investing in new technology and the expenses of increased marketing efforts , including a new television advertising campaign macy recently announced a 150 million television campaign and said it would promote the macy name as a brand , in the manner of mcdonald s and cocacola it also plans an aggressive promotion of its credit cards intended to attract another 100 , 000 regular customers but some analysts said the huge loss was jarring , especially in light of a series of ambitious plans macy announced to suppliers last week the new yorkbased company said then that it planned to open 11 stores , renovate a number of others and increase its sales by 36 billion , or 415 percent , in the next five years in addition to its sales drop , macy s had very large markdowns in the quarter in order to promote its business , said walter f loeb , an independent new york securities analyst i am concerned about macy s acceleration of store openings at a time when it is so important to gain existingstore productivity but even with an increase in its losses , i still think that macy has a unique ability to merchandise itself out of its problems and generate higher profits analyst expresses surprise another independent new york retail analyst , kurt barnard , said the big loss was surprising , adding that it was a direct result of high expenses and insufficient sales volume macy is not the only retailer reporting disappointing results other large retailers , including the may department stores , the dayton hudson corporation and the limited , have reported earnings declines in the quarter ended in may , but none reported losses macy s , with a manhattan flagship store , operates its biggest store group , the northeast division , in states in which the recession is worse than in much of the rest of the nation macy said its operating earnings fell to 10 million in the most recent quarter , from 895 million a year earlier the figures do not reflect taxes and interest payments or the charge for costs connected to the sale of its credit card operations about 25 million of the net loss in the most recent quarter came from costs of selling those operations to a subsidiary of the general electric company shifting sentiments sentiment regarding macy , among both bond investors and clothing makers , was heavily negative last fall but improved considerably earlier this year after the institutions that own most of macy agreed to buy more stock , providing money for an ambitious debtretirement program macy bond prices dropped yesterday after the results were announced , but there was little if any trading , according to bond traders the bond prices remain far above the autumn levels macy still has longterm debt of 34 billion , despite large reductions from the bondrepurchase program because macy repurchased the bonds for less than face value , it was able to report extraordinary gains on the transactions , including 154 million in the most recent quarter and 1109 million for the nine months the ninemonths gain cut the net loss to 794 million for the period , compared with 1353 million in the corresponding period of last year over all , the net loss for the quarter was the largest since the company posted a deficit of 1614 million in the quarter ended july 30 , 1988 that loss was inflated by costs connected with the acquisition that year of the bullocks and i magnin chains from federated department stores
whenever i used to tell dining companions that i was taking them to a greek restaurant , they would respond with a slack grin , as if i had suggested we attend an allnight bouzouki competition perceptions of greek food in new york city have been etched largely by those modest storefront spots characterized by washedout photographs of the aegean coast , checkered tablecloths and ragged gray lamb gyros in the windows enter periyali in late 1987 , a charming restaurant run by nicola kotsoni and steve tzolis , and new yorkers' ideas of greek cuisine changed dramatically the main dining room has white stucco walls , colorful banquettes , a long wooden bar and billows of fabric hanging overhead to conceal the sound tile it works , for the noise is well muted the snug back rooms surround an alluring outdoor garden periyali s kitchen turns out both familiar and uncommon fare at least it is uncommon to the average american among the former is the best rendition of avgolemono soup i have had , a vivid balance of clean lemon , seductive chicken stock , egg and semolina the arresting mixed appetizer plate is a diverting walk through greek terrain it combines taramosalata \( cod roe and bread puree \) , melintzanosalata \( eggplant salad \) and tzatziki \( cucumbers , yogurt and garlic \) my favorite starter here has always been the extraordinarily tender and fresh octopus that is marinated in red wine and grilled over charcoal crisply deepfried baby calamari served over greens in a subtle vinaigrette is another fine option the only grilled dish that fell short was the brochette of swordfish , which was dry , served with a tasty eggplant and semolina salad two light and beguiling starters are the puree of yellow split peas molded on the plate like the crest of a volcano , with red onions and a dousing of olive oil , and giant white beans tossed in a vinaigrette and vitalized by a garlic sauce that sneaks up behind you after you swallow and whacks you in the head my experimentation with greek wines on periyali s moderatesize international list has been less than electrifying , although there are several decent dry whites from 15 to 25 the impeccably professional staff is good about describing them to you one expects to see lamb on the menu of a greek restaurant , and two of the three renditions sampled here were superior lamb chops grilled over charcoal with fresh rosemary , and leg of lamb served exactly to order and accompanied by green beans and roast potatoes shish kebab with pepper and onions came out a few minutes overcooked baby chicken marinated in lemon , garlic and olive oil and grilled over charcoal was crisp skinned and exceptionally moist one of the most provocative entrees is salmon steak that is swathed with a blend of feta and cottage cheeses , then wrapped in spinach leaves , sprinkled with lemon and finally enveloped in phyllo dough the salmon comes out nicely cooked and the phyllo adds an interesting textural dimension if the dish has a fault , it is too much lemon on top of the sharp feta cheese more straightforward seafood dishes were big hits grilled tilapia , a sweetfleshed freshwater fish from florida sea bass marinated in olive oil , herbs and lemon , then grilled over charcoal , and pompano cooked the same way and served with delicious couscous and broccoli a shrimp dish called garides santorini may be an acquired taste it is made by baking shrimp with tomato , scallions , brandy and feta cheese the sweet brandy plays off the sharp feta cheese in an intriguing way yes , there is a greek dessert other than baklava \( although the one here is quite good \) how about sheep smilk yogurt , so thick you could plant a welcomehometothetroops flag in it , embellished with walnuts and honey \?

louisville , ky , april 7 as the lights came up on a reproduction of the vietnam veterans memorial in washington , women who served in that war placed mementoes of their experience as if they were flowers on a grave the reaction of the audience at the actors theater of louisville was palpable sobs filled the house in a crescendo that became a group lamentation this final scene in shirley lauro s new play , a piece of my heart , is a catharsis as well as a coup de theatre the women in the play are the most forgotten among all those who had been forgotten in vietnam the play itself was the climax of the 15th annual humana festival of new american plays , seen this weekend in a marathon of seven fulllength works and two oneacts in previous years , the festival \( under the artistic direction of jon jory \) has reached individual heights \( with plays from beth henley s crimes of the heart to last season s 2 by romulus linney \) and collective depths in a period in which mr jory commissioned plays from celebrities this year was an onseason for actors theater , as the company resoundingly expressed its valuable purpose , to encourage playwrights to challenge themselves and the hundreds of theatergoers who converge on louisville for the annual spring festival gone was the pretentious symbolism of plays in which metaphorical hounds of hell seemed to bark at the door of every drama instead there were tangible and meaningful plays by three theater artists along with ms lauro , the actors theater offered a striking study of revolutionary cuba by eduardo machado and , as an audience rouser , a dark comedy about a troupe of female wrestlers , written by jane martin , the first fulllength play with interacting characters by this pseudonymous louisvillian through these plays and others of varying interest ran the festival s primary theme the violence , psychological and physical , suffered by women , and their valiant attempts at selfassertion these views ranged from the journey into madness of a lonely shopkeeper \( in shem bitterman s evocative but attenuated interior monologue , nightside \) to the serial killer who regards the murder of women as an extension of seduction \( lee blessing s disappointing down the road \) in ms lauro s piece of my heart \( based on keith walker s oral history of the same title \) , six women , most of them nurses , fly to vietnam on a wave of innocence and idealism almost immediately replaced by panic they are insufficiently trained and totally unprepared for the maimed bodies , the river of blood that flows through the hospital after it is bombed and the illogic of the war itself in the second act , back home , we see the full nightmare of the war and its aftermath there have been a number of plays dealing with vietnam \( most recently steve tesich s speed of darkness \) but none with the direct emotional impact of ms lauro s work it is , on one level , a model of the art of the dramatic collage the playwright has taken true stories and crossthreaded them so that the monologous nature is completely concealed in collaboration with the director , allen r bel knap , and a symbiotic company of actresses \( one actor plays all the male roles \) , ms lauro has turned firsthand impressions into a disturbing drama that evokes empathy for survivors as victims , especially the women in the war zone , whose only weapons are their hearts with equal perceptiveness , three of the talented actresses in ms lauro s play have totally disparate roles in ms martin s cementville , directed by mr jory the title \( pronounced seementville \) is a fictional tennessee town with a sports arena that once housed greats like jake lamotta but has now fallen on seedy times mock wrestling matches are staged for the rabble , sports descended to the depths of show business in a fiercely funny first act , a border state reversal of david storey s changing room , female wrestlers are in a dingy locker room preparing for the evening s show as she did in talking with , ms martin creates a panoply of individualized characters , but , in contrast to that earlier anthology of monologues , these people become an interwoven ensemble in the second act , the play spins into an outbreak of locker bashing violence , which unwisely makes explicit things more effectively encountered as offstage emanations but the ending itself knits the play together in a moment of ruefulness cementville offers additional confirmation of ms martin s gift for dialogue , as she captures the local colorfulness of obsessive characters there is also a knowing sense of our times , as in one character s prediction that fantasy entertainment is the growth industry of the 90 s for mr machado , in the eye of the hurricane is a long awaited realization of the playwright s early promise the success is shared equally with the director , anne bogart , whose visually arresting production offers a tangoesque view of a cuban family and cuba itself \( in 1960 \) in the throes of radical change emotions seethe and flare , as the playwright and the director orchestrate a symphony of contradictions the stage echoes with lovehate , along with outlandish humor akin to that of mario vargas llosa when the family s bus line is about to be nationalized by castro , relatives agree to lie down in front of the buses in order to safeguard the vehicles the confident head of the household takes his prone position in front of a giant tire , awaiting vindication or death , and then , as the bus pulls away , realizes that he

when the trucking industry was deregulated in 1980 , thousands of new companies sprang up seeking to take advantage of the new ease of entry and greater freedom to set their own prices hundreds of existing companies expanded quickly , adding nonunion divisions and entering new markets ranging from pickup and delivery to storage a decade later , many of the new entrants have gone out of business and scores of established companies have also gone under , victims of fierce competition and an inability to adapt to an unregulated market the biggest winners in this new world have been the four trucking giants formerly dominant , now even more so united parcel service in greenwich , conn , which had 136 billion in revenues last year is by far the industry leader its familiar brown trucks and vans operate in all markets , from long distance hauling to pick up and delivery consolidated freightways in palo alto , calif , is next with 42 billion in revenues last year , followed by roadway express inc , in akron , ohio , with 297 billion and yellow freight systems inc in kansas city with 23 billion unlike the others , yellow operates only a longhaul business in 1989 , the latest year for which revenue comparisons are available , the top four companies accounted for 47 percent of the total revenue of the top 100 trucking companies in 1980 , the same four had had just 29 percent of the market there s been a shakeout with the leading carriers grabbing a bigger and bigger piece of the pie , said graeme lidgerwood , a transportation analyst at cs first boston in new york and , she added , these giants will get stronger yet as new entrants find it more difficult to raise the capital they need to grow and take advantage of the cost savings that size can bring full loads and not differing logistics in a split market the american trucking associations divides the industry into two major segments full truckload and lessthanfull truckload , dropping ups totals from the brokendown segments because of the special nature of that operation many companies compete in both markets although the lessthanfulltruckload segment is larger by far the logistics of sending a fully loaded truck containing goods from a single company to a single destination are quite different from those of routing lessthanfull truckloads to several destinations in the latter case , trucks sometimes load and unload packages at depots all over the country before making it to their final stops as might be expected , consolidated , roadway and yellow dominate the lessthanfull segment of the market together , they control 45 percent of that market in the less concentrated fulltruckload segment , the four leading companies , all far smaller than the lessthanfull giants , together controlled just 11 percent of that segment top among the fulltruckload four is schneider national carriers inc , which had 832 million in revenues last year , based in green bay , wis jb hunt , with 580 million is in lowell , ark builders transport inc , with 252 million , is in camden , sc and werner inc , with 240 million , is in omaha , neb none of these carriers were in the top 100 before the industry was deregulated littleguy growth startups proliferate despite failure rate unlike the airline industry , where very few new entrants have emerged to prosper since the early days of deregulation , there are still hundreds of new trucking companies , many quite small , springing up every year as brighteyed entrepreneurs set out to seek their fortunes indeed , the number of trucking companies in all three categories set up by the interstate commerce commission has proliferated from 18 , 045 in 1980 to 33 , 283 in 1985 and 45 , 791 in 1990 the mortality rate of these carriers remains high , as the new companies find out the hard way that it s not easy , said russell b capelle jr , director of statistical analysis for the american trucking associations many disappear within months but the actual number of failures is declining from a high of over 1 , 500 companies a year shutting down between 1985 to 1986 , the rate has dropped to about 1 , 200 failures a year , he said the squeeze ahead railroads , soft rates and pay hikes as others have stumbled , the big three yellow , roadway and consolidated often found they could buy equipment and terminals at bargain prices they also hired the pick of their ailing competitors' drivers and took over the failed companies' customers all helped consolidate their dominance of the industry and ms lidgerwood of cs first boston is now wondering whether another round of shakeouts is in the making i'm very disturbed that there is continuing pressure on rates , she said an increase of 5 percent in january of 1990 by the lessthanfulltruckload carriers just about evaporated and several others were often undercut , she said another stab at 55 percent rise last month , she said , may not yield as much revenue as expected because of discounting many large companies , hurting in the weak economy , are scouring the industry for low bidders , pitting trucker against trucker in an everrougher market

manboxinzhai , china dr su ke faces little risk of malpractice suits , but there are other hazards of working as a doctor in a remote chinese village like this one when we go out and try to inoculate babies , some of the peasants are very frightened and hide their kids , dr su , a 46yearold man with a graying crew cut , explained in a tone of sorrow or they turn their dogs on us to bite us and drive us away even if dr su manages to get his needle into the derriere of a local child a task made easier since none of the village children wear clothes then he is as likely to win censure as gratitude we give them injections against measles , and then the kid gets a cold and they come and complain , he said they say , 'you promised that my child would n't get sick ! ' dr su and hundreds of thousands of people like him are the inheritors of the legacy of the barefoot doctors who charmed the west in maoist days these days they wear sandals , and they are far better trained than in the past , but fundamentally the task is the same to transport medicine from the textbooks and laboratories to the villages , where threequarters of chinese live chicken pox , chest pains here in manboxinzhai , a village of 400 in the xishuangbanna district of southwest china , dr su worked out of a small medicine box one day recently to minister to a variety of patients there was a little boy with chicken pox , a young man with a swollen leg and an older man with chest pain on the way to this village , he has stopped off to pull a young woman s tooth dr su runs a small clinic 20 miles away , but he and the other doctors periodically hike off into the distance to treat peasants in the villages sometimes these house calls can last weeks and take a doctor from village to village china has made enormous strides in medical care in the four decades since the communist revolution , and in some ways the health profile of the population resembles that of a developed country more than that of a country with a percapita income of 300 a year the world bank lists life expectancy among chinese at 70 years , compared with 76 in the united states and 58 in india but there are some indications that the gains in health care have slowed in the last dozen years , at the same time that china has opened to the world and doubled its percapita income 'barefoot doctors' by some counts , for example , infant mortality has shown little improvement in recent years at last count , 31 chinese infants out of 1 , 000 die before the age of 1 , compared with 10 in the united states and 97 in india , according to world bank statistics the main reason for the slowdown in healthcare improvements in recent years appears to be the collapse of the commune system , which used to provide rudimentary health care , usually free of charge , throughout rural china after the communes were dismantled in the early 1980 s , some barefoot doctors returned to their farm work or started businesses , and many villages were left without adequate health care , or else had to pay more for it it also became more difficult to mobilize people for large preventive medicine projects everybody participated in inoculation programs or hygiene projects in those days , because if you did n't then they 'd be docked work points , dr su said but these days it s hard to do public projects , like mosquito extermination to reduce malaria the problems of rural health care can be seen in the life of mi de , a 29yearold woman who lives in this village she sat barefoot on a bench weaving cloth for clothes as she described in a matteroffact tone how her first child died soon after birth seven years ago her 5yearold son has not had a medical checkup since he was 13 days old , but as the boy looked on with a solemn face she explained that this was not a problem he s been very healthy , so he does n't need to see a doctor , ms mi said , adding that he had been inoculated against several diseases in another concession to modernity , a midwife was present when ms mi gave birth to her third child , a son , in december in the past , only her mother was present when she gave birth but throughout her pregnancy last year , ms mi never saw a doctor as he makes his rounds , dr su tries to combat traditional attitudes as much as diseases themselves he scolded two 18yearold women who are cradling their newborn babies , complaining that they are too young to be raising families and he reproached the village s health officer , sha piao , for failing to implement a new policy for prenatal checkups you 're too busy getting ready to build your new house to look after the pregnant women , dr su said sternly mr sha smiled wanly and explained that he would get to it in the next couple of days what with building the new house , i 'll be too busy to do the health work this year , mr sha said family planning the new program that mr sha promised to begin calls for registering all pregnant women and charging them an obligatory fee of 2 they then are to receive three prenatal checkups gynecologists will go from village to village to perform some checkups , and in other areas many women may have to go to the clinic for their checkups when it is time for the birth , the woman is encouraged to use a midwife with government training if she does , the government will pay the midwife s 40cent fee and return 160 to the mother as a bonus but if she does not use the approved midwife , then her 2 fee is forfeited in some areas , this will also help the government track pregnancies for its onechild family planning policy , but here in the ethnic minority areas of southwest china the family planning programs are implemented very loosely one difficulty that doctors have in this part of china is that urinary tract and gynecological problems are common , but are commonly attributed in the local folklore to promiscuity so women are sometimes humiliated and furious when they are told they have such problems so when we make our diagnosis , said the longsuffering dr su , they are outraged and do nothing but yell at us photo dr su ke and hundreds of thousands of people like him are the inheritors of the legacy of the barefoot doctors of china he pulled a young woman s tooth near manboxinzhai in the xishuangbanna district \( nicholas d kristof the new york

patrick ewing did n't give up on bernard king he did n't trade rod strickland for maurice cheeks he did n't relinquish firstround draft picks for stopgap veterans kiki vandeweghe , gerald henderson and jawann oldham he did n't hand johnny newman over to charlotte true , he became close friends with kenny walker , but he did n't waste a high firstround draft choice on him he did n't change coaches six times and general managers four times in six years he did n't pay mark jackson 2 million a year he did n't force the knicks to agree in 1985 to what was then his outrageous 10year contract there seems to be a widespread notion that ewing s contract is the paramount reason the knicks are n't very good if only ewing would take less money , the knicks would be on the interstate to title contention if only he would sacrifice , as have other superstars in the national basketball association , to let his team manipulate the daunting and dreaded salary cap magic johnson s deferring 100 , 000 to allow the already loaded los angeles lakers to acquire terry teagle is one thing in the case of the knicks , even if ewing could agree to play free next season , they would still be in a fine mess there are no freeagent shortcuts out there there will be no walt bellamy and howard komives for dave debusschere deals ewing aside , the knicks players are of limited skills and dubious worth that has nothing to do with ewing but everything to do with why he is pursuing restricted free agency through arbitration , scheduled for july 22 as i look back on what happened here the last six years , knicks president david checketts said , i feel there is responsibility on both sides , management s and patrick s things could have been done differently by both to improve the situation i look at boston , where larry bird took less money over the last couple of years so the celtics could sign reggie lewis and brian shaw at 4 million , patrick was making so much more than everyone else for a long time it was restrictive maybe something could have been done i do n't know that anyone ever asked would n't you know it \? for at least the first five of those six years , no one did whose fault was that \? let us deal quickly with the issues of the agent , david falk , and the extension he and ewing reportedly rejected , one averaging 54 million per season agents are the wellpaid antiheroes of professional sports there are no goodguy agents how insidious they are depends on how much leverage their clients have david falk would not be such a bad guy if he represented only trent tucker how much should ewing be paid \? his team has never come close to a championship but cleveland forward john williams s level of play has never approached ewing s , and he makes 4 million rookies who have yet to convert a free throw will command at least 25 million the system does not preach , it merely pays , and how much often has nothing to do with true worth , whatever that is , and championship rings it has been demonstrated thoroughly that centers are no longer the driving forces of the nba none of the three socalled franchise centers ewing , hakeem olajuwon and david robinson survived the first round of this year s playoffs unrelenting criticism of ewing currently centers on his failure to carry the knicks beyond the second round ewing has n't because he is a center in a league dominated by multiskilled forwards and guards , and not because he is a loser falk insists the move toward arbitration is not about money , it is about principle actually , it is about neither if this were about money , ewing would take the annual payoff of 54 million and the local endorsements and he would call it a draw there are few teams out there who do n't have salary cap headaches of their own few , if any , can pay ewing as well as the knicks but ewing negotiated for this window of freeagent opportunity six years ago he has every right to pursue it , just as the knicks had every right to attempt to trade him to the los angeles clippers last winter if ewing does not try for free agency now , his next chance to go elsewhere , should he so desire , will come in four years , along with his 33d birthday the knicks say they are not angry with ewing they say they are concerned about the nasty news media response ewing , likewise , should bear no malice toward checketts , who inherited this mess he hired pat riley to coach he drafted greg anthony , a nice college player but the knicks are no better now than when the season ended the way ewing sees it , there is no timetable for this team s success his career clock is ticking why would n't he explore the possibility that a portland or a golden state might sign him to an offer sheet with the hope that the knicks could be pressured into a trade instead of matching the offer \? that s how the knicks got king , their previous franchise player , from golden state now it is the knicks who must deal with the peripatetic yearnings of an unhappy star ewing does n't want to be traded he wants the chance to choose where he plays perhaps , after he found out what s available , he might even choose new york
the question of who will pay for sharply escalating medical costs employers or employees has replaced haggling over wages as the most contentious issue in labor negotiations , management and union representatives say health care was once a fringe benefit , something to be considered after the critical matter of pay raises but as health costs have increased rapidly in the last three to five years , medical benefits have quickly taken center stage in collective bargaining and have often been the prime reason for strikes , many labor experts say at the museum of modern art in manhattan , for example , long and difficult negotiations that included a twohour walkout by 100 unionized staff members were concluded only after an elaborate compromise was reached on sharing medical costs at indian point no 3 , a nuclear power plant in westchester county , employees worked without a contract for almost two years until the wrangling over medical benefits was resolved last month one of the most prolonged and disruptive strikes in the new york metropolitan area in recent years was over health benefits the 17week walkout in 1989 by 60 , 000 workers at the nynex corporation it is the impasse area , said john phillips , a professor of health science at the state university of new york at brockport and an expert in the economics and politics of health care in my judgment it has become the most difficult issue to resolve some unions have been able to keep all their medical benefits , although many labor leaders admit that they have done so at the expense of better wage packages many other unions have made concessions to employers , who have been aggressively seeking to share more of the burden of doubledigit inflation in medical care the concessions have taken many forms increasing deductible expenses , having employees pay more of covered medical expenses , making them pay some of the cost of premiums for family coverage and sometimes eliminating family coverage altogether it s a battle every time , said jack sheinkman , president of the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union , which represents 250 , 000 workers in the united states , canada and puerto rico i'm not going to lie to you and say we 've held the line every time often it has led to strikes the most recent statistics come from a study last year by the service employees international union , which found that nearly twothirds of the 43 major walkouts in the united states in 1989 were caused by disputes over health benefits thirty percent of the 66 major strikes in 1986 were over medical care , the study found but even that does not fully measure the impact on collective bargaining over the last five years the union study determined that the largest , most prolonged and most bitter strikes of 1989 including the one against nynex and a ninemonth walkout by miners at the pittston coal company in virginia , west virginia and kentucky were over management attempts to reduce health coverage or to have employees shoulder more of the cost 'the major obstacle' these walkouts , while the most public and emotionally charged manifestations of difficulties over health care , reflect a broad problem for most companies and unions it has increasingly become the major obstacle in collective bargaining in virtually every industry , said jan d pierce , a vice president of the communications workers of america in charge of new york , new jersey , connecticut and five other northeastern states health care spending increased nationally by more than 10 percent a year through much of the 1980 s , and it rose about 105 percent in each of the last three years , according to the federal health care financing administration the federal government , as well as many state governments , have sought to limit increases in healthcare costs by shifting some of the burden to the private sector for example , companies that provide medical benefits must insure employees older than 65 they used to be covered by medicare as a result , some companies have endured increases of as much as 20 to 30 percent a year in their premiums , professor phillips said tab none want to pick up in the new york region , companies have typically faced annual increases of 10 to 20 percent in their medical plans , said thomas e burns , nynex s corporate director for benefits and compensation many business officials said that they had little choice but to try to shift more to their employees union leaders and their members , accustomed to improvements in their medical coverage over many decades , have generally resisted picking up more of the tab the unions that struck nynex in 1989 , the communications workers of america and the international brotherhood of electricians , took great satisfaction in a settlement that kept their medical benefits intact last month , the communications workers reached an agreement with nynex on their next contract , nearly a year before the current one expires the unusually early settlement was possible , mr pierce of the union said , because the company decided not to press for healthcare concessions concessions from unions
new delhi , june 9 with the nehru family out of the running and a new age of politics about to begin in india , two popular leaders in important states are emerging as kingmakers sharad pawar , the congress party chief minister of india s richest industrial state , maharashtra , and jyoti basu , the communist chief minister of west bengal , already qualify as leaders who may fill the power vacuum created by the assassination last month of rajiv gandhi , the former prime minister whose family had long controlled the congress party national elections were suspended when mr gandhi was killed on may 21 they are to resume wednesday , with the probable result murky when the votes are counted a week from today , both leaders , but especially mr pawar , could be in the pool of candidates for prime minister it all depends on how the voters rank the three major political forces contesting the election the conservative , prohindu bharatiya janata party the nowamorphous congress party , and the national frontleft front alliance , a polyglot collection held together by a call for social revolution everything is negotiable who leads any of these three blocs now is becoming less important by the hour , as politicians gird themselves for an intense period of horse trading since everyone expects a close election result , everything party loyalty most of all is negotiable because the bharatiya janata party is a disciplined organization with little interest in diluting itself to win power , and because virtually all other parties in the race say they will have no truck with hindu fundamentalism , the hindubased group is out of coalition maneuvering but if the party were to win a majority , either lal kishan advani or atal bihari vajpayee , the former considered more conservative and the latter more liberal , would claim the prime ministership beyond that , everything is in flux the assassination of mr gandhi had two important political effects it removed the nehrugandhi family from its traditional place at the head of the congress party , and it provided unprecedented new political opportunities for the south and west of india every congress party prime minister , and all but one prime minister from any party , have come from one northern state uttar pradesh in the first round of this election , on may 20 , the congress party apparently did not do well in the north if the party s plurality in parliament is to be maintained , the south and west , where voting is to take place on wednesday and friday , will have to save the day mr pawar s maharashtra , with bombay as its capital , is the west s largest state in the south , no state has a congress party politician of his stature p v narasimha rao , the party president elected after sonia gandhi rejected the job , has none of mr pawar s appeal gandhi was a rival in addition , mr pawar is now free of the pressures he endured under mr gandhi , who tried and failed to undermine his state government early this year because the chief minister was correctly perceived as a rival mr pawar is foursquare behind industrial liberalization and modernization many who saw mr gandhi as a liberal influence are happy to shift their allegiance to mr pawar the situation involving mr basu is more complex in his state , west bengal , the congress party is unsure of its fate in the elections and is looking for possible coalition partners a secular organization , it has all but ruled out the fundamentalist bharatiya janata party as a partner it may be able to break off a chunk of the janata dal , the leading party of the national front , which under v p singh defeated mr gandhi s government in 1989 mr singh and other leaders were once members of the congress party but were expelled by mr gandhi recently , however , the congress party has seemed to put its hopes on an alliance with the left , an old partnership that fell apart after a state of emergency was declared and civil rights suspended by prime minister indira gandhi in 1975 at the same time , the communists and mr basu are reaffirming their ties to mr singh s national front most indian analysts think that they could swing either way if the communists emerge from the election holding the balance of power in parliament , mr basu may be projected as their prime ministerial choice or as a candidate for another important cabinet ministry photo with the national elections set to resume on wednesday , voters were searched as they arrived to hear subodh kant sahay , india s interior minister , speak saturday in punjab a day earlier , mr sahay had escaped an assassination attempt in the state \( reuters \)
montrachet it was an audacious move when montrachet opened its doors in 1985 on a drab block south of canal street it may be hard to imagine today , but back then fine restaurants in tribeca were as

philadelphia , feb 26 fire officials continued to search today for the cause of the weekend fire that badly damaged a 38story highrise office building here , while engineers pondered whether the scorched and charred structure was worth rehabilitating the city s fire marshall , robert c wauhop , said it was too early to pinpoint the origin of the blaze , which took the lives of three firefighters when a number of fire safety systems failed we will have to dig down through all the debris layer by layer , he added at a late afternoon news conference we have no basis to suspect anything , such as arson and we have no reason to eliminate anything richard i rubin and company , the agent for the building , said it had called in engineering consultants to help determine what to do with the structure , known as one meridian plaza and situated in the heart of downtown philadelphia , next to city hall damage over 100 million when determinations can be made , we will be sharing them , a company press release stated fire officials have estimated damage at more than 100 million , or roughly twothirds of the 160 million mortgage on the structure the city s fire commissioner , roger m ulshafer , said monday that the fire had not damaged the building s main frame but that there was so much damage to the general structure that it probably would take longer to repair it than to tear it down and reconstruct it no major highrise in this country has ever been torn down because of fire damage two years ago in los angeles , a fire swept through part of a 62story bank building , causing extensive charring on four floors and leaving the rest of the building covered in soot and soaked with thousands of gallons of water but the owners concluded that repairs , even though extensive and timeconsuming , would be much cheaper than a new building the final cost 52 million shortage of inspectors the city s commissioner of licenses and inspections , don kligerman , promised a full investigation of the way the city inspects building safety systems to determine if there had been any slippage in the case of the latest fire , the worst highrise fire in the nation in the past four years in recent years , the inspection agency has been called lax by some city officials but mr klingerman said today that he was confident his investigation would find his department had done a good job in examining one meridian plaza but he added that the city s tight budget had left his department short of personnel we need about a third more inspectors to have the level of thoroughness we would like , he said a member of the city council , james j tayoun , called for new fire ordinances to head off future highrise fires he said the city s requirements for sprinklers were not tough enough , noting that one meridian plaza was equipped with only a few sprinklers but nevertheless was considered in compliance with regulations danger of facade falling the fire began on the 22d floor of the 18yearold building late saturday and swept up to the 30th floor over the next 19 hours before it was brought under control by late today , the police still had the entire block surrounding one meridian plaza roped off fire officials said there was a danger that some of the building s facade might fall no one except safety officials and engineers were allowed to enter the structure , and three other office buildings in the block were also closed pending emergency repair of the facade over the next few days more than 2 , 500 office workers were affected the 27 tenants of one meridian plaza , mostly banks , insurance companies , investment consultants , lawyers and accountants , may be locked out for many weeks , perhaps permanently if a decision is made to demolish and rebuild the highrise by the conglomerate of insurance companies , real estate investors and pension funds that owns it little but ashes so far , none of the tenants have been permitted to enter the building to recover records or other valuables when they are permitted to enter , those who occupied the heavily burned floors will find little except ashes to take away , fire officials said many tenants who occupied floors above and below the fire will find their offices heavily damaged by smoke and water we were on the thirtysecond floor and my guess is that even though we probably were n't burned out , we 'll find we were pretty badly hit , said w thacher brown , president of 1838 investment advisors , an investment company but we 're recovering quickly , mr brown added we had almost all of our records stored on computer disks that were kept in another fireproof building mr brown s company has rented space in a building just across the street from his old office , no difficult task in a city where the office real estate market has long been glutted other tenants forced from one meridian plaza are also relocating , though not all have been able to reprint their lost , damaged or inaccessible records we 're so close to the old building , mr brown said , that if any of the facade falls off , it s likely to hit us one of the lessons of this fire in this computer age is to always keep a duplicate of your records stored somewhere else and keep the dupe current
one week after new york s big weekend at the races , spiced with classic matchups , photo finishes and memorable performances , it seems certain that nothing is certain in the confused world of racehorse medicine the big issue for weeks before the belmont weekend was lasix , the medication that is used to control bleeding caused by overexertion in horses the medication is banned in new york state , so none of the 11 horses in the belmont stakes ran with lasix , and none of them lost because of it but three of the horses apparently ran with an influenza virus that was n't even detected while everybody was arguing about lasix the box score on lasix seems to be this hansel , who raced five times in a row with lasix , raced brilliantly for a mile and a half and won the belmont stakes without it he won by a head over strike the gold , who has never taken it festin , who raced the last three times on lasix in other states , raced from last place to first and won the nassau county handicap by seven lengths over gervazy , who has never taken the medication but jolie s halo , who also never took lasix , got into a speed duel with farma way for nearly one mile and then fell back into 10th and last place and went home bleeding for the first time in his career meadow star , who has never taken the medication , ran a sizzling match against lite light on sunday in the mother goose stakes and won by an eyebrow in a melodrama lite light , who had run her last six races with lasix , was found to be bleeding slightly after the race but her blazing performance could hardly have been better , with or without medication it shows , dr manuel a gilman said , that you ca n't make sweeping statements about lasix or any other medication i'm proud of the way they all performed last weekend , and most of the top horses came here after running on lasix in other states gilman , the chief veterinarian at new york s tracks for 38 years , now serves as one of the three stewards monitoring every race here he believes that trainers frequently give lasix or other drugs to their horses because everyone else seems to be doing it , and nobody likes to lose an edge , if that s what it is one of his colleagues , the eminent veterinarian dr william o reed , who operated on ruffian , hoist the flag and other racing superstars , also suspects that trainers often administer medication because it s there lasix has no effect on correcting the cause of a horse s bleeding problem , he said the other day at his hospital near belmont park it s used by the mass of trainers , but it s not the panacea everybody thinks it is the more i see , the more i agree with new york state s strictures on lasix in florida , we found many horses bleeding through the lasix in new york , we 're seeing many horses winning without lasix besides , lasix will mask other drugs , and that s why we 're so adamant about not using it in new york meanwhile , the belmont barns are coping with their coughing problem these days , and there s no argument there it s a strain of influenza that usually affects 2yearold horses but the virus apparently infected three of the 3yearolds who ran in the belmont lost mountain , who ran seventh subordinated debt , ninth , and green alligator , 10th and for some reason , the betting public had rallied round green alligator , making him the 4to1 second choice with hansel while strike the gold reigned as the 2to1 favorite what we 're dealing with is influenza , reed said we see it every year , but there are many different strains it s not debilitating they may run , they will cough there s no epidemic it s a minor thing if you do n't have the horse racing it s a major thing if he s racing today but there is no symbol on the pastperformance chart reporting that a horse has been coughing so , what about the betting public s right to know \? i do n't know if you 'd find it in the first place , reed said you can scope any horse after a race and find some mucous in his bronchial tubes but the exertion of racing may have caused it so , it s a little misleading to say three horses ran in the belmont with a problem but they ran seventh , ninth and 10th even then , reed said he did not think their virus handicapped them in the race if you ran the belmont again tomorrow , reed said , the same three horses would probably finish 123 recordouting for lure performance of the week lure , a 2yearold son of danzig and grandson of alydar , making his debut thursday , set a belmont track record by hustling five furlongs in 561 5 seconds , knocking threefifths of a second off the mark set in 1986 by bucks best and matched on may 31 this year by celeste cielo the colt , owned by claiborne farm and trained by shug mccaughey , was ridden by jerry bailey , who also rode fly so free , hansel and meadow star to their major victories last weekend in the feature yesterday , the new york handicap , the favored foresta won for the third time in three starts this year when she took the lead in the homestretch and scored by nearly two lengths over crockadore , who had nearly two more lengths on flaming torch the winner , a 5yearold daughter of alydar owned by the loblolly stable and trained by tom bohannan , carried high weight of 121 pounds under angel cordero jr and covered the mile and a quarter in 1 591 5 on the inner turf course she paid 480 to 2 to win

los angeles , june 4 one day in late 1987 , callie khouri , a producer of popmusic videos who had never written a film script , picked up her notebook and wrote screenplay idea two women go on a crime spree they 're leaving town , both leaving behind their jobs and families they kill a guy , rob a store , get hooked up with a young guy the odds were stacked against her , but ms khouri s initial jottings found their way to the screen as thelma and louise , starring susan sarandon and geena davis as a pair of arkansas women on the lam from the law and the men in their lives giving a feminine twist to a pair of alltoofamiliar hollywood genres , the road picture and the buddy picture , the film has received outstanding reviews and quickly become an audience favorite , earning 12 million in less than two weeks but thelma and louise , directed by ridley scott , is more than simply the first sleeper hit of the summer movie season or a personal triumph for ms khouri it has also , to her astonishment , become the center of a growing polemic gossip columnists , talkshow hosts and a slew of others have attacked it for what they say is gratuitous violence , for its poor female role models and for deliberately presenting men in the worst possible light feminism or malebashing \? i hear people getting their knickers in a big twist about what this movie is supposed to be , ms khouri said in an interview the other day at her home here there s so much talk about whether it s a feminist screenplay , whether it s a malebashing movie it s none of those things i am a feminist , so clearly it is going to have my point of view but this is a movie about outlaws , and it s not fair to judge it in terms of feminism people say thelma and louise are not role models , she continued well , they were never intended as role models , for god s sake i do n't want anybody doing anything they saw in this movie they are outlaws who should be punished and are i do not justify their actions ms khouri credits her husband , the writer and producer david warfield , for originating what she thinks is the most accurate description of thelma and louise '9 to 5' meets 'easy rider' that a controversy has erupted around her film , and not the countless others like it that have featured male characters breaking all the rules , smacks of a double standard , she said here we are in an age when a guy like andrew dice clay is filling madison square garden , and they 're asking me if i'm writing a feminist revenge flick , she said incredulously it just seems ludicrous in the face of all that s going on out there to ask whether this is hostile toward men i do n't think that it is i think it is hostile toward idiots the thelma and louise script was , in fact , a conscious effort to counter what ms khouri said she sees as hollywood s tendency to limit women s roles to easily identifiable types such as bimbos , whores and nagging wives writing over a sixmonth period while continuing to produce popmusic videos , occasionally consulting a howtowriteascreenplay book for guidance , ms khouri strove for a delicate balance of humor and social commentary i did want the movie to be fun , and for people to laugh , she said but i also wanted , as a woman , to walk out of the theater not feeling dirty and worthless , for a change , not feeling like i had compromised the character of women , because that is one area where women really get shortchanged in movies so many times you go to the movies , and what woman up there would you want to be \? none of them an inveterate filmgoer , ms khouri vividly recalls some experiences with particular distaste she was appalled , she said , by beverly hills cop ii , particularly when that guy is being chased around by brigitte nielsen , and he finally shoots her in the head and says , 'women ! ' the audience went crazy it s not that it offended me it scared me not long after ms khouri finished her script and showed it to a friend for comment , it became the talk of hollywood or at least the talk of agents with female clients the script made its way to mr scott , who has directed such glossy fare as alien , blade runner and black rain , and quickly attracted the attention of four studios and big stars like goldie hawn , cher and michelle pfeiffer before ending up at mgm pathe , which promised not to force ms khouri and mr scott to tinker with the script or change the dramatic conclusion i had been hearing about this great script with not one but two great parts for women , which is a very unusual event , said ms davis , who ended up in the role of thelma i first saw it about a year before we began shooting and just loved both the parts it s not often you see parts for two fully realized women characters and have a movie be about women s adventures and journeys ms khouri , 33 years old , is no stranger to the world of workingclass southern women portrayed in thelma and louise she grew up in paducah , ky , and majored in drama at purdue university she has supported herself as a receptionist , salesclerk and waitress in restaurants and bars in nashville and out here when i needed something to fall back on she says she has endured the condescension and many of the same slights that so infuriate thelma and louise from the way she writes , you could tell she knew these characters inside out , said ms davis , who won an academy award as best supporting actress for the accidental tourist in 1988 i knew that if i needed to find out the color of the toothpaste thelma used , i could call callie and she would know what every woman knows unlike thelma and louise , ms khouri said she had never been raped but , she said i 've definitely felt threatened i 've found myself in situations where saying no was not doing the trick , and i did n't have a gun it s horrible for that reason , she thinks the controversial scene in which louise kills thelma s assailant is a very cathartic scene for women so , she says , is the scene in which thelma and louise take revenge on a truck driver who has been harassing them and making lewd gestures by shooting up his gasoline truck the scene has also drawn a strong reaction from both women and men it s definitely accurate , said mimi polk , who produced the film with mr scott i 've driven from minnesota to florida with eight girls , and believe you me , those guys exist and are pretty rude ms khouri added there is not a woman in the world who has not dealt with that guy he is out there in force , but when you 're walking down the street and guys do that , what you 're supposed to do as a woman is ignore it making up for '99 percent' ms khouri takes exception , however , to assertions that she has created no sympathetic male characters in thelma and louise and has gone out of her way to portray men as bullies , nags , betrayers , thieves and liars the detective played by harvey keitel is the moral sense of the audience , she said he is us you ca n't do a movie without villains , she added you have to have something for the heroines , or antiheroines , to go up against , and i was n't going to contrive some monstrous female along with ms khouri , ms davis said she feels a certain sense that turnabout is fair play even if this were the most manbashing movie ever made , saying , 'let s all us women get guns and kill men , ' it would n't even begin to make up for the 99 percent of all movies where the women are there to be caricatured as bimbos or to be skinned and decapitated , ms davis said if you 're feeling threatened , you 're identifying with the wrong character photos above , geena davis , right , and susan sarandon in thelma and louise callie khouri , left , who wrote the screenplay , describes the film as a movie about outlaws that should not be judged in terms of feminism \( mgm pathe bart bartholomew for the new york times \)

ann arbor , mich although mikhail gorbachev insisted yesterday that neither the internal nor the external policy has changed in the soviet union , the truth is that everything has changed the soviet interventions in lithuania and latvia have demolished any lingering hopes that mikhail gorbachev could transform the soviet union into a free association of republics in essence , the soviet union has ceased to exist the great question now , which will be played out over the next months and years , is what will emerge in its stead before the jan 13 invasion of lithuania , there was still hope that the republics could attain independence peacefully and go on to freely establish economic ties that would benefit them all this still may occur , but not under the leadership of mr gorbachev , who has clearly chosen to save the empire by falling back on the army , secret police and central bureaucracy while the crackdowns in lithuania and latvia mark the end of the reformist gorbachev era , they do not portend , as some are saying , a return to the old ways given the political change that has already occurred and the country s sickly economy which might collapse entirely following a countrywide crackdown repression is not a solution the current trouble can be traced to early last year , when the communist party abdicated its constitutional claim to rule that had been based on its alleged insight into the laws of history this left no justification , for holding the peoples of the soviet union together by force under a central government in moscow that government lacked any alternative , democratic legitimacy the soviet union might have been preserved by a popular , democratic election of a representative assembly that would in turn agree on a constitution binding all but none of this was done the central authorities in moscow never acquired a democratic or constitutional foundation the only democratic elections took place in some republics , regions and cities , most successfully in the baltic states it is revealing and tragic that mr gorbachev and his reactionary allies in moscow have chosen to apply force precisely against nations that have behaved in a civilized , lawabiding way , free of terrible interethnic violence it is revealing because the baltic states are defenseless , a fact that doubtless was not lost on a military that will think twice before invading one of the larger republics , such as georgia and azerbaijan , where the citizenry is more heavily armed it is tragic because mr gorbachev has failed to understand that the baltic states would have made excellent allies of russia would have been another finland had they been allowed to become independent and we know that finland has helped the soviet union economically without in any way threatening its security although vilnius in 1991 resembles prague in 1968 and budapest in 1956 , there is something completely new in the present situation the brutal action in lithuania was condemned not only by national democratic movements in the republics but also by some of the establishment most importantly , the leader of the russian republic , boris yeltsin , has condemned the action moreover , mass demonstrations in moscow and other major cities show that his stand has popular support among russians mr yeltsin s move is consistent with a policy he has quietly and steadfastly pursued since his election last spring drawing on his relatively democratic credentials , he has defined himself as a spokesman for russia , not a claimant to leadership in the soviet union in his travels to nonrussian republics , mr yeltsin has been building the foundation for a new relationship between russia and the republics not only has he recognized the baltic states but , during a littlenoticed trip to kiev in november , he signed a treaty recognizing the ukraine as a sovereign state and russia s equal a move without precedent in russianukrainian relations mr yeltsin and his advisers understand that the political independence of the republics does not preclude their economic cooperation with russia unlike mr gorbachev , they realize that ethnic affairs in the former soviet union have been transformed into international relations , and that political liberalization and economic reforms must proceed from this fact events in the baltics have destroyed any hope that economic reform will be promoted by the center mr gorbachev s new allies oppose the market and private property , and he has removed the reformers from the leadership any further reform must come from the republics what is likely to happen next \? as the soviet economy declines , we can expect a more severe and brutal version of the polish crisis of 1981 , which followed gen wojciech jaruzelski s declaration of martial law throughout the 1980 s , general jaruzelski tried to institute economic reforms without political liberalization eventually , he gave up mr gorbachev s problems run much deeper , since he also has to deal with republics demanding independence in the soviet version of this crisis , reactionaries in the center will battle reformers in the republics as that struggle unfolds , a key role will go to mr yeltsin , because he alone among the major soviet figures active today has the credibility and vision to offer a way out of the chaos that seems likely to become mr gorbachev s chief legacy the latest turn of events presents a dilemma for policymakers in the us and the west they understandably wish to keep dealing with mr gorbachev , whose foreign policy has , to say the least , served western interests yet , they have to recognize that to support mr gorbachev and condone the repression in the baltic states is to harm the forces of political and economic reform in all the republics in this respect , yesterday s decision by the european parliament to block a 1 billion aid package was only half right actions aimed at penalizing the center should be accompanied by gestures of support for the democratic aspirations of the people drawing
los angeles , march 20 as rodney g king was beaten by los angeles police officers on march 3 , other officers seized one of mr king s passengers , bryant allen , who says he was manhandled and taunted in a racially motivated attempt to provoke him in an interview , mr allen said he feared for his life as he was made to crawl along the ground , hearing at the same time his friend s screams and the sounds of police batons from the far side of the car he was screaming , stop ! ' said mr allen , who said he heard but did not see his friend being beaten then he kind of quit , and all you could hear was like bones being broken , a crunching , like a whip sound in the first complete account of the incident from one who was there , mr allen , 25 years old , said he believed the beating of mr king and the blows directed at him and a second passenger , freddie helms , were racially motivated all three men in the car were black the police officers were white as many as 21 los angeles police officers were present a sergeant and three officers have been indicted on assault charges watching the 7 minutes mr allen s lawyer , john c burton , said he would file a federal civil rights suit mr king s lawyer said tuesday he also would file a suit none of the three men in the car have been charged mr allen tapped his foot slowly as he sat with his lawyer tuesday night , watching for the first time the full sevenminute videotape , which includes the twominute beating that has been shown repeatedly on national television the videotape has led to calls for the resignation of chief daryl f gates and prompted inquiries into the extent of police brutality nationwide speaking quietly , mr allen described mr king s erratic behavior behind the wheel on a night when the three men had been drinking beer and said tension was heightened when mr king had trouble with his seat belt as he was complying with police orders to leave his car he said that at one point a female officer intervened when he himself was threatened with violence she s the one who had her hand out saying i did n't do anything wrong , mr allen recalled she was saying , 'he s the one that had his hands up' an attempt to provoke \? nevertheless , he said , he was kicked and manhandled and threatened by officers who said you want to be like your home boy \? you want to be like your home boy \? he said mr helms was bloody at the end of the evening after apparently being struck on the head with a baton mr allen said he believed that remarks like home boy , along with his physical treatment , were part of an attempt to provoke him they were trying to get me to respond to that , because i'm a black kid , he said asked why else he thought the incident was racial , he added , three blacks in a car , all white policemen , the way they look at us when the beating was over , the police officers left him and mr helms standing by the side of the road , he said they said , 'guess what \? ' i said , 'what \? ' they said , 'you 're in a crips neighborhood' they laughed and took off mr allen said he and his friends , all unemployed , came from a neighborhood claimed by the bloods , a rival to the crips gang friends since boyhood since the incident , he said , he had spoken twice with mr king , who suffered multiple fractures and what his lawyer said may be permanent brain damage mr king initially declined to characterize the incident as racial he and mr king have known each other at least since they were 13 , mr allen said as a boy , he said , mr king , who is also now 25 , enjoyed working on bicycles , and his father taught him to fix automobiles on his recent visits , he said , mr king was having difficulty remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way it sounded like he was talking in riddles , all mixed up , mr allen said as mr allen recalls it , the latenight incident began with the three men speeding down the foothill freeway in northern los angeles at what might have been as fast as 80 miles an hour mr burton said the men had each drunk a 40ounce bottle of old english 800 malt liquor mr burton said , drugs had absolutely nothing to do with this incident medical tests also showed that mr king was free of drugs saw flashing lights after visiting at mr allen s house , the young man said , mr king told his friends he was taking them to a park where he had gone in the past with his father when he saw the flashing lights of a california highway patrol car behind them , mr allen said i told him , 'rodney , pull over , stop' he just kept on going , kept on driving he said mr king continued driving on the freeway for about five minutes , with the patrol car behind them , during which time he continued to urge him to pull over i was scared , he said , adding that he thought his friend was acting odd i was thinking , 'why does n't he pull over \? ' but , mr allen said , he was n't saying nothing , just driving then , he said i thought he was pulling over , but he was going down the offramp we stopped at the stop sign , and then we were driving again i said , 'rodney , pull over' we were still driving , and the lights were flashing i could hear a lot of cars we stopped at a red light and took off again we came to another red light i told him , 'rodney , stop , ' and he finally went to pull over and he stopped in glare of light their small white hyundai was surrounded by police cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights it was at this point , he said , that the other passenger , mr helms , who had been asleep in the front seat , woke up the police ordered us , 'driver , put your hands out the window , ' mr allen continued they said , 'take your left hand outside the door and step out' rodney had the seat belt , and it kind of yanked him back the police were getting nervous too they told him to lie flat down , and he lay flat down mr allen said he and mr helms left the car on the opposite side , beside a large , dark park , and also lay down the police put the handcuffs on me , and that s when i heard rodney screaming , mr allen went on he was screaming like he was getting a whupping when i was little i used to get whuppings this sounded different , like they wanted to hurt him he s a real tough man , and he was like , 'help ! ' he was screaming , stop ! ' 'they made me crawl' after the screaming stopped , he said , he continued to hear the whipping sound of the nightsticks through the clatter of a hovering helicopter police officers in los angeles use standardissue pr24 aluminum nightsticks that are 24 inches long and weigh 27 ounces on the far side of the car , he said , he was ordered to crawl in the direction of the park , his hands still manacled behind him they made me crawl a certain way , to scoot i was flat down i was definitely frightened i thought i was going to get shot or something i thought they were trying to get me to scoot somewhere real dark so they could hurt me i had already been kicked twice later , he said , they slapped me twice against the car , threatening that he could get beaten like his friend , frisking him and covering his face so he could not see what was happening by that time , he said , mr king had stopped screaming i just closed my eyes , mr allen said whatever was happening to him , i did n't want to see photo bryant allen , a passenger in a car driven by rodney g king , said yesterday that he feared for his own life as mr king was being beaten by los angeles police officers mr allen watched a videotape of the incident \( barth bartholomew for the new york times \)

mercantile exchange , by far the biggest singleday drop in history the price at the close yesterday was 40 cents lower than on aug 1 , the day before the invasion of kuwait but a few hours after the markets were closed , a number of iraqi missiles exploded in israel within an hour , oil prices jumped about 2 a barrel in cash deals between companies and investors by late in the day , oil companies , which had promised on wednesday night to freeze prices to protect customers from increases , were instead cutting what they charge distributors and retailers for gasoline and other products exxon

10 cents no panic buying with the early successes in the war against iraq , oil companies , which had reported scattered instances of panic buying over the last few days , said there was none yesterday several traders said last night that the iraqi missile attack had changed the tone of the market somewhat i was quite euphoric today and now i'm not , said michael wilner , the president of the hilltop trading company , a new york energy trading firm and that s the way i think the whole market is going to feel few people expected the price of the world s most widely traded commodity to fall , at least not so fast if yesterday s closing price on the new york mercantile exchange holds in coming months , the nation s foreign oil bill would be reduced by 175 billion in the next year , and saudi arabia s revenue would drop 30 billion a year everyone was surprised i think everyone , including the iraqis , was surprised that the saudi oil facilities were secured so quickly , j robinson west , president of the petroleum finance company , a consulting firm based in washington , said before the iraqi missile attacks at cambridge energy research associates , joseph stanislaw , a parisbased oil expert , said the market had decided during the day s trading that this war is under control yesterday s price change means that about 2 billion in value shifted yesterday from people

you made a killing , said michael mayer , a stock analyst at wertheim schroder if you were long on jan 16 , you more than gave it back the day seemed to set new standards for price instability i thought volatility was when we lost 69 percent in 132 days , said peter beutel of pegasus econometric associates , referring to the period of the price crash in 1982 but we 've lost 33 percent in one

of iraqi counterattack dimmed and the market refocused on the glut of supplies around the world , some of it gathered by consumers in contemplation of a siege , and some by producers who had hoped to make a killing iran , which has put tens of millions of barrels of oil on tankers around the world in anticipation of a price spike , was said yesterday to be looking for buyers but there were few , because of the momentum established by the market nauman barakat , vice president at merrill lynch , said nobody wants to buy in a situation like this the price today may look good compared to the price on the board yesterday , but it may look overpriced tomorrow reports that saudi production has been modestly cut and that iraq had set afire a saudi oil tank complex near kuwait did not slow the record plunge in prices one reason , experts said , was the announcement by western governments that they would release strategic stocks simultaneous with the announcement of the attack on iraq , the bush administration said it would make 112 million barrels a day available for 30 days the department of energy did it right this time , said philip k verleger jr , a visiting fellow at the institute of international economics in washington and a commodities expert the bush administration had previously held off releasing the nation s petroleum reserve , arguing that it would be needed in case of an actual shortage , but the policy attracted bitter criticism in the fall when prices peaked at over 40 a barrel yesterday the volatility was in the other direction for the first time in the history of the exchange , trading was halted for an hour because the price swing hit the 750 limit if the price had dropped another 750 when trading resumed , the price would not have been allowed to fall further that day , under rules instituted by the exchange a few weeks ago sudden and unexpected the turnaround yesterday was so sudden and unexpected that companies that hours before had announced a

deficit would get far bigger , he said loss in potential profits and investorowned oil companies saw a sudden loss in potential profits from drilling but they also saw some increase in refining and marketing profits , because the cost of their raw material , crude , plummeted yesterday , but prices for gasoline and other products will fall more gradually all the majors are goodsized producers , and that sector of their income is going to go way down , said rosario ilacqua , an analyst at rothschild inc but you have to believe that gasoline prices are going to go down slower than crude prices

to the editor randall short credits you could look it up to casey stengel it is true that stengel often said it in monologue with those he called my writers , but it probably originates with james thurber in 1941 thurber published in the saturday evening post a story titled you could look it up it dealt with a baseball manager who in the course of a tight game sent a midget up to the plate because his strike zone would be so small that the opposing pitcher could n't help walking him after the count had reached three balls and no strikes the pitcher , desperately trying to get the ball over the plate , threw such a fat pitch that the midget could n't resist swinging at it the ball dribbled a few feet , and the midget was thrown out the story ended with the manager s setting a new record for throwing a midget thurber s title refers to the fact that the narrator of the story alleges it all really happened and you could look it up , although he does n't say where stengel was not the only baseball man who read the story , or at least heard of it in 1951 bill veeck , the promotionally minded owner of the st louis browns , hired a midget named eddie gaedel to take a turn at bat in a majorleague game forewarned , gaedel did n't swing and duly got his base on balls in the baseball encyclopedia his record appears on one line games , one hits , none bases on balls , one you could look it up dennis flanagan new york
boys town , neb , may 15 like the mickey rooney character in the old movie about this storied home for wayward youths , the newly elected mayor exulted in victory with clenched fists raised high in the air a dream come true for a teenager who has not always known such approval and it was a remarkable victory the new mayor is a girl , the first to be elected head of boys town since it was established 74 years ago after her election earlier this month the new mayor , 16yearold sarah williamson , looked out on a crowd filled with boys and girls of every color and creed and , in a voice that broke with emotion , told them , we are family her brothers and sisters cheered mightily since 1917 , when the rev edward j flanagan founded boys town , it has been a place for troubled youths who had nowhere else to go situated on farm land 10 miles west of omaha , boys town is governed by youths and supported by private contributions it was incorporated as a village in 1936 what began with a 90 loan for five boys has become a nationwide effort with branches around the country boys town , which is nonsectarian , now serves 15 , 000 youths on a budget of 925 million it provides a vast array of programs , from videos on parent skills to a tollfree hot line for homeless and abused children father flanagan liked to say , there s no such thing as a bad boy that motto now extends to girls the first girl came to live at boys town in 1979 but it was not until 1985 that girls were enrolled in significant numbers today , about 40 percent of the 556 young people at boys town are girls the presence of girls has had a humanizing effect on boys town , said the rev val peter , the executive director we have become a village in the fullest sense and for the boys , it has been the first real chance to learn how to be a friend to a girl and that , after all , is the basis for a good marriage , a good family life for the most part , young people come to boys town in three ways most come through state institutions the courts , hospitals and schools and sometimes a parent will call and say they just ca n't cope with a child anymore the third way , father peter said , is that they 'll walk right up the road here and ask , 'will you take me \? ' in many cases they have seen the 1938 movie boys town , in which spencer tracy portrays father flanagan and mickey rooney plays a troubled boy nicknamed whitey who rights himself and rises to become mayor of boys town miss williamson prefers not to talk to outsiders about her route to boys town that s yesterday , she says i want to focus on today and tomorrow she has big plans for tomorrow she hopes to attend medical school and her hopes for the future were reflected in her successful mayoral campaign , when she sent a letter to all the residents of boys town with the slogan , think big vote sarah in guarding her privacy , miss williamson is following what father peter calls the nontherapeutic intervention policy at boys town in other words , unless someone is there to help , it s none of their business for the past 20 years the staff at boys town has been studying its methods and documenting what works best it now serves as a consultant to child care agencies around the country while the staff talks about some modern therapeutic strategies like microbehavioral analysis , much of the theory is rooted in oldfashioned discipline and compassion father peter , who is 57 years old and who formerly taught ethics to medical students at creighton university in omaha , had a talk one day with a newcomer , a toughtalking 16yearold girl with a history of drug problems she had this wild blue and green hair , the priest recalled i told her 'i want you to look like a 16yearold girl , not a 29yearold streetwalker' 'if you 're going to stop taking drugs , it means more than just not putting that chemical in your body , ' he continued 'it s a change in life style if you do n't want to be a druggie , then do n't look like a druggie do n't talk like a druggie do n't hang around druggies' the priest s brow unfurrowed and a smile danced across his face you know what she looks like now \? he asked a 16yearold girl photo sarah williamson celebrating after becoming the first girl to be elected mayor of boys town \( john melingagio boys town \)
dwight gooden will emerge from the shea stadium dugout at 3 08 pm tomorrow and stride to the center of the diamond he will accept the baseball from the umpire and remove his cap for the opening day national anthem gooden will then ascend the mound , and in the final check of the afternoon , turn to face the fielders spread out behind him his eyes will ask if the defense is ready , the most loaded question about the 1991 mets there is concern , and it 'd be kind of ridiculous to pretend otherwise , said david cone , the talented and plainspoken righthander the questions about the defense are legitimate it s what we 've all talked about among ourselves for more than a month it has been a hot topic because it has the potential to be an absolutely incendiary issue sensational defense may not insure titles , but bad defense almost always breeds chaos pitchers work scared fielders , in addition to any physical shortcomings they already have , wind up performing the difficult task of fielding while figuratively looking over their shoulders the exploitation by opponents of subtle deficiencies taking an extra base on a bad arm , laying down a bunt against an indecisive third baseman can snowball into a blatant disrespect of the team on the field last season , the mets , who on paper were for most of the year vastly more proven with the glove than this year s outfit , finished ahead of only two other teams in the national league in team fielding the mets scored more runs than any other national league team and their pitching ranked fourth , but their record of 3242 in games decided by one or two runs was the worst in the national league we 've been through the backstabbing , the finger pointing about the defense , cone said it tore us apart last year is it likely to be perfect this year \? no could it be detrimental \? yes we have to be prepared to play through it there certainly does n't appear much chance of hiding or disguising the liability the mets , through their considerable offseason overhaul of personnel as well as the realignment of the remaining regulars , arguably have question marks at five of the positions in the field vince coleman , the longtime left fielder for the cardinals who has never played center field full time in the major leagues , has been handed the critical chores hubie brooks , the natural infielder who was converted to a right fielder in montreal , admits nothing comes easily for him at the position around the infield , tom herr s range at second is suspect gregg jefferies s instincts and mechanics at third are unpolished and was howard johnson s awesome but abbreviated stewardship of shortstop last season an accurate indicator of how he will fare in the glare of a full season and kevin elster s stare \? everybody knows there are n't many gold gloves there , said tim teufel , the veteran reserve second baseman definitely , the players know that but there are guys with great ability i just do n't see it as being as catastrophic as people are predicting in 1986 , we had ray knight at third and wally backman at second not many gold gloves there , either and we won going away a glance at history , though , suggests that there is a fairly conclusive correlation between success in catching the baseball and success in outracing the competition in the last decade , for instance , 5 of the 10 national league champions finished first in team defense only twice the 1988 dodgers and the 1983 phillies did teams finish in the lower half of the national league in fielding and go on to the world series you look around the national league and offensively we do n't match up , said coleman , a member of the 1985 and 1987 championship st louis teams that finished first in defense both seasons and so defense is going to be a giant aspect of this team it remains to be seen for more than one , how the state of affairs came to be is unfathomable it is one of the central and most popular theories in the clubhouse that the organization s almost blind allegiance to the young and offensively gifted jefferies has forced it to construct and then reconstruct defensive deployments whose shortcomings it would not otherwise tolerate jefferies , a notorious liability at second base , was moved to third last season even before herr was acquired in a september trade one guy out of position forces two or three guys out of position , said frank viola , the starter whose style of pitching requires a solid defense is that fair \? is it going to hold up \? we need all the help we can get much of it , of course , will come from himself and his colleagues on the pitching staff , although the perennially powerful contingent has , like the defense , its share of soft spots sid fernandez probably wo n't uncrank one of his curveballs until july as he recuperates from a broken arm wally whitehurst steps in , but none of the starters will want to leave any game too early , for the relief help other than the allstar closer john franco is green , thin and erratic i do n't want to hand the ball to anybody but franco , said one starter i do n't want a setup guy to have to get me to him just who is going to get these pitchers runs after the departure of darryl strawberry and his bat is another unknown for the 1991 mets kevin mcreynolds , after two straight years of declining offensive numbers , has to pump out the rbi even if he still does n't care to turn up the volume in the clubhouse brooks , trumpeted by the organization as their man in the clutch at the plate and the guy installed as the cleanup hitter by manager bud harrelson , was nonetheless no better than 47th in the national league last year with his 250 average with runners in scoring position i think there s great balance and a quiet consistent threat throughout the lineup , said johnson , the team s sole source of lefthanded power we 've got four or five guns we definitely are all eager to get out and see it work terry puhl , the veteran pinchhitter who said almost nothing before he was released last week , departed with this analysis echoing rather loudly through the clubhouse it s strange the way the team did n't score runs in the spring , said puhl it kind of made you think that when and if this offense works it 'll be when and if everyone hits it s not a coincidence that occurs often in the course of a season it 'll click , insists harrelson there 'll be no room for any more grinding come tomorrow photo dwight gooden may be ready , but the bottom line for the mets will depend on the effectiveness of their defense \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) diagram depicts mets' openingday postion paper \( pg 8 \)
the yankees and athletics played a game yesterday that did not appear as if it would ever end the second inning felt like it was the seventh and the ninth inning felt like the 19th it could have been the steamy weather on a lazy day at yankee stadium causing the senses to fade from the onagain , offagain action more likely , it was the procession of hits , walks and pitching changes clogging up innings , keeping the bullpen phone busy and delaying the outcome for almost four hours before new york finally claimed a 106 victory over oakland there were 16 walks , 27 hits , 16 runs , 24 men left on base , a combined 11 pitchers used and undoubtedly a few hot dog vendors searching for slippers by the time jose canseco made the last out with two runners on in the ninth it was like two games , said matt nokes , who clubbed a threerun home run off dennis eckersley in the eighth to clinch the triumph there were plays from early in the game that i do n't even remember it was so long ago it was too long , said rickey henderson and it was too hot out there do n't blame the yankees if they enjoyed every moment of this marathon affair , no matter how much it dragged on how often do they beat oakland \? not very how often does anyone hit a homer off eckersley \? only two were hit off him last season the yankees not only hit a home run off eckersley but they have now won two of three against the team that had beaten them 16 straight times amid the muddled picture of a game that took too long to complete was a growing confidence on the yankees it all starts with their fiery captain , don mattingly , who exhorted his teammates to beat oakland three out of four games by writing such a message on a clubhouse blackboard before the series so far , so good the saying goes if we beat these guys we should be able to beat anybody , mattingly said playing hard should n't be hard to keep going toying with the yanks as the game stretched into the later innings and the yankees hung on to a lead they acquired with four runs in the first off mike moore , it seemed only a matter of time before oakland would take control the athletics always do , do n't they \? the yankees led by 41 , but oakland sliced the lead to 43 in the third the yankees upped it to 63 after four , but the athletics pushed across two runs and knocked tim leary from the game in the fifth after new york inched ahead , 75 , in the seventh , oakland made the score 76 in the eighth always , the athletics were there , ready to pounce on the yankees and seemingly toying with them usually when we do that , we 're going to find a way to win , said walt weiss but they got the big hits late in the game some breathing room the biggest hit was provided by nokes though eckersley has given up four homers in 14 innings this season , he is still one of the league s premier relievers manager tony la russa wanted eckersley to keep the athletics within one run so they could mount a comeback in the ninth nokes spoiled the plan by hitting a homer that just found the rightfield seats and may have also nicked the foul pole a 76 squeaker became a 106 game and the yankees were breathing easier in two of the last three days , they played a better brand of baseball and one of their old employees noticed the change i see it , i see it , said henderson but he added i do n't think they should get that excited about beating us they still have to beat everyone else inside pitch steve farr pitched one and twothirds innings of scoreless relief for the victory and lee guetterman worked a scoreless ninth steve sax was caught attempting to steal third with none out in the fourth and don mattingly up mattingly struck out on the pitch it was the first time sax had been caught at third in 13 attempts kevin maas followed with a double do n't even ask , manager stump merrill said it s already been discussed the game lasted 3 hours 57 minutes , 19 minutes short of the league record for a nineinning game do the yankees need a third baseman \? let the numbers answer while playing third , randy velarde , mike blowers and jim leyritz are 10 for 88 \( 114 average \) with one homer and two rbi photos yankee catcher matt nokes firing to first to complete double play in the fifth he also went 3 for 5 \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c1 \) matt nokes slugging threerun eighthinning home run yesterday off athletics' ace dennis eckersley earlier , in the second inning , he tagged out terry steinbach trying to score on walt weiss s double to right \( photographs by barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c5 \)
private insurers , which once spread the cost of health insurance equally across all groups , are increasingly charging different rates for different kinds of people the young , single , healthy employee and the couple who both work are benefiting at the expense of the older worker whose spouse does not work and who has illness in the family all told , the difference between the highest and lowest rate paid by employees at the same company for health insurance can now exceed 2 , 000 a year , and is expected to widen sharply in coming years some experts on health economics are troubled by such changes , arguing that everyone should be charged the same for health insurance one might call it the desocialization of american healthcare financing , said uwe e reinhardt , a professor of political economy at princeton university who specializes in medical economics it used to be that this nation said we 're all in this together and the healthy subsidize the sick , the young subsidize the old , and so on , he said now we are caving in to an ethic that says sick people should pay higher premiums than healthy people and why should i be forced to subsidize someone who is sick plan called fairer but many insurers the employers themselves in the case of larger companies say the move away from universal rates has been reasonable it makes workers more aware of the cost of medical care , they say , which in theory makes them more careful consumers , just as with other purchases and it makes the price of the insurance better reflect the employee s costs to the plan , which is fairer just as workers with a spouse and three kids expect to pay more for clothing and other expenses , their higher health costs are increasingly being viewed as their responsibility as well , said rich ostuw , a vice president at tpfc , a unit of the consulting firm towers perrin the change is visible in many company health plans adopted this winter and is expected to gain even wider acceptance it takes many forms broader choices workers with a spouse and children , who often paid no more for their insurance than workers with just a spouse or even single employees , now must pay more in many plans people who take early retirement once paid the same rate as those who continued working now they are being charged a higher rate nonsmokers , who always paid the same rate as smokers , are now paying less workers are also being offered a wider choice of health coverage at different prices an employee covered by a working spouse s plan can now sometimes choose not to take insurance and instead receive a cash refund or benefits like more life insurance or extra vacation days employees who want health insurance but are healthy and confident that they will not need medical care can choose the least expensive health plan such a plan requires only a small monthly contribution or none at all , but carries higher outofpocket payments when care is actually received these plans also do not always cover as many kinds of treatments and increasingly offer only doctors and hospitals in an insurer s network but employees whose medical bills will be higher , or who need coverage for psychiatric care or other treatment not provided in the lowestcost plan , or who want to use doctors not in the network , must now pay extra to belong to a richer plan an increasing burden among the companies that have recently adopted such arrangements to some degree are citicorp , at t , champion international , procter gamble , baker hughes , chubb son , southern california edison , rjr nabisco , chevron , mobil , monsanto and sears , roebuck they are promoting the plans for the freedom of choice they offer other companies , including american express , expect to introduce such plans in coming months the changes have for the most part applied to nonunion workers unionized workers have usually resisted for the last decade , employers burdened by rising medical costs have in growing numbers asked workers to pay a portion of not only their medical bills but also the insurance plan that pays for the rest but only recently have a significant number begun to divide their workers into many groups , each paying a different monthly amount the effort to segregate the work force into more than one group is being extended to areas that traditionally have been left alone , said ken sperling , a consultant at hewitt associates at the same time , some insurance companies for small businesses , which once based their rates on the claims experience of a large number of people and offered everyone one price , are increasingly placing the groups they cover in different categories each group is charged a different rate , based on factors including occupation , location , and age and sometimes health of the members some high risks rejected all told , the rate for one group can be 5 times or even 15 times that of another group the same size as one extreme example , a painting business in the los angeles area with three employees in their early 60 s could pay more than 500 a person monthly , as against about 50 a person for an accounting firm in vermont with three employees in their 20 s , said richard w hill , a vice president at prudential insurance
behindthescenes complaints you might think that starring in a broadway show is a pretty glamorous job but to hear the cast of neil simon s lost in yonkers tell it , it s not even close their problem is their work place , the backstage areas of the richard rodgers theater , which is owned by the nederlander organization according to the show s stage manager , jim woolley , and cast members who refused to speak for attribution , the complaints are plentiful for starters , the building s antiquated wiring accommodates only 60watt bulbs in the dressing rooms , which makes it difficult for the actors to put on their makeup since there is frequently no hot water , the men who need to shave have to use a hot pot and consistently blow the lights there are no toilet paper holders in the bathrooms when the show , about two teenage boys left to live with their grandmother and aunt in 1942 , arrived in early february , it was apparent that no cleaning crew had been there first the backstage area was so dirty that mr woolley took a bottle of fantastik and scrubbed the walls himself the actors washed the windows in their dressing rooms , which are described by mr woolley as so dirty you ca n't see across the street at least most of them have windows in 13yearold danny gerard s dressing room , one window is missing altogether , and is taped over with a piece of cardboard it s freezing in there , and on one whole side of the backstage area , where , mr woolley says , there is no heat we all sit there in our winter coats and use space heaters , he says the nederlanders have never been known for spending as much time or money on their theaters as the shuberts or jujamcyn but did anyone think of complaining \? well , not officially what about complaints to actors' equity , or the show s producer , manny azenberg \? none why \? mr woolley says complaints about the richard rodgers were previously made to equity by the companies of accomplice and the merchant of venice , but nothing was done alan eisenberg , executive secretary of actors' equity , says , no one ever complained to me in any company that has played in that theater as for the nederlanders , everyone is petrified of them , says one company member the actors are afraid they 'll get mad and complain to manny , who could make their lives miserable nonsense , says arthur rubin , executive vice president of the nederlander organization if i had a complaint , i 'd follow it up , but no one has complained we 're prepared to fix whatever s necessary but i ca n't help them in a vacuum the cast , which could benefit from a seminar in assertiveness training , did ask the nederlanders to fix up the backstage area a few weeks ago in a poem the theater was promptly painted i'm willing to meet with them , mr rubin says they asked for a new washing machine and got it but somebody has to address this directly to me how about mr azenberg \? the cast showed me the poem and i was told it was fixed , he says it s really a wonderful old theater , mr woolley concludes it just needs a facelift 'earth and sky' to be a film the race to buy the film rights to earth and sky , about a woman s investigation of her lover s mysterious death , by the 33yearold playwright douglas post , recently at the second stage , has been won art linson , the producer of the hollywood blockbuster the untouchables , has bought the play for warner brothers , with a script to be written by mr post robyn goodman , coartistic director of the theater , says mr post will be paid between 250 , 000 and 500 , 000 trying to pick the tony winners the slow theater season has n't discouraged the traditional guessing game about who will win the tonys the issue for some producers now is how to stack the deck when it comes to the acting awards , both leading and supporting , the guideline has traditionally been that if an actor s name is billed above the title in the openingnight program , he or she qualifies as a star and should compete in the leading category but billing aside , producers are allowed to make recommendations to the tony administration committee that an actor be considered in a category that is not dictated by the billing the reasoning , of course , is to try to minimize the competition and maximize the chances of winning two plays that are seeking this switch are lost in yonkers and the speed of darkness yonkers bills irene worth , mercedes ruehl , and kevin spacey above the title but mr azenberg , the show s producer , says that both he and mr spacey agree that he be considered in the supporting category the producer says he and ms ruehl agree that she be submitted in the best actress category but the recommendation on irene worth is more difficult since the size of her role could be considered supporting by entering the best actress category , she s not only splitting the vote with ms ruehl , but also going up against the industry favorite , stockard channing , in six degrees of separation mr azenberg says that instead of trying to persuade miss worth , who is billed first , above the title , to consider the supporting category , in which she would have little competition , he left the decision to the committee he said he did not want to be accused of trying to manipulate her chances of winning and harvey sabinson , executive director of the league of new york theaters and producers , which administers the tonys , says that if a producer does not make a recommendation within two weeks of the play s opening night , the billing stands that means miss worth will be considered in the best actress category the smart thing to do is not compete with stockard , says one producer who insisted on anonymity but irene worth is above the title for what is essentially a supporting role that stems from dumb billing , which is a reflection of agents she could walk away with the supporting award in the speed of darkness , steve tesich s drama about a vietnam veteran confronting his past , len cariou and stephen lang are billed above the title , but mr lang has agreed to a bid in the supporting category in the best actor category , there is n't a favorite as strong as ms channing , but along with mr cariou , nigel hawthorne in shadowlands and courtney vance in six degrees are considered frontrunners and when i hate hamlet opens in april , nicol williamson and evan handler may join them the tony administration committee meets soon to judge the recommendations photo off broadway discounts passports to off broadway month begins april 1 , when more than 50 theaters will offer discounts of up to 50 percent on tickets in a program sponsored by art new york and the itt corporation among the participants is the wpa s production of red scare on sunset , a new comedy by and starring charles busch \( above \) for passports , call \( 212 \) 7681818 \( tl boston \)

the parade of the pasta cafes continues if it seems as though every other italian restaurant opening on long island is a pasta cafe , there is good reason these popular newcomers are perfectly matched

up to steer them additionally , the owner is ever present , keeping a sharp eye out for diners' needs it is the food that sets caffe donatello apart its bread basket is a reliable barometer herbencrusted focaccia and warm chewy rolls start the meal right in addition to butter , there is a head of roasted garlic to spread on the rolls although pizzas are labled individual , they can be

array of roasted red peppers , grilled eggplant , sundried tomatoes , fresh mozzarella , artichoke hearts and asparagus the starter to skip is a shrimpandasparagus combo awash in a honeymustard sauce that tasted only cloyingly sweet the shining light among the pastas was a special of penne tossed with spinach , sundried tomatoes , slices of sausage , plenty of garlic and fine fruity olive oil spaghetti siciliana was pleasing , but would have been even better if it had included the usual powerhouse italian olives rather than the pitted watery variety a better pasta choice is the cappellini donatello , angel hair in a creamy bolognese sauce flecked with radicchio the chef has a winning way with fish salmon , deftly cooked in white wine and garlic with an embellishment of artichoke hearts , was a treat , as was the perfectly turned out pink snapper snuggled below fresh tomatoes , olives , garlic , olive oil and white wine speaking of perfection , the simply grilled veal paillard , so often dried out and overcooked , is a juicy marvel at caffe donatello chicken scarpariello was not traditional , but was sensational succulent chunks of boneless breast meat were smothered in wild

tokyo , march 31 a new noh play is a rarity in japan , a country that thinks there are only a few good examples of the genre , all of them written 400 years ago but dr tomio tada , a professor at tokyo university s medical school , has used this dusty old art form to tap a deep modern sense of ambivalence over the boundary between life and death and his noh play the well of ignorance has become something of a surprise hit the play is about a fisherman who is knocked unconscious in a giant storm and taken for dead the wealthy father of a severely ill young woman summons a chinese doctor , who removes the fisherman s heart and uses it to save the young woman what dr tada chronicles is the odyssey of the unfortunate heart donor , not alive enough to join the living , not dead enough to join the deceased the ambiguity of the fisherman s death and the guilt that racks the young woman seem the perfect themes for noh from the time it originated in the 14th century , noh has been a forum for mixing spiritual and earthly life on a spare stage , occupied not only by the actors but by a chorus and a small orchestra playing traditional japanese instruments noh characters themselves are often the spirits of the dead , appearing in fearsome wooden masks and chanting their poetic dialogues to the heavy beat of drums but if the usual plots of noh plays are drawn from ancient japanese legends , dr tada s play emerged from the operating room no japanese doctor has dared to perform a heart transplant since 1968 that was the year that dr juro wada , a transplant specialist , was accused of murder by colleagues for taking a beating heart from a teenage boy who was declared brain dead after a drowning incident while no criminal charges were ever filed , the case dragged on for more than six years while prosecutors tried to decide what to do in the west , the mind is considered superior to the flesh , dr tada , a prominent immunologist , said the other day in an interview in his office , whose walls are covered with a mix of medical charts and posters for noh dramas in the east , though , there is still no distinction between flesh and soul we think that the mind is indeed an active part of the self but even if the mind is gone , it is hard to accept that as death when the well of ignorance had its premiere recently at japan s national noh theater , it was to a standingroomonly crowd that included a fair sprinkling of the country s policymakers and opinionmolders as well as its medical elite in a few weeks that performance will be will be broadcast on nhk , the semiofficial national television network though dr tada contends that he does not oppose the adoption of a braindeath standard , his play seems to argue that position in powerful terms the chanting chorus , giving voice to the spirit of the fisherman , offers a gruesome description of the operation when i was barely hanging on to life , the fisherman says , the doctors decided to come at me with blades and scissors they opened my chest and took my beating heart out , and i heard the sounds of snipping and cutting but my body was totally frozen , and no voice came out when i screamed ! am i living , the spirit implores , or am i dead \? it is a chilling moment in the play , made more so by the fact that the fisherman s spirit never resolves his netherworld dilemma nor does the conscienceracked recipient of his heart the young woman s efforts to purify herself at the well are stymied when it dries up because of a curse placed on all those associated with the operation , the villagers say people get very caught up in the ambiguity of the question , and that is what makes this compelling noh , said gerry yokota , an assistant professor at osaka university , who is completing her phd on noh at princeton university more important , she says , the antagonists in the play the doctor , the people in power never appear on the stage there is a lot of mystique and a lot of taboos , and most of them have to do with who is in power , and who should be the subject of criticism to noh historians like ms yokota , dr tada s biggest achievement may be overcoming japan s distaste for new noh of any kind only one or two noh plays are written each year , and few of them are staged by ms yokota s rough count , there have been only 110 noh plays written since the meiji restoration in 1868 only one has entered the repertory of classic plays , she said , and that was commemorating emperor hirohito s enthronement in 1928 the current emperor , akihito , was enthroned last year without benefit of a noh play in his honor thus , it was not surprising that the noh establishment here there are no fewer than five schools of noh in japan viewed dr tada s creation with suspicion this was the first time that i ever did a new noh play , said cumas hashimoto , the wellknown noh actor who plays the role of the spirit who loses his heart it turned out to be a significant undertaking most noh plays require no rehearsal experienced noh actors are so familiar with the classics that they need none this was different , said mr hashimoto we were overwhelmed by this experience and it took about 10 sessions before we could put the chanting to the poetry , and do the choreography photo cumas hashimoto , left , and keigoro zenchiko in dr tomio tada s new noh play the well of ignorance in tokyo \( toshiro morita \)
to the editor this is a good time to reconsider bicycles as a supplementary but important means of transportation their widespread use would make a perfect fit with two pressing concerns pollution \( bicycles cause none at all \) and how to save on the use of oil \( twothirds of our oil goes to gasoline , of which bikes use none \) the health benefits would not be negligible bicycling on errands , and to and from work daily , would fill many exercise needs and a bicycle industry geared for serious transportation , rather than periodic pleasure , would create new products , new markets , new industries and jobs the federal government is nearing the end of its most recent fiveyear plan for highway legislation , and plans for the next five years are under discussion in the new proposal , called the national highway system , planners demonstrate not only a desire to cope with the problems of congestion and pollution but also remarkable flexibility alongside legislation for highway funding , the government proposes to require major cities to offer detailed approaches to pollution and congestion , showing how all forms of transportation would be used furthermore , the plan would set up special funds to encourage innovative , immediateaction solutions to congestion and air quality problems , and the federal government would pay 60 percent of the cost of such programs concerned citizens should introduce the idea of bikeways to local officials among the many remedies to our pollution and oil dependency problems , bicycles and bikeways will be one of the least expensive , and they will have immediate and measurable consequences bikeways , and the heavy use of bicycles , will be more practical in some places than in others , at least at first it would make more sense to start with small towns , linked to villages and perimeter shopping malls and suburbs , than with major highways or cities as bikeways catch on , and demand begins in other places , larger and more populated areas can increase the network to whole counties , states and cities perhaps to begin , a program to create a bikeway network should be confined to one state or region planners will need to find out how to build bikeways that are free of competition with cars and trucks , what width is necessary for what volume of traffic , the best ways to handle bicycle parking much of the rest of the world uses bicycles as normal transportation , especially china and the netherlands , and may have answers to many of these questions the united states , with 4 percent of the world s population , uses 40 percent of the world s fuel , twothirds of which goes for gasoline and the environmental protection agency has announced that 1990 cars use , on average , 4 percent more gas than slightly older models given , then , the urgency of environmental problems , our reliance on foreign oil and the need to create jobs , bikeways should not only be included in the new federal highway fiveyear plan , but even emphasized harry b hollins new york , dec 12 , 1990
ever so grudgingly , iraq now admits that it was conducting a secret uranium enrichment program , thus tacitly conceding it was hellbent on making nuclear arms worse yet , it s still trying to conceal a starker truth , that it has come closer to making a bomb than the us suspected that shocking news , from knowledgeable iraqi defectors , reveals that saddam hussein remains a regional threat despite the crushing defeat that was supposed to have neutralized him even a single nuclear bomb in the hands of a ruthless dictator is menace enough a nuclear production capability , if undetected , could multiply the risk of attacks and of nuclear blackmail the newly understood danger is rightly prompting the us and its persian gulf war allies to reconsider how best to disarm iraq of its terror weapons once and for all but the dismaying fact is that no surefire method exists bombing iraqi nuclear facilities during the war failed to destroy all the nuclear materials trying to eliminate saddam hussein might backfire if he feels himself a target , the iraqi strongman will have little incentive to hand over his nuclear materials the best answer is to gain international support for more vigorous inspection and for keeping the pressure on iraq the latest revelations surprised many intelligence experts before the war , iraq was judged to be 5 to 10 years away from a fullfledged nuclear arsenal and bombmaking capacity the more imminent threat came from 100 pounds of known weaponsgrade nuclear material that was checked periodically by international inspectors by worstcase assessment , it could have been turned into a bomb in a year or less what s new is that iraqi informants have told us intelligence of a clandestine electromagnetic process baghdad was using to separate weaponsgrade material the process has already produced about 90 pounds of uranium , some of it highly enriched that s enough to make a bomb and it shows that baghdad is still lying when it claims to have produced only one pound of enriched uranium clandestinely the need to keep nuclear weapons out of iraq s hands grows more urgent but none of the three main options look very promising bombing nuclear sites , while superficially attractive , is no more likely to eliminate iraq s nuclear capability than it did during the gulf war iraq has been squirreling away uranium and other nuclear material , making it difficult to target and some of iraq s nuclear facilities are concealed and hardened another , facile option is to overthrow or kill saddam hussein the us has tried decapitation and failed and even success would n't stop his successor from building the bomb the least bad choice is more aggressive use of inspections to find and remove nuclear facilities and material more inspectors might help so would rewards for informants and the international coalition can press iraq to comply by maintaining tight economic sanctions and , if that fails , threatening renewed bombing of military targets saddam hussein has to know that the world is ready to resume bombing rather than see him get away with bombmaking
washington all right , so the peaceniks were wrong about one thing there will be no tens of thousands of body bags coming home and thus no popular reaction of revulsion and horror against the persian gulf war president bush s popularity ratings are off the charts and even the most hawkish of prosanctions democrats are running for cover , musing about 1996 politically and militarily , operation desert storm is a rout but does this mean , as many try to claim , that america has finally exorcised the ghost of vietnam \? the question itself implies a misunderstanding of the underlying factors that created the vietnam syndrome although neoconservatives sneered at the culture of appeasement it allegedly bespoke , the nation s reluctance to involve itself directly in the wars of the 1980 s represented a lasting and significant confluence of thinking between military leaders and the american citizenry following vietnam , the military saw itself nearly destroyed by fighting an inconclusive , unpopular and probably illegal war that trauma instilled in it an unshakable respect for the clausewitzian dictums that wars should be undertaken only on behalf of what former defense secretary caspar weinberger called clearly defined objectives and only with the reasonable assurance that they would enjoy the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress our brass learned to read polling data as effectively as they did battlefield intelligence they were hardly eager to see their precious resources , military or political , squandered in a war that lacked overwhelming support , had no clear definition of victory and offered plenty of jungles and mountains conducive to a long drawnout guerrilla campaign from vietnam , americans learned the cost of blind obeisance to their leaders though nicaragua may not be a perfect spanish translation for vietnam , it sounded sufficiently similar to american ears to prevent a rerun of our tragic sideshow in that decidedly unvital part of the world ronald reagan used every trick in his great communicator s bag to convince americans that the conflicts in central america merited a direct us military response but the opinion polls always came back , no thanks so , are we really ready to get back into the war fighting business \? to answer in the affirmative , one must be confident that the us is likely to find a villain as convincingly evil as saddam hussein victims as unarguably aggrieved as the kuwaitis threatened resources as vital to our way of life as petroleum an enemy as vulnerable to us military doctrine as was the iraqi army none of these conditions is likely to be reproduced anytime soon it s not that saddam hussein , as president bush has tried to argue , is uniquely evil our erstwhile gulf ally , hafez alassad of syria , gives him more than a run for his money on that score it s that mr hussein provided a unique combination of evil and stupidity he not only invaded a country that supplies oil to the entire western world but he threatened our regional allies as well moreover , he did so on a terrain that left his soldiers no place to hide in exactly the kind of orthodox land war that nato has been planning for 40 years is there anybody out there nasty and stupid enough to try that again \? in the philippines , the new peoples army may be unpleasant fellows , but they are smart enough to conduct their war on an island archipelago in peru , the shining path guerrillas have jungles and mountains on their side neither one sits on any oil in china , deng xiaoping had the good sense to bond with george bush before conducting his terror campaign most of the world s potential military conflicts , from slovenia to east jerusalem , have their roots in ancient ethnic , political and economic legacies these are exactly the kinds of morally and militarily complicated interventions that the nation has forsworn as unwinnable and unworth it the cold war is history , with the soviets fighting exclusively among themselves the new world order is a pipe dream so given all these caveats , just who is it that americans should prepare to fight \? vanessa redgrave \? despite the cheerleading of our armchair infantrymen , the vietnam syndrome remains in place saddam hussein is a oneofakind bad guy now , if only our real longterm threats weakening productivity , a deteriorating environment , collapsing infrastructure and thirdrate education system provided such spectacular television visuals
raoul s for all those nouveau bistros striving to stay above water for more than three american express statements , raoul s is a paradigm 15 successful years of cassoulet , cotesdurhone and cigarette smoke what makes raoul s thrive while so many others tremble \? after three recent visits , the answer seems to be a genuine feeling of neighborhood , an affable staff and betterthanaverage food raoul s is owned by serge and guy raoul , who also own the recently opened raoul s brasserie and grill on varick street the original restaurant , tucked away on cluttered prince street , looks as if it could have been there since tammany hall days the barroom up front has a black stampedtin ceiling , an art deco wooden bar and a row of candlelit cafe tables in front of long black banquettes the french garagesale wall decorations include sundry mirrors , posters and even an antlered buck s head to reach the dining room , you go past a fish tank with a submerged statue of liberty to reach the nonsmoking skylighted back room , you traverse the steamy kitchen , nodding good evening to the toiling cooks the traditional bistro menu is scrawled on a little chalkboard that should come with little flashlights fresh asparagus is sprinkled with a good vinaigrette and garnished with confetti of red peppers leeks vinaigrette are pleasing , too , served with tomatoes and black olives another salad combined chilled sweetbreads with tomatoes and greens in a mayonnaise dressing this drew a split decision at my table cold sweetbreads are not my idea of a delicacy , although several others at my table liked them wellfleet and belon oysters were fresh but served indifferently on a metal tray with no ice , allowing them to get warm quickly two of the better starters were a casserole of chanterelles , pleurotes , cepes and oyster mushrooms sauteed with white wine and a touch of cream , and buttery , armagnactinged goose foie gras ringed by a fullflavored gelatin the wine list carries ample quality selections at good prices to go with any of these starters servers , who know both the food and wine well , are not as keen on cleaning tables between courses or removing empty bottles for main courses , cruise in the bistro mainstream and chances are you will do well broiled salmon with a good bearnaise was faultless , as was thick tuna steak stippled with black pepper and cooked perfectly rare in the center the steak au poivre i had was not the most tender piece of meat ever to hit a pan , but it had plenty of flavor , a good sturdy pepper sauce and crispy french fries rack of lamb au jus was buttery and delicious with little potato fritters and julienne of zucchini and carrots while most seafood dishes were recommendable , the same cannot be said for the dryish swordfish crowned with a tart disk of goat cheese , a combination that escapes me more harmonious are the firmfleshed cobia \( also known as ling \) from gulf waters or sauteed cabillaud \( fresh cod \) garnished with citrus slices and basil butter veal chop forestiere replete with morels was flat tasting for lack of salt do n't bother with the sour rhubarb puree , the bland apple tart or the flossy raspberry mousse in a chocolate shell the thin lemon tart is citric and fresh , and chocolate bavarian cake is unremittingly rich raoul s may not be the most refined bistro in town , but its elan is palpable anyone feels right at home there , which is partly the definition of a good bistro cafe un deux trois new york city , with its frenzied latenight scene , seems ideally suited for that casual french agora known as the brasserie , where food of all sorts can be had around the clock in a wide open , convivial setting aside from the 24hour brasserie on east 53d street , though , no such prominent place exists cafe un deux trois , the 14yearold french restaurant in the broadway theater district , resembles many timeworn brasseries in paris , although it is not one in practice it is a vast space with a faux antique look achieved through deliberately chipping mustardcolored paint , marbleized columns , crumbling walls and trompe l'oeil murals tables are draped in paper and come with glasses of crayons this is not the best place to conduct business , for the din can be nettlesome but hundreds come daily to do just that servers , who are generally nimble and efficient , sometimes get distracted for as long as i have been frequenting cafe un deux trois , i have found several dishes to be reliable one of the better steak tartares in town is served here , the meat of impeccable quality and mildly piquant with tabasco steak au poivre is always pleasing , too the creamtinted peppercorn sauce carries a good kick of pepper and a sweet blush of brandy coq au vin comes with a moist leg of chicken , breast meat , carrots and mushrooms in an herby broth and fans of tripe will enjoy the version here with tomatoes , garlic , boiled potatoes and deepfried parsley couscous on the current menu comes out in a wheelbarrow portion , but generosity is all it has going for it the meats are dry and the grain is beyond rescue from the broth served on the side at lunch recently , penne with salmon , tomato and fried parsley was unpleasantly pinguid better was a roomtemperature chicken salad combining eggs , potatoes in vinaigrette and marinated cucumbers seafood is usually a 5050 bet here broiled salmon recently was inedibly dry , while fried calamari on the appetizer list was deliciously crisp and tender

tuesday , other coalition countries' lists of missing in action had been cleared up senior american officials said they did not expect any of the 28 to turn up , apparently because of the circumstances of their disappearance general neal disclosed for the first time today that an air force ac130 gunship , armed with a heavy cannon , which disappeared on jan 31 , had gone down over the

washington , oct 23 in a survey that tends to confirm that the recovery has lost momentum , the federal reserve reported today that retail sales have been virtually flat in recent weeks and that factory output , while still improving , is doing so at a slower pace over all , according to the fed s compilation of anecdotal evidence from its 12 regional banks , the nation s economy was weak or growing slowly in september and early october , with merchants cautious about the holiday season ahead such language presents a somewhat less optimistic picture than the one in the report the fed issued five weeks ago , in which it said the economic recovery continues to be uneven across the country sluggishness in cars underscoring the sluggishness , detroit announced another dismal sales period today sales of cars and light trucks fell 161 percent in midoctober page d6 the fed survey , formally called current economic conditions but usually referred to as the beige book after the color of its cover , is intended to aid fed policy makers in advance of meetings of the open market committee the market panel , consisting of fed governors and regional presidents , meets eight times a year to set monetary policy , with the next session scheduled for nov 5 little gain in retail in most districts , there has been little improvement in retail sales , and a few reported some slowing , stated the latest survey , which was based on information collected through oct 10 and prepared this time by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia manufacturing output is still improving , it added , although at a slower pace in some areas the fed s respondents mainly companies , stores and banks but also port officials , farmers and business groups repeatedly asserted that consumers were holding off buying bigticket items , including cars , because of uncertainty over jobs and incomes they also cited an inclination by consumers to buy at discounters rather than department stores , and they noted heavy activity in refinancing mortgages at lower rates by region , where the variations were perhaps less pronounced than usual , much of the relative strength was in the chicago and cleveland districts , which take in most of the midwest , while the san francisco district california and most of the northwest seemed the weakest consistent with previously reported statistical data , the manufacturing areas did better than others in the new york district new york state and new jersey developments remained mixed in recent weeks , the survey stated , with departmentstore sales sluggish despite greater promotional activity the survey also cited subdued interest among potential buyers of new homes on the plus side , however , the vacancy rate for midtown but not downtown manhattan office space declined and in the western part of the district , twice as many buffaloarea companies as in the last survey reported an increase in new orders the san francisco district reported deteriorating factory activity in california and the pacific northwest , sluggish retail sales and plummeted rents for los angeles offices , where the vacancy rate could reach 30 percent next year somewhat ominously , 17 percent of the district s business leaders said they expect the next 12 months to be characterized by recession , up from 7 percent five weeks ago and breaking a string of improved expectations that began in january concern in new england elsewhere , most respondents in the boston district , which includes all of new england , said there was as yet no clear uptrend in manufacturing , with most expecting none until next year and several suspecting that the recent trend has , in fact , turned down on the other hand , some steel mills in the cleveland district reported they were operating in the range of 85 percent of their capacity and that they had bulging order books for flatrolled steel products , which lengthened the delivery dates of those products to late in the year and early 1992 in the richmond district , economic activity was described as generally weak in the period , with retail activity slowing further but exports rose in september at the district s main ports baltimore charleston , sc , and hampton roads , va in the atlanta district , which runs from tennessee south to include florida and lousianna , retailers were described as pessimistic about holiday sales , but in the minneapolis district the northern states from the great lakes to montana sales were fairly strong with the aid of a september surge for trucks and the minneapolisst paul area expects to garner 6 million in direct spending for each baseball playoff and world series game held there the dallas district , mostly texas , is growing very slowly , with car sales anemic , the survey also showed activity is strongest along the mexican border , where retail sales are benefitting from a strong peso
tokyo , dec 9 in a first for the japanese corporate bond market , the nippon telegraph and telephone corporation said today that it would issue bonds at the same price to all investors , rather than offering discounts to preferred customers this unusual approach to an underwriting in japan , like most changes in japan s financial markets , was induced by an outsider in this case morgan stanley company it pushed for the change and will comanage the offering with nomura securities , ntt s traditional underwriter this will be the first time an american securities house will lead a domestic japanese securities underwriting , breaking the lock that japan s major securities firms have held on the market an underwriter s view this idea is long overdue in japan , said mark a seigel , a morgan stanley executive who helped organize the deal this is the primary method used in the united states and europe a nomura official said , we hope the introduction of the new system will increase market transparency and stimulate the japanese corporate bond market although the terms have not been announced , it is expected that ntt will issue 50 billion yen , or 390 million , in bonds , with a maturity of from 6 years to 10 years the interest rate is likely to be about 125 percentage points above the rate for 10year japanese government bonds , which is currently below 6 percent the announcement that governmentowned ntt was planning to experiment with a system common in the united states and europe represents a modest step toward making japan a genuinely worldclass financial market it was also one of those seemingly technical developments that speaks volumes about how coddled japan s financial markets remain in many respects , despite their enormous growth salomon brothers tried to be lead manager of bond issues by two japanese companies early last year and was met with howls of criticism from japanese securities executives a senior nomura official said of salo mon s deals , which involved a complex series of steps , this is like bringing aids from new york the companies eventually dropped the deals , and salomon brothers never got the underwriting under the method being introduced , the underwriters will start the process by canvassing major investors to test their interest in the securities by the time the issue is ready , the underwriters should have a good feel for what the market is prepared to pay a price will then be set , and all the investors will be sold their bonds at that price later , the bonds will trade at market prices currently , there is almost no standard corporate bond market in japan japanese corporations have been issuing large amounts of eurobonds , as well as bonds that are convertible into stock or bonds with stock warrants but they have sold few on the domestic market , in large measure because of a 20 percent withholding tax here and rules that subtly encourage them to take bank loans instead of issuing bonds the ntt issue is expected to be greeted more enthusiastically , in part because ntt is such a bluechip company and because the new pricing system insures investors will be treated fairly in general , underwriters here have sold corporate bonds to investors at discounts of varying size according to morgan stanley officials , the japanese underwriters would determine their discount based on how good the customer was the result has been a primitive corporate bond market , where there is little trading and where pricing is at times unrealistic market pricing for debt securities is not a well developed concept in this market , said john s wadsworth jr , president of morgan stanley japan a giant blue chip ntt is 75 percent owned by the japanese government and is one of the world s largest industrial concerns , which gives the new pricing concept a big push in japan at a time when capital is proving scarce , ntt was encouraged to pursue the new method as a means of opening up a potentially big new source of financing but morgan stanley officials said that it was unlikely the concept would catch on quickly because the market has so far to catch up for instance , the creation of a large corporate bond market depends on trustworthy corporate rating agencies none of the major agencies in japan is taken seriously by securities professionals , and only 14 industrial concerns here , including ntt , have ratings from moody s and standard poor s , two of the major american rating agencies what we hope is that this will develop a level playing field in the market , but it still has a long way to go , mr wadsworth said

published as a 1695 hardcover with more than 200 million copies of 107 l'amour books in print , and almost 50 million copies of the 12 books by miss andrews , this is clearly a big business in fact , the l'amour titles account for about 5 percent of all books in print from bantam understandably , perhaps , the publishers are not actively publicizing that their star authors are dead we do n't hide the fact , but we always put a new photo of louis on each book , said stuart applebaum , who edits mr l'amour s books we believe he lives on through his writings the description on the jacket for mr hubbard s fear is written as if the author were alive mr hubbard , it says , has written hundreds of novels and stories \( rather than had \) and is \( rather than was \) one of the most widely read authors pocket books , the simon schuster unit that publishes miss andrews s books , also does not go out of its way to publicize the author s death but facing the copyright page in dawn is a letter from the andrews family mentioning her death and saying that when ms andrews became ill , she began to work even harder , hoping to finish as many stories as possible so that her fans could one day share them the letter added that after her death , the family worked with a carefully selected writer to organize and complete virginia s stories and to expand upon them by creating additional novels inspired by her wonderful storytelling genius the difference between dawn and the posthumous l'amour and hubbard books , however , is that the latter two , according to their publishers , were written by the authors whose names appear on the cover all of what we will publish was written during louie s lifetime , mr applebaum said none of it is posthumous writings perpetuated by living ghosts problem of dead authors publishers , estates and agents have attempted to solve the problem of dead authors in various ways the forthcoming sequel to gone with the wind , to be written by alexandra ripley , will be titled , scarlett the sequel to margaret mitchell s 'gone with the wind' the ian fleming estate authorized john gardner to write the james bond books and robert b parker recently completed a sequel to raymond chandler s the big sleep \( titled perchance to dream \) in each case , the new author s name appeared on the book jacket but mr romanos said pocket books and the andrews family had decided against doing that we were not sure , nor are we sure , that a single writer would be assigned to the continuing projects , he said , so it did n't make sense to include an author s name moreover , he said , v c andrews created a unique style , a unique type of book , and it was better to continue v c andrewslike stories by finding someone who would mimic it nancy drew and the hardy boys miss andrews used to write a series of books her first five books make up a series about the dollanganger family and dawn is described as the first of a new series mr romanos noted that such series as nancy drew and the hardy boys were written by various writers using the names carolyn keene and franklin w dixon other publishers say they see nothing wrong with carrying on a dead writer s name if there is no attempt to pretend the original author is still writing the books nevertheless , barry winkleman , the managing director of general books for harpercollins in britain , recently protested that miss andrews s name appeared on the jacket of the hardcover edition of dawn published by simon schuster ltd in english law , he said in a telephone interview , you ca n't say a book is written by somebody who did n't write it mr winkleman acknowledged that his ire was stirred by the fact that after publishing 11 andrews books , he was outbid for the rights to dawn but he said that had he won the right to publish dawn , he would have publicized on the cover that it was actually written by andrew neiderman the return of hemingway \? we invested an enormous amount in the virginia andrews titles , he said if that canon is diluted by new titles every few months , it will diminish our assets what about if i come to america and publish under the name ernest hemingway \? but publishers usually contend that each new book published under an established author s name will lead to additional sales of previously published books and bantam says that when it publishes the rustlers of west fork in may , a hardcover novel by mr l'amour , it is planning a special promotion of 11 previous l'amour titles that promotion , mr applebaum said , is expected to sell two million copies photo dawn by vc andrews has been a hughe success , even though it was actually written by another author after her death \( pocket books \)
washington congress is moving quickly to adopt significant antitrust legislation that its supporters assert will encourage price competition by making it more difficult for manufacturers and retailers to fix prices last week the senate approved legislation that would essentially codify some court rulings , making vertical pricefixing by manufacturers and retailers automatically illegal the measure , approved on voice vote , would also roll back decisions by the united states supreme court and federal appeals courts in the last decade that have made it increasingly more difficult for plaintiffs to bring such actions proponents of the measure say it would make it easier for discounters like k mart and toys r us to sue a rival that persuades a manufacturer to try to dictate price levels consumer groups estimate that the legislation could save customers up to 20 billion annually the bill is sponsored by senator howard m metzenbaum , democrat of ohio after years of unsuccessful attempts to change the sherman antitrust act of 1890 , mr metzenbaum broke a deadlock in the senate by agreeing to amendments offered by senator hank brown , republican of colorado , that would make the legislation slightly less onerous on manufacturers that move won the support of some republicans whose opposition had blocked the measure similar legislation sponsored last year by representative jack brooks , democrat of texas and chairman of the house judiciary committee , was approved overwhelmingly in the house mr brooks is expected to reintroduce his legislation shortly if , as expected , his measure is adopted , it would have to be reconciled with the senate measure before proceeding to the white house but the justice department has expressed opposition to the measure , saying that it would create an inference of unlawful conspiracy in many cases where none existed at this point , it is expected that the measure will be vetoed by the president , and both the measure s supporters and its critics say it is not clear whether there are sufficient votes to override a veto the measure was adopted largely in response to decisions by the reagan and bush administrations not to bring any civil pricefixing cases between retailers and manufacturers justice department officials have maintained that price maintenance agreements improve service to customers and are therefore not harmful to competition nor has the supreme court felt the need to encourage such lawsuits in 1984 , the justices decided that plaintiffs bringing such cases must provide evidence showing that the manufacturer and another party consciously intended to maintain resale price levels and in 1988 , the supreme court elaborated on the ruling by holding that there was no violation of antitrust laws unless the manufacturer and retailer actually agreed on a specific price as a result of those decisions , retailers have been discouraged from filing lawsuits the legislation approved by the senate would ease the standards of evidence for plaintiffs bringing such suits the measure has drawn widespread support from an array of consumer groups and representatives of discounters and has provoked criticism from manufacturers and other business interests it s happening for everything from tennis racquets to passover products , said kristen rand , counsel to consumers union , the publisher of consumer reports magazine the state attorneys general say it is endemic to the economy but the manufacturers , whose most vocal supporter on capitol hill is senator strom thurmond , republican of south carolina , are fighting to block the legislation james p carty , vice president for government affairs for the national association of manufacturers , said the measure would result in scores of new legal actions any time a retailer is terminated by a manufacturer , counsel will immediately threaten to file a treble damages antitrust lawsuit , he said the system right now is working well you and i do n't have a problem getting discounted products drawing
the dispute over whether executions should be televised has rearranged some political alliances defenders and opponents of capital punishment are found on both sides of the argument that the first amendment gives television cameras a right to a place in the death chamber the san francisco public television station kqed is claiming that right in federal district court there some champions of the death penalty welcome pictures from an execution as a deterrence to murder others fear they may create sympathy for the criminal some opponents hope the sight of capital punishment in action will stir revulsion against it others believe the pictures will make the taking of a life seem routine , the latest madefortv show all the possibilities seem plausible none seem ordained but whatever one s hopes or fears regarding the consequences of television coverage , they are the wrong criteria deciding what newspapers may print or what television may show on the basis of the possible political effects is not invigorating for a free press but other objections have been raised that invite more attention do they add up to the need to shield the nation from executions \? not in my opinion to begin , there is the coarsening issue the columnists george f will and anthony lewis , who agree on so little , agree that execution on television might further coarsen american life mr lewis of the new york times is sure of it mr will considers it a serious possibility i wonder given the tube s day and night splatterings of brutality , grossness , commercialism , exploitation and inanity , it is hard to imagine that an occasional execution can add much to the coarsening effect possibly , just possibly , the sight of a person being killed by the apparatus of the law might actually stir some moments of reflection likening an execution on television to the festive public hangings of 19thcentury england smacks of theatrics the public stations can be counted on to drape the event with discussions of justice and mortality , and although the tabloid shows will doubtless be less sober , there is no reason to expect even them to turn the occasion into a party it seems to me that some of the opposition to kqed s case stems from a mistrust of democracy and of that great leveler , television the mistrust has grounds within the demos , the common people , of democracy lurks the mob , and television has the power to incite but such mistrust can easily lead to a patronizing attitude and prohibitive rules the cultivated observer looks down at the television audience and sees the unwashed mr lewis writes of people inviting friends over for beer , pretzels and death would it be reassuring if the friends were invited over for brie and a pleasing chardonnay \? in an uncomfortable way , those who would keep certain material off the small screen because of its possible coarsening effects resemble those who would keep certain works off the walls of galleries because of their possible effects on the moral life reasonable arguments can be made for both positions , but as civil libertarians frequently caution , the slope to censorship is slippery most people would agree that some scenes ought not to be on television is an official execution one of them \? what is being suggested here by those who would keep it off \? that americans may not , must not see the consequences of laws that have been enacted with their support \? that the state not only has the power to take lives but also has the power to keep the actual act out of sight \? if you believe the death penalty is justified , why not welcome a display of what the words mean \? if you believe that execution is a barbarism , why not expose it \? is the rule to be that if an official action is unsettling enough , it should be concealed , or at least reported in a way that will not offend one s own sensibility or stimulate the passions of the less sensitive \? anyway , it is a little odd for people who grow indignant about government secrecy elsewhere to demand that a shroud be placed over an execution granted , the event will be reported in newspapers , and for some , words can be more effective than pictures but for most of the nation , all those beerandpretzel people , the picture is the thing and television is the source \( if the suppression reasoning is carried through , overly evocative writing ought also to be banned \) it strikes me , too , that the show of delicacy may be selective only a few weeks ago , opponents of the war in the persian gulf were complaining about television cameras being kept away from the battlefield they wanted the scenes of carnage brought home to americans , in the hope that it might quell enthusiasm for the war one heard no cautions then about the coarsening effects of seeing all those corpses of iraqi soldiers some who oppose execution coverage express concern for the privacy of the condemned it is a fair consideration , and perhaps the courts can again find in the capacious penumbra of the constitution a new right of privacy but even without such a discovery , kqed has promised not to film the event without the subject s approval not all stations may prove so courteous , but the opportunity for millions of people to comprehend the workings of their system of justice as directly as possible seems to me to have as strong a claim on society as a convicted murderer s desire for privacy may kqed win its case and may all the stations and programs that benefit from the victory exercise their new right responsibly , for example , by showing the execution only after the youngest viewers are in bed such regulations or understandings are not unprecedented but the thing about democracy is , you have to take some chances
florham park , nj , july 18 stacy robinson has always been a thinking man s football player bright , analytical and logical in recent days , even while his agent , tony agnone , was negotiating for a new contract with the giants , robinson was wondering if he wanted to keep playing pro football on wednesday , agnone worked out a oneyear contract for 275 , 000 today , before robinson even looked at the contract , he retired from football i really do n't have the desire anymore , he said i wish i could have taken that zest i had the last two or three years 48 catches and 2 rings for six years , he played wide receiver for the giants he was never a star as a pro , he caught only 48 passes \( two last season \) in regularseason games and three more in the playoffs \( none last season \) he was there when needed , as his two super bowl rings attest in each of the last three seasons , the giants waived him , then called him back when another receiver was injured now , at age 29 , he faced the numbers game again ray handley , the giants' new head coach , hopes to get by with a total of 12 wide receivers , tight ends and running backs that means he will try to keep only four wide receivers from a group that included four veterans \( robinson , mark ingram , stephen baker and odessa turner \) , a plan b free agent \( james milling \) and two draft choices \( ed mccaffrey and jerry bouldin \) talked with martin robinson said he thought handley would have given him a fair chance on wednesday , he talked with george martin , the retired defensive end who had become almost a father figure for his old giants teammates i wondered if it was just the apprehension of training camp , robinson said sometimes , that can be worse than camp itself george gave me some pros and cons i called him back when i made my decision he respected it robinson drove to the giants' training camp today and told handley he was retiring handley told him he hoped robinson would stay in shape and be available if the giants needed him later in the season robinson said he would stay in shape but as for playing again , robinson said , it would depend on what i'm doing at the time he is sure to be doing something first , he will complete a term paper , the last requirement for a master s degree in business administration from fairleigh dickinson university i could get a job next week if i wanted to , he said i'm going to take my time i know there s nothing i can do to make the money i make in professional football some guys develop a lifestyle they are unable to maintain after pro football i have n't done that robinson said money was not a consideration in his decision i could have sat on the bench and made 200 , 000 or 300 , 000 a year , he said but not getting an opportunity to compete is hurtful i think that has something to do with my lack of desire now robinson said he accepted the instability and lack of security that went with the job the highlight of my career was the 1986 season , he said , and even then there were ups and downs you take the bad with the good and you just move on extra points bart oates , the giants' center , returned to training camp today after a night in morristown \( nj \) memorial hospital , where he was treated for kidney stones oates said his doctors thought he had passed one or more stones he hoped to return to practice friday in his absence , brian williams was the firstteam center luis cristobal and rich segina , both rookie guards , also worked at center ottis anderson , the running back who was named the most valuable player in super bowl xxv in january , signed a oneyear contract and took part in the morning practice greg taylor , a freeagent wide receiver , injured his left knee there was no immediate report on the nature of the injury alex shell , another rookie receiver , fought briefly on the field with mark collins , the veteran cornerback , after a collision
the pianist plays through the musical staples of ballet classes around the world the commands are familiar , too , as the teacher calls out to his solemnfaced students to pirouette and plie correctly but the look of the class is unusual it is a nearly even mix of black , hispanic , white and asian children pointing their toes and stretching their arms together in the predominantly caucasian world of ballet the class is part of a new ballet program at the professional performing arts school , a public junior high school on west 48th street that opened in september developed by anthony j alvarado , superintendent of district 2 , the school offers training in music , dance and drama to children throughout new york city in grades 6 through 8 the ballet component was designed with eliot feld , the choreographer and director of the feld ballets ny company in 1978 he founded the new ballet school , which offers free ballet training at the feld studios to city public school children selected by audition students in the new high school program are selected the same way , and it is supported by the original ballets foundation , the sponsor of the feld company and school the new ballet school offers training starting in grade 3 with ballet technique classes that build from one morning class a week during the school year , with additional summer classes for some , to classes six days a week for fourthyear students one such student was rachel alvarado , and her father and mr feld decided that a solution to the problem of juggling the demands of advanced professional training and junior high school education was to form a school that offered academic and arts training under one roof seventyfive children are enrolled in the junior high school , and all are offered ballet classes taught by teachers from the new ballet school more advanced , intensive training is offered to children in the ballet division one of the teachers is richard thomas he and his wife , the late barbara fallis , taught several generations of professional dancers , among them mr feld , in companies throughout the country typically , mr thomas walks about the airy , spacious topfloor studio cajoling and hectoring his young students he is armed with the kind of cane affected by the russian ballet teachers of old , swung with a sportiness that is entirely american a passionate teacher , mr thomas never loses the children s attention he is not easily satisfied you cheat , you cheat , he cries when one little boy sails too easily through an exercise you 're too young to know the word plie and see what happens there are repeated calls for more abandon turn everything loose , he roars all the way now not all the way later there is more than simple physical grace , mr thomas seems to suggest , to the world they have chosen a child walks disconsolately off the floor after one exercise stop worrying , he tells her gently when you go out the door , there s worry in here , there s no worry too little and too late mr feld is intent about providing ballet training to these children , public school students who might otherwise have little access , or access too late , to training in an art that some consider elitist and too expensive there is little agreement about why there are still so comparatively few minority dancers on ballet stages around the country , two decades after arthur mitchell began to provide role models with his successful , mostly black dance theater of harlem company mr mitchell has recently embarked on a project with the royal ballet in britain to establish a ballet training program for minority children it is de facto a way of getting minority kids into ballet , because 82 percent of new york schoolchildren are minority , mr feld said recently but we do n't have quotas we 're looking in the school system for kids with an aptitude and feeling and even passion for dance the impulse is not social , though it has social implications essentially , we 're saying that there are one million children or thereabout in the public school system , and these children have the same right to discover their talents and develop them but it is important for the ballet world , too , so ballet does n't become an effete art separate from the bulk of the population ballet needs the infusion of the talent of all people who are gifted the results in the years since plans for the new ballet school were developed with the board of education , which authorized transportation to and from ballet classes during school hours on buses used at other times for disabled students , mr feld has seen the number of children auditioning jump from 3 , 000 to 15 , 000 i 'd like to see every child in every school in new york city have the opportunity to audition , he said i 'd like to see the board of ed provide that access it s just a logistical problem a small financial problem it does n't do any good for a 16yearold to discover ballet , or for ballet companies to say they 'd love to have more black dancers but there are none you ca n't not give people the opportunity and then not take them three students from the new ballet school have become members of the feld ballets ny within four years , mr feld prophesied , about five students from the new program will be dancing in his or other companies i know it , he said and that will be evidence of the possibilities clear , clear evidence so i'm hopeful but patient the two go together photo students in the new ballet program at the professional performing arts school , a

amman , jordan , feb 14 flags were at halfstaff and tempers in full cry in many arab nations today , as people took to the streets to grieve for iraq s civilian dead and to damn the united states for what they called a deliberate massacre of women and children protests swept across several countries , including yemen , the sudan , libya and tunisia , which along with jordan declared a period of national mourning but on this matter , as on the war itself , the arab world revealed its deep divisions countries like egypt and syria , which belong to the antiiraq coalition , blame president saddam hussein for the civilian deaths , accusing him of leading his own people to slaughter by refusing to withdraw his troops from kuwait no group was more outraged by the american action that palestinians in the occupied west bank , they began what was scheduled to be a threeday commercial strike , while thousands of other palestinians marched through the narrow alleys of refugee districts in lebanon avoidance of land war seen palestinian leaders based in tunis and damascus said the bombing in baghdad on wednesday was an abominable crime some of them charged that it was part of an american war of extermination being waged against iraq s people to avoid confronting the iraqi army in a ground war their accusations reverberated across the angry streets of jordan , where half the people are palestinians and where sentiment for mr hussein as an arab champion runs strong is this how they are going to liberate kuwait \? said walid tarabsha , a chemical engineer who was reading this morning s black headlines at a newsstand in downtown amman does this now give me the right too , to go out and kill every civilian i see \? that was not the view , however , from arab nations intent on removing mr hussein from kuwait and from power , even though they also expressed pain over the deaths of civilians syria assails hussein in a commentary , the statecontrolled damascus radio said in the syrian capital the heart of every arab bleeds when the pictures of death and destruction are shown , except for one heart that remains unmoved it is the heart of the ruler in baghdad , who could put an end to this if only feelings of pain could touch his heart egypt s president , hosni mubarak , also attacked mr hussein personally , saying , it is inconceivable for a ruler to make propaganda hay from the corpses of his citizens the deaths in baghdad were totally ignored by some saudi arabian newspapers and scantly covered by others in gulf oil states like dubai and qatar , newspapers spoke scornfully of mr hussein , accusing him of having remorselessly committed war crimes on a huge scale over the years on amman s sunbleached streets and in the sullen lanes of the beqaa palestinian district 15 miles outside the city , no one could be found who believed the united states version of events that a reinforced concrete building bombed in a residential neighborhood of baghdad was a military command and control bunker and not the civilian bomb shelter the iraqis said it was attacks called deliberate there was virtually universal agreement in the district that american bombers were deliberately going after civilians and that the targets included jordanians trying to flee the war on wednesday , refugees crossing into jordan from iraq reported that 30 jordanian civilians on the road from baghdad , including four children , had been burned to death on saturday when their bus came under an allied air attack the americans knew these were civilian targets , said mahmoud daoud , a 34yearold civil engineer american has failed in its military campaign it has not stopped the iraqi military so now it is hitting civilian targets the jordanian government , denouncing the bombing in baghdad as a horrible massacre , declared three days of national mourning and ordered that flags fly at halfstaff on official buildings across the capital , people also draped black flags from lampposts king hussein , who last week abandoned his previously professed neutrality in the war to side with iraq , demanded that the united nations security council order an immediate ceasefire and send an investigating team to baghdad united nations resolutions authorizing force to remove iraq from kuwait were being used , the king said , to wage a war of systematic destruction against iraq that constituted a flagrant and callous violation of humanitarian law march on embassy blocked on wednesday night , police officers turned away about 1 , 000 jordanians who had tried to march on the united states embassy in amman but apparently in an attempt to defuse rising tensions , the government imposed no such restraints today hundreds of protesters stood outside the embassy s main entrance , where at one point they hurled stones and clumps of dirt scooped up from plant beds some of them then marched to the nearby egyptian embassy , where they broke several windows in another part of the city , demonstrators also broke windows at a building that houses united nations organizations none of these protests led to injuries but on wednesday night , a german student in his early 20 s was stabbed in the chest by a jordanian man who was described by the authorities as emotionally overwrought after watching televised images of the baghdad disaster the police said he had attacked the first foreigner he saw , thinking he was an american the victim was said by the german embassy to be in fair condition at a military hospital us seen as losing for some street protesters , the civilian casualties in baghdad had a positive note to them , it suggested that the united states must be losing the war , because otherwise , they argued , it would not be resorting to what were viewed here as acts of desperation photo a jordanian woman waving an iraqi flag at the us embassy in amman several hundred people gathered at the embassy yesterday to protest the bombing of a baghdad building on wednesday \( reuters \)
as his administration grappled with new york city s most serious fiscal problems since the mid1970 s , mayor david n dinkins offered a message of hope in his first state of the city address , but provided few indications of how the administration would master its budget woes this is no time for despair , mr dinkins said in a speech before hundreds of elected officials and invited guests in the city council chamber though our prospects may seem dim at the moment , a rebound is coming , and it will be based on the wealth of resources that we sometimes , in our gloom , overlook in his 32minute speech , mr dinkins repeatedly talked of the hope , openness , joy , courage and the heroism he has seen in individual new yorkers he said the city needs to look to a brighter future , beyond the current recession that has seen city revenues fall and demands grow for social services for the poor preserving fiscal stability he also called for strengthening laws for juveniles arrested for crimes , to make sure the punishment fits the crime he raised the possibility of a march on washington for stronger guncontrol legislation , and called on legislators in washington and albany to reduce the mandated programs that increase the city s costs in addressing a budget gap that could reach 25 billion over the next 18 months , mr dinkins said that the budget would be cut to the bone to preserve fiscal stability he said he wanted to make sure that the state s financial control board , which monitors city finances , does not step in but much of his speech was devoted to a recitation of how the city s current adversity could pave the way for a brighter future he noted that depressed realestate values here made new york a less expensive place to live in than 40 other cities around the world because our neighboring states and counties have raised their taxes much faster than ours to solve their own budget problems , mr dinkins said , no one has to move out of the cultural and commercial capital of the world speech is not mandated unlike the president s state of the union message or the new york governor s state of the state message , the state of city address is not mandated by charter , law or custom former mayor edward i koch started it in 1979 , abandoned it in some years , and took it up in others mr dinkins chose not to deliver the address last year , using his inaugural speech , instead , to present the goals of his administration under mr koch , who governed during an era of rising city tax revenues , the speech , usually delivered in late january , was chockfull of new programs sometimes vaguely described in areas from the homeless to policing mr dinkins chose to deliver the address in early january , a week before the deadline for the submission of a financial plan that will lay out service cuts that have already prompted angry demonstrations at city hall and firehouses but with almost no money for new programs , mr dinkins focused on longterm goals and enduring ideals instead he ended his address with a reaganesque touch , citing six city residents , who have come to the aid of their fellow new yorkers the list included community organizers , bystanders who rescued children from a fire and an advocate for the homeless the mayor said that they would receive a mayoral gorgeous mosaic award , an allusion to an image mr dinkins often uses to describe new yorkers' varied ethnic and racial communities but as he depicted his vision of the city s future , mr dinkins was unable to summon the former president s common touch his delivery was earnest , but when he began speaking he found the teleprompter hard to see , and rarely looked up from his papers mr dinkins began speaking at 5 04 pm at a podium set up in the city council chamber , before a backdrop of american and new york city flags sixteen palm trees and ferns were trucked in from a parks department greenhouse from forest park in woodhaven , queens , for the occasion he received sometimes polite applause 11 times , until the final moments , when he listed the recipients of his gorgeous mosaic award when he paused for applause and none followed , he said , i think you should applaud them the speech was broadcast live on five television stations notable absences it was mr dinkins s fourth major televised address since his inauguration reflecting , perhaps , the lonely and difficult choices a mayor must make , many who cheered mr dinkins at his inauguration were absent many city council seats were filled by staff members borough presidents claire shulman of queens and howard golden of brooklyn were absent the city comptroller , elizabeth holtzman , was on vacation , and only a handful of the congressmen and state legislators who were expected were present the address came as the dinkins administration has been preparing hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts to close a gap of as much as 25 billion over the next 18 months with so much bad news in the offing , mr dinkins chose to reiterate the administration s achievements the speech was written by albert scardino , mr dinkins s press secretary , and maria laurino , a former writer for the village voice , who was hired as mr dinkins s chief speech writer last october for months , the administration has been under attack by critics , including felix g rohatyn , the departing chairman of the municipal assistance corporation , who say the administration s response to the fiscal problems has been ambiguous and inconsistent peter f vallone , speaker of the city council , said the council would stand beside mr dinkins in his efforts to solve the city s fiscal problems this is a very difficult time to make a speech and rally people , he said , but the mayor has the best of intentions photo this is no time for despair , said mayor david n dinkins , looking hopefully toward the future in his first state of the city address yesterday at city hall \( angel

on the capacious ethnic buffet that is new york city , korean cuisine is only a small , inconspicuous platter that may be because there are relatively few korean restaurants in town or because the food remains mysterious and intimidating to the average diner a fine introduction to this colorful and salubrious cooking can be found at woo chon in midtown s little korea along west 36th street korea s centuriesold culinary tradition emphasizes health as well as harmonious flavors the essential seasonings in every meal are green onions , ginger , garlic , sesame seeds and oil every table also has an array of kim chee , which are pickled vegetables or seafood , most commonly cabbage , turnip , cucumber , squid and octopus there are more than 100 types of kim chee , and in korea there is even a museum devoted to it the basic meal includes steamed rice , a hot soup , kim chee and a number of meat , seafood or vegetable dishes fruit is always served for dessert woo chon , which recently relocated to larger quarters across the street , is an attractive , twolevel establishment with walls of stone and tim ber on the bottom half , and lacquered calligraphy on the top big exhaust vents hover over tables with gas grills in the center after we were seated , a swat team of kim chee commandos descended from all sides , filling our table with little dishes octopus in a mildly hot red sauce was unassailably fresh innocentlooking cabbage packed a wallop from chili peppers spinach and bean sprouts were refreshingly mild , as was the fermented cucumber one of the more interesting tidbits was sheets of pressed cuttlefish , no thicker than a postage stamp , preserved in a soylike sauce squid kim chee is made with lemon , crushed nuts , pear and vinegar it s hard to conceptualize , but it s not bad turnip squares in hot red sauce are not for the fainthearted finally and every meal starts this way there is a cool , clear , faintly citric soup holding slices of translucent radish this pleasing combination is intended to cleanse the palate the korean waiters who speak english try their best to explain dishes , and you will find yourself seeking them out often the menu is much too large to report on comprehensively if you are to start with a soup , however , a good choice is pork dumplings , rice cake , scal lions and thinly sliced beef brisket in beef broth the broth is mildly spicy and richly flavored from long steeping another popular selection here is called spicymild codfish and vegetable soup it is more mild than spicy buckwheat noodles are often used in soups , such as an appealing sweettart north korean dish made with sliced chicken , mixed vegetables and sliced pear , and the puffer fish soup barbecuing at your table is a must when we ordered short ribs , the meat was cut from the bone at our table and placed on the grill its sweet marinade gave the tender strips a caramelized sheen boneless prime beef was equally good either can be had with leaves of romaine lettuce , scallions and rice that you wrap up like tacos and dip in one of several sauces we sampled the barbecued pork cooked in the kitchen , but it came out underseasoned and overcooked some cold dishes sampled , like a platter of brisket , beef tongue and spleen , were secondrate deli fare and woo chon s flirtation with sushi and sashimi is halfhearted

maybe there s no place for my kind of play on broadway any more , says edward albee , slipping down in the black leather sofa in his manhattan loft , so that his hair , long in the back and a bit stringy , hangs over the cushion i find what is encouraged , more and more , is a literate middlebrowism iconoclasm is discouraged rocking the boat is discouraged and i would hope that every play i write shakes a few people up , asks a few questions that people would rather not think about two days ago , mr albee s latest play , three tall women , had its world premiere at the english theater in vienna , where it has been widely anticipated , even in this bicentennial summer of mozart s death , as a major cultural event the public loves him as one of its great idols , says friedrich hoess , the austrian ambassador to the united states for us , mr albee cannot be too thoughtprovoking at home , however , the playwright , once celebrated as the boy wonder of the american theater , has not been seen on broadway since 1983 , when the man who had three arms was decimated by the critics and folded after 16 performances none of the proposed productions of marriage play , which had its premiere in 1987 also in vienna has materialized and finding the sun , a longish 1983 oneact , has been seen only in a few regional theater productions , directed by the author you have to go back to 1975 and seascape to find a time when the critical opinion was less than hostile and the pulitzer prize committee , at least , came down squarely on his side maybe i'm a european playwright and i do n't know it , muses mr albee in a tone that balances selfmockery and arrogance so perfectly that it can be taken either way but and i love doing this in my lectures just look at the playwrights who are not performed on broadway now sophocles , aristophanes , shakespeare , marlowe , moliere , ibsen , chekhov , pirandello , beckett , genet not a one of them if you 're going to be snubbed , what better company to keep \? and mr albee feels the snubs the hysterical , skirthiking 'appalldom' on the part of the new york critics with regard to 'the man who had three arms , ' he sniffs you 'd have thought it was women seeing mice climb up their legs several years ago , he says , he tried to get an obituary of his mother published by the new york times , figuring that not only had she been for many of her 90odd years a socialite of minor prominence , but that she had also raised , albeit turbulently , a playwright of passing renown his request was flatly turned down , he says now he jokes that there has been a longstanding conspiracy to keep his name out of the new york press but it s not wholly a joke we like to shoot down our idols , find the clay feet that s a universal human characteristic , says joanna steichen the widow of the photographer edward steichen , a psychotherapist and a close friend of mr albee s edward sees and reports deepdown emotional truths so accurately that it s just too painful for some people 'the lady from dubuque' 1980 was the only honest cancer play at a time when there was a spate of cancer plays in which the characters behaved as saints and martyrs in edward s play , they behaved as people do , with manic selfinterest and fear and selfish need edward has had to cope with a lot of envious hatred but for as long as i 've known him , which is 16 years now , he has been able to take in the hurt and deal with it he goes on the critical griping has perhaps had less to do with envy than with what walter kerr , for one , perceived as mr albee s growing preference for thinnish and familiar philosophical speculation and a convoluted 'literary' style that has no conversational feel to it what had become of the lacerating power and the headtohead fury of who s afraid of virginia woolf \? the 1962 work that not only picked up the broadway theater by the scruff of the neck and shook it soundly , but also suggested that its author was an american strindberg in the making \? i suppose i could have gone on writing son of virginia woolf' forever , mr albee says but i never believed my own publicity the mistake was thinking i was a broadway playwright i am a playwright , and for a while , broadway was receptive he gets up from the couch and crosses to the kitchen to make a pot of coffee his loft is two stories high in places , and much of its 6 , 000 square feet is given over to an extensive art collection spare , abstract paintings on the walls and , on the highgloss floors , the sort of modern sculpture you usually find in museum lobbies or corporate gardens you just go about your business and write whatever play is on your mind , he says when he returns you see the new great white hopes , or the new great black hopes , coming along , and you go about your business a patrician gunslinger and eternal outsider at 63 , mr albee could probably shave 10 years off his birthdate without arousing suspicions he always had an air of brooding defiance about him , but with time he has taken on the look of a patrician gunslinger the lankiness of the body , the droopy mustache and the leatheriness of the stillhandsome face contribute to the gunslinger image the sharp intelligence , the emotional reserve and the ironic humor , often signaled by no more than a twinkle in the deepset eyes , are the hallmarks of the patrician

washington , oct 13 while the members of the senate judiciary committee and millions of television viewers try to decipher what happenned when clarence thomas and anita f hill worked together a decade ago , specialists in psychology are posing a different question in their discussions of the national drama , pitting memory against memory and strong character against strong character what , many are asking , do the protagonists believe really happened \? this issue came into sharp focus at today s hearings , with republicans suggesting that professor hill was delusionary and with senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , saying that nobody the committee had heard was qualified to psychoanalyze the professor for several leading psychiatrists and psychologists , whose professional specialities center on the dynamics of human memory and the complex , sometimes surreal world of deception and selfdeception , at least three hypotheses can be invoked to explain the otherwise irreconcilably different accounts of professor hill , who accuses her former employer of sexual harrassment , and judge thomas , who emphatically denies the accusation the first , and most obvious , is that either the accuser or the accused is consciously lying , deceiving the committee , the senate and the public the second is that one of the two is suffering from a delusion , a clinical psychiatric disorder the third , and most complex hypothesis , is that both are telling a version of the truth , and that both completely believe their own versions particularly after 10 years , memories distort , said bruce sales , a professor of psychology , psychiatry and law at the university of arizona s tuscon campus it could be they are each remembering a view or a side of it that is partially true and then creating a memory around this partial truth elizabeth f loftus , a professor of psychology and an adjunct professor of law at the university of washington in seattle , said how could anita hill have memories for things that are so detailed coke cans and long dong silver and all the other very , very specific details , unless it really happened \? that s what people are asking responding to the question , she said in my own work i can inject these kinds of details into people s recollections , into the minds of people who are being as honest and sincere as possible i could believe that her recollections could be , in part , things that happened to other people or things she read about it s one hypothesis the other is that it really did happen , added dr loftus , who with katherine ketcham is coauthor of a book on memory , witness for the defense , published this year by \( st martin s press who knows what really happened \? another possibility , she said , is that judge thomas s memory is now selective , but not deliberately so he can be remembering his own past actions in ways that make him feel better about himself in his case , that involves minimizing the conversations , or even denying that they ever took place we 're talking about completely normal people , added dr loftus , who was cited by several of her professional colleagues as one of the few national experts on the dynamics of memory if you start getting into delusional cases then you get into a group of people who are even more suggestible than most of us but these are processes that characterize all of us the question of delusion has been mentioned repeatedly in the past two days , since john doggett 3d , a lawyer in austin , tex , who knew both professor hill and judge thomas , and who signed an affadavit saying that ms hill had an unreasonable impression that he was romantically interested in her he suggested that she may have harbored similar unreasonable assumptions about judge thomas erotomania is the psychiatric term for a condition in which otherwise competent and rational people harbor a fixed romantic delusion the hallmark of this disorder is that the romantic delusion is plausible , although wrong , and the person s behavior is not otherwise odd or bizarre when love turns to anger while it is common for people with erotomania to act on their romantic fantasy in some way writing letters , for example , or otherwise pressing unwanted attention on the object of their fantasy occasionally they keep the delusion a secret when the object of the romantic fantasy does not reciprocate , love can turn to bitterness and anger , according to dr jonathan h segal , a psychiatrist in palo alto , calif , who wrote an article on erotomania in the october 1989 american journal of psychiatry the target of the delusion is typically someone of higher status , according to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual most patients treated for erotomania are young , single women whose scenario concerns an older male , often a boss , dr segal said but that is also the most common relationship involved in cases of sexual harassment like other psychiatrists and psychologists interviewed for this article , dr segal said he was not commenting on the emotional states of professor hill or judge thomas , but making general comments about possible explanations of this conflict evidence called inconsistent several other therapists , however , rejected the notion that professor hill might be suffering from this clinical disorder erotomania just does n't work that way , said david l rosenhan , a professor of psychiatry and law at stanford university the evidence is totally inconsistent several of those interviewed added that if both parties believe they are telling the truth , both would pass polygraph examinations , as professor hill s associates announced today that she had my bet is that although only one of them is telling the truth , neither of them is lying , said paul ekman , a professor of psychology at the university of california s san francisco campus that is n't contradictory , added professor ekman , whose work has focused on the psychology of lying in my studies of lies , he said , one of the things that we find is that the more often you tell a lie and the longer the period of which you tell the lie , the greater the likelhood is that you will no longer remember it s a lie and believe it s the truth a lie , as i define it , is you know at the time you are deliberately trying to mislead another person i presume that initially one of them lied either invented or embroidered , or lied in denying rational , normal people can forget that they 're lying you do n't need to be a psychopath or a sociopath 'terrified at being caught' another possibility , dr ekman said , is that one of them in their mind knows they 're lying to congress and the american people he added if so , the person who s doing that has to be terrified at being caught or they have to be very angry angry at their opponent , angry at the world to justify this in that case , the accused has to be angry about being attacked , dr ekman said , adding from expression , voice and gesture , i can read anger the problem is , both people show it could they both believe their stories are truthful \? absolutely , yes , said dr norman weiss , a manhattan psychiatrist who has served as an expert witness in court cases , though none involving sexual harrassment what s something bad to one person is inconsequential to another there are studies about witnesses that witness events and the degree of disotortion is extroadinary , dr weiss said there may be no single truth to get out of this
florence , june 15 several new experimental drugs hold promise for improved treatment of two of the infections from which aids patients most commonly die , researchers said at a meeting here today the eventual promise of the experimental drugs is greater safety and options for many people with aids who cannot tolerate the standard treatments for the two common complications one is toxoplasmosis , a parasitic infection that often invades the brain to cause seizures the other is a fungal infection of the respiratory system known as pneumocystis pneumonia , or pcp the experimental drugs have been tested in only small numbers of patients , and additional studies are needed to determine the drugs' eventual place in the care of aids patients , said dr henry masur , who heads the critical care medicine department at the clinical center of the national institutes of health in bethesda , md one problem is trying to determine whether the drugs would be most effective when given alone or in combination with other drugs not serious diseases normally toxoplasmosis and pcp are known as opportunistic infections because they seldom cause serious disease in healthy people but can overwhelm an individual whose immune system is severely weakened by aids standard therapies are effective against toxoplasmosis and pcp , and their use to prevent pcp has helped extend the lives of many people who have aids or are infected with the hiv virus that causes it but researchers have sought newer treatments because many people develop blood system problems and other toxic effects also , many people cannot tolerate the rashes and other adverse effects from the standard treatments such reactions can limit the usefulness of azt , the drug used to slow the progression from infection with the hiv virus to the disease , aids looking for lower toxicity we 're looking not so much for more effective drugs but ones that are less toxic , dr masur said the hope expressed at the meeting today is that if the experimental drugs continue to show fewer adverse effects in larger studies , the experimental drugs can be used more effectively in combination with azt and other drugs the availability of the experimental drugs has come about in part because the pharmaceutical industry has taken a greater interest in developing drugs for opportunistic infections , dr masur said in an interview at a meeting of the international aids therapy group the meeting was held a day in advance of the opening of the seventh international conference on aids for toxoplasmosis , the standard treatment is a combination of two drugs , pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine , that has been used since the 1950 s but until recently individuals who could not tolerate the combination were out of luck , dr mazur said small studies have hinted that a class of antibiotics known as the macrolides might be useful for toxoplasmosis among the antibiotics being tested for toxoplasmosis are those known as azithromycin , clarithromycin , roxithromycin and spiramycin , dr masur said none are licensed in the united states 'dramatic response' for one azithryomycin led to a very dramatic response in one patient in new york city , dr masur said but he added that there have been failures among patients tested at the national institutes of health , in part because the experts do not yet know the proper amount of drug to prescribe another drug holding promise for toxoplasmosis is known as bw566c80 and is made by the burroughswellcome company of research triangle park , nc the drug was originally developed to treat malaria studies at stanford university showed impressive efficacy in mice that developed toxoplasmosis , dr masur said , adding that the drug has benefited the eight patients it was tested on in a trial at nih the eight could not tolerate the sulfa in the standard therapy among the other drugs being evaluated for potential benefit against toxoplasmosis are two biological compounds known as gamma interferon and interleukin2 the standard treatments for pcp include the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole , which are sold as bactrim by roche in nutley , nj and septra by burroughs wellcome aerosolized pentamadine is also commonly used to prevent pcp one experimental drug being tested for its safety against pcp is bw566c80 we think this is a very promising agent , dr masur said two other experimental compounds known as wr 6026 and wr 238 that were developed at the walter reed army institute of research in washington are also being studied , dr masur said still another experimental therapy is the combination of a macrolide antibiotic known as clindamycin and an antimalarial drug known as primaquine in another report , dr douglas richman of the university of california at san diego said researchers were beginning a trial of a combination of two drugs against aids among 600 people with advanced aids in several medical centers in the united states the drugs are azt , which is licensed for aids , an a similar one , didioxycytodine , or ddi , that is experimental
stockton springs , me , nov 1 ted reed , the police chief in this rundown town of weatherbeaten houses by penobscot bay , now exists on a salary made up of donations his old cruiser runs on gasoline provided by a garage owner chief reed s plight has been brought about by growing anger among the town s 1 , 383 residents over the recession and rising property taxes in september they voted to do away with their oneman police force , and the drive stalled temporarily only after some townspeople took up a doortodoor collection to keep chief reed on the job on tuesday the question will be settled by a referendum if the vote goes against keeping the chief , the town will have to fall back on the county sheriff s office and the state police tempers are running high familial insults at a selectmen s meeting on thursday night , with beige quilts covering the windows to keep the cold out of the unheated room , members of the audience insulted each other s families and one burly man poked his finger in another s face afterwards , parker gray , the head selectman , summed up the sentiments if you took these same parties and put them in a bar , with a couple of 38 s , i think you can imagine what kind of problem you 'd have although the amount of money at stake here is small it would cost 4 , 000 to keep chief reed and his patrol car operating till the end of the year the issue touches a raw nerve in maine , where the economy has been declining and frustration over taxes has been building for two or three years , especially in poor rural areas similar concerns led two other towns in maine to eliminate their police forces last summer in one , lebanon , a town of 4 , 300 people in the southwest near the new hampshire border , an 18yearold security guard at a campground was stabbed to death while trying to stop a breakin shortly after residents voted to abolish the town s sevenmember police force in july some local and state authorities worry that more communities will follow suit next spring at their annual town meetings , new england s traditional form of town government in which financial and other major decisions are made by a vote of those attending our small towns see their police departments as discretionary spending it s not like it is in big cities where crime is a big threat , said jim damicis of the maine municipal association these towns are counting on their county sheriffs and the state police to take over the duties of their police forces , mr damicis said but the sheriffs and the state police have been hit by budget cuts of their own and are concerned that they may not be able to provide adequate assistance col andrew e demers , head of the maine state police , said , if there are any more cuts , i am afraid there will be a point where we 'll have to decide what we can do and what we ca n't town business and feuds in stockton springs , the battle over whether to keep the chief s job is typical of the fights elsewhere in maine , and , as is true of smalltown tussles , it is spiced with local feuds the conflict began at the town meeting last march when mr gray , newly elected as head selectman , proposed a police department budget of 22 , 000 , including mr reed s salary , gasoline and maintenance for his cruiser that was 9 , 000 less than was spent the previous year mr gray said he believed that the department was simply too expensive people were in a cutting mood , he recalled they had just watched as their property taxes were reevaluated , with the valuation on some waterfront land jumping to more than 100 , 000 an acre from 3 , 000 mr gray offered the chief an option take a cut in his 440aweek pay , or face elimination of his job when money ran out in september chief reed , a bluntspoken 56yearold man who some people here say would arrest his own mother , took his chances , reckoning that come september the citizens would vote to draw enough money from the town s general fund to cover his expenses but at a special town meeting on sept 26 , after two disputed ballots , the decision was no , by four votes ed marshall , a retired 69yearold traveling salesman who voted to extend chief reed s pay , said we all felt sick when we left the meeting i tossed and turned all night mr marshall said he remembered what it was like when stockton springs , a workingclass town of clam diggers and mill hands , did not have a policeman he lives across the street from the local school , and he recalled young people gathering there , drinking and swearing and breaking into the buses the drive for donations so mr marshall and some friends came up with a plan the next week , at the selectmen s meeting , after chief reed s job was terminated , mr marshall s group asked if the chief could be kept on with contributions the answer was a grudging yes , and so the chief was rehired a few minutes later in the next two days mr marshall s group raised 2 , 000 for their police officer mr marshall s team also circulated a petition , getting 242 signatures , seeking a referendum on election day that would have the town pay the rest of chief reed s expenses until the end of the year that way , under maine s form of government , the chief would automatically be kept on three more months , until the next annual meeting perhaps then , mr marshall thought , the town would come to its senses but manly shute , a barrelchested carpenter and lobsterman , was angered by the donations scheme and the referendum he saw the donations as a trick , because it forced the town to continue paying the chief s insurance 'they do n't give a darn' i'm not against the officer personally , mr shute said in an interview it s just that it s the poor people who keep paying and they do n't give a darn about the poor people so mr shute began gathering signatures for another petition , which he presented at the selectmen s meeting on thursday , calling on the town to stop the donations plan at the meeting , one supporter of chief reed shouted at mr shute , your problem is , your name is shute in a derogatory reference to mr shute s large clan of relatives in town mr marshall tried to quiet the dispute let s not get into this , he said this is a good town mr shute replied , well , it was it was halloween , and as the angry participants , including mr reed , left town hall , they noticed his cruiser it had been splattered with eggs photo the recession and rising property taxes in stockton springs , me , prompted voters to do away with their oneman police force in september some residents have since taken up a collection to keep chief ted reed on the job , until the matter is settled by referendum on tuesday \( gary guisinger for the new york times \) map of

london , oct 6 officials in western europe today welcomed president mikhail s gorbachev s proposals for sweeping cuts in the soviet nuclear arsenal and his assurance that the weapons would remain under strict central control as the country continues to come apart but neither britain nor france took up his suggestion that other countries besides the soviet union and the united states consider reductions in their nuclear weapons prime minister john major of britain said london would go ahead with plans for new submarinelaunched trident missiles with more warheads than its existing polaris force president francois mitterrand of france made no public statement at all about the new soviet proposals he said after president bush s announcement of unilateral cuts in american nuclear weaponry late last month that france felt no need to follow the american example since its own small submarinemissile force was not comparable reassuring , kohl says chancellor helmut kohl of west germany today described mr gorbachev s announcement that soviet nuclear battlefield weapons would be eliminated as a further step toward security and stability in europe he singled out the soviet announcement that all moscow s strategic weapons would be placed under a single military command as a reassuring step for the future mr major described the soviet decisions as a turning point in the peace process but he and other officials here insisted that britain would go forward with plans to modernize its nuclear force with four new submarines , each carrying 16 united statesdesigned trident missiles with seven or eight warheads apiece , starting in 1994 trident is the essential minimum defense that we need in this country , mr major said , emphasizing that the soviet union was still an immense nuclear power the british force now consists of four older submarines carrying 16 polaris missiles apiece , with only three warheads on each missile one submarine has been under repairs and may not be put back into service the french have four operational nuclearmissile submarines , with a fifth under repair and a sixth under construction these carry 16 missiles with up to six warheads each the pace of disarmament is increasing , and that s a good thing , france s foreign minister , roland dumas , said britain followed mr bush s lead of sept 27 and said it would eliminate its battlefield missiles , but it also retains longrange bombers capable of carrying nuclear bombs foreign secretary douglas hurd implied in an interview with bbc radio today that a decision on whether to replace those with airtoground missiles might be subject to review , depending on how far and fast the soviets actually reduce their forces the choice on that is some way away , and obviously we are continuing to study how that choice will be made , he said a spokesman for the north atlantic treaty organization in brussels called mr gorbachev s initiative a step in the right direction for a more secure and stable world at lower levels of nuclear weapons western diplomats here also welcomed mr gorbachev s call for quick ratification of the united statessoviet treaty on the reduction of strategic arms that he and mr bush signed in moscow on july 31 in his speech on saturday , mr gorbachev said the soviet union would go beyond the treaty and reduce its own strategic weapons to 5 , 000 instead of the 6 , 000 called for in the accord by 1998 , and said it would welcome reciprocal steps by the united states but some western diplomats here , while accepting assurances from mr gorbachev and leaders of the larger former soviet republics that they will honor all the treaty obligations undertaken by the old soviet union , have wondered how they will actually do this mr gorbachev s statement saturday night provided some reassurance to increase control over nuclear weapons , we bring under one operational command all the strategic nuclear weapons , he said we include the strategic defense systems in just one single arm of the armed forces according to the institute of strategic studies in london , the bulk of the soviet army s strategic forces are based in the russian federated republic , but there are about 200 ss18 intercontinental nuclear missiles in kazakhstan and more than 100 mediumrange missiles in the ukraine , plus nuclear bombs there and elsewhere mr gorbachev also announced a plan to reduce the size of the soviet armed forces by 700 , 000 , in response to mr bush s cut of 500 , 000 in the united states but diplomats here are also wondering how mr gorbachev can make good on such a promise , with the ukraine and some other republics talking about military forces of their own such plans could complicate the carrying out of the 22nation treaty on conventional forces in europe that was signed in paris in november 1990 the ukraine may be talking about a 750 , 000man army , the biggest in europe outside the red army , a western official here said that is n't covered by the conventional forces treaty at all , and potentially it s very worrisome the treaty , which has not yet been ratified by the soviet union , includes extensive provisions for monitoring compliance to prepare for that , the soviet government this year declared 895 sites west of the urals open for inspection but they are located on the territory of russia , the ukraine , byelorussia , moldavia , armenia , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and the baltic republics the three baltic countries are now independent and the others may declare independence none of them were party to the treaty who will insure access to the sites if they do become independent is not clear , western diplomats say who would even negotiate further reductions for the soviet side if decentralization continues is a question that mr bush and mr gorbachev are both sidestepping by proposing unilateral cuts without the need for timeconsuming negotiations
washington , oct 15 in his last full day as the nation s senior banking regulator , l william seidman said he would have left more than a year ago had he not been assailed by the white house chief of staff , john h sununu absolutely no question about it , mr seidman said as he prepared to relinquish the chairmanship of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the resolution trust corporation referring to his visit to the white house in the spring of 1990 and the personality clash with mr sununu , who sought very publicly then to push him out the door , mr seidman said , i went over there with the purpose of arranging an amicable , friendly and smooth transition in an interview over sandwiches in his bare sixthfloor corner office overlooking the washington monument and the mall , mr seidman made these other points none of the nation s largest banks are in danger of failing in the first three months of next year , the fdic may be forced to consider another increase in the premiums it charges banks to insure deposits the administration s attack on bank examiners and regulators , accusing them of helping cause tighter credit , could lead to dangerously lax supervisory standards as long ago as 1986 , senior regulators , including himself , saw many of the warning signs for the crises now afflicting the banking and savings and loan industries but did not move vigorously enough to contain the problems if the economy grows next year at a rate slower than 35 percent to 4 percent , as measured by the gross national product , the costs of bailing out banks and savings and loans might be significantly higher than current administration estimates many economists have forecast a growth rate lower than that , but mr seidman stood by the administration s estimates today he did say , however , that the estimates might be revised based on a new fdic review that will be sent to the office of management and budget this month mr seidman leaves office as the bank insurance fund is on the verge of borrowing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars and regulators are seeking another 80 billion for the savings and loan rescue in his six years as its outspoken chairman , he has built the fdic from a backwater agency to one of the most powerful institutions in the nation , doling out billions of dollars in contracts and determining the fate of the country s most important financial institutions he also supervised the growth of resolution trust into one of the largest financial institutions in the world , but one that is struggling to unload a huge portfolio of real estate at points during the hourandahalf interview , the 71yearold regulator from east grand rapids , mich , recounted his ups and downs with the bush administration and his running battles with congress and its investigative arm , the general accounting office other times he was politely evasive , clearly saving his juiciest anecdotes for his memoirs a rough draft the first chapter on the administration , he said , starts out with the sentences 'if there was one thing i learned in my first tour of duty in washington , it was not to get in a battle with the president s chief of staff here follows the story of how i was unable to carry that out' he said he would disclose his future plans , besides writing the book , on wednesday he said that while the savings and loan bailout would probably wind up costing 250 billion , as a practical matter , americans would pay for it forever because of the longterm borrowing costs he said it would be unwise to pay for the bailout costs now by either raising taxes or cutting other federal programs , particularly as the economy struggles to rebound he also took a swipe at the general accounting office , which in recent months forced the fdic to drastically lower its valuation of the bank insurance fund from about 8 billion to about 4 billion and refused to certify the finances of resolution trust while acknowledging the accounting office s legitimate role as as auditor , he criticized it for issuing what he said were misleading news releases they should stop acting like they were a part of the ball game instead of an observer , he said in looking back at how the banking industry s troubles grew , mr seidman recalled that as early as 1986 he had spoken about how banks were making too many risky loans and that private and public debt was growing at unprecedented rates yellow light , red light i said in a speech in 1986 in san francisco that we must decrease high debt levels and proceed with care and that the flashing yellow caution light is operational , he said the mistake was that i should 've said the red light is flashing , not the yellow light recalling his speech , which denounced large debt levels , he said , what i'm saying is my greatest regret is that i did n't listen to what i said carefully enough of the economy and the weak condition of many large banks , mr seidman observed banks are so time sensitive because the longer recession lasts , the more capital is used up for those who are losing money if we see an estimate that s higher than 10 billion in losses to the bank insurance fund , then i think we will have to raise bank premiums photo l william seidman returned to his office in downtown washington after lunch yesterday , his last full day as the chairman of the fdic \( george tames for the new york times \) \( pg d4 \)
washington , march 4 president bush welcomed the release of 10 allied prisoners by iraq today , but vowed to win the freedom of every single captured soldier and kuwaiti citizen the nation s senior military officer said the war would not be formally ended until iraq accounted for all its prisoners one day after iraqi officers met with allied military commanders in southern iraq , the pentagon said the suspension of hostilities was holding and the white house called iraq s initial compliance with the united nations' conditions for a permanent ceasefire encouraging the bush administration said that in addition to releasing the 10 prisoners , who included 6 americans , baghdad had also supplied the location of land and sea mines in kuwait and the persian gulf to coalition forces , as demanded by the alliance as a condition for a formal ceasefire we 're making progress in our journey from war to peace , mr bush told a veterans' group in the white house in a speech that mingled a sense of triumph with quotations from abraham lincoln and assurances from the president that he was not gloating 'it s not a time to brag' mr bush s comments were part of a concerted effort by the administration today to convey the impression that the united states was not seeking to punish iraq after the coalition s military victory , but to play what mr bush has called the role of the healer it came at the start of a week in which secretary of state james a baker 3d is to begin a diplomatic mission to the middle east mr bush plans to meet next week with prime minister brian mulroney of canada , president francois mitterrand of france and prime minister john major of britain to discuss the future of the middle east it s not a time to brag , mr bush said , quoting lincoln s postcivil war formulation of malice toward none although mr bush has vowed not to spend a single dime of taxpayers' money to rebuild iraq , he added we are a generous nation and we 've got a lot to do now we 've got a lot to do to heal the wounds our argument has never been with the people of iraq , with those hapless soldiers that were sent to a fate that they did n't even know what was in store for them iraqi compliance demanded in his remarks , mr bush repeated that iraq must comply with all the united nations resolutions on kuwait , including ones that require baghdad to renounce its annexation of the emirate and accept in principle that it must pay war reparations , before the allies move beyond the current suspension of hostilities to a more permanent and stable ceasefire but mr bush said he could not relax at all until every single one of those prisoners is home and every single missing is accounted for to the best of the ability of the iraqi forces mr bush said iraq must also free the thousands of kuwaitis seized by its retreating forces in the final days of the war he added , and clearly , on a sad subject , that requires the returning of the remains of all our fallen heroes speaking to another veterans' gathering in washington , a meeting of the veterans of foreign wars , gen colin l powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , also demanded that all prisoners be released in this war , it wo n't be over until we get a full and immediate accounting for all of our pow s and mia s , he said iraqi cooperation noted marlin fitzwater , mr bush s spokesman , said the united states still treated iraqi assurances and commitments with a high degree of skepticism but he said that with the release of the prisoners today , they were being cooperative in a way that was very helpful and we 're optimistic about that mr fitzwater reiterated that until the allies sign a permanent ceasefire with iraq the coalition will keep its forces in the southern part of that country but mr fitzwater and pete williams , the pentagon spokesman , declined to estimate how long that might take mr fitzwater said the united states did not intend to initiate any attempt to prosecute president saddam hussein of iraq on war crimes charges , but would be part of such an effort if one was started by an arab country
a conflict of rights the supreme court and affirmative action by melvin i urofsky 270 pp new york charles scribner s sons affirmative action is an issue about which relatively small segments of the population hold ferociously strong and opposing views while the bewildered majority leans one way and then the other , depending on how the question is framed the debate over how to construe an unfair past and establish a more just future stirs primal emotions both sides bring powerful arguments those favoring affirmative action maintain that a social and economic spoils system has been restricted for generations to white men engaged in their own affirmative action to correct that imbalance , women and minority group members must be given special breaks those against affirmative action argue that if the civil rights revolution taught us that people must not be judged by their skin color or sex , are n't such breaks whether called quotas or goals and timetables the wrong application of that lesson \? is n't the point to reaffirm the individualism of all rather than to promote the balkanization of the country \? since the 1978 bakke case , when nine supreme court justices produced six opinions on the legality of a medical school s plan that set aside 16 spots out of 100 for disadvantaged minority students , the court has found itself caught , like the rest of the nation , between those two arguments what appeared to emerge from bakke was approval for raceconscious recruitment but rejection of quotas since then the court has upheld some affirmative action plans and struck down others , often without clear continuity of reason one of the more noteworthy of those decisions , in this instance involving a woman , came in the 1987 johnson v santa clara county case , when the high court upheld , 6 to 3 , a california transportation agency s promotion of diane joyce over paul johnson to the job of road dispatcher this , despite mr johnson s greater experience and initial selection by a board of men rather like himself ms joyce was sufficiently experienced to make the grade , tested virtually as well as mr johnson and noted that none of the county road department s 238 skilledcraft jobs had ever been held by a woman the story , both human and legal , is a good one , and melvin i urofsky , a professor of history and constitutional law at virginia commonwealth university and the author of many books on the supreme court , generally does it justice in a conflict of rights , a timely and modest work mr urofsky is careful for the most part to stay evenhanded throughout the book we meet mr johnson , quiet and industrious , born to poor kansas farmers , brought up by relatives in texas , who pushed himself along , justly setting his sights on a wellpaying job only to be denied it because he was a white man and we meet ms joyce , a tough , likable widowed mother of four who spent much of her life being told she could n't have a variety of jobs because they were only for men this time she had a county government behind her , she badly needed the money , she was willing to fight and she won mr urofsky , who writes cleanly and briskly , makes us see how essentially similar are the values that ms joyce and mr johnson believe they fought to uphold , values of equal opportunity and reward for merit he offers , too , a nice glimpse of the high court s deliberations on the case through the access that the retired justice william j brennan jr gave him to his files the book does have a failing it does not deliver the human texture it promises we meet mr johnson and ms joyce , but we do not really get to know them , or their lawyers , colleagues and judges depth and drama are missing from some key moments but for those seeking a reliable and accessible examination of a growing national debate , this is a fine place to start
washington , jan 15 declaring to the senate ethics committee that the political heart and soul of this country was at stake , the panel s special counsel made an impassioned case today that three senators should be punished for their dealings with the savings and loan executive charles h keating jr in his closing arguments at the longest public hearings into the conduct of members of congress , the counsel , robert s bennett , portrayed senators alan cranston and dennis deconcini as crass politicians who had done favors for mr keating s savings and loan association because he was a big contributor to their political efforts and several times he bluntly suggested that senator donald w riegle jr had perjured himself before the committee , which he characterized as the lawmaker s most striking impropriety mr bennett depicted the two other senators in the case , john mccain and john glenn , as admirably breaking off their ties with mr keating when it became clear that his own conduct was in doubt the counsel had been instructed by the panel to set out no conclusions about how the members should act but he left no doubt that he believed senators cranston , deconcini and riegle should be punished and that senators mccain and glenn should be cleared options for the committee besides clearing any of the lawmakers , the panel could vote to send them letters of reprimand criticizing their behavior or it could take the more serious step of recommending that the full senate vote to condemn the senators' actions it could also advise the senate to expel any of the members , but that is considered the least likely outcome on the eve of a possible war in the persian gulf , mr bennett appealed to the committee not to lose sight of the case s significance we 're talking about ethics when our nation could be at war , literally , in a matter of hours , he declared late this afternoon reciting the possiblility of war , a recession and other troubles facing the nation , mr bennett looked directly at members of the panel and said in comparison to these crises , some may say that ethics is unimportant but i say to you to accept this conclusion would be a terrible mistake , because with an economy in trouble and war hanging over our heads , it is all the more important that the american people have confidence in you and your ability to judge your peers and reach an honorable and definite decision peppering his summation with highlights of 25 days of testimony , mr bennett outlined his case that three senators violated clear standards of conduct in intervening with federal regulators on behalf of mr keating mr bennett rejected earlier arguments from the five senators that they had violated no specific rules because there were none that addressed such actions as contacting federal regulators on behalf of mr keating s failing lincoln savings and loan association of irvine , calif keating facing charges the counsel argued , for instance , that senator mccain , an arizona republican , and senator glenn , an ohio democrat , followed appropriate standards in knowing when to cut off contacts mr keating called mr mccain a wimp , mr bennett said , because he did not follow the keating agenda to get the bank board off his back lincoln was seized by the federal government in 1989 at a loss of more than 2 billion to taxpayers mr keating is facing fraud charges in california he or his associates had donated a total of 13 million to the five senators or their causes since the hearing s opening on nov 15 , the five senators or their lawyers repeatedly argued that they were treating mr keating as they would have any other constituent , and they denied they were rewarding him for his contributions closing arguments for the five senators are scheduled before the committee on wednesday then the panel of three republicans and three democrats will deliberate in closed session , possibly for several days , on the fate of their peers mr glenn was the only of the five senators who sat in the cavernous senate hart office building s hearing room to hear mr bennett , and he stayed mostly to hear the summation of his involvment in a calm , measured voice , mr bennett offered example after example of how the senators acted behind the scenes to help mr keating he said the case of mr cranston , a california democrat , stood out because of the striking relationship between donations from mr keating and efforts by the senator to help him contributions and requests this pattern of coupling large contributions from mr keating with requests for action was repeated on four occasions , mr bennett said even after he learned that the regulators were recommending that the justice department investigate lincoln for criminal misconduct , the counsel asserted , mr cranston personally contacted federal regulators at least 12 times on behalf of lincoln mr bennett said that mr deconcini , an arizona democrat , also pressed regulators to help lincoln long after he was told of the criminal referral he described how mr deconcini took a leading role in advocating lincoln s case in two meetings between the senators and federal regulators in april 1987 the counsel suggested that mr deconcini ignored all the red flags in continuing to help lincoln
santa barbara , calif , may 22 in 1979 , the voters of santa barbara , hoping to limit growth and keep their idyllic coastal city from becoming another los angeles , voted overwhelmingly not to connect to the state water project , the vital lifeblood of so many arid california cities they succeeded all too well in the view of many santa barbarans who now regret their vote the lack of state water , combined with a searing drought that has entered its fifth year , have left the city and its environs short of water more than 200 , 000 trees have died , hundreds of homeowners have given up on their lawns and water prices have about quadrupled , siphoning about 40 million a year from the local economy housing prices have risen so high that many younger santa barbarans must move elsewhere a glimpse of the future santa barbara , 85 miles up the coast from the urban cacophony that is los angeles , offers a glimpse into a less expansive future in the arid american west the decision santa barbara made a dozen years ago is increasingly being forced on countless other cities in the west as rapid growth begins to bump against limited water supplies on june 4 , voters in santa barbara and the adjoining suburbs of montecito and goleta will have one last chance to obtain state water and even that source is not the endless fount it once seemed to be residents will be asked to approve bonds to build an aqueduct that would pump water over the mountains from california s central valley they will also vote on whether to build a permanent desalting plant as insurance against continued drought in a region where , even in a normal year , it rains only 17 inches almost everyone favors desalting , which can be locally controlled , but the prospect of state water has touched off a bitter debate that has as much to do with control of political power in this beautiful city as with water and growth a clamor for more water has arisen from those who say santa barbara has consigned itself to perpetual obscurity a nice place with a magnificent climate , beautiful flora and graceful redtiled buildings in the spanish style , where retirees who bring their money from someplace else can live in quiet comfort but where young people and growing businesses are forced to move away defenders say that if water was much more plentiful , developers would turn santa barbara into yet another suburb of los angeles burdened by traffic and crime desalting , alone , they say , can meet the city s most urgent needs after the 1979 vote to reject state water , many thought santa barbara s population would stabilize it did not its population grew about 15 percent , to 85 , 571 in 1990 from 74 , 414 in 1980 strikingly , the hispanic population swelled 69 percent , to 31 percent of the total but many hispanic residents are crammed into illegally converted garages or are doubled up water use grew in 80 s water use in santa barbara continued to grow , from 12 , 745 acrefeet in 197879 to 16 , 092 acrefeet in 198889 then it plummeted after the drought left the city s two reservoirs nearly dry \( an acrefoot is 325 , 851 gallons , or about enough to supply two typical households for one year \) santa barbarans get about 10 percent of their supplies from wells , which have become increasingly salty and less reliable advocates of obtaining state water say that if the 1979 hookup had been approved , it would have meant an average of 20 , 000 more acrefeet a year for the city the hardships inflicted by the drought have changed many minds about state water i no longer feel that you have to rely on shortage of water to limit growth , said david m yager , a lawyer and former county supervisor who was born here 60 years ago for an economy that is based on tourism and agriculture , you cannot have brown lawns , brown fields and empty fountains if you want to survive economically much of the decorative vegetation at his former home in montecito , now occupied by his former wife , has died by one estimate , 30 million of tourist business was lost last year because of publicity about the drought and fires look at the economic damage that s been done , and at what environmental cost , said pier a gherini jr , president of the santa barbara chamber of commerce he said he believed that a ballot measure passed two years ago to limit commercial development would be a much better tool to control growth than contrived water shortages 'another suburb' none of these points have swayed opponents of state water we are trying to use anything we can to keep this area from becoming another suburb of los angeles , said gordon j fulks , a physicist who works at a research center here the most powerful force fighting growth and state water is bob klausner , a former new yorker who made his fortune in the textile industry , became fed up with life in new york and moved here with his wife , betty , in 1973 after searching the country for his notion of the ideal spot he bought and remodeled a magnificent spanishstyle house on the ocean in montecito and became a potent behindthescenes political force in santa barbara county
these are tough times for pan am its competitors are picking over its routes and equipment as if it were the carcass of a weekold turkey pan am is still flying , but a month ago it slid into bankruptcy and even though its logo still sits atop its park avenue headquarters , the building itself was long ago sold to an insurance company it was n't always like that in the 50 s and 60 s , when juan trippe was in charge , it was respectfully known as pan american world airways the emphasis was on world a big american flag was painted on the sides of its blueandwhite planes , and scattered around the globe were billboards that proclaimed pan am the world s most experienced airline as america s flag carrier , it was haughty , even imperious but it was the nation s magic carpet you felt at home and safe flying it to tokyo or hong kong or bangkok it s hard to believe today , but once luxury and flying could both be mentioned in the same sentence pan am pioneered both the china clipper and the stratocruiser the china clipper was a graceful seabird that looked right at home bobbing in a south sea lagoon the stratocruiser was a glamourless flying boxcar on the outside , wall to wall luxury inside in the late 1930 s you could clipper leisurely out to honolulu , bed down overnight at the royal hawaiian , then fly on the next day , refreshed pan am passengers did not simply travel in those great planes , they journeyed in them the stratocruiser could bed you down aboard there was even a plush sitdown bar in the belly of the plane that spawned lasting friendships on the long hauls to tokyo or teheran none of those planes was as roomy as today s 747 or as fast as the concorde but you could get your steak homecooked , some of the stewardesses were nurses , and none of them , to anyone s recollection , ever greeted a passenger with hi , i'm jane , and i'm your flight attendant abroad , pan am s resident managers were america s proconsuls they lived big , entertained lavishly and , very often , were more helpful than the local embassy over the years the competition tried harder and pan am grew seedier but for most of its history pan am and america were one and the same in the late 1950 s when a recently arrived correspondent sought out lord beaverbrook for advice on covering britain , he was told , do n't assume that british history began the day you stepped off pan am sarcastic or not , even a lord assumed in those days that pan am was the only way to go
washington , feb 3 the toughest chore of political salesman ship anyone is attempting in washington these days is the argument that political action committees are getting blame they do n't deserve last week , president bush denounced bigmoney influence in politics and called again for the abolition of pac s lawmakers complain all the way to the bank , some of them that their dependency on pac s degrades them and taints the legislative process and hardly a week goes by without one reform group or another appealing for money to help it rid american politics of pac dollars it s the latest round of those appeals , citing the ethics charges against senators who helped charles h keating jr and his lincoln savings and loan association that have spurred the pac s to defend their good name , so to speak if you have any doubt that our campaignfinance system reeks like a threedayold fish , look no further than the 'keating five' scandal , proclaimed a recent fundraising letter from joan claybrook , president of public citizen , founded by ralph nader she said contributions to public citizen would help it limit campaign spending and pac s fred wertheimer , president of common cause , wrote recently that in 1990 a tide of campaign money , swelled by specialinterest political action committee \( pac \) contributions , flowed overwhelmingly to incumbents , skewing the elections and corrupting the congress he said the savingsandloan scandal was a classic example of specialinterest money at work , and maintained that when it comes to the s l crisis and highflying influence money , the 'keating five' scandal is the ultimate smoking gun enter the national association of business political action committees , complaining to the same ethics committee members who are now weighing the five senators' cases the association complained that common cause and others have unfairly attempted to tie pac s to the keating case martin d garber jr , a phillips petroleum executive who heads the association , said pac s had not contributed any of the money that allegedly moved the senators to pressure regulators on mr keating s behalf and indeed , nowhere in the 15 million that mr keating and his associates lavished on the five senators was there a contribution from a political action committee mr garber went on to argue that contributions from pac s were the healthy way to put money into politics , because they are publicly disclosed and limited \( to 5 , 000 for a primary and 5 , 000 more for a general election \) mr garber is swimming upstream , challenging a current of opinion against pac s that has gathered strength from year to year it got nationwide attention in 1988 when thensenator dan quayle said , it s time we get rid of pac money in his vicepresidential debate with senator lloyd bentsen of texas pac money has never been important in campaigns for president and vice president , but mr quayle probably knew something about it anyhow of the 22 million he raised for his 1986 senate reelection race , 38 percent came from political action committees steven f stockmeyer , a former republican campaign operative who now serves the business pac group as its executive vice president , scoffs at his party s antipac language as searching out for some moral high ground they could posture on and at the same time threatening to punish pac s that were n't giving enough to republicans but the idea had appeal across party lines last year the senate voted to prohibit pac contributions in all federal elections , and the house voted to limit how much pac money house candidates could take there was no serious effort to reconcile the two bills on these provisions or others , which left lawmakers with the opportunity to boast of having voted for reform and none of the inconveniences either bill would have imposed this year , the leaders in both houses say they want action soon enough to have the chance to do the real legislating in a housesenate conference before another election year is upon them and , whether it s logical or not , senate embarrassment over the keating affair is almost certain to hasten passage there of a measure that makes it harder for all pac s to do business , tougher on what mr garber calls the legitimate players in the current system
washington since world war ii , the world has lived free of a nuclear weapons calamity but that does not mean the us remains safe from longrange ballistic missiles launched accidentally by the soviet union or deliberately by a third world country for example , a soviet submarine caught fire and sank off america s east coast in 1986 none of its missiles were accidentally launched earlier , in the 1980 s , a soviet submarine in soviet waters inadverently launched a nucleartipped ballistic missile that fortunately traveled only several hundred yards in 1988 , i proposed that the us explore the development of an antiballistic missile defense system against accidental launches in recent years , as soviet ethnic and separatist tensions have risen , my concerns have grown fighting in azerbaijan and the baltics has forced the authorities to move nuclear weapons out of these areas of strife our director of central intelligence has said this new concern lowers the level of our confidence in moscow s ability to control its nuclear arsenal an equally disturbing development is the spread of ballistic missiles to the third world the cia estimates that , by the turn of the century , 15 to 20 third world countries will have them many of these missiles could be armed with nuclear , chemical or biological warheads as a result of the gulf war , a strong consensus has developed in support of building missile interceptors superior to the patriots for defending our allies and us forces deployed in regional conficts i support this effort but why should tel aviv or riyadh be entitled to protection atlanta or new york city do n't have \? this month the senate armed services committee took a realistic step toward meeting america s missile defense needs its recommendation appears in the fiscal 1992 defense authorization bill , which the senate will begin debating today the committee voted to set a goal to deploy an abm system to defend against limited ballistic missile strikes the panel wants to deploy 100 abm interceptors , allowed under the treaty , at a reopened base at grand forks , nd , by 1996 but this will occur only if the deployment is affordable and its effectiveness can be demonstrated to the next president and future congresses while this system could not protect the entire continental us against all conceivable threats , given current interceptor technologies , eventually it could grow into such a defense against the most probable limited threats to make this a reality , negotiations with moscow are necessary to modify the 1972 abm treaty to permit more than the one groundbased missile site the treaty sanctions the committee emphasized groundbased systems instead of spacebased weapons it has dropped the administration s plan for deploying brilliant pebbles rocket interceptors in space , although research on this and other followon technologies will continue criticism of the armed services committee s action from some quarters , including the new york times , has been swift and sharp , but without merit first , critics claim that the committee s proposal would undermine strategic stability and force the soviets to tear up the justconcluded start treaty this is wrong how can the soviet union complain with a straight face about our deploying 100 abm interceptors when it has just finished upgrading its 100 abm interceptors around moscow and when it retains 8 , 000 strategic nuclear weapons under start \? the 1972 abm treaty is based on a philosophy of strategic stability in which neither side is given incentives to launch a nuclear first strike the pact prohibits defenses formidable enough to intercept and destroy the other side s retaliatory forces that survive the first strike the armed services committee requires that the the interceptor system it proposes be kept well below that mandated in the treaty second , critics say the proposal will lead america down a slippery slope toward eventual emasculation of the abm treaty this , too , is wrong the committee calls only for negotiations on modest amendments to permit a more effective us defense against limited attacks the treaty itself provides for an amendment process in light of missile proliferation in countries within missile range of the soviet union , moscow might well agree to amendments should it say nyet , there is no explicit or implicit commitment in the committee proposal to abrogate the abm treaty the us needs a twotrack policy of diplomacy and defense we must strengthen lax us and allied controls on arms exports and pressure the world s leading missile makers including china , north korea and the soviet union to halt their sales at the same time , we must have a strong us defense as insurance against the failure of diplomacy to restrict proliferation and against accidental launches drawing

three weeks after the westchester board of legislators declared a rabies health emergency , confirmed reports of the disease among animals are increasing with concern growing about the threat in the suburbs , pet owners are lining up outside clinics to have their animals vaccinated by midweek , 13 confirmed cases of rabies had been reported in westchester since april 4 , officials at the county health department said ten of the diseased animals have been raccoons the others were two foxes and a skunk state health officials said the number of wildlife rabies cases statewide has reached a 30year high through may 3 , 204 cases had been reported , compared with 225 for all of last year and 54 in 1989 so far in the local epidemic , there have been no reported cases of humans contracting the disease , although two dogs that bit people are being quarantined in weschester , as are two in putnam county the four dogs , none of which had been vaccinated against rabies , are being observed at the owners' expense to see whether they are carrying the disease rabies hot line in westchester , the health department has set up a rabiesinformation hot line 2855210 among other measures , the department is warning residents to keep their pets inside as much as possible , particularly for feeding use leashes when walking dogs , and make sure garbage lids are secure so as not to attract raccoons wild animals that are seen exhibiting unusual behavior or acting unusually aggressive , sluggish or friendly especially animals spotted during daylight hours should be reported to the health department through its 24hour number 2855100 under terms of the health emergency declared last month , county residents must vaccinate their cats and dogs against rabies or face penalities of 25 for noncompliance 1 , 000 if the pet attacks anyone and has not been immunized officials have estimated that as many as 500 , 000 dogs and cats live in westchester , half of which have not been immunized if such pets bite someone , the owners will be given the choice of destroying the animal or subjecting it to a fourmonth quarantine , which could cost several thousand dollars , said mary landrigan , a spokeswoman for the health department vaccinations for 10 a county clinic and several private ones that have been set up are vaccinating pets for 10 the turnout indicates that the public is responding to the health emergency at the palmer animal hospital in larchmont last week , for example , a special fourhour clinic drew 400 people with their pets , which included at least one rabbit despite the response , county officials are considering a measure that would mandate the licensing of cats which , because they wander more than dogs , are more likely to contact raccoons the most common carrier of rabies dog licensing , which has long required proof of a rabies vaccination , has proven to be an effective mechanism for protecting dogs and their owners , ms landrigan said rabies , a viral infection that is a form of encephalitis , is spread through the bite or saliva of infected animals and poses a serious threat to humans and household pets treatment , if begun immediately is invariably successful , health department officials say , but without such treatment , rabies is almost always fatal once contact is made with a diseased animal , it is important for people to respond right away , ms landrigan said survivors no longer functional if they wait until they feel sick , it s too late , she said the few victims who survive a rabies attack , she added , do so with such severe symptoms they are no longer functional treatment for human rabies victims consists of four shots administered over the course of a month unlike in the past , when the injections were given in the patient s stomach , the current method involves shots in the arm except for an injection of gamma globulin , blood serum that contains antibodies the gamma globulin injection accompanies the first rabies shot and is administered in the buttock the entire course of treatment is expensive , costing about 800 a precautionary vaccination is recommended for people who work regularly with animals , including veterinarians , trappers and wildlife experts the vaccination , three shots of a lesser dosage than the actual rabies treatment , costs about 100 county health officials have ordered parks department employees likely to encounter wild animals to receive the precautionary treatment in putnam county , a horse that had not been vaccinated was destroyed after it killed a rabid fox that had wandered into its paddock as a result of that incident , health officials in both counties are also urging residents to immunize livestock against rabies 75 of raccoons could die although rabies can affect any animal , it is most common among raccoons health officials , who estimate the westchester raccoon population at 80 , 000 , predict that the rabies epidemic could destroy 75 percent of those raccoons by the end of the summer but the cyclical nature of the disease , they say , could keep rabies in the area for at least 30 to 40 more years wildlife experts are unable to explain how the current outbreak began , but many believe it is a consequence of overpopulation among the raccoons , which are threatened by few natural predators but can quickly transmit the disease among themselves the disease can also be passed from mother raccoons to their babies through saliva and breast milk the countysponsored rabies vaccination clinics for pets will continue at the animal emergency hospital in greenburgh , at 193 tarrytown road an appointment is required and may be arranged by calling 2855100 clinics will be held may 17 , 22 and 31 and june 7 , 19 and 21 private clinics offering 10 vaccinations for pets include the palmer animal clinic in larchmont \( 8349000 \) and guiding eyes for the blind in yorktown \( 2454024 \)
wall street gave investors the toughest time last year since 1981 , final stock market figures showed yesterday hotel , leisure and machine tool stocks were the worst performers , according to the standard poor s corporation healthcare , soft drink and tobacco stocks were the best computerized program trading , roughly 20 percent of overall activity , accelerated the downturn , said laszlo birinyi , president of birinyi associates , a wall street research firm that monitors such activity 366 points below peak the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip stocks ended the year at 2 ,

33022 , up 150 points for the day but down 66 percent for the year the figures clearly show that the bluechip stocks held up better than the rest of the market in a year hampered by a sluggish economy , poor earnings , a seriously weak real estate market , banking troubles and the fear of a war in the middle east as a result , professional and individual investors alike turned to such safe stocks as cocacola , ibm and merck typical for new year s eve yesterday s trading was typical for new year s eve , when many investors are more interested in the holiday than in trading volume amounted to 1141 million shares , making it the quietest new year s eve since 1985 asked if he noticed anything particularly interesting yesterday , rao chalasani , chief investment strategist for prescott , ball turben in cleveland , remarked with a chuckle , i turned off my machine an hour and a half ago he turned the machine back on and , noting the low trading activity , said the low volume s not only related to the holiday but also to the un deadline for iraq after the 250point runup in the dow since its low in october and comparable gains in bonds , investors are taking a waitandsee attitude there s plenty of cash on the sidelines , he added , and it will be supporting the market on any pullback commenting on program trading , where market professionals make a profit on small price differentials between , say , futures contracts on the sp 500 index and on the stocks themselves , mr birinyi maintained that the practice had a markedly negative impact and accelerated some of the downtrends considerably more than it helped on the up side the market in 1990 , he said , was up 52 percent of the time the obvious reason we ended with a down year , he added , was that the bad days had greater declines than the good days had gains he said that program trading averaged about 20 percent of the volume during 1990 well over an hour a day on average downtrend was accelerated during this period , he added , the market fell more than 800 points but that s not to suggest that program trading was the primary cause but in many cases program trading accelerated the downtrend without causing it there s a very definite strong relationship , but there are too many facets to the stock market to blame or credit just one figures supplied by sp on the best and worst performing stock

the locker room has closets of its own , deep and dark and crowded we 've been inundated with the names of famous athletes people want us to 'out , ' says gabriel rotello , editor in chief of outweek , a gay and lesbian news weekly i think the proportion of gay men and lesbians who are pro athletes is higher than their proportion in the mainstream population overcompensating , i guess in golf and tennis , maybe 50 percent more like 90 percent when i was still playing , laughs lynn greer of columbus , ohio , a lesbian who was on the pro golf tour from 1978 to 1982 the tour was a subculture of gay culture every dyke with two nickels to rub together got to palm springs for the dinah shore it was the event while 90 seems a high percentage , there was no question that the men who wanted to make money from the women s tour were concerned about its lesbian image , a concern that s now pervasive throughout women s sports the real panic is in women s intercollegiate sports , says arlene gorton , an associate athletic director at brown university in providence , ri athletic departments do n't even like to run workshops on sexual and gender issues , they think it will be used against them in recruiting there s homophobia , of course , but i think it s basically a power issue , another way of controlling women especially now that there is money in women s sports homosexuality and bisexuality in american sports has usually been treated topically , as rare outbreaks , despite a continuing roster that includes babe didrikson , the founder of the women s golf tour the tennis champion bill tilden , pro running back dave kopay , major league umpire dave pallone , past tennis champions billie jean king and martina navratilova and the olympic gold medal swimmer bruce hayes pat griffin , a lesbian who has coached in high school and college and now teaches physical education at the university of massachusetts at amherst , believes that gay male athletes are not as challenging to mainstream gender roles as are lesbians it goes to the heart of the struggle against sexism , says griffin sports is the last place men can hang on by whipping out the lesbian label , they can intimidate women and keep control of sports that s how rene portland gets away with it rene portland , the penn state women s basketball coach , turned the spotlight back on two months ago , when , without allowing herself to be quoted directly , she let it be known that no lesbian could play for her rights groups were outraged , while some coaches grudgingly gave her credit for a cynical recruiting tool in a time of backlash professor gorton found it disgraceful that penn state did not disavow portland s policy she saw it as part of a pattern it pushes more women into the closet , it pushes more issues under the rug , says gorton i 've seen young lesbian women get married just to get a coaching job and i 've heard athletic directors say , 'if we have lesbians coaching here , i do n't want to hear about it' when i got to college in 1974 , says golfer greer , the other golfers told me to stay away from the coach , she was one of 'them' i thought , who do they think i am \? silence was the safe way to operate in those days once known with either pride or disdain as the lesbian professional golf association , the ladies' tour has become very much more heterosexual in the past few years , greer said she credits title ix with making sports more socially acceptable for straight young women , and more of a lucrative career opportunity others believe that as female athletes became a sales force for cigarettes , whiskey and cars , they needed to be perceived as heterosexy for the predominantly male sponsors only a superstar who is economically important to the sport , like martina , could come out without terminal damage to her career but even martina is not immune to what the advocate , a biweekly gay and lesbian magazine , calls dyke bashing in its current cover story last summer , former champion margaret court accused martina and other lesbian and bisexual players of ruining the sport and setting a bad example for younger players what we 're seeing is a recreation of the discrimination against blacks , professor gorton says they will spoil the neighborhood , ruin the game , hurt recruiting substitute the word 'black' every time you hear 'lesbian' , and wonder if rene portland could get away saying the same thing i called penn state wednesday and left questions for the athletic director and the sports information director is coach portland s policy acceptable , and is it policy throughout the department \? i left a question for the football coach , joe paterno would he keep a gay player off his team \? as of this writing , none have responded they were correct if they assumed that at deadline time i would go away for now they were wrong if they assumed the issue would leave with me
new brunswick when jewel , a medical student from south orange , meets duke , a medicine man , or psychic healer , at a rain dance one summer , they strike a spiritual connection and the sex is pretty good too then mundane things get in duke s way accustomed to his personal space under the stars , duke , who is given to such pronouncements as the essence of reality is unreality , is uneasy in a restaurant like its namesake characters , the play , jewel and the medicine man , resists convention for a time it starts as a sort of freeform theatergame exercise with five characters sitting on stools , or crouching on hind legs , as when duke plays a rooster they ramble about universal vibrations of truth , reclaiming femininity , self actualizing and things like that then the play settles into being a thoroughly conventional and confused romantic comedy the world premiere of kate waters s jewel , billed as a postmodern fairy tale , is the first offering of t3 productions , based in new brunswick the new company is presenting it at george 99 , the studio theater of the george street playhouse here , in collaboration with the waterfront ensemble , a hobokenbased playwrights' workshop four of the play s five actors are alumni of the mason gross school of the arts at rutgers university what ms waters appears to be getting at is the search of the presumably 20something generation for love , commitment and perhaps marriage , but certainly meaning of some sort or , as one scene title has it , the l word , the c word and the m word throughout , the gist of each scene is flashed upon a screen \( scene 1 relationship is a many splendored thing scene 12 the manwoman game \) so singleminded is that search the s word , for sex , is never less than implicit that a middleaged listener may well respond , i'm glad i'm not young anymore in the second act , the five characters begin to surface beneath the clutter of selfinvolved cliches the characters include roy , the philandering lover of claire , jewel s best friend , and tim , a handyman an intended double entendre \? who hangs out in a bar still , none of them become consequential , in spite of engaging performances , especially by laura swanson , who is an amusingly acerbic claire by the end , one suspects that what ms waters may be really writing about is not what she is ostensibly writing about lacking an objective distance from her characters , both the playwright and the director , arlen bensen , are simply overindulgent through the repeated playing of old songs of the 40 s , 50 s and 60 s and the evocation of oldtime movie stars , a longing for the way things were is ever apparent at certain moments , references to the foulups of parents their divorces , reconciliations , therapy sessions suggest that all jewel and her cohorts mean to do is mend the threadbare values they have fallen heir to but first they must come to stage life jewel and the medicine man by kate waters , at george 99 at the george street playhouse , 9 livingston avenue , new brunswick performances are thursday through saturday at 8 pm , saturday also at 3 pm and next sunday at 3 and 7 pm for tickets \( 908 \) 2467469 photo laura swanson , left , with robert osborne , second from left , shelley delaney and joseph barbarino in scene from jewel and the medicine man , playing in new brunswick
baltimore , oct 16 rebecca moody , a 59yearold retired secretary , watched the anita f hillclarence thomas drama on television and came away thinking it s unbelievable that a woman could n't stop something like that at its inception tammie lee , a 33yearold worker at the house of ruth , the shelter for battered women here , said i was harassed , and i nipped it in the bud i stopped it right then and there one guy said , 'i see you do n't take any guff' theresa lowry , 52 , an elementary school teacher , asked would n't you haul off and poke a guy in the mouth if he spoke in that manner \? in the bluecollar corners of this city , the women who keep house or bag groceries , nurse patients or work in construction have little sympathy with professor hill they are angered by sexual harassment , which many say they have experienced but that anger does not translate into support for the softspoken law professor who accused the supreme court nominee of intimidating her with graphic discussions of pornographic films a decade ago matter of disrespect in part , it is a matter of disbelief but perhaps in greater measure , it is a matter of disrespect the feelings of these women provide some clue to the reasons why , although nearly 40 percent of american women said in recent polls that they had been sexually harassed , only about 25 percent of women said they believed professor hill s versions of the events more than judge thomas s interviews with about 20 women in baltimore in a variety of occupations showed sharp divisions , with lawyers , human services professionals and politicians showing strong sympathy for professor hill at a retreat thursday for all the women in the state legislature , all but one believed her version of the events , said state senator paula hollinger of baltimore but white and black women from the lowrent neighborhoods of this city look at professor hill as cowboys might look at a dude adrift in dodge city , their incredulity spiced with contempt the workplace they know is an untamed frontier where bad men roam and smart women learn how to take care of themselves or leave 'women against women' roberta gayle , a radio talkshow host on wcbn here , calls the phenomenon waw , or women against women yet women here are not stuck in some prefeminist time warp about 465 percent of the work force in the baltimore area is composed of women , slightly higher than the national average fortyfour members of the maryland state legislature , not quite one in four , are women gov william donald schaefer made national headlines in february when he commuted the sentences of eight battered women convicted and imprisoned for attacking or killing the men who beat them but that does not mean maryland is an oasis of enlightenment women in state government say that examples abound of demeaning conversations with men at the house of ruth , which 14 years ago was founded as one of the country s first shelters for women beaten by their husbands or livein partners , the executive director carole alexander was still shaking with anger over the hearings and the senate s 52to48 vote confirming judge thomas as an associate justice of the supreme court the potential for backlash here is very great , ms alexander said for men inclined to minimize this problem , it 'll enhance their minimization she said women who believe they can take care of such situations , when professor hill could not , will continue in this belief she said this was mistake if we minimize the issue of sexual harassment and say it s not a problem , she said , we 're sending a very very bad message to the community her colleague , judy wolfer , 33 , a lawyer who defends battered women on trial for attacking their partners , said if you have a case where the battered woman fights back , the last person you want on your jury is a formerly battered woman she 'll say i got myself out of it why did n't she \? ' valerie gebreamlak , who , like ms lee , works at the center and sees its clients regularly , had far less sympathy for professor hill i might have stayed on one job , if i needed the money , she said i sure would n't have followed him to another job i honestly think something happenned none of these women said that sexual harassment did not exist , and many said they believed judge thomas had said or done something to professor hill her story , in fact , made them talk about their own view from another era there was a guy who was pinching my bottom at work years ago , said honey ashel , 48 , who does volunteer work in pikesville , a suburb just northwest of the baltimore city line i waited , and eventually he started pinching someone else s bottom because he liked their s better senator hollinger said i know an elderly woman , 82 years old , who , after these hearings , told a friend for the first time about something when she was 12 and just beginning to develop , a pair of men who lived in her building started chasing her one day they chased her around the yard , grabbing at her breasts she did n't tell anyone about it for 70 years , not until this week but only rarely did the personal experiences provoke feelings of empathy for professor hill a lot of women do handle this sort of thing themselves , said nancy gregor , 43 , a lawyer with the firm of kramon graham but when you 're younger , for some women it may be more difficult you have to develop in some fashion a feeling of power as you move on in life , you have some more resources to handle it darby carrington , 30 , an unemployed construction engineer , said what he was supposed to have said to her , i 've had said to me , jokingly , and i 've had said seriously by people trying to get a reaction you have to make sure you get across that you 're a professional if someone is n't willing to accept that , you make sure you 're not in a room alone with him but some women like ruth ennis , the director of human resource services for phh fleet america , a subsidiary of the business services firm phh corporation , said that their work made professor hill s lack of reaction to what she said was harassment believeable a number of things are hauntingly true in her testimony , said ms ennis , who used to investigate sex harassment complaints in jefferson county , ky she was afraid of losing a career track , a person who would be a valuable resource to her networking this is not her fault , but it shows the mark of an insecure person she added , if what professor hill said was true , the man was not seeking a date , he was seeking to intimidate and control her sexual harassment is not an act of lust or a compliment or an attempt to get a date it s an action of control one should first and foremost say , 'no ! ' in a loud clear voice and mean it photos i was harassed , and i nipped it in the bud , said tammie lee , right i stopped it right then and there one guy said , 'i see you do n't take any guff' ms lee talked with a fellow worker , valerie gebreamlak carole alexander , director of a shelter for battered women , said , if we minimize the issue of sexual harasment and say it s not a problem , we 're sending a very very bad message to the community \( photographs by marty katz for the new york times \)
new york city s largest shelters for the homeless are a gross official embarrassment , none more so than the huge fort washington armory at the north end of manhattan some 600 men bed down there on cots set out on a vast open floor built for national guard drills there s little security , less privacy and no dignity that s one reason to put fort washington high on the list of shelters to be closed or drastically scaled down under mayor david dinkins s new plan for the homeless but there s another reason , just as compelling removing the homeless from the armory could revive a sports program of immeasurable value to the city , at virtually no public cost for a halfcentury before the homeless moved in , the armory was the center for high school track for all new york and beyond during the indoor season , teams from more than 100 public and parochial schools trained on the drill floor , large enough to accommodate a 220yard oval nearly every saturday , the armory played host to huge meets that might draw teams from 200 schools some 12 , 000 city high school athletes used it each year coaches and runners considered it a unique place in a city where scarcity of suitable space severely inhibits team sports for youngsters , especially those who do n't go to private schools for a few years , the runners tried to coexist with the homeless after the city set up its shelter on the drill floor on days of the big meets , the homeless men were ordered out , their cots piled up on the infield but coexistence quickly deteriorated the halls where athletes suited up smelled not of muscle liniment but of urine , wrote marc bloom in a 1988 oped article in the times a fetid odor pervaded the place homeless men occasionally wandered among the youngsters and disrupted the sporting events parents and coaches began to worry about safety events like the bishop loughlin high school games , the largest indoor track meet in america , squeezed into smaller sites unable to use the armory , some competitions simply stopped in short , loss of the armory to the homeless dealt a severe blow to high school track and to civic spirit track , after all , is an ideal sport for urban public schools equipment is cheap and skills are relatively simple huge numbers of youngsters can participate at different levels of ability as many as 100 students might join a single school s team sports on that scale are powerful tonic for the spirit of depressed city schools norbert sander , a physician who went to school in the bronx , bears witness to that he recalls competing at the armory in the 1950 s under a coach named joe fox within four years i went from a submidget sprinter to a distance runner of reasonable ability , he recalls his achievements at fort washington earned him a full college scholarship running track changed my life , he says lately , dr sander has been making the rounds of city officials , community groups and business executives to promote revival of the armory s high school track programs the place could be restored for competition for about 250 , 000 , he estimates , a sum he believes could be raised easily from private donors mayor dinkins s plan to replace all the armory shelters , including fort washington , gives the doctor , and the city s high school athletes , reason for hope
tokyo , aug 25 for all the amazing races and remarkable long jumps , the gold medals , records , titles and honors that have defined carl lewis s life in track and field , little of the past could have foretold his stunning performance tonight in the 100meter final of the world championships and , certainly there was nothing in the past to match it enduring growing doubts about his ability to run faster and questions about his age , now that he is seven weeks past his 30th birthday , lewis won the fastest race in history , setting a world record of 986 seconds he led an american sweep as six of the eight runners finished in under 10 seconds only twice before in the final of the 1988 seoul olympics and in one of the semifinals tonight had as many as three sprinters broken 10 seconds in a race for the ages , it seemed only appropriate that one of the aged should win , with a time that sliced 4hundredths of a second off the world record set by his friend and 24yearold teammate , leroy burrell , just 10 weeks ago at the national championships in new york in the race tonight , burrell broke the previous record as well , finishing second in 988 seconds dennis mitchell of the united states was third at 991 , followed by linford christie of britain in 992 , frank fredericks of namibia and brigham young university in 995 and ray stewart of jamaica in 996 christie , fredericks and stewart all set national records in the race , only robson da silva of brazil and bruny surin of canada failed at the 10second barrier , with times that could have won a thousand other races , 1012 and 1014 , respectively while the times give the race its place in history , they do only partial justice in illustrating the significance of the moment for lewis even he had trouble putting things into perspective for a roomful of reporters at a postrace news conference he laughed about a scolding from his coach , tom tellez , before the race about his not doing his best in finals of major competitions and he cried through a poignant remembrance of his father , william , who died in 1987 this is a most special time , lewis said haltingly he ca n't be here with me , but i know he s with me when there s a clear sky , he s able to see through the clouds tonight , he was able to see through the dark , and i was happy i was able to do what i could do what the sprinter did was follow three preliminary rounds in which he led all those in the competition with a 1012 , then a 980 helped by tailwinds over 9 miles an hour on saturday , followed by a 993 in the semifinal , which preceded the final by two hours that time merely equaled the thirdfastest time ever run in the event burrell led the other semifinal group with a 994 , followed by mitchell and christie , each in 999 as lewis wandered through his explanation of what happened tonight and why , he cited burrell as the foremost influence on the outcome both are products of metropolitan philadelphia lewis is from willingboro , nj , and burrell is from lansdowne , pa and they have trained together under tellez in houston for more than five years and have become good friends the older , lewis was parttime idol and fulltime mentor until burrell began overtaking him last year raking in the medals by that time , lewis had won six gold medals in two olympics \( 1984 and 1988 \) and five in two world championships \( 1983 and 1987 \) he even gained credit for a world record in the 100 , the 992 he ran finishing second to ben johnson of canada at seoul but lewis only had that record because johnson produced a drug test that showed he had been using steroids this invalidated johnson s time , 979 , and cost the canadian his gold medal as well two years after seoul , burrell had surpassed lewis , posting the best times in the world in the 100 last year and again this year , when he snatched lewis s world record with his own , in his third victory over lewis in four races no way could i have done this without leroy , lewis said he set the tone the whole year if he had not run the 990 , i would n't be here i had to run , technically , the best race of my entire career to beat him , and if i had been one percent less , i would have lost it could well be that lewis was something less than 99 percent of his best , even in so glorious a victory his start was good but not great , and before he reached 50 meters , at least four other runners were ahead of him , including burrell , who was out well in admonishing him , tellez had told lewis that in the 1984 olympics , the 1987 world championships and the 1988 olympics , he had concentrated better in the semifinal than he did in the final , never mind the results lewis remembered rather than panic , he stayed focused and drove , his trademark those knees , christie said when he gets going , he s like a choochoo train five or six people must have broken the world record for 60 meters , lewis said i felt great , but i was still about fifth but i still felt confidence at 80 meters , i felt very good , and at 90 , i had cleared everybody but leroy that s when i was beginning to get the idea i could win this that s why i looked over to see where he was he only passed burrell in those final strides , and burrell did himself no favors by leaning as the line approached instead of surging if i had n't leaned , burrell said , maybe i 'd have been a hundredth faster nearly 75 , 000 spectators here in national stadium were delirious they continued cheering through lewis s victory march , on which he carried an american flag and was joined by burrell and mitchell , who put their arms around his shoulders lewis got teary then , too , and again during the starspangled banner , which followed the medal ceremony emperor akihito and empress michiko even stayed to watch how many times before had be gone through similar ceremonies \? maybe too many to remember , but none at this advanced age , and that was a factor in the mix of the night , as well thirtyanything is ancient for a sprinter of the finalists , only christie , who has never matched lewis s times , is older , and he found consolation pronouncing himself the best 31yearold runner in the world it kind of tugs at you , lewis said of the age thing i try not to give people free rent in my brain but , ok , it gets to you when they say , all of a sudden , carl is dead but , hey , i did n't think at 24 , 25 or even 28 that i would have run my fastest at 30 i can still hang there with the young boys photo carl lewis , second from left , after winning

san domenico was n't the first restaurant to open with a muchpublicized celebrity chef nor was it the first to have its luminary quietly slip away once all the hoopla had died down valentino marcattilii , whose restaurant in imola in northern italy held a twostar michelin rating at the time , came to new york city in 1988 to help open san domenico , and he did a splendid job his consultancy ended two years later , about the same time his imola establishment lost a star since then , things have never been quite the same at san domenico the current chef , the germanborn theo schoenegger , is a highly capable professional who follows the path cut by mr marcattilii whereas mr marcattilii and his team had a touch for turning out exquisite fare that at the same time seemed so homespun , the current kitchen appears to be overreaching san domenico s dining room is more colorful these days since the addition of vivid italian paintings the rest has sort of an autumnal aura , with terracotta floors , ochertinted walls , scalloped glass sconces on marble columns , luxurious leather chairs , orange tablecloths and matching doilies on silver plates extraneous noise is well muted , making san domenico a good choice for business entertaining as for service , the captains are alert and helpful , but at times it seems as if there are not enough of them on the floor two simple appetizers on the current menu can be recommended a glistening tartar of marinated salmon with garlic sauce , and artichoke slices paired with delightfully salty mullet roe there is also a wellseasoned white bean soup holding firm little wheat kernels one dish that needs reworking is pumpkinfilled tortelli \( small ravioli \) with an amaretto sauce cut with red pepper flakes the sweet pumpkin and the excessively sweet sauce do n't give the hot peppers a chance mr marcattilii imported the house specialty from imola a large raviolo , containing ricotta , spinach and a softcooked egg , set in a puddle of butter and parmesan when the balance is correct , this is a stunning dish mine was overpowered with parmesan two other pastas were on target lasagnetta , a wide , thin noodle , draped over shrimps , mussels and scallops in an herbed shellfish stock , and homemade spaghetti tossed with tart broccoli rape and good olive oil one of the best pastas sampled was ravioli filled with minced pheasant and squab , served in a lusty thymeaccented pheasant sauce san domenico has a whopping 670 labels on its wine list it s nice to see a section on the list that recommends particular bottles to accompany specific types of food the depth in particular wines is formidable 19 barbarescos , 30 barolos and 10 sassicaias , to name a few good buys are possible , but prices are in general what one would expect in a place with such an inventory to support the first entree sampled was overcooked scallops in a pleasantly sharp potato and grappa sauce another letdown was a special , halibut wrapped in spinach and steamed , served with a viscous mullet roe sauce that broke down on the plate , leaving an unappetizing oil slick far superior was the deftly poached shrimp served in a cannellini bean sauce perfumed with rosemary another hit was salmon giftwrapped in thin slices of breaded zucchini , cooked to perfection and served in a light white wine and herb sauce one does n't see sturgeon in restaurants very often the public is more enamored of its roe the seared fillet of sturgeon served here , with a firm , dense flesh , could have used more seasoning and the socalled potatomayonnaise with it was mostly mayonnaise , which made for a cloying combination game dishes are the best options succulent braised goat infused with the flavors of savory cooking liquid saddle of rabbit wrapped in pancetta with artichoke chips and a white wine and basil sauce , or moist breast of pheasant in a light juniper berry sauce if you have never had a dessert made with eggplant , do n't bother ricottafilled eggplant skins with chocolate sauce are more fuss than they are worth instead , try the thick custard embedded with prunes , the vanilla ice cream doused with espresso , or the heady baba drenched with rum and floating on a velvety espresso sauce while san domenico has lost some of the sparkle and consistency it had at the outset , it is still holding up

los angeles it is important to be clear about the issue in the current dispute between the us and israel it is whether israel is going to annex the west bank and gaza in the years ahead without meaningful objection by the united states the nominal subject of the conflict is israel s request for 10 billion in loan guarantees to help resettle soviet jews the israeli government and its american supporters say the guarantees must be approved at once , while president bush wants congress to hold up considering the idea for four months but the very suddenness and haste of the israeli request make plain what is really at stake prime minister shamir and his government want the united states to get committed to this new program without any chance to put conditions on it conditions that would inhibit the process of israeli settlement in , and effective annexation of , the occupied territories this is a last clear chance for the united states to do something about the planting of settlements in the west bank and gaza american policy under the last five presidents has opposed settlements , but the policy has had no effect indeed less than none , because us aid makes the settlements possible how could that be \? yossi sarid , a member of the israeli knesset from the citizens' rights party , explained in the los angeles times through a simple circular movement , dollars in aid for israel flowed to security , education and welfare , while shekels freed from those budgets flowed into the construction of at least 200 settlements the american government agreeably played dumb the same thing happened with a first us program of housing loan guarantees the bush administration insisted on a promise that the program would not be used to settle people in the occupied territories the israeli government gave the promise but then used other funds to accelerate the building of settlements settlements are rapidly bringing the occupied territories to the point of no return a point where israeli annexation is a reality , whatever the political pretense that would be a fateful moment for all of us who yearned for the creation of the jewish state and who hope for its safety and prosperity israel would then be a binational state , with 17 million west bank and gaza palestinians inside its borders they would not have rights of the kind that americans take for granted , such as the right to vote in short , israel would have an alien people in its midst , and it would have to keep that people down by force forever forever , that is , unless the israeli politicians who want to expel the palestinians from their homes in the west bank and gaza such as rehavam zeevi , the farright member of mr shamir s cabinet who this week called president bush an antisemite have their way such an outcome would be terrible for israel , morally and politically the arab states on its borders will not make peace the peace that israel so needs if settlement and annexation proceed there would be material consequences , too whatever aid the us government gives cannot be sufficient for the great humanitarian enterprise of absorbing the soviet jews there must be investment by the industrial world , and that will not come in the needed amount if the situation on the borders and inside the country remains unstable some who criticize mr bush say he could ask congress later to impose conditions but the chance of doing so once the loan guarantee program is in place is approximately zero or again , it is said that mr shamir may voluntarily freeze the settlement process if a peace conference gets under way yes , and the moon may land in toledo , ohio , broken into neat packages of green cheese mr shamir has always said he is for a greater israel , and he is a man who means what he says an especially sad aspect of this dispute is the role of american jewish organizations many of their leaders are deeply opposed to annexation but they have got themselves into the position of supporting just about anything that yitzhak wants , even when annexation is going to be the result president bush is courageous to resist the demand for a blank check in loan guarantees his position is essential to the hope of peace and to the future of israel

east rutherford , nj , sept 2 in january , the last time the giants played the san francisco 49ers , they beat them on a field goal as time ran out tonight , with five seconds left , they beat the 49ers on another field goal matt bahr won last season s conference championship game , 1513 , with a 42yard field goal tonight , with five seconds left , he kicked a 35yard field goal , and the giants won , 1614 that was a fitting end to a battle between what might be the two best teams in the national football league it was a marvelous finish for the screaming sellout crowd of 76 , 319 at giants stadium this was the beginning of an era for the giants , with ray handley as their new head coach and jeff hostetler as their new starting quarterback it may also have been the beginning of an era for the 49ers because steve young was their quarterback in place of joe montana , the 35yearold legend sidelined by tendinitis in his throwing elbow typical giants49ers game new eras or old , this was a typical giants49ers game there was hard hitting by two active defenses there were big passes and big thirddown plays by both teams and , with scrambling quarterbacks in place of the usual pocket passers , there were big runs to keep drives going the giants won the last super bowl and the 49ers the two before that , so this was a showcase game on the showcase of national television the 49ers had won 18 straight road games , an nfl record , and seemed on their way to beating the giants , who were oneandahalf point favorites the giants carried a 137 lead into the fourth quarter then young , who had connected on a 73yard pass play to jerry rice for the 49ers' first touchdown , scored on a 5yard scramble the giants then threatened , but bahr , who had kicked field goals of 35 and 28 yards earlier in the game , was short from 51 yards but the giants got one more chance and made good with 4 minutes 40 seconds left , they got the ball on their 22yard line they moved to the 49ers' 18 , mostly on hostetler s passes , as the clock ran down from there , bahr kicked the gamewinning field goal it seemed like january all over again but not to bahr this was just a good start , bahr said you 're playing on a monday night against a team that had won 18 straight on the road hostetler agreed this was just one game , he said the super bowl is gone and in the past the next one is a long way off the drive at the end was a real tribute to the team the defense had to hold them and it did then we had to get down there to put points on the board , and we did the giants' touchdown came in the second quarter on ottis anderson s run from inside the 1foot line in all , anderson carried 15 times for 45 yards and hostetler 5 times for 45 yards hostetler showed poise in completing 17 of 31 passes for 228 yards young completed 12 of 22 for 162 yards charles haley , the 49ers' combination linebackerdefensive end , sacked hostetler once and forced him to fumble , although hostetler recovered the ball the 49ers were called for frequent penalties , but none for the many times they held lawrence taylor , the giants' outside linebacker did hostetler enjoy his debut in his new role \? i enjoyed it , he said right after the final kick handley enjoyed the game , too they told me they would n't all be this easy , he said with a half smile and a half sigh the giants scored the first time they had the ball by converting their first two third downs on thirdand8 , dave meggett turned hostetler s short pass into a 20yard gain three plays later , on thirdand4 , the giants put in four wide receivers instead of throwing to one of them , hostetler pitched to meggett for a 9yard gain on the next play , stephen baker got behind eric davis in the end zone and hostetler threw to him he caught it , but he was out of bounds three plays later , bahr kicked a 35yard field goal and the giants led , 30 the 49ers took the ensuing kickoff and nearly were pinned deep in their own territory on thirdand9 , lawrence taylor sacked young on the 49ers' 8yard line but mike fox , the giants' young defensive end , was called for putting his hands in guard roy foster s face on the play so instead of the 49ers being forced to punt from their end zone , they still had the ball six plays later , on third and9 , rice got behind myron guyton and greg jackson , the giants' safeties rice pulled in young s pass on the giants' 42 and raced to the end zone to complete a 73yard touchdown play the conversion put the 49ers in front , 73 giants get lead back in the second quarter , the giants regained the lead they started on the 49ers' 44yard line , and on second down hostetler scrambled for 25 yards two plays later , he passed to tight end howard cross , who bulled his way to inches from the goal line on the next play , anderson smashed over , and the giants led , 107 with 1 minute 45 seconds left in the half , the giants got the ball on their 31 on the first play , hostetler s pass to baker turned into a 47yard gain when the drive stalled , bahr kicked a 28yard field goal , and the giants led , 137 , at the half extra points five hours before the game , the giants activated three starters william roberts , the offensive guard mark ingram , the flanker , and dave meggett , the punt and kick returner meggett is also the thirddown back and occasional tailback and wide receiver the three players signed thursday after they had missed the first 45 days of preseason one roster position had been available because eric dorsey , the starting left defensive end , was placed on injured reserve friday after arthroscopic knee surgery the other spots were opened monday afternoon when the giants placed james milling and johnie cooks on injured reserve milling , a 5foot9inch , 160pound wide receiver , is a fourthyear pro signed as a plan b free agent from the atlanta falcons the giants said he injured a hamstring saturday afternoon in the final full practice for this game cooks , in his 10th pro season , is especially valuable because he is an outside linebacker who can also play inside he sprained his right ankle nine days ago against the new england patriots in the final preseason game and had been limited since then photos quarterback jeff hostetler on 25yard scramble that led to giants' secondquarter touchdown against the 49ers \( vic delucia the new york times \) \( pg b7 \) lawrence taylor , left , celebrating after matt bahr \( 9 \) made gamewinning field goal with 5 seconds left jeff hostetler \( 15 \) was the holder \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg b10 \)

even as many motorists watch their insurance premiums drop in the wake of gov jim florio s sweeping transformation of the state s automobile insurance laws , some insurance industry experts and legislators say the governor s plan is already following in the footsteps of previous unsuccessful attempts to rescue the state s ailing automobile insurance system in the last year , for example , three independent studies have predicted that the market transition facility , the successor to the debtridden joint underwriting association , is inexorably sliding into its own multimilliondollar deficit while department of insurance officials insist that they do not anticipate a shortfall , industry experts say that the studies are accurate and that consumers could end up footing the bill if companies are granted rate increases to offset losses resulting from paying off the deficit at the same time , some experts are calling the governor s plan nothing more than a bandaid that will inevitably fail to mend the system others say that only radical , politically unpopular remedies can produce an insurance system that is fair to consumers and profitable for insurance companies still others say that despite the fact that premiums are decreasing , regulations imposed by the state insurance commissioner unfairly penalize many drivers by allowing insurance companies to charge exorbitant surcharges against those who commit minor traffic offenses the renewed debate comes on the heels of last tuesday s apparent repudiation of governor florio s controversial political strategies , and as the allstate insurance company , which insures nearly half a million vehicles , proceeds with its plans to stop writing policies and pull its business out of the state for good we have felt all along that legislatively killing the jua certainly did n't make the problems or the conditions that created them go away , said ronald krauss , vice president of communications for the american insurance association , a new yorkbased trade organization of insurance companies mr krauss said that despite repeated attempts at insurance revamping by legislators and governors of both political parties , the insurance system in place in new jersey today was only marginally better than it was 20 years ago the wellmeaning efforts of the politicians to hold down auto insurance rates just wind up not succeeding , mr krauss said you ca n't legislate away economic reality the economic reality that the insurance industry is now facing , he said , is the deficit in the market transition facility under governor florio s fair automobile insurance reform act , the debtridden joint underwriting association was dissolved and the estimated total of two million drivers who were insured by it were transferred to the market transition facility rates set at same level rates for drivers insured by the market transition facility were set at about the same level as those that had been charged by the joint underwriting association , notwithstanding the fact that the association had accrued a 34 billion deficit unlike the association , however , the market transition facility will essentially selfdestruct as drivers are shifted into the voluntary market only 10 percent of the worst drivers will remain in the pool by the end of september 1993 , and they will then be placed in an assigned risk pool , an insurance pool of otherwise uninsurable drivers that would be similar to the assigned risk plan that preceded the joint underwriting association when the law was passed , officials said the market transition facility would be selfsupporting that expectation , however , appears to have been overly optimistic in november 1990 , two independent studies of the market transition facility were commissioned one by the insurance department and the other by the market transition facility itself both studies showed the transition facility to be running at a significant loss robert aldorisio , consulting actuary for milliman robertson of new york , the company hired by the insurance department , said his company had calculated that in order for the market transition facility to break even , rates would have to be raised by 621 percent with no increase , mr aldorisio said recently , the market transition facility could have been expected to run up a deficit of as much as 1 billion the insurance department disagreed with the company s projections and raised rates 186 percent the department also took exception to the study that had been requested by the actuarial committee of the market transition facility itself that study , prepared by william m mercer inc , new yorkbased actuarial consultants , predicted a 1 billion deficit frank j karlinski , a principal of the company , said that since that projection did not take into account the 18 percent rate increase that was granted after the study was done , the projected 1 billion deficit would be about 18 percent lower anyone looking at it logically has to come up with the same conclusions , mr karlinski said
jerusalem , may 3 the israeli government is openly acknowledging for the first time that tens of thousands of soviet jews are postponing or canceling their moves to israel because of the country s inability to provide jobs for those already here in dozens of emotional speeches over the last 18 months , israeli leaders have tied the nation s hopes for the future to the successful absorption of the soviet union s jews now they admit that they are failing late last month the government revised its official estimate , saying that no more than 200 , 000 soviet jews are now expected to move here this year rather than the 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 expected before some officials say the number may actually fall even lower this is a real tragedy , said michael kleiner , head of the parliament s immigration and absorption committee at least half have decided that for the time being they have changed their program we 're talking about a snowball gaining speed the bank of israel , in a major report just issued , warned that unless the government immediately carried out fundamental economic changes to create new jobs , up to 200 , 000 of the soviet jews who have just arrived would decide to leave over the next several years even now , the nation s unemployment rate stands at about 11 percent , the highest rate in recent times by the end of the year , the bank of israel s and other economists estimate , the rate could rise to between 13 and 18 percent and when that happens , the bank study says , thousands of the new immigrants as well as many other israelis will probably flee the study does not try to guess where these people might go but it seems likely that many would try to move to the united states the financial problems causing the rising unemployment are manifold the economy is heavily state controlled more than 60 percent of the nation s economic activity is the result of governmentrelated spending year after year the statistics show sluggish growth , doubledigit inflation and a currency that seems to be forever declining in value those are not conditions that promote the creation of jobs time and time again over the last two decades , public and private economists have urged the government to divest itself of its extensive , poorly managed business and industrial holdings to free up the economy so it can grow and create jobs nonetheless , a new study published by american economists at the institute for advanced strategic and political studies in jerusalem says the economy is still riddled with moneylosing stateowned enterprises , a huge government bureaucracy , dozens of official monopolies and cartels , massive taxpayer subsidies of manufacturers , price controls applied to a quarter of all consumer goods , tariff and nontariff barriers to free trade , foreign exchange controls , government domination of the capital markets , government ownership of 93 percent of israel s land , oppressive levels and rates of taxation and bureaucratic hurdles to entrepreneurship israeli economists acknowledge much of that but almost every attempt at change is stifled by a government so tied up in interministerial bickering that it never seems able to carry out any of its plans just as important , the allpowerful national labor union representing 90 percent of the state s workers often calls strikes that shut much of the country down when it believes its interests are threatened under those twin pressures , little ever seems to change in another report , published almost two years ago when the nation s unemployment rate was first approaching 10 percent , the bank of israel issued an urgent warning that the government must immediately put together a wellthoughtout , longterm economic strategy to create new jobs only a few would deny the need for a drastic reduction in the current level of government intervention , it added now , michael bruno , governor of the bank , said in an interview this week there 've been changes but they 've been very , very slow too slow 'looming disaster' in economy seen alvin rabushka , a senior fellow at the hoover institute at stanford university and the principal author of the institute for advanced strategic and political studies report , draws a darker conclusion israel s leaders , he writes , are making no discernible effort to face up to the looming disaster of israel s economy , together with the squalid farce being made of the russian immigration in fact , every plan offered so far to address the unemployment and immigrant absorption problems advocates greater government intervention in the economy , not less that is not only because of political inertia the dozens of governmentcontrolled enterprises have grown to be an important vehicle for patronage appointments and other political debtpaying and so , the institute study says , the israeli vision of the future is to continue down the same failed , dismal path of more and bigger government the immediate victims are the soviet jews just over 254 , 000 new immigrants have moved here since january 1990 , and more than 90 percent of them are from the soviet union

mineola , li , dec 18 at the very time they are preparing to dismember and decommission the illfated shoreham nuclear power station , officials here began the process today of seeking an alternative use for its nuclear shell , possibly including a new gasfired plant with little comment and none of the bitter public protest that has dogged the 20year shoreham saga , trustees of new york state s long island power authority said that within two weeks they would seek proposals from several large companies to retrofit the plant we are convinced that conversion is a genuine option , said richard kessel , chairman of the state authority , which purchased the shoreham station for 1 from the long island lighting company in 1989 the question now is whether qualified bidders will actually step forward the general electric company , the brooklyn union gas company and cms energy inc , a company that has converted a large nuclear station in midland , mich , to a gasfired plant , are known to have expressed interest in the shoreham project but mr kessel said he did not know which , if any , would submit proposals that meet the state s unusual requirements all the costs under the plan , any private company that takes on shoreham would submit a fixedprice bid , pay all construction costs and bear the burden of any cost overruns it would also retain partial ownership and operational responsibility for the new plant consultants for the state have estimated the cost of the conversion at 217 million , less than the 269 million that the long island lighting company estimated that it would pay to build a nuclear power station at shoreham in 1970 and a fraction of the 55 billion that was eventually spent before the plant became a symbol of the stalemate over nuclear power in the united states one advantage of conversion , the state officials said , was that the turbines , power lines , control room and some other components of the abandoned nuclear plant could be adapted to a gasfired plant in a separate proposal under study in albany , the site of the shoreham plant , on long island s north shore , would be used as a terminal for ferry service to new haven within minutes of approving the proposal to seek bids on converting the plant , trustees of the state agency awarded 506 million in contracts to six companies that will supervise its decommissioning as a nuclear plant among the many problems facing the nuclear plant is that it was contaminated by radioactive material during lowlevel operating tests in 1985 decommissioning the plant , which will require removal of its nuclear core and contaminated equipment , must be approved by the federal nuclear regulatory agency , which is expected to act on the matter early next year ultimately , mr kessel said , cleaning up the shoreham plant will cost 166 million in new york state funds
paul cheng , his eyes red with exhaustion and grief , stood over the tracks of the west 96th street subway stop in manhattan and spoke to the darkness grace , grace , grace , he said , repeating his sister s name none of the dozen commuters , absorbed in their newspapers or staring vacantly past the dimly lighted rows of girders , lifted their heads but mr cheng was not speaking to the living he was speaking to the dead i am calling to her spirit , he said , standing next to his mother , shirley i am calling for her to come into us it was two days earlier , on tuesday , at exactly the same time , that grace cheng , a 31yearold waitresss who lived at 20 west 102d street , bolted between two subway cars in pursuit of a man who had grabbed her purse she fell and was dragged by the moving train , the police have said she died 12 hours later from her injuries in her handbag was 1 'we believe her spirit is alive' mr cheng , a retired jockey who now trains horses in new jersey , was in hong kong when his sister was killed he arrived in new york late on wednesday , and yesterday , at 10 45 am , the time the incident occurred , he went with his mother to the spot where his sister had fallen my mother did not want to come , he said i do not think she will come here again but i told her we had to go once for my sister after this , i tell my mother she will come with me to hong kong new york is no good for her now my sister was beautiful , he said we are buddhists , he went on we believe that her spirit is alive and will have another life i hope she will be beautiful again to the people at the station , the death of ms cheng was only more reason to be anxious about the subways many said they carefully watch those around them , keeping away from the tracks and refusing to enter cars at the front or the end of the train , or cars where there are few riders i try to be more alert after something like this , said denise placakis , 25 she said she stays in view of the closedcircuit camera near the platform and away from the tracks the suspect is a man with a long conviction record for robberies , many on subways the police said the man , brian lawrence , 30 , of irvington , nj , had preyed on womenwaiting for trains in dingy stations we do not know why she chased him , ms cheng s brother said she had been robbed twice before and had done nothing i told her many , many times that new york is a dangerous place and she should be careful the c train , its headlight beam pushing through the tunnel s darkness , thunderedand screeched into the station people on the platform stepped into the maroon cars one young man went to mrs cheng , who has a limited command of english , and took her hand i am so sorry for you , he said she nodded , her fingers wrapped tightly around a damp handkerchief two burly transit police detectives , whospoke on the condition that they not be named , showed their badges to the conductor , who was leaning from his window moments later the conductor s voice came over the loudspeakers in the cars will anyone who has knowledge of an incident which occurred on tuesday morning disembark from the train and speak to the transit detectives on the platform , he said mrs cheng and her son watched the detectives , one in a beige trenchcoat and the other in a blue trenchcoat the doors of the train remained open no one moved from the cars after a minute the doors closed soon , the train disappeared into the tunnel at the far end of the station mr cheng , who immigrated to the united states with his sister , brother and mother from shanghai in 1975 , pulled a large color photo of his sister from under his coat the photo was protected in a ziplock plastic bag the detectives , their feet cold from the wet concrete floor , stood uncomfortably in the dreary , subterranean stop two flights below 96th street nobody thinks much about transit crime in this city , the detective in the beige coat said the courts think things like purse snatching are n't important so guys like this just go on making a living stealing purses from women home is long island now a train plunged by on the opposite track heading uptown , sending a gust of cold air against the detective s face and drowning out the rest of what he was saying the detective said he does not live in new york anymore he lives on long island when he first took his children on the subway , he said , they were terrified mr cheng walked shyly over to the detectives , his slight frame dwarfed by their height and girth wrapped in the bulky overcoats please , sir , he said can you show us exactly where my sister died \? she did n't die here , the detective in the beige coat said she had many hours of operations in the hospital before she died they worked on her for a long time he stopped for a moment but it started down there , the detective said , pointing toward the tunnel on the uptown side it finished here , he added slowly , and as he spoke he swept his arm to cover several dozen yards of track until he pointed almost directly in front of mr cheng and may i have permission to come again , mr cheng said , once more , to leave flowers \?

harts , wva as the fourwheeldrive lurches across the mountain , splashes through the creek and bounces down a graveled lane , miles from the cushioned comforts of blacktop , a thought occurs john denver may have immortalized west virginia s country roads , but he did n't have to drive on them in west virginia , the struggle to build and maintain roads is a sisyphean quest that is woven into the state s politics , with significant social and economic consequences bad roads can keep children from school , workers from work and the sick from people who can heal them they bring endless promises from west virginia s politicians and occasional rulings by the state supreme court a harder road to build no other state combines the mountainous terrain , dispersed population and poverty that makes roads so hard to build in west virginia roads are more expensive here than they are in just about any other state , and few states have less money to build them west virginia may be the only state where a roadless town has petitioned the soviet union for foreign aid west virginians are constantly preoccupied with their roads , said ken sullivan , a historian who edits the state magazine , goldenseal but if bad roads have been part of the state s sorrow , they are also part of its glory by preserving some of the region s isolation , they help maintain the distinct culture that keeps so many residents from ever wanting to leave for the families in sand creek hollow , a few mountainous miles from harts , the road to school has brought the kind of epic misadventure rarely found outside road runner cartoons every morning , until a recent court decision , the hollow s 11 children patience , frank , amy , marie , larry , jason , april , t c , jasper , eddie and shawn would crowd into louise collins s dilapidated red pickup truck down the hollow they would bounce on a dirt road that sometimes crossed the creek and other times was the creek assuming no ice or floods , they would emerge at the hollow s mouth , turn left and hug the railroad track for three miles , spitting gravel from there , all they had to do was climb out of the truck , crawl under the occasional parked coal train and scoot across a swinging bridge without sides that dangles 60 feet above the guyandotte river in good weather , that is in bad weather , the truck would bog down and the children would push we 'd be late just about every morning , said patience collins , now 15 years old , who is louise collins s daughter everybody 'd be in class looking at you that s embarrassing , water squishing out your shoes since a 1986 ruling by the state supreme court , things are better , though how much so remains in dispute holding that the right to attend school includes a right to get there , the court told the state s division of highways to fix the road these days , the middle section of its fourmile stretch is studded with progress s own jewel gravel but , with a good rain , the end that crosses the mountain and opens onto blacktop still turns to gravy , making it too dangerous to travel and the other end is still blocked by creek and railroad 2 miles in 2 hours the local school board now sends in a fourwheeldrive vehicle in good weather , the trip , about two miles as the crow flies , takes about 45 minutes in bad , it has been known to last two hours conditions there are not unique we 're reluctant to print letters to the editor about poor roads , because they just set off an avalanche of letters saying , 'my road s worse than yours , ' said don marsh , editor of the charleston gazette political brawls over west virginia roads are older than west virginia itself , dating back to the time when virginia was united westerners accused easterners of hogging all the development money that , along with slavery , led to the westernmost counties' separation from virginia in 1861 a century later , in 1965 , congress created the appalachian regional commission as a conduit for development money in a 13state area since then , about twothirds of the money has gone to road building emphasis is changing those roads , along with the federally financed interstates , have reduced the region s isolation , providing fourlanes between most major west virginia cities and efforts by the commission and others have helped bring health clinics and social services to underserved areas but getting out of the hollow can still be a feat we 're just now getting around to taking the emphasis off the interstate and switching it onto those local roads , said randy epperly , of the division of highways in most mountain states west of the rockies , the population congregates in towns and cities in west virginia , by contrast , the population is spread out in the hollows carved by the state s countless streams this means it takes more roads to reach the people higher road costs and west virginia is the only state that lies completely within appalachia states like north carolina , kentucky and virginia have lowland areas with prosperous cities that can help subsidize road building in the mountains in steep , creekcrossed west virginia road building almost always entails earthmoving and bridge construction , and the high cost s bleeds away money from other services it lowers the overall quality of social services that west virginians can draw on , said john alexander williams , a leading historian of the state how much does it cost to build a west virginia road \?

santiago , chile suddenly , a look at the economic map of latin america shows a startling change after a decade of no growth , crippling inflation , rising foreign debt , protectionism and bloated state payrolls , governments at least for now have found a new economic religion balanced budgets are in , as is privatization , the buzzword for selling off government enterprises negotiations to reduce foreign debt have been successful in some countries , especially mexico , and are continuing in others stabilization and discipline have become winning political slogans the free market , open economies and deregulation are now part of the vocabulary of taxi drivers and laborers in latin american cities there are signs of change everywhere in concepcion , 200 miles south of here , three new paper plants costing more than 13 billion are opening in buenos aires , the park plaza hotel is overrun with investment bankers from new york , london , bonn and paris looking for deals in lima , adventurous business executives talk with the peruvian government about its plans to sell off staterun enterprises 'committed to free enterprise' we have a country committed to free enterprise , where there are established rules , a central bank you can deal with and zero bribery , said vincent a russo , general manager of santa fe forestal y industria , a 460 million pulp plant in nacimiento , chile , that is owned by shell oil , scott paper and citicorp there s not a lot more you can ask for driving this newfound optimism and economic activity are profound policy changes that run from the rio grande to tierra del fuego the new consensus says that inflation is bad , particularly for the poor , that governments do not know how to run businesses , that printing money is political suicide and that tax evasion , a timehonored sport here , should be punished severely also , in the face of democracy s growing popularity , marxism has all but disappeared all of latin america , except for cuba and haiti , have democratically elected governments in early 1979 , argentina , bolivia , brazil , chile , ecuador , paraguay , peru and uruguay were all run by military dictatorships military governments except in chile have been unable to run stable economies huge amounts of unpaid debt borrowed over the last decade or so underscore the insolvency of those governments and their inability to meet social needs now , the only alternative seems to be to generate jobs through internal growth there has been a psychological lift for several countries , including mexico and venezuela , from the bush administration s debt reduction plan especially in mexico , the negotiation of a successful debt plan lowered the level and cost of billions of dollars in foreign commercial bank loans and eased the economic burden on a new mexican administration with the added imprimatur of aid from the international monetary fund and world bank , a successful debt reduction agreement has made mexico and some other countries more attractive to foreign investors even though both argentina and brazil have yet to frame a debt reduction agreement , the mere prospect of one has been a spur to foreign investor interest country by country in argentina , president carlos saul menem has announced a vast deregulation of his country s economy , reversing decades of protection for industries in chile , a prospering freemarket economy generated by gen august pinochet , who stepped down from office 18 months ago , has been maintained by a coalition of his successors in bolivia , the poorest country on the continent , a general and his leftist opponent have teamed up to impose tight monetary discipline and promote growth and even in peru , long plagued by poverty , president alberto fujimori has instituted a severe package of economic restrictions that are unpopular but accepted as necessary in the last two months three respected organizations the international monetary fund , the international bank for development and the united nations have all issued cautious reports predicting a new era of vigorous , through sporadic , economic growth but none of these new policies have been able to wipe out poverty in 1980 , 40 percent of the latin american population was considered living in poverty by last year , that had risen to 44 percent in peru , where the minimum wage is 50 a month , 90 percent of the people are considered to be either unemployed or underemployed in chile , five million people , or a third of its population , is considered to live in poverty what astounds economists and analysts is that the tough economic medicine continues to be popularly supported even though it has resulted in large government layoffs , a precipitous drop in the buying power of the average citizen and less spending on public needs like housing , water and electricity in both mexico and argentina the incumbent political parties won large midterm elections because of economic stability brazil plans frustrated brazil is the only country still struggling to produce a plan to stop perennial inflation president fernando collor de mello has been frustrated by an opposition congress and has failed to persuade the public that with the dole and a relaxed life on the beach , brazil will remain in the past
warren e buffett , the vaunted omaha investor , did not get what he bargained for when his berkshire hathaway company bought a 700 million stake in salomon brothers four years ago now , as mr buffett scrambles to save the company , it is becoming clear that salomon did not get what it expected either the new salomon that mr buffett is creating is likely to be a very different one from the old one smaller , less haughty and less inclined to take risks that aversion to risk reflects mr buffett s style , and may also reflect the nature of his investment , which will remain a safe one unless things get far worse than they are now but before he can forge the new salomon , mr buffett , now chairman , must assure its survival by finding ways around the four areas that are producing nightmares for some salomon employees they are government action foremost would be that the government takes severe action against the firm it is already a given that salomon will pay huge civil penalties for violating the rules governing auctions of treasury securities but it hopes to retain its status as a primary dealer in treasuries and to avoid criminal charges against the firm either action could severely weaken it , even lead to its failure massive staff defections important salomon staff members who stick around through dec 31 will receive a share of a 100 million bonus pool put in place before the treasuries scandal arose , as well as normal annual bonuses but once january arrives and these financial handcuffs are off , there remains the possibility that large numbers of employees will walk to counter this , salomon plans to pay large bonuses to important staff members , despite the congressional hostility and unfavorable publicity that is likely to result and it will probably come up with an incentive plan putting more stock into the hands of some workers fleeing banks salomon does not now need new bank loans , in part because it has cut assets by 40 billion , back to the levels of last december but it needs to preserve existing lines of credit , and to arrange additional financing backed by securities if major banks agree to provide financing at reasonable terms , that would provide an important psychological lift but if there are doubts about salomon s longterm credit , some important areas of business could be closed off this might not lead to the firm s failure , but it would certainly constrain it and leave it at a competitive disadvantage massive customer defections when the salomon scandal first arose , fear that customer defections could sink the firm were rampant at this point , only a relative handful of customers have walked away , mostly governmentrelated entities but others have cut back their business , and salomon knows that it will lose much of the business it has if people believe its customer relationships have withered to the point it will be difficult for it to distribute securities so far , none of these dire events have occurred and if mr buffett , armed with his reputation for integrity and a new management team , can hold them at bay , salomon is likely to survive and could prosper though mr buffett and deryck c maughan , the new chief operating officer , have been preoccupied with salomon s problems and have had little opportunity to look forward , interviews with salomon executives last week painted a portrait of a vastly different solly time for 'tough questions' we will be more focused , said mr maughan that means competing where we are strong marginal businesses , he said , will be cut off he said he had not yet made much progress in identifying such businesses , but would do so before the end of the year because we have had a large capital base , he added , in the past we have not had to ask the tough questions creating such a firm has the potential for considerable internal conflict , which could also affect business and hasten defections mr buffett has no experience as a wall street manager , and his conservative financial style clashes with that of salomon berkshire hathaway , the company mr buffett has built , owns 700 million in preferred stock , which could be converted into a 14 percent stake in salomon at 38 per share at the moment , with salomon shares trading near 25 , conversion is a long way off it is conceivable that the nature of this stake will reinforce mr buffett s conservatism in an annual report to berkshire hathaway shareholders , he noted that the company would have done better if he had been willing to borrow more money but he posed the hypothetical question of what he would do if he thought there was a 99 percent chance of raising profits by taking on more debt , and a 1 percent chance of results falling somewhere between temporary anguish and default he answered this way we would n't have liked those 99 1 odds and never will a small chance of distress or disgrace cannot , in our view , be offset by a large chance of extra returns it is fair to say that virtually any trader at salomon would relish such odds
the failure of new york city s environmental protection department to approve contracts for 600 million in badly needed repair work deals the city a further blow mayor david dinkins has wisely called for closer supervision of the department , and the environmental commissioner , albert appleton , has belatedly made some management changes nonetheless , the 600 million gaffe raises serious questions about mr appleton s stewardship the unlet contracts were designed to upgrade water mains and sewers with mains bursting all around town , the repairs were critical the city authorized 134 billion for the last fiscal year the department spent only 711 million as calvin sims reported in the times , the delay hurts the repair work could have created jobs it would have benefited from depressed construction costs and it would have headed off expensive emergency repairs as excuses , mr appleton cites cuts in street crews , preoccupation with moving his office , a blizzard of new paperwork and a repair plan that was too ambitious none of that explains away a 600 million mistake more likely , the department is not getting adequate management mr appleton is a dedicated environmentalist who has taken the lead in purchasing watershed land upstate to insure a continuing source of good water for the city and is working hard to save the staten island wetlands but his department is primarily a construction and utility agency , responsible for maintaining new york city s aging water and sewer system managing such projects has not been mr appleton s strength he has n't dealt with the stench from harlem s north river sewage treatment plant he could be more aggressive in cleaning up hazardous waste sites and in responding to the water shortage if the commissioner does not shift his own focus toward management , mayor dinkins would do well to consider using mr appleton s energy elsewhere in his administration
to the editor your may 20 article on national tests of other countries calls the scholastic aptitude test , which is sponsored by the college board , the closest american version of a national test unfortunately , you err in saying that the sat differs from the national tests of other countries because it does not test what students have learned the sat does measure what students have learned it differs from other national tests in that it measures broad verbal and mathematical reasoning skills that students learn throughout their courses and outside of school as well college applicants can display their reasoning skills without regard to background , geography or particular courses the sat is thus faithful to the ideals of fairness , local control and pluralism that underpin our american education system moreover , the sat is designed not merely to assess past achievement but to predict future success as well in a nation committed to the principle that one s past need not predetermine one s future , this is a critical difference as we seek to learn from testing programs in other countries , we must not fall into the trap of trying to emulate them none of them aspire to the breadth of student access , the diversity of means or the multiple layers of opportunity that our american system of education affords we also must avoid the trap of believing that how many facts students can recall is more important than how well they can think in the long run , it is not only how much you know , but how you use it that determines ability and success before we rush to devise a new national body of tests , let us be sure we know what we want students to know and be able to do in the meantime , revisions to the sat announced last fall and effective in 1994 , are designed to make it even more responsive to this country s changing educational needs and a new generation of students it is a national standard that tells us much about student achievement without requiring us to don the straitjacket of a single curriculumdonald m stewart president , college board new york , may 22 , 1991
the united states says that the decision to postpone the moscow summit meeting had nothing to do with mikhail gorbachev s use of force to throttle the baltic nations do you believe that \? of course not everybody with an ounce of political sophistication knows it s a falsehood , and that congressional and public anger in the us about the baltic crackdown was at the heart of the bush administration s decision to postpone all right , try this one the secretary of state and the soviet foreign minister suddenly issue a joint statement it is immediately interpreted by capitals around the world as changing the conditions for saddam hussein to climb out of his trap in kuwait it seems to hint at new ceasefire possibilities based in part on saddam hussein s word and most certainly it creates the link between the persian gulf and the israelipalestinian struggle that washington had said it would not accept well , now the white house , reacting to the astonishment around the world , says there is nothing important in the statement , just an innocent announcement that somehow got misinterpreted by just about everybody everywhere do you believe that \? some do , most do n't and there you have the danger at a time when it is essential for the american public and the world to understand precisely what the us is doing politically in the gulf and why , the word of the us is becoming fuzzy , subject to different interpretations , and sometimes simply not believed that would be a grievous selfinflicted wound for any free country even in peacetime domestic and international belief in its political good faith is one of a democratic country s strengths and in time of war against dictatorship , which sacrifices trust by its very nature , clarity of intent and objective become the critical advantage for a free country lives can depend on it the white house , picking up the pieces strewn by secretary of state james baker , says there is nothing new in the statement , really but the white house just barely manages to swallow its anger at the way the sovietamerican communique was handled the statement was released about an hour before president bush delivered the state of the union message he was unaware of the communique , hanging on the press bulletin board at the state department it was quite different in tone from his staunch speech mr bush was blindsided but few people in washington or other capitals are buying the line that the communique was innocuous and unimportant none that i happen to know some editorial writers praise it as a new opening for saddam hussein to get out of the war while staying in power certainly moscow sees it that way and is boasting to the arab world about its great triumph in washington some administration officials even say that maybe the reason mr baker committed the statement was to give a present to his new soviet counterpart , foreign minister aleksandr a bessmertnykh other diplomats and journalists , including myself , see this move as quintessentially dangerous it created the impression that with victory in sight , but not yet in grasp , the united states was suddenly unsure of itself , of why the war was being fought and how to end it kind of an expensive present at best it was a baker foulup it was not as bad as the instructions to our embassy in iraq to tell saddam hussein we were not terribly interested in arab border disputes that encouraged him to move his own borders right across kuwait and even now , the us is not being candid about war objectives suppose saddam hussein eventually surrenders kuwait washington says that ends hostilities fine but what about war crimes against kuwait , israel and coalition prisoners \? and what about any war supplies he has on hand like those planes stashed away in iran \? do we leave iraq to use them again some day \? what troubles me most about the mysterious persian gulf communique is that the administration does not seem to understand what almost every child knows if you fail to tell the truth once , people wo n't believe you the next time so there is a connection between what washington says one day about canceling the moscow summit meeting , how it explains the baker stumble , if it was a stumble and not a leap , and what it does not say about what happens after the war it s fine for a diplomat to be clever it is dangerous when he is too clever by half
of all the candidates for the post of secretary general of the united nations , none wanted the job as much , or campaigned for it as openly and as ardently , as the veteran diplomat who was chosen yesterday , boutros ghali , deputy prime minister of egypt for foreign affairs mr ghali , the first from the arab world or from africa to head the organization , traveled throughout africa and to china , britain and the united states , calling in longstanding chips and upon old friends to win support for his bid unabashedly , he says he was born for this post the united nations , he says , can be critical in the new world order , a concept in which mr ghali steadfastly believes in his victory , mr ghali , whose full name is boutros boutros ghali , overcame complaints that he was too old and frail to serve the expected two fiveyear terms many diplomats argued that at age 69 , and after suffering an abscess on the liver that incapacitated him for several months two years ago , mr ghali lacked the stamina to reshape the united nations' bloated , weary bureaucracy but his indefagitable campaign , coupled with his ability to sketch an inspiring vision of a reorganized , reinvigorated peacekeeper able to meet the challenges of the 21st century , won over doubters , among them president bush , whose lastminute support guaranteed his election no opposition from israel despite unease with the prospect of an arab head of the united nations during thorny peace negotiations with arab countries , israel did not oppose mr ghali s election israeli officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said mr ghali s support for the camp david peace process led israel to conclude that he could be fairminded and smart enough not to intervene in the current peace talks in an adversarial way though president anwar elsadat of egypt was the prime mover of the camp david peace process , which culminated in 1979 in a peace treaty between israel and egypt , mr ghali played an important role in negotiating the accords after egypt s foreign minister resigned rather than accompany mr sadat on his trip to jerusalem in 1977 , mr ghali , then deputy foreign minister , went along instead and he was one of the few senior egyptian officials at mr sadat s side when the peace treaty was signed at the white house in 1979 he was always a strong supporter of the peace process , said william b quandt , a senior official in the carter white house who helped broker the accords he is as internationalminded as they come , a walking un in his own personal experience , and very fairminded diplomats also recall that mr ghali warned israel early on that failure to address the palestinians' grievances would damage the quality of the peace with egypt after israel s invasion of lebanon in 1982 and the breakdown of negotiations aimed at providing autonomy for palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza , it was mr ghali who coined the phrase cold peace to characterize the deteriorating relations between jerusalem and cairo while mr ghali is associated primarily with the camp david peace , he has helped mediate many a quarrel among african nations in 1990 , he was influential in helping win the release of nelson mandela , leader of the african national congress , from a south african jail while many african countries would have preferred a black african to head the united nations , mr ghali , representing egypt , a member of the organization of african unity , was on that group s list of candidates for the post warning on environment it was mr ghali s strong african ties that helped bring egypt back into the arab fold after it was ostracized for having made peace with israel mr ghali , a coptic christian who is married to a jew from alexandria , persistently lobbied for egypt s readmittance to the islamic conference organization , the 45member islamic group that had suspended egypt in 1984 , it became the first international organization that included virtually all of the arab countries to reinstate egypt s membership long before concern about ecology became fashionable , mr ghali warned that the water shortages facing africa and the middle east would pose as great a threat to the region s stability as any political dispute for more than a decade he has been responsible for negotiations among the nine countries that share the precious waters of the nile a tenured professor of international law , fulbright scholar at columbia university , and author of more than a hundred publications , mr ghali , who was born on nov 14 , 1922 , never seems to rest a committed diarist , he often rises at dawn to work on articles or another chapter of yet another book exquisitely tailored , he seems equally comfortable in the tent of an african tribal chieftain as in elysee palace an unabashed francophone , who still speaks english with a distinctly french accent , he is known for his wit in three languages best of all , say friends , he does not take himself too seriously boutros boutros ghali , or peter peter , as israeli negotiators used to call him based on the english translation of his name , has patiently tutored generations of visitors to cairo about the intricacies of middle eastern politics a descendant of one of egypt s most distinguished coptic families , he believes passionately in the centrality of egypt in the middle east support for the us after iraq invaded kuwait , he worked assiduously to build support for the americanled coalition that ousted iraqi forces but soon after the allied victory , he urged the formation of an allarab parliament , something of an anachronism in a region with virtually no democracies , and of an arab petrobank to transfer wealth from the arab nations rich in oil to the poor ones like his own asked whether he was frustrated by his neighbors' seeming disdain for both proposals , mr ghali just smiled and counseled patience if i lost hope each time i proposed something offbeat , he said , i would never have accomplished anything
in many ways , the latest statement on the persian gulf , which was issued by secretary of state james a baker 3d and foreign minister aleksandr a bessmertnykh of the soviet union without warning tuesday night , is much more revealing about current american soviet relations than it is about the middle east after three days of talks between mr baker and mr bessmertnykh , what appears to have taken place was some oldstyle superpower horsetrading , in which each side gave the other something , got something in return and denied publicly that anything new had happened at all since the persian gulf war began two weeks ago , the bush administration has been watching with anxiety the ceasefire proposals various third world countries and nations espousing nonalignment have been introducing at the united nations the state department had been concerned that the soviet union with eduard a shevardnadze no longer foreign minister , and with the soviet military , which still seems friendly toward the iraqis , on the ascendancy might get behind one of those stopthefighting proposals , thereby fracturing the antiiraq coalition signal on baltics seen those fears were heightened on saturday when mr bessmertnykh , before leaving for his talks in washington , spoke about moscow s concern that the united states was trying to destroy iraq it also seemed to be a subtle signal by mr bessmertnykh that if the white house was going to give the kremlin trouble on the baltics , the kremlin would make life difficult for washington in the gulf there was therefore a strong desire in the state department to get mr bessmertnykh s agreement to something that would keep the soviets in line with washington on the next major diplomatic issue in the gulf under what conditions should the americanled coalition cease firing if iraq promises to leave kuwait \? the joint statement did that , state department officials say , by committing the soviets to support a ceasefire proposal only if it was formally linked to a total iraqi withdrawal from kuwait the state department spokeswoman , margaret d tutwiler , said the point was , since the foreign minister arrived here on saturday , he had made some statements in moscow that he himself said had been misinterpreted basically the ministers decided that this was an opportunity to put these rumors to rest , to put to rest any concerns that somehow the soviets were retreating from their positions on the gulf crisis the statement says that a cessation of hostilities would be possible only if the iraqis make an unequivocal commitment to withdraw from kuwait backed by immediate concrete steps leading to a full withdrawal in other words , there can be no long pause in the war to give iraq a chance to reconsider , and possibly regroup its forces raising israel s hackles some administration officials believe , though , that mr baker , in his eagerness to keep the soviets on board with washington s overall gulf war policy , accepted certain other language in the statement demanded by mr bessmertnykh meant to mollify the soviet union s own muslim population and its arab allies that has raised the hackles of israel and raised questions about the administration s real diplomatic plans for the middle east in particular , the officials point to the references in the statement that hint at linkage between a settlement of the gulf war and renewed diplomacy to resolve the arabisrael dispute , which have upset israel s prime minister , yitzhak shamir while none of this language is a departure from previous american statements on this subject , putting it into a sovietamerican communique about ending the gulf war has certainly left the impression that washington was tacitly offering iraq a link between its withdrawal from kuwait and a settlement of the israelipalestinian conflict , even though administration officials deny this the soviets certainly behaved as though they got more than they gave while many administration officials spent the day distancing themselves from the joint statement , the soviet press agency tass said it was a matter of particular gratification for moscow tass said the statement marked yet another switch in the american stand on the arabisrael dispute in addition , at least some administration officials believe that the united states should be limiting its objectives in the gulf to reversing the iraqi invasion period expectations may be too high with the president and the secretary of state constantly speaking about a new order in the middle east , and joining with the soviets in commitments for peacemaking in all middle east conflicts , they may be raising expectations that cannot and will not be met given the way in which many palestinians have applauded iraq s scud missile attacks on israel , the idea that there will be great peace opportunities after this war strikes many analysts as fanciful neverthless , the joint statement said , both ministers agreed that in the aftermath of the crisis in the persian gulf , mutual ussoviet efforts to promote arabisraeli peace and regional stability , in consultation with other parties in the region , will be greatly facilitated and enhanced the tradeoffs between washington and moscow do not appear to have been confined to the gulf while administration officials insist there was no deal , it was striking the degree to which mr baker , and president bush in his state of the union address , muted their criticism of soviet policy in the baltics after their talks with mr bessmertnykh , and how the soviet minister suddenly stopped complaining that the americans were destroying iraq the soviets certainly made it easier for the administration to do so by assuring mr bush that they were withdrawing some of their forces from the baltics and reopening a dialogue with the independenceminded leaders of those republics but that is what the soviets told washington before they cracked down there two weeks ago
sherwinwilliams inc , the big paint company , recently let executives from sears , roebuck inc help select the people who would service the sears account we and sears already had joint sales and productturnover goals , so it made sense to jointly select the people who can make those goals happen , said t scott king , a vice president of sales for sherwinwilliams the digital equipment corporation often helps its smaller customers put together corporate image programs in their communities they are buying our product , so anything we do to help them be successful makes sense , said joseph d codispoti , digital s media relations manager the xerox corporation and the general electric company , which buy from each other all the time , now send people to each other s inhouse training sessions , too to really focus on customers' needs , you must understand more about them than how they use your product , said wayland r hicks , xerox s executive vice president for marketing and customer operations throughout the 1980 s , customer partnerships were defined solely in terms of products but by working together on technologies and processes , many suppliers and customers came to trust each other enough to share schematics for products , sales forecasts and other information once considered proprietary and many discovered that discrepancies in the ways they handled invoicing and deliveries far more than product constraints prevented them from doing even more joint business , such as dealing with each other overseas as a result , companies are now broadening their definitions of customer partnerships to include office procedures , training , even hiring if you assume the goal of staffing , training or any other internal process is to better respond to customer needs , then it makes sense to help the customer participate in those processes , said david ulrich , professor of executive education at the university of michigan s school of business , who has written extensively on the subject that may be so , but corporate executives have been slow to act on the concept only lately have we shifted our emphasis from transactions to relationships , said james p baughman , ge s manager of corporate management development that means feeling that we and the customer are part of one system , not two ge is striving hard to reach that utopia over the last six months , several ge divisions have invited customer teams to join sessions of workout , a training program that ge developed to decrease internal red tape those sessions enabled one ge division to shave more than a week off delivery times by letting major customers enter their own orders into ge s data system another division eliminated about six monthly reports to a customer when , in workout sessions , the customer admitted to throwing them away yet another is now working with customers to find the point at which their need for quick access to spare parts intersects with ge s need to reduce inventory costs xerox , too , has been using a team approach albeit a less formal one to smooth its interactions with major customers for example , its executives have been meeting with executives from the bechtel corporation with an eye toward better understanding bechtel s ordering and accounting systems one result xerox has stopped sending bechtel paper invoices for each order , conforming to bechtel s preferred method of being billed electronically , once a month sometimes , going after small irritants in systems is as important to meeting a customer s needs as major design changes in products , said mr hicks of course , no supplier gives customers a guarantee that every small irritant will be abolished but customers report that being asked for their input has value in itself r gene richter , executive director of corporate procurement for the hewlettpackard company , says his suppliers often ask him to recommend people whom they might hire to manage the hewlettpackard account none has let him participate in the hiring decision and only about 25 percent of the people he recommended got hired but the suppliers invariably explain why talks with the other threequarters did not work out i realize my advice is taken seriously , mr richter said and that alone makes me feel warmer to the person they do hire building partnerships , step by step collaborations between customers and suppliers are not always directly tied to business systems sometimes , they just involve sharing expertise xerox , which won the malcolm baldrige corporate quality award in 1989 , has sent its people to help several customers install quality assurance processes the question of xerox products rarely comes up a corporate president who invites you to talk to his management team will continue to think of you as a partner , not just another vendor , explained wayland r hicks , xerox s executive vice president for marketing and customer operations and not only that our customers might provide us with a way to reach their customers similarly , frank m j lafasto , the baxter healthcare corporation s vice president of human resource planning and development ,

queensbury , ny , march 22 as an allegory for these patriotic times , none may be better than the scene today in a warren county courtroom where a young prosecutor won back the right to wear an american flag pin on his lapel in a case that has become the talk of this adirondack town , a supreme court justice reversed a lower court s decision by ruling that william e montgomery 3d , the county s district attorney , could keep the tiny metal pin on his jacket while addressing a jury a local defense lawyer , kurt mausert , had argued that the pin could unfairly influence jurors because of the nationalistic fervor sweeping warren county and the rest of the country after the persian gulf war based on the letters in the local paper , the comments on radio callin shows , and the talk at pat s diner \( the selfdescribed home of the 99cent breakfast \) , most residents seem to feel that mr mausert s contention lies somewhere between the seditious and the absurd distributing flag pins i think the whole thing is ridiculous , said kit m graves of warrensburg , who was pouring coffee at the diner he s from the united states so why should n't he be able to wear a flag pin if he wants to \? joseph p fiore of glens falls , a world war ii marine who joined other veterans in distributing flag pins outside the county courthouse today , was more indignant than bemused anyone should be able to wear this flag , he said you should be able to wear it to school , to your church or synagogue , to your fraternal organization you can wear it into heaven or hell , too justice john g dier of state supreme court made it clear today that he agreed , and his unabashedly flamboyant ruling won a raucous ovation from a crowd of flagpinned spectators not only did justice dier rule that mr montgomery could wear his pin , he also recommended a judicial review of the lower court judge and ordered that mr mausert be banished from the ranks of lawyers allowed to defend indigent clients in warren county mr mausert , who said at least half his practice consists of defending poor peo ple , said he would appeal the decision justice dier suggested in his ruling that he felt obligated to block the path to a slippery slope if the courts of this state ever deny anyone the right to wear the american flag , what would be next \? he asked , reading a prepared text the masonic pin \? the rotary pin \? the crucifix \? the star of david \? that mr mausert , who says he is as patriotic as the next guy , even thought to raise the issue speaks volumes about the national mood and how high it has swung since the days of the country s last major war it is an evolution that did not go unnoticed in the courtroom the courts have recognized that the american flag can and indeed has evoked not only emotion but physical activity , said peter a firth , the lawyer for michael j muller , the queensbury town justice who ruled on march 6 that mr montgomery could not wear his pin you only have to look back about 20 years to the vietnam era there were demonstrations by american citizens that included burning and mutilation now a short 20 years later , in light of the military successes that this country experienced in the persian gulf , there are many who are inspired by it the point is that at times of strong national feeling the flag has been known to evoke strong emotions this just happens to be one of those times that was mr mausert s feeling on feb 22 , the day before the land war began , when he noticed that one of mr montgomery s assistant prosecutors was wearing a flag pin in justice muller s court the judge granted mr mausert s request that the prosecutor be ordered to remove the pin before a jury trial began , and the prosecutor took the pin off to avoid being held in contempt 'the wrong message' my reasons were not antiflag , said mr mausert , who is 33 years old my motion was made at the height of the persian gulf war and the flag was everywhere , on restaurants , on laundromats and that s wonderful but if it s on the chest of the district attorney it could send the wrong message to the jury on march 6 , the 35yearold mr montgomery came into justice muller s court to try a defendant accused of illegally connecting his cable television he was wearing a tiny flag pin that was given to him in 1990 by representative gerald b solomon , a fellow republican mr mausert repeated his motion during a hearing in justice muller s chambers , mr mausert and mr montgomery made it clear that they shared little mutual respect mr mausert called mr montgomery a threat to the integrity and wellrunning of the justice system , according to a transcript mr montgomery suggested that mr mausert might share a dislike of the flag with saddam hussein mr mausert called mr montgomery a scoundrel and said the remark was scurrilous justice muller again ordered that the flag pin be removed mr montgomery announced that he would not do so and took his case to the supreme court in the interim , mr montgomery did not discourage speculation that justice muller s ruling was related to the judge s active support for mr montgomery s opponent in the 1990 election for district attorney mr montgomery well remembers the hostility shown toward the flag during the vietnam war , when john prine sang your flag decal wo n't get you into heaven anymore , they 're already overcrowded from your dirty little war twenty years later , justice dier also seemed to have captured the national mood today with his ruling i find it very difficult to understand that anyone who is a citizen of this country could object to another citizen of this country wearing an american flag pin , the judge said and especially today with the situation as it exists in the middle east photos william e montgomery 3d , the warren county , ny , district attorney , second from right , won back the right yesterday to wear an american flag pin in his lapel he was greeted by supporters at the municipal center in glens falls \( david jennings for the new york times \) \( pg 25 \) kurt mausert , a defense lawyer in warren county , ny , had argued that an american flag pin worn by a prosecutor could unfairly influence jurors \( david jennings for the new york times \) \( pg 26 \)
baghdad , iraq , jan 2 the united states embassy here is showing keen sensitivity to the physicial security of american diplomats as the deadline approaches for what could be a military showdown between iraq and the united states in the persian gulf on monday , the senior american diplomat here , joseph c wilson 4th , protested to the iraqi foreign ministry over a sitin by iraqi women s organizations the same day , in which 25 to 30 women crossed a barrier in front of the compound and blocked pedestrian and automobile access to embassy buildings after a brief standoff , the women left , but iraqi military guards charged with protecting the embassy premises refused to take action against the protesters because they were women the women were protesting the seizure by american and allied naval forces of a socalled peace ship that last week tried to run the international blockade of iraq s ports with a cargo of wheat , sugar and other foodstuffs dozens of peaceful protests the iraqi authorities have organized dozens of peaceful protests outside the united states compound over the last four months , but none has been judged as a serious threat to the embassy or its personnel , a senior official said as diplomats took precautionary measures , dipomatic efforts to break the impasse in the crisis remained blocked , according to a senior iraqi official the official said iraqi and american authorities had no dialogue under way to resolve the dispute over the dates for highlevel discussions in washington and baghdad before the jan 15 deadline set by the united nations security council for iraq to withdraw from kuwait or face the use of force a senior western envoy said the last sessions between mr wilson and top iraqi foreign ministry officials on the date question took place on dec 17 and 18 mr wilson has received no new instructions to broach the date dispute or negotiate a compromise , a western official said personal assurances received as the united nations deadline neared , a united states official here said that the decision to keep mr wilson and four members of his staff who carry diplomatic status was being reviewed daily by the state department mr wilson at the outset of the crisis over iraq s aug 2 invasion of kuwait sought and received personal assurances from president saddam hussein of iraq that united states diplomatic personnel in iraq and the united states embassy would remain secure but iraq s decision in august to seize american and other foreign hostages and lay seige to the united states embassy in kuwait has heightened security concerns in baghdad mr wilson still moves freely in baghdad , with none of the heavily armed escorts required for united states envoys in such places as egypt and lebanon the united states marine guards have been evacuated from baghdad and their weapons destroyed material is shredded the embassy has laid in a large food supply , 150 cases of bottled water and 200 cases of beer to be prepared for any crisis that cut off food and water supplies an embassy employee this morning was observed shredding a large volume of diplomatic material , though most of the embassy files were shredded in august many of the nearly 70 foreign missions are awaiting a decision by the bush administration on whether it will evacuate the united states embassy as the threat of military conflict nears the united states official said that in recent days , several foreign embassies in baghdad have decided to reduce their staffs and that at least one country s , which he did not identify , remains open but unstaffed right now britain announced on tuesday that it had reduced its embassy staff from 18 to 6 monday s sitin protest was characterized as unofficial , and prompted a telephone call from mr wilson to the chief of protocal at iraq s foreign ministry mr wilson reminded the iraqis of their responsibility to guarantee the integrity of diplomatic premises they do recognize their responsibility , the united states official said
havana aug 6 in the distance , mt steinbrenner could be heard rumbling that cuba was leading the united states in total medals , 39 to 28 , at the pan american games going into today s competition a vice president of the united states olympic committee , george m steinbrenner 3d has been complaining about the caliber of athletes the united states has sent to this meet , and promising to do something about it , and soon it kind of makes me feel like chopped liver , said lacy barnes , an american discus thrower but most of the athletes look at how they do as individuals they try not to pay attention to all the talk other american athletes , particularly the boxers , have had to sit at similar news conferences and listen to questions about why the united states sent a secondstring contingent few surprises cuba is dominating track and field with eight gold medals to three for brazil and one for the united states i'm very familiar with the cuban system , said joe vigil , the head american track coach here the cubans are wellcoached and wellprepared we 're not surprised at their high level of performance this is their show the cubans , who did not attend the 1984 summer games in los angeles or the 1988 games in seoul , south korea , have been improving all the time in a nation where the words el deporte es un derecho del pueblo \( sport is the right of the people \) can be seen on billboards and stadium walls needless to say , none of the cubans are skipping the pan american games one reason most american stars are not here is money , said earl bell , the veteran polevaulter a guy in my range , it could cost him between 5 , 000 and 20 , 000 , bell said , referring to the appearance and prize fees being paid to athletes in the european meets this summer looking to tokyo another reason for the limited showing in track and field is that the world championships are being held in tokyo later this month that meet , which started in 1983 and is held the year before the summer games , permanently altered the face of the pan american games the pan american games are a development program for us , said jose rodriguez , the cubanborn manager of the american team your upandcoming athletes use this as a steppingstone we brought a team that wants to compete the united states has brought seven winners from the national meet , which was held in new york in june all will go on to tokyo along with the dozens of united states champions who chose not to come here steinbrenner , who is expected to return to cuba by the weekend , has been talking about spending more money to bring better athletes , a philosophy that worked for him in his early years as owner of the yankees tony dees , a hurdler from the florida track club sponsored by steinbrenner , is saving his efforts for the world championship , and the sponsor is not amused andre cason , another member of the club , is going to tokyo with the relay team but he chose to come here , finishing second in the 100 meters , because i want to uplift american sports , not because of steinbrenner s influence bell said he was eager to compete here because i was born in panama and i have many friends and relatives there , and i 've always wanted to visit cuba barnes , a personable 26yearold from fresno , calif , said she had a curiosity about cuba but that her main reason for coming here was because i'm just on the verge of breaking through as a worldclass athlete , and she needs all the competition she can get this is the opposite reaction from many who stayed away , fearing an injury or interruption in training before they could get to the world championships 'honest mistake' those who come have to deal with finishing second , and the hard questions , and the pride of the cuban people some americans were upset monday night over a few perceived slights llewellyn starks , an american long jumper , persuaded judges to reverse a foul call , but zealous officials had already raked up an impressive leap he made into the sand pit he was given another leap , but finished second and said , i do n't want the silver because i deserve the gold today , vigil termed the mixup an honest mistake cason said he never could recover from an unusually late falsestart call against another runner in the 100 meters , after he was 20 meters down the track he finished second after the restart finally , some people thought president fidel castro had deliberately avoided handing a silver medal to chryste gaines at the women s 100meter sprint ceremonies , but american officials said today that the president had assumed he would only present a gold medal they noted that mr castro later shook hands with gaines while she was holding an american flag the president has been gracious about congratulating other american athletes , and he has saluted while the american flag was being presented of course , he has had more opportunities to observe his own flag being raised he has probably noticed this certainly , george steinbrenner has photo liliana allen of cuba , right , edging chryste gaines of the us at the tape to win the 100meter final the cubans have dominated the track events \( associated press \)

walpack township backpackers hiking along the appalachian trail where it crosses the kittatinny mountains here may one day be able to spend the night in a rustic bed and breakfast or enjoy a snack at a lakeside concession stand , if plans being considered by state and federal officials come to fruition the backpackers' hosts , however , will not be the usual assortment of park rangers and college students working during summer vacations instead , the beds will be made and the hamburgers fried by 40 innercity boys from 15 to 18 years old who are serving 90day sentences for nonviolent crimes the plan , inspired by gov jim florio s call for juvenile boot camps , envisions using the time , energy and talents of the youths serving sentences to convert an abandoned boy scout camp in the delaware water gap national recreation area into a service area for tired , hungry hikers when construction is complete , the boys will be taught to prepare meals for guests and to maintain the grounds and buildings that line the western shore of long pine pond while officials of the state department of corrections and the national park service believe that the plan will benefit both the park and the boys to be sent there , some residents of the area are not so optimistic i believe that recreation areas should be for recreation , not for prison camps , said paul klimek , deputy mayor of stillwater township , a rural community that borders walpack township , the camp s actual site concern about escapes mr klimek s concern is that youths housed there may escape and endanger the safety of local residents the department of corrections , he said , has not developed any satisfactory plan for keeping the youths inside the unfenced camp in my personal opinion , i do n't think they can supply adequate security at night , mr klimek said anybody can sneak out of that camp if they want to , and the fastest place they can get to is stillwater though officials in walpack township say that residents there have not expressed any objections to the camp , residents of nearby sandyston township have voiced concerns similar to mr klimek s tom hoffman , who lives in sandyston , said he had collected more than 200 signatures on petitions demanding that officials scrap the proposal some of the townships here in sussex county have already been exposed to serious problems caused by the department of corrections , mr hoffman said , referring to incidents that occurred at two other juvenile camps in sussex county in october 1989 , he said , two 16yearold boys who escaped from a day camp in stillwater township were later captured in warwick , ny , driving a stolen car and carrying several weapons in another incident , a month later in sandyston township , a 13yearold boy was charged with setting a fire at a ymwca camp for troubled youths mr hoffman said that when such incidents occurred , residents were not adequately notified so that they could bring their kids in out of the yard and put the car in the garage supervision is questioned the only way you know something has happened is when you hear police sirens or fire trucks or see helicopters flying overhead , he said we 've concluded that the department of corrections lacks the supervisory ability that is essential if the young people in its custody are to benefit and the nearby neighborhoods are not to be terrorized but corrections officials say security at the proposed camp should not be a problem we have experience in doing this in the past , said thomas f lynch , assistant commissioner of the department s division of juvenile services we have almost 50 programs statewide , 22 of them are residential in nature , and they 're all run very well the sandyston ymwca camp , he said , was not under the direct supervision of the department of corrections youths housed at the walpack site , he said , would be put to work renovating abandoned buildings there and would then be taught to run the food and lodging concessions that officials envision they 'll be so tired by the end of the day there s not much chance they 'll want to do anything but sleep , mr lynch said he said the camp would mainly be used to house youths from newark , paterson and camden who have committed nonviolent crimes the youths would be supervised by a total of 25 security guards , at least three of whom would be on duty during the night after the youths complete their 90day stay at the camp and are returned to their homes , they will be followed up by counselors who will encourage them to continue working together in support groups and cadet corps in their communities 'we 've been wildly successful' we 've already done this with other kids , and we 've been wildly successful , mr lynch said and none of our programs have fences around them we keep the kids in by providing good programs the potential for escape is minimal , he said , since the youths would probably fear getting lost if they left the camp we 're talking about urban kids who are scared to death of being alone in the woods , mr lynch said residents of the area disagree that does n't make sense , said jean maggio of sandyston township they 're on top of the mountain all they have to do is go downhill , and eventually they 'll hit civilization but richard ring , superintendent of the 70 , 000acre recreation area , said he was satisfied that the department of corrections could maintain adequate camp security clearly everybody i talked to understands that this has some risks associated with it , he said but the national park service does n't enter into this kind of agreement unless we have a specific commitment that the program is going to be run properly in the event the department of corrections does not live up to its commitment to provide adequate security , mr ring said , the agreement will be immediately terminated he said he was convinced , however , that the program would be successful and that it would benefit both the park service and , more importantly , the boys who would participate by putting them in a highly disciplined program like this , he said , the youths can be returned to their communities in a much better frame of mind than when they left 'maybe it will teach them' but jack robertson , a sandyston police officer , said he doubted that the program would have any lasting benefit maybe it will teach them something , he said but teaching them how to build a campfire is n't going to help them get a job in newark officer robertson said the youths would be better served by having them rehabilitate the neighborhoods they live in rather than a camp they would most likely never see again this is a cheap way out for the department of corrections , he said but i do n't see how it will have any longterm impact on the juvenile the minute they get back to the city and hit the streets , they 'll laugh about it it 'll be a big joke photos an abandoned boy scout camp in walpack township would be converted to a camp for hikers where youths serving time for nonviolent crimes would work tom hoffman , a resident of the area , is leading a fight against the plan \(

the misleading idea that martha graham was a socalled literary choreographer gained currency when she turned to literature and myth , deconstructing the brontes and the greeks alike yet the point was in the retelling , and graham did not so much retell as barely tell a story at all gut emotions were her prime interest , and the proof was expressed in dazzling relief again this weekend in her treatment of the classic greek drama of jocasta and oedipus in her 1947 dance masterpiece , night journey the essence of graham was even more visible in steps in the street , revived a few years ago and still a hit in this splendid season by the martha graham dance company , which ends on sunday at the city center \( 131 west 55th street \) steps in the street was part of a 1936 depressionera suite , chronicle here is early graham at her most abstract , creating an aura of loneliness and desperation through formal patterns and movement alone for the truth is that no matter how literary the pretexts of her works in her middle period , she achieves her impact through movement , through the shape and dynamic of her choreographic invention steps in the street never fails to bring the house down , and it is powerfully danced by the women in the company laura jimenez was the protagonist on saturday afternoon , while denise vale , who is new in the role , appeared on sunday night the heroine is at first an anonymous figure within an ensemble of women in black who enter backward , bodies contracted , heads twisted the extraordinary figures of instant tension who fill two other early graham pieces that should not be missed this season , the 1931 primitive mysteries and the 1934 celebration graham suggests alienation \( the subtitle is devastation , homelessness , exile \) through structure and pattern that isolate the heroine with the group the dancing , to a score by wallingford riegger , grows insistent and exuberantly filled with repetitive staglike leaps , ending in the inexorable parade that passes the soloist by so rightly is the form here expressive of the emotion that there would seem no room for interpretation yet miss jimenez telegraphed poignant vulnerability with no loss of forcefulness , while miss vale , with her sculptured , weighted approach , was all wonderful rage saturday s matinee included two works from the graham greek cycle a change of cast and debuts lent needed coherence to the 1963 circe with its siren song of a textured score by alan hovhaness christine dakin s luminous purity made her a fetching circe , seducing donlin foreman s ulysses through appeal to his instincts these are represented by a nasty bestiary youngha yoo , all pounce and grit , was a magnificent lion , kenneth topping conveyed a shakespearean lust in his goat imagery , duane cyrus s snake was electric as well as serpentine , while tancredo tavares s deer was on the right path nothing can improve upon terese capucilli s jocasta , who learns she has married her own son , oedipus , despite the frenzied efforts of a chorus to prevent the inevitable this performance on saturday of night journey , with its ever dramatic music by william shuman , was fresh miss capucilli danced with a new serenity that diminished none of her character s anguish or angular thrust , but mr topping offered a surprise his oedipus looked young and innocent , a victim of fate in his deadpan but articulate wooing of jocasta lyndon branaugh continues to do good work his blind seer , tiresias , clearly set the action in motion but nothing in this work can match the ferocity of the leaping , stamping chorus , led by miss vale , that seems to nail itself into the ground these superb daughters of the night were camille brown , kathy buccellato , theresa maldonado , miki orihara , daniela stasi and myra woodruff debuts in appalachian spring brought in joyce herring and floyd flynn , who caught the spirit of a frontier couple in love mr flynn , however , is still nervous and loses his form , and miss herring is surprisingly balletic in the first solo mr topping , clearly on a roll , got nicely worked up in the preacher s fire and brimstone sermon , countered by miss vale as the pioneering woman photo terese capucilli in martha graham s night journey \( martha swope m graham co \)
any activity that elicits fervent acclaim from political leaders , far and near , merits the microscopic scrutiny of humankind i am thinking here of the swelling enthusiasm for direct talks between washington and baghdad i , too , advocate talks to convey thinking , particularly with enemies who are , or may soon be , shooting at us but much of what has been passing for diplomacy to arrange direct talks is a scam , and wednesday s meeting between secretary of state baker and foreign minister aziz is unlikely to elevate matters the irony is that saddam hussein , who has been digging in his heels , actually wants the talks and prays they succeed for a deal is the best way for him to keep some of his illgotten goodies from kuwait , distract eyes from his withdrawal and escape a catastrophic war and the further irony is that president bush , who has been offering talks , undoubtedly shudders at their prospect negotiations mean compromise , and compromise in this case rewards aggression what he wants are talks that demonstrate iraqi obstinacy in order to placate congress and derail allies from pursuing separate peace tracks or better still , that produce outright iraqi capitulation as senator dole put it the other day , mr bush has to pursue every avenue for peace , before the firing starts in diplomacy , especially in crises , things are rarely what they seem a diplomatic code book is indispensable for example , flexibility usually means almost no flexibility thus when ambassador mashat of iraq said baghdad was flexible on a date other than jan 12 for mr baker to visit saddam hussein , he meant that no other date was possible , but that other arrangements might be similarly , endorsing allied negotiations with an adversary generally means opposing those negotiations thus when the state department blessed the european community s wish to talk with baghdad , it warned that the initiative should adhere to a uniform and consistent message translation go only if you 'll demand complete iraqi withdrawal from kuwait by jan 15 the code book contains no translation , however , for a certain primitive pronouncement attributed to mr bush , namely , if we get into an armed situation , he s saddam hussein s going to get his ass kicked the code book s only mention of an anatomical region refers to cheek kissing there will be none of that in the bakeraziz talks and just in case saddam hussein is hoping otherwise , george bush said the encounter would involve no negotiations , no compromises , no attempts at facesaving and no rewards for aggression but in the very next sentence , crafted for those who might see the previous sentence as a touch too negative , he added that the talks are simply and importantly an opportunity to resolve this crisis peacefully for all the public antics , and even in the absence of a direct dialogue , the fact is washington and baghdad have been negotiating for some time , in plain sight they have both been playing with a settlement modeled on the 1962 cuban missile crisis , in which president kennedy pledged not to attack cuba if moscow removed its missiles from that island moscow demanded a facesaving symmetry the removal of us missiles from turkey in a side agreement kept secret for many years so as not to appear to reward moscow , the us promised to withdraw those missiles at a later date now , washington offers a noattack pledge if iraq leaves kuwait unconditionally to which mr bush adds that afterward there may be opportunities to solve kuwaitiiraqi border disputes and settle the conflicts that divide the arabs from israel saddam hussein insists on nailing down these postwithdrawal possibilities in advance as the soviets did in 1962 , but mr bush forswears any future linkage with such reassurances , we can now look forward to diplomatic smog of the highest density from this day to that moment when either war begins or iraq announces its departure from kuwait , all will use the diplomatic code words liberally to make and hide compromises , bargain away others' valuables and generally posture we will hardly know what is going on , and whom to trust president bush , however , can count on one thing if he buys iraqi withdrawal for more than a noattack oath and general promises about seeking to resolve other regional problems , he will betray his own principles and lose the trust of most americans and world leaders however resounding the momentary applause
washington , june 26 the presidential campaign looms ever closer over the horizon racial politics are in the air a dominant democratic candidate has yet to emerge all this leads to one thing the rev jesse jackson is back or at least he wants to be after two years of aimless wandering in a political sinai , mr jackson is moving to capitalize on recent events , sowing hope among his loyal followers and agita among some democratic moderates the moderates had been hoping mr jackson would continue on the arc of diminishing visibility that he has followed since declining to run for mayor of washington , dc , and settling for the obscurity of the makework position of shadow senator for the district of columbia instead , mr jackson is raising the possibility of another run for the democratic presidential nomination , all the while declining to say that that is his plan i have to look at all the political options for 1992 because i am the frontrunner , he said in a few days of frenetic activity this month , mr jackson put his political and personal strengths on display , as well as his weaknesses he pointed out that the agency managing the savings and loan bailout was failing to award some contracts to blackowned businessess , as required by federal regulations he directed a disappointed bidder with internal documents detailing the practice to the new york times in an effort to publicize what he considered an injustice he criticized president bush for his opposition to the civil rights bill , spelling out his differences with republicans in ways few democrats of weight have so far undertaken and with an oratorical passion few others can match race is a decoy that sets america against america , mr jackson said in a recent speech castigating republicans for what he said was using the quota issue for political gain it is a way for a politician to win , and the people to lose it is morally wrong to polarize the country this way moreover , it is economically destructive racebaiting is a smokescreen that hides how vulnerable americans really are at the same time , mr jackson showed he is not above indulging his own ego and political jealousies sitting in his office , ticking off the bevy of democratic heavyhitters that would attend the fiveday convention of the rainbow coalition , the political group he founded and heads , he sounded more like a youngster comparing his baseball card collection to that of his rival in mr jackson s case the rival is the democratic leadership council , a moderate group that declined to invite mr jackson to address its meeting last month we 've got tsongas coming , harkin coming , gephardt coming , simon coming , gore coming , graves coming , rockefeller coming , cardenas of mexico coming , mr jackson said the references were to senators tom harkin of iowa , paul simon of illinois , al gore of tennessee and john d rockefeller 4th of west virginia , all democrats former senator paul tsongas of massachusetts , a democrat representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the house majority leader earl graves , president of black enterprise magazine , and cuauhtemoc cardenas , a former mexican presidential candidate for the leftwing democratic revolutionary party a prominent noninvitation mr jackson said that his conference , held this month , was far more substantive , far more diverse , than the democratic leadership council meeting one possible democratic candidate not invited was gov bill clinton of arkansas , the chairman of the leadership council he is not a candidate , mr jackson said when asked why mr clinton was not asked to attend it s nothing personal i have appreciation for his work inquiries about mr jackson s own plans for 1992 bring forth coy demurrals , but his actions speak louder than his demurrers when newspapers fail to record mr jackson s own view of himself as the frontrunner , he is quick to provide polls showing that he is at or near the top of democratic candidates in terms of name recognition and initial support for example , he has referred repeatedly recently to a nationwide poll of 355 democrats , conducted in april for time magazine and cable news network , in which jackson scored higher than any other democrat mentioned as a potential presidential nominee whatever renewed attention mr jackson may be getting must be enormously satisfying to a man who just a few months ago seemed dangerously close to what all politicians fear most irrelevancy wilder s tribulations help not a few democrats have been saying that mr jackson s role as chief spokesman for blacks within the party was being eclipsed by gov l douglas wilder of virginia even the contract mr jackson signed with time warner inc to host a syndicated television talk show was canceled yet if the gods seemed to have been frowning on mr jackson in the recent past , they have in recent days changed their expression the recent tribulations of mr wilder , who has been engaged in a nasty feud with senator charles s robb , a fellow virginian , could eliminate him as a rival to mr jackson for the position of most influential black politician in the democratic party even the snubbing by the democratic leadership council and the white house opposition to the civil rights bill may help catapault mr jackson back into the news
uniondale , li , dec 10 ray ferraro got a hat trick for the islanders the blues' brett hull unveiled one , too and steve thomas bounced the islanders' seventh goal , a restorative gametying goal off the goalie s catching mitt with just 17 seconds left in regulation , enabling the islanders to skate off with a 77 tie tonight against the st louis blues until thomas s goal , a blooping slap shot from nelson emerson that clanged just inside the crossbar at 17 minutes 1 second of the final period , the islanders were caught in a game filled with scoring bravado and defensive lapses all that goaltenders glenn healy and chris joseph could do tonight at nassau coliseum was try to survive an evening of sneak attacks and impudent comebacks their dignity was surely dented by the time the clock finally ran down on this show of hockey at its most erratic islanders start quickly the islanders had received an earful from their coach , al arbour , on the evils of making a slow start and building themselves a deficit instead of a lead , a trait they had exhibited in their previous two games so tonight they started fast and , even after st louis displayed a willingness to play catchup , they tried to stay that way the problem was , their dervish offense was contagious , and the blues not only caught it , but caught up again and again until , down by 76 and desperate to force overtime , it was the islanders' turn to imitate the blues in a hurry ferraro got himself on the fastest track of all and erased a 22 stalemate with his natural hat trick in the second period , but the blues , although it took them until midway through the final period to do it , resurfaced again you do n't get a feeling like that very often , unfortunately , said ferraro , whose only other natural hat trick came three years ago against the devils but ferraro was less than charitable about his team s defensive play that s 17 goals we 've given up in the last three game , he said for our team to be effective , we 've got to be a lot tighter defensively it was the culmination of brett hull s 13thcareer hat trick , one that did n't unfold naturally like ferraro s but one that proved to be more timely , that gave st louis a 66 tie at 8 04 of the third period it took pierre turgeon just 44 seconds to close in on underprotected goalie chris joseph in the first period and stuff the puck through his legs for a 10 islander lead ron sutter s wraparound at 5 09 produced a 11 tie , but benoit hogue put the islanders up , 21 , when he flicked a ferraro rebound over the fallen goalie hull evened things with the first of his three goals , but then ferraro , who had five hat tricks as a whaler but none since being acquired from hartford on nov 13 , 1990 , took control of the middle period it was a brief spurt and , in the long run , it had only brief significance thanks to the blues' persistance around healy ferraro managed to put himself in close proximity to joseph at 23 seconds , 4 16 , and 5 06 of the period , and each time he got close , he tricked the blues' goalie joseph looked like a collapsed marionette by the time ferraro finished with him , but due to a corresponding collapse of the home team s resolution to play conscientious defense , the 52 islander advantage eroded hull made it 53 by chipping the puck over healy at 18 37 , and with the islander lead narrowed to 65 in the third period , hull struck again , this time from a distance , with a shot that wobbled like a mirage before beating healy photo islanders ray ferraro making a shot on goal as blues goalie curtis joseph blocked it last night \( alan zale for the new york times \)
councilman robert j dryfoos of manhattan , who has become the target of a federal grand jury investigation , faces eviction from his expensive office suite , garnishment of his official salary and new questions about using publicly raised money for personal purposes records indicate that mr dryfoos tapped an unusual 170 , 000 fund that he set up to defray the costs of his expanded councilmanic duties to pay more than 10 , 000 in overdue maintenance charges for his coop apartment on the east side an internal memorandum shows , furthermore , that mr dryfoos s lawyer and financial advisers were concerned about the disbursements to him out of the fund , the 7th district council government committee , and were worried that bob s would or might be audited at some time the payments continued , nonetheless a month ago the new york times reported that mr dryfoos had used the fund to pay personal bills that he was deeply in debt that he had accepted 25 , 000 from a developer , leonard litwin , after championing his project before a city agency , and that he had not filed tax returns for years in the last month the grand jury has been examining whether mr dryfoos can be prosecuted for mail and wire fraud the grand jury , directed by the public corruption unit of the united states attorney s office in manhattan , has begun taking testimony and has subpoenaed records from mr dryfoos and his staff and associates , including an executive of prudential securities , william howell mr howell has acknowledged giving cash periodically to mr dryfoos the 170 , 000 that the fund held at its peak it is now virtually depleted was raised by mr dryfoos through parties with benefactors and solicitations of unions and other groups some of the groups had business before mr dryfoos s committees many contributors said they believed that they were giving to mr dryfoos s reelection campaign the fraud investigation is trying to determine , among other facets , whether donors may have been deceived through mailings or telephone calls records walk while officials wait mr dryfoos , 48 years old , a lawyer representing the upper east side on the recently strengthened council , has yet to turn over crucial records sought from him , said people familiar with the investigation we are complying , said his lawyer , andrew m lawler , who declined to say more on may 23 , two days after the subpoenas had been issued , aides to mr dryfoos carried records out of the woolworth building , where mr dryfoos has his 6 , 400amonth suite mr dryfoos is being evicted from the suite opposite city hall for 30 , 536 in rent arrears it is unclear why the records were removed and where they were taken a lawyer for the f w woolworth company , jay b ringel , said last week that city marshals had started the process to garnish part of mr dryfoos s salary of 55 , 000 a year to satisfy a court judgment on june 7 to prevent 10 percent of his salary from being attached each week , mr dryfoos has to pay an equivalent amount to the landlord plus marshals' fees , mr ringel said in any case , under the eviction order , to which mr dryfoos has consented , he has to leave the building by july 15 since the article in the times , mr dryfoos has refused to respond to questions in an interview for the article last month , he said there was no problem of a legal nature and no problem of a spirit or perception nature concerning the 7th district fund he denied it had been used for personal expenses at a recent democratic forum , mr dryfoos , who has held his seat without serious

fund missing deadlines on the flow of cash mr dryfoos set up the fund in april 1990 , three months after having been named chairman of the council s important subcommittee on planning , zoning and landmarks , part of the land use committee mr dryfoos was already chairman of the committee on state and federal legislation during the investigations , he has stepped down from both posts the committee s charter said it would not aid or take part in mr dryfoos s campaigns , but was authorized by him to pay expenses in connection with the discharge of his councilmanic duties , which are not payable from councilmanic funds in an interview last month , mr dryfoos s lawyer , lawrence a mandelker , said that there was no legal requirement to disclose the receipts or expenditures of the fund , but that he and mr dryfoos promised to do so by june 28 friday was the deadline for candidates seeking public matching funds to file with the city campaign finance board records of all campaign financial activity between the 1989 elections and last january the deadline passed with none of mr dryfoos s records turned in board officials said candidates who mailed in their filings by midnight friday would still be in compliance the times reported last month that tens of thousands of dollars from the fund were used to pay for the office in the woolworth building , well outside mr dryfoos s district the office was listed on the building directory not as a councilman s office , but as a private law office the times also reported that some of the money paid for clothing and american express bills and that onethird of the 170 , 000 was given to mr dryfoos in large lump sums whose purpose was not recorded
albany , june 24 new york state s top prison official said today that many guards at the state s new highestsecurity prison had become lax before last month s inmate uprising because the officers wanted the prison s experimental program to fail the official , correction commissioner thomas a coughlin 3d , said that guards at southport prison had routinely violated a critical security procedure by leaving inmates unobserved while the officers took unauthorized lunch breaks at a hearing on the causes and implications of the riot , mr coughlin said that many of the 234 southport officers believed that the jobs of 46 officers who had been laid off would be restored if southport were turned back into a normal maximumsecurity prison the prison now requires fewer guards because the inmates are locked up 23 hours a day and do not go out of their cells to work or attend classes mr coughlin vowed to continue the southport program , which has been phased in over the last five months it will work , he said it is based on sound principles union blames commissioner leaders of the guards union denied today that correction officers had tried to sabotage the change at southport the officials of the union , council 82 , security and law enforcement employees , called for mr coughlin s resignation , saying he was blaming guards for disorders that had been caused by his staff cuts and inadequate security , including flimsy fences and a lack of guard towers at a news conference called after they learned of mr coughlin s comments , the union officials said that mr coughlin had been aware that officers took lunch breaks that apparently left inmates in the outdoor recreation pen unsupervised for short periods there were 53 inmates in the recreation pen when the riot broke out last month he knows full well that our people took lunches , thomas p kennedy 3d , the president of the council , said joseph p puma , the union s executive director , said southport authorities had neglected to inspect the recreationarea fences and had failed to provide enough guards to prevent inmates from ripping through the metal barriers five officers were taken hostage and four officers were injured , one seriously , in the disorders on may 28 and 29 , in which inmates took over part of cellblock a the inmates involved surrendered when they were permitted to air grievances about living and health conditions in a television interview southport , which is near ithaca in the western part of the state , opened in 1988 as a maximumsecurity prison it was converted in january to what penology experts describe as a maximaxi security institution for 790 unmanageable inmates who have committed violent acts and other serious infractions while in prison the prisoners at southport are kept in virtually solitary confinement for 23 hours a day and allowed recreation for one hour in fenceenclosed pens mr coughlin and the union have been at odds for months over layoffs in the correctional system , and the effects the cuts will have on security about 600 officers and 800 civilian employees have been dismissed in recent months , while the prison population climbed to a record 56 , 000 lunchtime for guards as the first witness at a hearing before the state s commission of correction , an oversight agency , mr coughlin expanded today on a report he issued sunday in which he put the blame for the riot largely on seven guards who had left their posts for lunch mr coughlin said three of the guards had received permission from a supervisor to leave the recreation area , but that three others had gone to a storage room without authorization for a lunch break the seventh officer was going back and forth between the yard and the storage room , he said at a news conference after his testimony , mr coughlin said that a number of officers at southport wanted the program there to fail they thought if they could hang loose and show it does n't work , either i or the legislature would cave in , mr coughlin said , adding that the officers hoped southport would be converted back to a normal maximumsecurity prison mr coughlin emphasized that the officers who opposed the plan did not believe they were taking risky steps when they allowed inmates more than one hour of recreation and often neglected to observe them fewer disorders elsewhere but he said the inmates capitalize on the boredom and indifference of guards and realized they were frequently unobserved during the recreation time and could tamper with fences and plan escapes at the hearing , mr coughlin said that the consolidation of problem inmates in southport had dramatically reduced the number of incidents with unruly prisoners in the state s 67 other correctional centers he said the harsh conditions for inmates at southport deterred prison disorders because inmates in the other institutions do n't want to wind up at southport none of the officers who were taken hostage during their unauthorized lunch breaks will be disciplined , mr coughlin said , explaining they 've paid for their errors dearly mr kennedy , the union official , said that mr coughlin s policies at southport including forced overtime and refusing to accept union recommendation on how to reduce tension had led to staff demoralization 'a hot and miserable place' they are doing a job in a hot and miserable place and getting secondguessed by someone in an ivory tower in albany , mr kennedy said of mr coughlin he s not the one who s getting urine and feces thrown in his face while the union disagreed with mr coughlin over whether southport was the best site in the state for a maximaxi prison , mr kennedy asserted , we have tried to make it work william g mcmahon , the chairman of the correction commission , said the panel was investigating the southport melee to determine whether the riot was an aberration or if the maximaxi idea was a flawed concept anne w crowley , press secretary for gov mario m cuomo , said mr cuomo had full confidence in mr coughlin and had no intention of asking for his resignation photo correction commissioner thomas a coughlin 3d testifying

the fevered speculation that drove art auction prices up over the last five years was virtually absent this week as collectors , dealers and museum curators crowded into sotheby s on tuesday night and christie s last night for contemporary art sales most came to see if the works presented would sell , and at realistic prices others came in search of bargains , and many were successful what they found were paintings and sculptures at prices that prompted them to buy enthusiastically , especially the works of artists of the 1970 s and 1980 s , representing a new development at these sales both houses said they persuaded sellers to lower their estimates and to accept reserves that were moderate lucy mitchellinnes , who heads sotheby s contemporary art sales , said owners were very much aware of the difficulties in recent sales fewer glamorous offerings we took a very conservative approach , she said owners listened carefully and when we told them if you put a conservative estimate on your works you will generate a lot of interest in the piece , they abided by what we said glamorous offerings , although fewer in number , were not entirely absent at these sales major works by robert rauschenberg , roy lichtenstein , cy twombly , franz kline , frank stella and philip guston were included in the sales at both houses that were estimated to bring half or less than the totals realized six months or a year ago the most important work was mr rauschenberg s rebus from 1955 a prize painting by the artist that was auctioned in november 1988 for a record 63 million when it was presented again in the same room at sotheby s on tuesday night and brought even more 73 million the audience showed none of the euphoria it had in 1988 the price was the highest paid at auction for a work by the artist and at sotheby s sale of postwar art but this time , many artworks in sotheby s sale brought prices well below the house estimates bidding for rebus an 8by11foot work splashed with paint , plaster , varnish , graffiti , a torn poster , comics and photographs was intense between at least three potential buyers on tuesday night two were in the room and one bid by telephone from an undisclosed location sotheby s did not identify the buyer interviewed after the sale by telephone , the manhattan art dealer larry gagosian was asked whether the buyer of rebus was charles saatchi , the british advertising magnate for whom mr gagosian acts as agent no , i bought 'rebus , ' mr gagosian said i think it is an incredible painting asked if he had a client for the rauschenberg , mr gagosian replied , we 'll see prices below house estimates americans dominated in the bidding and buying at sotheby s auction of 74 works , 54 of which were sold for a total of 213 million against a house presale estimate of 23 million to 32 million twentyfour works were bought for prices below the house estimates at christie s auction of 54 works , 39 were sold for a total of 11 million in a sale the auction house had estimated would bring 15 million to 20 million of the 19 works that were sold below christie s estimates , 2 were bought by richard gray , a chicago dealer kline s west brand , a bold blackandwhite canvas from 1960 , which brought 187 million , and lucas samaras s box no 35 , from 1965 , which brought 88 , 000 the kline is an aplus picture that was much admired by collectors , said diane upright , who heads contemporary art sales at christie s 'a great sigh of relief' mr gray bid throughout much of the sale with a portable telephone atone ear and slight nods to christopher burge , christie s president and chief auctioneer i breathed a great sigh of relief last night and tonight , mr gray said both were good sales with spirited bidding and realistic prices people are no longer willing to pay the prices they had to pay in the boom period mr lichtenstein s razzmatazz \( 1978 \) was sold for 17 million well above the house estimate we sold it to an american private collection , ms upright said lichtenstein is a great artist whose work was subject to speculation and made the sort of massive leaps in a short period of time that is very hard to sustain although this price was higher than the estimate , it was still realistic north americans bought most of the art tonight 34 out of the 39 works , she added what we found was that works by artists of the 50 s and 60 s kline , rauschenberg , de kooning , gorky and calder were all of great interest to collectors drawing
a record number of banks in connecticut are going broke , but a new one has opened in the town of essex , which already had almost one bank for every 1 , 000 residents maritime bank and trust company , the first new bank in the state in more than a year , opened its single office on route 153 in the lower connecticut river valley town we started this project three years ago and quickly found out that timing is everything , said the chairman of the bank , richard r manning , who also heads city coal inc , in nearby new london we 'll probably be the only bank to start up for a long time plans for at least two other eastern connecticut banks in windham and canterbury , which were organizing at the same time as maritime , have been abandoned and maritime s president , william r attridge , said there were some nervewracking moments over the last couple of years for his bank as well good mixture of accounts there was somewhat of a risk involved , mr attridge said when i joined them , they were still raising money , and it was not a good environment to be trying to raise money for a bank but maritime raised 46 million from 300 stockholders as seed money , and the bank said it has been steadily attracting 600 , 000 to 700 , 000 a week in new deposits since its may opening in one week in july maritime brought in 12 million in deposits , bank officials said , and the mixture has been good , with a higher percentage in checking and savings accounts than expected if all your money is in certificates of deposit , that money can disappear tomorrow , if the bank across the street offers a higher rate , mr attridge said if it s in checking and savings accounts , it implies the money is there to stay for a while in mr attridge s case , the bank across the street , is not merely a figure of speech across the street is the former chester bank , now taken over by connecticut national bank but having such a close competitor does not seem to have harmed maritime we expected an initial rush of deposits from directors and their friends , mr attridge said what we did n't expect was how consistently the influx of deposits has continued it really has n't trailed off banks in connecticut lost a total of 649 million in 1990 , which was worse than 1989 , when 505 million was lost but dr lewis mandell , a professor of finance at the university of connecticut , said the market is ripe for banks like maritime 'only time to start a bank' he recalled his efforts to help a group that was starting the first minorityowned bank in texas in the 1970 s , just before the banking collapse there when he went back to texas several years later , he called the lawyer for the group to apologize for such poor timing , he said he said the bank was fine , that they opened just as real estate prices collapsed , and every loan they had on the books was made after the collapse , so they had no bad real estate loans , dr mandell said that made me realize the only time to start a bank is when things are at their worst but it is also the time when people are least likely to invest in a new bank , he acknowledged , and when regulators are scrutinizing new charters you need to put in a lot of capital now , dr mandell said he noted , however , that investors would be scrutinized closely , and that if any of a bank s organizers even spit on a public sidewalk in their youth , the fbi is going to knock them out of the roster mr attridge said the poor economy hurt maritime a little when it was raising capital the planned stock offering of 51 million had to be scaled back to 46 million , he said , and the investors do not expect to double their money soon the sole stock transaction since the bank opened was at 10 a share , the price the shares brought during the public offering people who bought stock in this bank did n't buy it for the quick flip , mr attridge said they knew they were getting in for the long haul with parking in the rear and a decidedly residential facade , the bank looks more like an elegantly restored sea captain s home than a commercial establishment inside the front door a plate of cookies and pitcher of lemonade greet visitors , and in the waiting area , a cherrywood coffee table holds banking and finance journals along with the local main street news profit in second year seen the interior is done in white and forest green , with brass lighting fixtures and plush carpeting customers exchange pleasantries with the tellers , who often find no need to check their identification maritime has gone out of its way to make people comfortable , mr attridge said he said that if the bank s goals are reached , it will be the second year before it turns a profit , and perhaps two years or more before it reaches the 40 million in deposits it would need to make a second stock offering it s not appropriate , 10 weeks out of the box , to be talking about where your next branch will be or potential mergers and acquisitions , mr attridge said but we are looking around the bank s 11 directors include people in the oil business , accounting , computers , restaurants , finance , and retail , and none draw a salary , mr manning said among them they own more than 50 percent of the stock mr manning said with no bad loans on the books , and with 600 , 000 or more coming in every week in new deposits , maritime should be able to avoid the pitfalls that have claimed so many other banks obviously , if we 're bringing in that kind of money , people are saying there s a need for community banks , and community bankers , mr manning said we 've been inundated with new business , particularly from medical professionals , because a lot of people are concerned about other banks the people at maritime really did their homework , said the executive director of the middlesex county chamber of commerce , lawrence d mchugh i think they 're going to do very well , because they 're filling a void middlesex county , while it has been affected by the recession , has still seen some expansion , mr mchugh said his organization is taking in an average of 15 members a month , with only 6 or 7 dropping out a positive message in essex , he said , several businesses have expanded , and the bank s opening will send a positive message to businesses looking to relocate the older banks have no money to give out , mr mchugh said maritime is going to pick up business , because they 're new , and they can write loans without regulators climbing up and down on them john a johns , the first selectman of essex , said he is not surprised maritime s directors chose the town at the time they started the bank , construction was doing well , particularly the construction of costly new houses , which i'm sure would be attractive to any bank , mr johns said and our tax structure is attractive , the third lowest taxes of the 169 towns in connecticut mr johns said it might seem that essex had too many banks the town , with 5 , 800 residents , is home to the essex savings bank and has branches of four regional banks but for myself , if i were seeking a mortgage , i 'd want to go to a place where i know the people i'm dealing with , and where i know the stockholders , mr johns said photos william r attridge , president of maritime bank and trust company in essex , the state s first new bank in more than a year , with

the sale of french furniture and decorative objects from the keck collection on thursday night at sotheby s proved that in this depressed auction season a touch of gilt and lacquer goes a long way many pieces sold for more than their high estimates , a far cry from the disappointing results in last month s auctions of paintings , drawings and sculpture of the 55 objects on the block on thursday , only six failed to sell the auction s total , 10 , 212 , 400 , confirmed what the art market already knew fine french furniture appears to be recessionproof it just does n't fall , jeanmarie rossi , a parisbased dealer , said after the sale this is still a serious market and that was exactly what sotheby s was banking on with the auction house s bread and butter impressionist , modern and contemporary paintings bringing in far less revenue , it is counting on the decorative arts to make up much of the difference as a result , sotheby s treated thursday s sale with the importance it accords a sale of major paintings it was at night , the first time a furniture sale in new york has not been held during the day , and the house presented the keck collection in an elaborate hardbound catalogue the auction house also guaranteed the seller , howard b keck , an undisclosed sum , which some experts estimated was as low as the sale s low estimate of 8 , 189 , 000 and others estimated was as high as 19 million \( a guarantee is a minimum price that the auction house promises the seller regardless of the outcome of the sale \) small but potent turnout still , the turnout seemed small compared with the crowds that attend the major paintings auctions , although all the major decorativearts dealers from new york and paris were present in the front row were the antiquaires a paris , five french dealers \( including mr rossi \) with their own paris galleries who hold joint exhibits and often buy pieces together there were also several private collectors visibly bidding and a great deal of business was done on the telephone the collection was from la lanterne , the bel air mansion in los angeles belonging to mr keck , the son of william m keck , the founder of the superior oil company most of it was acquired within the last 10 years the sale was forced by a divorce it s an outstanding collection , said thierry millerand , who heads the french furniture department at sotheby s , one that covers the scope of french furniture highlighting the sale was a louis xvi ebony and japanese lacquer commode and secretary , both by adam weisweiler , a wellknown 18thcentury furniture maker the pieces fetched 2 , 860 , 000 and the final bid was made by mr rossi , who was buying the piece for the antiquaires a paris highly unusual pieces are what people were after tonight , said mr millerand a pair of blueandwhite marble jardinieres , expected to sell for 250 , 000 to 350 , 000 , sold for 825 , 000 to a private collector bidding on the phone a rare louis xvi stained horn , motherofpearl , stone and brass marquetry writing table , estimated to bring 400 , 000 to 500 , 000 , was sold for 962 , 500 to a darkhaired man wearing dark glasses and identified only as a european private collector a louis xvi ormolu and hard stonemounted ebony cabinet brought 572 , 000 , well above its projected 350 , 000 to 450 , 000 estimate it went to the parisbased dealer maurice segoura , who said he was bidding for a client from monte carlo a disappointment the evening s one major disappointment was a louis xv desk attributed to joseph baumhauer that was estimated to sell for 1 million to 12 million bidding stopped at 675 , 000 it was one of the most distinguished pieces in the sale , mr millerand said maybe the problem was that it was too distinguished tastes tonight ran toward the more exotic indeed , rare works of french furniture , no matter how recently they have been on the market , are a strong commodity these days another sale of a major collection of french furniture assembled in recent years , the roberto polo collection , auctioned nov 7 in paris , also brought top dollar estimated to bring 10 million , the final total of the polo sale , held at the french auction house ader tajan , was 17 , 422 , 271 surprisingly , none of these prices seem the least affected by the recent 186 percent tax that the french government recently imposed on the purchase and importation of french antiques while the french dealers who were buying in new york are thought to be shipping their goods to geneva , such arrangements are more difficult for private french collectors there was a noticeable absence of french collectors bidding tonight , said mr millerand of sotheby s but for a number of years now , because of the economy , the french have been sellers on the auction scene rather than buyers

pontiac , mich , march 22 the tapes were played the duke blue devils were studied the conclusion was simple if there is an area to be exploited , it is the outside shot so goes that theory , jim calhoun , the university of connecticut coach , said at the end of a season duke s 8167 victory tonight at the silverdome , which advances the blue devils to a regional championship game for the fifth time in six years , was built upon the one flaw calhoun could find the thing that stung us most , calhoun said , was the 3point shooting longdistance connection within the first three and a half minutes of their meeting tonight , duke made three 3point shots by halftime the blue devils , a 37 percent 3point shooting team , had made 6 of 8 that shooting forced the huskies into as much as an 18point firsthalf deficit , too big a problem against as reliable a team as duke after eliminating connecticut from the tournament for the second consecutive year , the secondseeded blue devils \( 297 \) will face st john s \( 238 \) , seeded fourth , for the championship here sunday greg koubek , a senior forward who has been a substitute for much of his duke career , scored 18 points , including 3 of 5 3point shots christian laettner , the junior center , added 19 and blocked 3 shots hurley in control bobby hurley , the sophomore guard , scored 12 points with 7 assists and no turnovers to provide duke with stability against connecticut s pressure defense while duke committed 21 turnovers , the firsthalf cushion was enough to create a margin for error the 11thseeded huskies \( 2011 \) ended a season that became as rewarding as it was difficult expectations created by the 31victory season of a year ago , complicated by the unexpected departure of nadav henefeld to a professional team in israel and a sixgame losing streak , ended with a longer tournament than many of their fans had planned we wanted to go to the final four , said steve pikiell , a guard and cocaptain to go to the sweet 16 two years straight says a lot about the program and where it is now quick turnaround connecticut s biggest problem was its reluctance to pressure duke s outside shooters that created an uncharacteristic hesitancy in its defensive play the problem was compounded by the fact that the duke coaches had anticipated that connecticut would concentrate more on the inside of the defense containment , calhoun said , does n't mean you step 4 feet off the coaches just told us to be ready to shoot the outside shot , koubek said , because it s going to be open within a span of 1 minute 24 seconds that calhoun considered shocking , duke made three 3point shots to turn a 1point lead to 10 thomas hill , the sophomore swingman who scored 13 points on 4 of 5 shooting , made the first two following passes from hurley koubek made the third after another pass from hurley after just 3 17 had gone by , the huskies were behind , 144 , and calhoun was loudly challenging his players in connecticut s previous 11 games , just one of its opponents had made more than 40 percent of its shots , and none had made more than 44 percent duke ended that streak of defensive achievement by making 58 percent of its shots in the first half and 56 percent over all pikiell , when asked what makes the blue devils so strong , looked at a simple formula you see a couple of allamericas 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 allamericas , pikiell said that makes them pretty good rally falls short still , the huskies had a chance to make the game close when john gwynn , the animated senior guard who scored 16 points , made a second consecutive 3point shot with 11 23 to go connecticut was within 9 points , and the crowd of 30 , 461 , sensing the chance for an upset , began to get involved but over the next 3 34 , five connecticut possessions led to just three foul shots soon the duke lead was back to 14 points , and the connecticut season was near its end and when it was over , calhoun s season ended with as much admiration for the blue devils as disappointment in the finish it s not fun to get defeated , calhoun said but they play the game the way it s meant to be played
on the day after his philadelphia concert , tom petty s brown suede jacket , the same one he wore on stage , hangs on the back of a chair in his hotel room when mr petty himself walks in , his outfit , too , matches that of the previous night blue jeans , a white shirt , a dark vest this is appropriate , because the tom petty you get in person is not all that different from the one you get on stage up close , you can see that his blond hair is thinning , his face a bit worn like his music , mr petty is direct , unpretentious he s not too keen on publicity being on the cover of rolling stone terrifies me , he says but once he gets going , he s a thorough talker when he hits on a subject , he likes to get to the bottom of it and his conversation , like his songs , communicates a sense of conviction he s easy to believe in tom petty s concerts have always been straightforward theatrics are kept to a minimum on the current nationwide tour , which comes to the nassau coliseum on tuesday and the meadowlands on wednesday , the set list gives a kind of timelapse look at his career concentrating on his two most recent albums , the show manages to touch upon almost every moment of mr petty s recording history there s a short acoustic medley of songs from his first two albums , and the biggest hit off each of his next four records , refugee , the waiting , you got lucky and do n't come around here no more the concert s hat tricks come in the form of two nonoriginal songs the count five s 1960 s classic psychotic reaction , which his longtime backup group , the heartbreakers , perform with all the spitfire of a club band , and an introspective reading of the 1989 van morrison ballad i'm tired joey boy the songs cover more than 25 years of rockandroll history , and mr petty has lived through it all now , with the release of his 10th album , into the great wide open , he has reached , if not exactly a crossroads , then certainly a point of reflection into the great wide open is all about reflection two of its 12 stories deal with a subject perhaps closer to mr petty than any , that of being a teenager in a rockandroll band almost all the others many co written with mr petty s friend and coproducer jeff lynne look at either the past or the distant future from the narrative vantage point of the present the album , says mr petty , is about being young and old in the wide open spaces between the acoustic guitars , you can almost feel time passing through the songs like a wind the inner sleeve graphics superimpose the lyrics over diagrams of clouds and constellations , a kind of literal depiction of the imagery filling the songs it seemed like when i was a kid in the 60 s , it was so easy to be a teenager , he says everyone was so united on what we were about now there s so many different ways to go i mean , a lot of young kids are republicans it s a whole different thing now i was just trying to compare it to my own youth unlike other american songwriters of his generation bruce springsteen , don henley , john mellencamp the 40yearold mr petty has n't resigned himself to rockandroll adulthood he continues to try to make sense of rock as the music of youth , and to understand himself in that context into the great wide open uses simple but elegant metaphorical language to look at the promises of adolescence , and what can become of dreams later in life he is the only rocker over 40 making honest , articulate and nonpatronizing music for and about his primary audience teenagers when mr petty was growing up , things were different he came of age in the mid to late 60 s , watching bands like the beatles on the ed sullivan show , listening to elvis presley singles he had traded for a slingshot at that time , in his hometown of gainesville , fla , rockandroll was , pure and simple , the music of transcendence mr petty tried other work construction , washing dishes at a barbecue restaurant , even digging graves it was the only job in 1967 where they did n't make you cut your hair off , he says nothing panned out i got fired from every job i ever had without exception because i obviously was n't that interested although he also played in high school and club bands from the ages of 14 to 17 , he had no expectation of making it a career i grew up without any money , but i never saw this job as one that was going to make me money , he says i was just sort of accepting that my life was going to be one of struggling to get by like , 'well , i'm not going to go to college , but i really like playing and that s what i'm going to do' with this in mind , he left home at 17 and played in bands around florida , then eventually headed for los angeles by the mid70 s , he and the heartbreakers had signed a record deal , and their eponymous debut album was released in 1976 the songs on tom petty and the heartbreakers are swathed in innocence jangly , upbeat tunes like american girl or the more somber the wild one , forever sound more like paeans to archetypal rockandroll figures \( the girl and the tough girl \) than narratives based on reallife experience i think i was innocent in some ways , mr petty says when we started in this business , it was a lot more innocent than it is now now it s very organized , it s big business
norderstedt , germany , nov 13 a group of refugees huddled in the shalom community church here has defied a government order that they move to a hostel in eastern germany , where they say they fear for their lives for us , west germany not very good , but good , said one gee , a kurd who said he was wanted by the police in his native turkey east germany no good maybe we die there the group has come to symbolize the refugee crisis now gripping germany the group reflects the diversity of the refugees streaming into germany at the rate of nearly 1 , 000 per day there are single men , elderly women , and families with young children they come from bulgaria , yugoslavia , albania , turkey , pakistan , afghanistan , india , algeria , zaire and angola all arrived in germany this year they lived quietly at a hostel near hamburg while waiting to be assigned permanent quarters , but when the assignment finally came in september , many were horrified the government decided to send them to greifswald , in what was formerly east germany as the decision was announced , neonazis in another eastern town , hoyeswerda , were in the midst of a violent , and ultimately successful , campaign intended to force foreigners out of their community fearful , the refugees refused to go to greifswald left without shelter , they moved into a church in neumunster , 30 miles north of hamburg in negotiations with church workers , the government was adamant , and finally the refugees recognized that they had no choice but to travel to greifswald but after only a week there , their worst fears came true gangs of young hooligans marched to the hostel where they were living , attacked residents outside , and then tried to storm the building , hurling rocks and bottles and smashing windows and doors organizers of prorefugee groups offered to bring the refugees back to western germany the terrorized refugees jumped at the chance , and made their way to the shalom church in norderstedt , a suburb of hamburg government officials visited the church recently and said that those who do not want to return to greifswald can be assigned to other towns in eastern germany this is a solution that puts our lives in danger , said a refugee who insisted on anonymity we want a solution that will allow us to stay here after the meeting , one western official , gunther jansen , said he reluctantly realized that none of the refugees were going to return to greifswald we are going to have to start again from zero , mr jansen said map of germany , indicating norderstedt
port st lucie , fla bud harrelson does not appear alone in the photograph on the cover of the team s 1991 information guide , although he is not joined by any current member of the mets or their front office instead , he is accompanied , basically , by a ghost , for it is a faded , grainy reproduction of the late gil hodges s profile that is peering over harrelson s left shoulder it is an odd , if not an outright strange , touch harrelson , as well , does not have the only locker in his office here at the team s spring training complex doc edwards , the dugout coach , has a stall right next to harrelson s , and he can often be found alone in the office , smoking a cigarette and reading the newspaper it is a peculiar , if not entirely inexplicable , arrangement some people do n't like to eat alone , said one longtime and respected regular for the mets maybe buddy does n't like to manage alone the wisecrack , of course , could be interpreted as a cheap shot and the presence of hodges in the photograph and edwards in the office could amount to nothing substantially more than a selfdeprecating style on harrelson s part but the crack actually has its origins in a longstanding and widespread clubhouse curiosity , one that for more than a couple of players has deepened into an open cynicism about harrelson s independence as a baseball thinker and field manager as a result , one of the spring s dominant and explosive questions for the mets is this is bud harrelson his own man \? it is a question asked by players , speculated about by those outside the team and dismissed disdainfully by harrelson himself it s important for him to have a grip on the clubhouse , said ron darling , the pitcher with more years of service with the team than any other current player on the mets but that has to be nurtured harrelson s grip appears at best partial as he begins his first full season directing the mets , a contingent famous in recent years for its underachievement on the field and bellyaching in the locker room and newspapers there are corners of the clubhouse suspicious of harrelson s tactical soundness as a manager , convinced that he lacks all genius for the unorthodox or improvisational , as well as the kind of outsized personality that could by force of ego lift a team to exceptional levels of performance this perspective , at its most savagely sarcastic , portrays harrelson as an acquiescent tool of the front office to this contingent , harrelson s recent rethinking of the lineup he had spent the off season devising amounted to a retreat from his first major strategic decision of the spring there are , however , numerous players nearly defiant in their support of harrelson they consider him immensely dedicated and sufficiently communicative , as well as absolutely entitled to a full year to craft his personal stamp and then apply it to this collection , harrelson s willingness to consider adapting his lineup according to the preferencess of individual players reflect his skills as a diplomat and openminded manager you 're always going to have secondguessers , and you are always going to have guys who will say good things regardless , said howard johnson , the mets' shortstop , who has returned harrelson s reliance on him with a public faith in his manager i consider him a players' manager and any players griping or questioning him behind his back should spend more time worrying about themselves harrelson s own position is that he has n't himself spent many minutes agonizing over the perceptions and politics of his clubhouse he was skeptical of a reporter s claims as to the scope and seriousness of the doubts concerning him and he pointed to the effort and enthusiasm of the spring training workouts to date as evidence that whatever grousing did exist was irrelevant to the product he was going to produce come april i'm an organization man , harrelson said while overseeing infield drills one day last week i think that s a strength what i see more than anything else this spring are guys going the extra mile i do n't remember it being that way there are players , though , who ca n't forget the way it was last season , and the most bothersome images are of harrelson , who had just one complete year of minorleague managing before taking over last may , repeatedly turning to edwards , who had managed cleveland for almost two seasons , in the course of a game for advice and direction , provoking doubts among some players about who was making the critical decisions those questions have manifested themselves most sinisterly in barry lyons s angry understanding of the roots of his demise with the mets lyons , who began last season as the no 1 catcher for the mets before injuring his back and then being sent to the minors for good , said in an emotional and profane outburst here friday that he believed edwards was behind his demotion and then departure to the dodgers when asked about accusations from various mets that edwards s input was far too great to be too healthy , lyons said bluntly , i 've heard that
an agent of the federal bureau of investigation arrived at nazih deyda s office in los angeles last week , unannounced , unexpected and accompanied by a member of the los angeles police department s antiterrorist squad at first the visitors asked mr deyda if , as the regional director of the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee , he had been subjected to harassment or threats because of the standoff in the persian gulf mr deyda was pleased with the questions and the simultaneous offer of protection then the conversation took a different turn the officers , mr deyda said , began asking about his political beliefs , his views of israel and of president saddam hussein of iraq they asked me did i know any terrorists , he said i object to this kind of questioning mr deyda s mixed emotions reflect the feelings of many of the nearly three million arabamericans since monday , when the fbi confirmed that it had ordered its agents to interview business and community leaders of arab descent in the united states the interviews were described by the bureau as an effort to get information about possible hate crimes or terrorist acts in five days , more than 200 interviews have been conducted , all with american citizens , the bureau has said the increased concern by washington over the possibility of terrorism was evident yesterday in a bush administration warning that attacks are being planned by iraqisupported terrorists worldwide it said agencies were taking countermeasures in the united states and abroad page 9 discussing the fbi s interviews of arabamericans , albert mokhibar , the national president of mr deyda s organization , which has 25 , 000 members and is the largest arabamerican group in the united states , said the group has a schizophrenic relationship with the bureau on the one hand , we go to them to protect our civil rights , he said on the other hand , we find them more often than not probing into our personal opinions and violating our rights the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee is one of more than a dozen civil rights groups that attended a meeting in washington yesterday to form a coalition to address the question of fbi harassment according to several people who attended the meeting , fear was expressed not only over the fbi interviews , but also over an announcement by the justice department on thursday that immigration officials will begin photographing and fingerprinting anyone entering the united states with an iraqi or kuwaiti passport it s all consistent with a presumption that your national origin means you have some knowledge of , or connection with , terrorist activities , said kate martin , director of the national security litigation project of the american civil liberties union , who attended the meeting other groups in the new coalition include the japaneseamerican citizens league and the washington area jews for palestinian peace the coalition has prepared a statement to be presented to william baker , head of the fbi s criminal division , at a meeting monday praise and protest a draft of the statement , which is expected to be completed over the weekend , reflects the balancing act that mr mokhibar described , according to several people familiar with the document first , it applauds the bureau for its investigation of hate crimes , and then it protests the interviews , calling them harassment of arabamericans the possibility that arabamericans might one day be interned in camps similar to those that held japaneseamericans in world war ii was much discussed at yesterday s meeting , coalition members said this certainly raises that specter , ms martin said one of the questions that we do n't know the answers to is , where did they get the list of people they are interviewing \? did they already have a list of people to be talked to in the event of war with iraq \? that s the first thing you need to repeat the world war ii experience that also began with interviews , and then it accelerated the current tension reflects years of mutual mistrust of the bureau by arabamericans , leaders say the fbi has long considered political support of the plo position in the middle east to be the equivalent of terrorist activities , and thinks that gives them the right to treat people who hold those views as terrorists , ms martin said munir bayoud , a former member of the league of arab states office in dallas , and his wife , katie , who is the president of the north texas chapter of the antidiscrimination committee , recalled mr bayoud s encounter with the bureau in 1972 , immediately after palestinian terrorists killed 11 israeli athletes at the olympic games in munich mr bayoud said he felt so threatened by that interview that he sought the advice of a lawyer mr mokhibar cited the 1987 disclosure that the bureau and the immigration and naturalization service had drawn up a contingency plan to quarantine arabamericans at a camp in oakdale , la , in the event of war with certain arab states the plan came to light when the immigration agency tried to deport eight palestinians and a kenyan citizen because of their political views
los angeles , jan 30 by winning tuesday night , the knicks made today s crosscountry flight a lot easier to endure new york s 108107 overtime victory against the los angeles clippers was a strange game with a strange ending exciting it was pretty it was not but the knicks \( 1924 \) needed the victory no matter how they accomplished it they concluded their fivegame road trip with a 23 record not a success , but not a disaster either at least the knicks found a way to win , when on numerous occasions they have found ways to lose we had some leadership down the stretch and we did n't turn the ball over under fire , said john macleod nobody cracked nobody lost their composure with all the problems we 've had , to lose this game would 've made things that much more difficult the knicks won because maurice cheeks , patrick ewing and gerald wilkins delivered critical plays in pressure situations cheeks made the winning basket , a 20foot jump shot with 1 minute 7 seconds remaining in overtime ewing forces overtime ewing forced overtime with an eightfoot jump shot that tied the game with 208 seconds left he also blocked a potential gamewinning shot by ron harper at the fourthquarter buzzer and with the knicks trailing by 3 points in overtime , wilkins made two consecutive steals from harper that set up new york s final two baskets even so , the struggling clippers \( 1528 \) had a chance to win on the game s final possession but after winston garland missed an 18foot jump shot with six seconds remaining , charles smith missed four consecutive pointblank tipin attempts harper \( 23 points \) grabbed still another rebound , but cheeks stripped the ball from harper s hands and dribbled toward midcourt as the final buzzer sounded smith could not believe that none of his tipin attempts went in the first tip was so clean , i knew it was going to go in , said smith , a 6foot10inch forward patrick worked his way so far into the basket that he was n't involved i knew we would win the game , but the ball kept going to either side i have no idea how many tips there were you might as well say there were 10 of them what were the knicks doing while smith was playing volleyball \? trent tucker told me he was cursing me out , because he said i almost tapped it in myself , said ewing , who had an allstar type game with 44 points and 17 rebounds i had blocked smith out , but he gave me a nudge in the back and i went flying then he got the ball and he kept on tipping it i was trying to get it away from the basket , but he kept getting his hands on it then harper got it , but fortunately mo took it away from him big plays by cheeks cheeks made several extraordinary plays during overtime he fed kiki vandeweghe for a layup that pulled the knicks to within 1 point and on his gamewinning shot , cheeks fed ewing in the low post , then smartly moved to an open area when ewing was doubleteamed ewing fed cheeks with a return pass , and the veteran guard casually sank the open jump shot throughout his 13year career , cheeks has excelled in pressure situations this was another example on that last shot , i figured they would probably doubleteam patrick , so i was ready , cheeks said patrick had been burning them all night if i was their coach , i would 've doubleteamed him , too i was thrust into pressure situations as a young player , so i learned a lot about that at a young age i 've made mistakes in those situations before , but i 've been in them so many times , i'm comfortable in them now , 40 record in overtime macleod is still waiting for cheeks s savvy to rub off on the rest of the knicks they had a 10point lead in the third quarter , but the clippers ran off the next 14 points the knicks missed 12 consecutive shots from the field during that sequence , playing oneonone basketball instead of working together for highpercentage shots one of the most deceiving knicks' statistics is their 40 overtime record this season they were fortunate to win all of those overtime games , including tuesday night s even wilkins , when asked the significance of new york s overtime record said it has no significance look at our overall record that has significance new york will return home to play the washington bullets on thursday night the knicks may be fatigued , but they will enter that game in a better frame of mind than if they had lost on tuesday night

amman , jordan , april 1 kurdish rebels in iraq were reported falling back on snowbound mountain fastnesses today as baghdad s forces pressed a campaign of retribution into their adversaries' northernmost refuges kurdish spokesmen in damascus called the fast retreat from northern cities a tactical withdrawal to spare civilian lives , but iraq s official press depicted the advance of president saddam hussein s troops as a victorious parade that spelled the virtual collapse of the revolt that has seized both northern and southern areas of iraq since baghdad s defeat in the persian gulf war the iraq news agency said government forces had retaken the city of zakho on the turkish border after a series of withdrawals by rebellious kurds from other northern towns , including erbil , dohuk and kirkuk , an important oil center jim muir , a british broadcasting corporation correspondent , sent a radio dispatch from northern iraq saying hundreds of thousands of kurds are now on the move , cramming their families and whatever they could carry into lorries , tractortrailers , cars , taxis and any other vehicles they could find refugee families are now scattered through the snowcovered kurdish mountains , illequipped to face the bitterly cold nights and with no idea what future lies ahead for them again and again refugees and many other iraqi kurds asked western correspondents why the coalition powers that urged the iraqi people to rise up against saddam now seem to be standing by and leave them to face the consequences of having done so kurd reports heavy attacks a kurdish rebel spokesman in damascus said , the iraqi army hardly fought against the allied forces but is using all its might and muscle against iraqi civilians , including women and children kurds are a nonarab , sunni muslim people fragmented in mountainous areas of turkey , iraq , iran , syria and the soviet union in iraq , kurds account for around onefifth of the 18 million people there was a tactical withdrawal from kirkuk , dohuk and erbil to spare the lives of innocent civilians and spare the cities total devastation , the spokesman for the kurdish democratic party said in damascus the moves seemed to illuminate many ambiguities in the kurds' plight and in united states policy kurdish officials in damascus complained that while the allied defeat of iraq and american statements urging mr hussein s ouster had emboldened them to rebel , neither the west nor its allies seemed prepared to give military support to help the revolt potential supporters wary that perception underscored the kurds' perennial problem while nations in the region , notably syria and iran , have traditionally used kurdish guerrillas as surrogates to attack their adversaries , usually iraq , none of the nations sees an interest in political gains for the kurds that would spill over to kurds elsewhere turkey , in particular , is fearful that kurdish gains in iraq might inspire further unrest among its own eight million kurds neither the kurds nor shiite rebels in the south offer iraq s neighbors an acceptable alternative to mr hussein , so the rebellions have left iraq s hostile arab and turkish neighbors in a quandary while the revolts provide a welcome challenge to an adversary , their success would present many regional governments with more uncertainties than the continued tenure of mr hussein american troops control about 15 percent of iraq in the south and have ordered baghdad to ground its fixedwing warplanes , which might have been used against rebels but the united states has taken no action against iraqi helicopters , used as gunships against rebel positions , and administration officials have said they will not interfere in the rebellion the rebel spokesman said government troops were using tanks , helicopters and artillery against kurds they are killing any kurd they see , he said we are facing a worse genocide than halabja there , an attack on iraqi kurds by government forces using chemical weapons killed an estimated 5 , 000 people in 1988 border town reported retaken kurdish rebels have not so far acknowledged the loss of zakho , once a rebel command post , but turkish news reports today said iraqi government forces had also taken the border town of habur , suggesting that baghdad was reasserting control in the restive north turkey s semiofficial anatolian news agency said the iraqis had used helicopters and tanks the only northern center still thought to be in kurdish hands is sulaimaniya , near the border with iran mr hussein s forces also claim to have quelled revolt among the shiite muslim majority in southern iraq the developments in the north coincided with evidence thar iran and iraq appeared to have rekindled a longrunning proxy war both iran and iraqbased iranian dissidents reported fighting today in rugged border areas east of baghdad between iranian revolutionary guards and members of the people s mujahedeen , a group of opponents of the islamic regime in teheran teheran said the dissidents crossed the border from iraq into iran but spokesmen for the group in paris and washington said iranian troops had tried to attack their bases near jallula , in iraq both sides claimed to be defeating the other the mujahedeen s military activities ceased after the august 1988 ceasefire between iran and iraq but since iran began supporting the revolt in iraq in recent weeks , the iranian dissidents have reemerged a mujahedeen official said in a telephone interview from washington now we got involved because we were attacked what else could we do but defend ourselves \? he denied a suggestion that iraq had ordered a revival of muhajedeen activity in response to iran s political support

east rutherford , nj , jan 12 frankness is one of john cunniff s characteristics when being interviewed , the coach of the devils always speaks his mind and looks reporters in the eye while answering the type of unpleasant questions that arise during a losing streak so it was today , when cunniff was asked to assess his team minutes after new jersey squandered a 42 lead and was beaten by the edmonton oilers , 54 , in overtime the devils' loss was their fifth in a row right now , we 're not thinking as a unit we 're thinking individually , cunniff said our big guys are pressing , he went on , referring to several of the team s experienced players , who have been unproductive in recent games we 're running through this with mac right now he s uptight , taking penalties , paying the penalty the reference was to john maclean , who leads the devils with 28 goals but has only one in his last six games maclean s slashing penalty on craig muni with 26 seconds left in regulation carried over to the overtime and led to steve smith s powerplay goal 56 seconds into the extra session at byrne meadowlands arena he was letting everything go in the third , maclean said in defending the infraction called by the referee , dan marouelli , but he called that one marouelli called four other penalties in the third period , including a bench minor to the oilers for abusive language that gave the devils a fiveonthree advantage for 1 minute 23 seconds , at 7 13 of the period 'we did n't take advantage' the devils had a twogoal lead and acted as if the game s outcome was already determined when marouelli awarded the twoman advantage the fifth goal was not what lost it we had the game in control and we did n't take advantage , said ken daneyko , the physical defenseman for the devils , who turned out to be the victim on smith s winning goal smith s goal , which came on a shot from high in the slot , went in past chris terreri off the right hand of daneyko , who was standing in the crease to terreri s right spectacular saves by terreri instead , the puck went right into the goal before a flabbergasted terreri , who faced a total of 21 shots , including two in the overtime terreri made several spectacular saves and was not clearly responsible for the other goals , scored by martin gelinas , esa tikkanen , craig simpson and craig mactavish the devils took 36 shots , 16 against kari takko and 20 against bill ranford , but none in the overtime ranford replaced takko eight minutes into the second period , after takko allowed three goals dave maley , jeff madill , myles o'connor and laurie boschman scored the goals for the devils , who are without a victory in their last eight games \( 053 \) , their longest such streak this season three bright spots the bright spots for the devils were zdeno ciger , madill and o'connor , the three rookies promoted from utica because of the injuries to brendan shanahan and bruce driver in tuesday s 53 loss to st louis for madill and o'connor , the goals were their first in the national hockey league although ciger did n't have a goal , the 22yearold native of czechoslovakia , who had four goals before he was demoted after playing 17 games earlier in the season , might have been the most effective of the three we bring in rookies and they 're our top players , cunniff said photo devils' peter stastny , \( 26 \) , driving toward the goal , being tripped by the goalie , kari takko of the oilers , in the first period yesterday \( eddie hausner the new york times \)

the american red cross is moving forcefully , if belatedly , to strengthen its procedures for testing and handling blood that threatened to allow some patients to receive blood contaminated with the aids virus or other diseases only three months after taking office , the new red cross president , elizabeth dole , announced yesterday that the organization will now spend some 120 million on a sweeping reorganization of its entire blood collection system , which supplies half of the nation s blood for transfusions mrs dole called it the most dramatic and farreaching public safety step the red cross has taken in its history her hyperbole is justified the change comes after mounting evidence that some of the 53 red cross blood centers have been sloppy in conducting tests or keeping records , and that virtually all have been struggling to process an enormous increase in tests the errors were mostly clerical but had the potential to kill in one case , the fda found an aidscontaminated blood unit mislabeled , ready for shipment to a hospital to revamp the system , the red cross will close most of its 53 testing laboratories , each following its own procedures , and replace them with six or eight standardized laboratories it will adopt a single computer system to replace the confusing babble of 10 different ones it will retrain its workers and set up new local oversight boards none of this will guarantee the safety of all blood transfusions there is a window of time right after a person has become infected with the aids virus during which screening tests cannot detect the infection the risk , however , is very small only 15 cases of aids have been attributed to blood transfusions that passed the screening tests and estimates of the amount of infected blood that escapes the testing system range from 1 in every 40 , 000 pints of blood to 1 in every 150 , 000 pints some small risk is inescapable but the admirably decisive red cross reorganization should reduce the chances that human blunders will add to the toll
philip k dick published 35 novels and six volumes of short stories during a short , bohemian life of 54 years , a life that involved a lot of drugs , five marriages , several psychological breakdowns , religious visions and an enormous amount of frustrated literary ambition now , nine years after his death , he has become a powerful influence on popular culture , especially at a time when the culture bespeaks our deepest fears and most persistent fantasies about technology and its potential to destroy us dick wrote the stories on which two major movies were based blade runner , regarded by many critics as a science fiction masterpiece , and total recall , arnold schwarzenegger s do n'tmesswithme blockbuster there are probably more films in the offing nine other wittily gloomy futuristic works by dick have been optioned by movie makers there have also been a play and an avantgarde opera based on his novels and recently some of dick s books , most of which have been out of print since well before his death in 1982 , have been reissued by vintage press it seems as though just about every word dick wrote and every minute of his offbeat life has suddenly become worthy of attention dick s old scifi fans will regard the attention currently being paid him as long overdue but there are many latecomers to the philip k dick cult , arriving there , as i did , by way of the movies many of us are not devotees of science fiction , either the term itself has always seemed to me to be an oxymoron , particularly when it encompasses such notions as psychic projection , time travel , the existence of alternative worlds but the movies inspired by dick s books have little of that , and the books themselves have even less i'm talking here of a novel , do androids dream of electric sheep \? , and a story , we can remember it for you wholesale , on which blade runner and total recall , respectively , were based the conceptions behind them contained the shock of plausibility , and that is what , in my mind , unites them with other arresting antiutopian novels like brave new world and nineteen eightyfour the tremendous surge of interest in the author , his posthumous status as a guru , a prophet of the new age , raises that always interesting question about cultural trends why now \? my attempt to answer the question by reading the bestknown books ran up against the fact that , until recently , dick had been secluded in a very marginal corner of the literary world , away from the category of what scifi writers have always called , with a hint of envy , mainstream fiction he had a cultish following , his many works most readily available in the sorts of bookstores that specialize in exotica , fantasy , the occult and what is called new age but until vintage started releasing a few of the novels this summer , dick s books were mostly out of print and , even with the vintage reissues , most of them still are and so , when i tried to find do androids dream of electric sheep \? or a collection including we can remember it for you wholesale , none of the manhattan bookstores i tried had either of them i settled for a novel called the penultimate truth in a glossy paperback published by carroll graf that novel has not been optioned by a movie studio it is not viewed as one of dick s classics yet it is a good introduction to the author and to his dark vision of a soulless , poptech future in which there will be no meaningful difference between the real and the fake the idea is this most of mankind lives in vast multistoried underground tanks that manufacture robots for use in the nuclear conflagration that is raging at ground level the millions of people in the tanks watch news broadcasts about the war and the poisoning of the planet s surface they know , for example , that to go up there would result in diseases like stink of shrink , in which your head is reduced to the size of a marble , and bag plague and so they stay where they are , until , more or less by accident , one of them ventures into the sunshine and what that person learns is that all is fraudulent there was indeed a nuclear war that much is true but the rest of earthly existence is the secret of a privileged few who live on an entirely habitable earth on vast estates serviced by the robots produced by the duped inhabitants of the tanks thus the penultimate truth is a tale of the almost infinite manipulability of facts and images , of a bureaucratic dictatorship whose hold on power is based on the bureaucrats' control of truth the story is told in a gritty , technobabblish sort of noir prose , stripped of sentiment , blunt , disabused , a bit reminiscent of william burroughs and also of dick s fellow californian raymond chandler , with passages like this one , having to do with stink of shrink the microscopic things downfalling to us that some careless ambulatory metal hunk of handmade parts had failed to 'cide out of existence before yanking the drop switch , shooting three hundred pounds of contaminated matter to us , something both hot and dirty at the same time hot with radioactivity and dirty with germs great combination , he thought
washington , july 1 federal reserve policy makers will hold one of their most important meetings of the year here tuesday with two seats on its board vacant and alan greenspan s future as chairman at least officially in limbo fed officials say that the vacancies and the uncertainty over whether mr greenspan will be given another fouryear term are no more than inconveniences and that they will have no problem on tuesday agreeing on a target range for the growth of money supply over the next six months maybe so but when pressed , the officials concede that they wish the white house and congress would pay a bit more attention to the fed , the agency of the government with the most influence over the economy i do n't know whether it s that they 're not interested in us or that they just do n't want to have anything to do with monetary policy , said one staff assistant the decisions on monetary policy made in secret tuesday will be announced july 16 when mr greenspan testifies before a subcommittee of the house banking committee if the fed lowers the target range for growth in money supply , currently 2 1 2 percent to 6 1 2 percent , that will be seen as a renewed commitment to fight inflation if , on the other hand , the target is raised or even left as is , the markets will probably take that as a signal that the fed is encouraging a strong recovery from the recession mr greenspan s term expires aug 11 it is widely assumed throughout the capital and on wall street that he will be reappointed , but no word has come from the white house awaiting better times why not \? one theory is that president bush wants to give the economy as much time as possible to improve before renominating mr greenspan if the recession is unequivocally over when the senate holds confirmation hearings , according to this line of thought , the government s economic policy will not be subject to such intense scrutiny another view is that the decision cannot be made without the participation of john h sununu , but the president s chief of staff has been distracted by ethical questions only four or five people know for sure what is going on mr bush , mr sununu , treasury secretary nicholas f brady and probably michael j boskin , chairman of the council of economic advisers , and richard g darman , the budget director and they will not say mr boskin and mr brady have maintained publicly that mr greenspan has kept interest rates too high but they are known to think highly of the fed chairman and are believed to want him reappointed still , a top official at the treasury said last week that mr brady had not even discussed the matter with his staff mr sununu s position is less clear , but white house officials say that if mr brady and mr sununu are at odds on this issue , the president will almost certainly side with his treasury secretary rumors travel fast in washington and on wall street , and when vernon a walters announced last week that he was resigning as ambassador to germany , word spread that the administration was creating a graceful way for mr greenspan to be eased out of the fed after all , the reasoning went , germany is a plum assignment , and arthur f burns was given that post in the carter administration after he left the fed chairmanship but administration officials now say robert m kimmitt , the under secretary of state for political affairs , will get the post despite the fed s importance to the economy and despite politicians' occasional statements about interest rates , the simple truth may be that people in political circles pay little attention to the fed mr bush prefers focusing on foreign affairs mr sununu has been preoccupied with his traveling travails mr brady has been busy promoting the administration s banking legislation two empty seats if they were going to select someone else to be chairman of the fed , the white house would have had to act by now otherwise , after aug 11 , the agency would be without a chairman or mr greenspan would be in the awkward position of being a lame duck but if mr greenspan is going to get another term , it makes no difference if he has not been officially confirmed when this term expires the politicians' lack of attention to the fed is clearly the main reason the two vacancies remain on the sevenmember board manuel h johnson resigned last august he had been vice chairman of the board in january , more than five months later , mr bush nominated david w mullins jr , already on the board , to the vice chairmanship , and named lawrence b lindsey , a white house economist , to the vacant seat the senate banking committee did not hold hearings on mr lindsey s nomination until may and on mr mullins s until last month and while their confirmation is assured , the panel has not held a meeting to vote asked last week why the long process , senator donald w riegle jr of michigan , the democrat who heads the committee , said , we 've just been absolutely swamped in january , martha r seger announced that she planned to leave the board , and she resigned in march by early may , the administration had settled on susan m phillips , a former chairwoman of the commodity futures trading commission , to fill the vacancy but the nomination still has not been announced an increased workload the fed has functioned quite well shorthanded , its officials say , but the remaining five governors have had to double up on some assignments for example , no governor has been concentrating on international finance for the last year that had been mr johnson s specialty none of this should , however , put a damper on mr greenspan s annual fourth of july party for political and financial figures and fed reporters he holds it in the penthouse ballroom of one of the fed s office buildings , with one of the city s best views of the fireworks all this gossip is sure to be hashed out there
if you listen to some restaurantindustry pundits , la grenouille is just the type of expensive , opulent institution that is slated for extinction as ineluctably as the dinosaurs in this era of austerity and a return to more ingenuous foods , they say , the dining public is turning away from haute cuisine and embracing little pizzas , pasta , coq au vin and grilled chicken so welcome to la grenouille , tuesday night , midjanuary , traditionally the slowest time of the year for restaurants the dining room is as packed as bloomingdale s during a postholiday clearance the setting is luminous , with little silkshaded lamps on the tables , goldleaf sconces on the walls , red velvet banquettes and as many flowers as you will find this side of the rose bowl the room reverberates with the sound of wellheeled patrons content in their situation twentyeightyearold la grenouille , still run by the masson family , has an oldtime clientele of distinguishedlooking men dressed in the somber tones of international bankers and designerclad women weighed down with a king s ransom in jewelry and it now seems to be attracting some younger patrons a good sign what attracts these varied fans , aside from the wonderfully romantic setting , is the comforting and consistently superior classical cuisine by frederick heba , who came last year from lucascarton in paris the strength of this kitchen is its excellent stocks , which form the basis for sublime sauces among appetizers , a hearty lobster stock gives lobster bisque a rich flavor and a long aftertaste the same stock contributes to a silken sauce to go with gossamer lobster ravioli delicate malpeque oysters were wrapped in spinach , draped in a light curry sauce and gratineed a lovely combination a green bean and mache salad came with a slice of luxuriously unctuous fois gras however , salmon mousse with redpepper coulis on two samplings was so rich with cream it could have been served as dessert , and much of the salmon flavor was lost in the process if you are indeed an international diamond dealer , la grenouille s ostentatious wine list may hold appeal in stjulien , for example , prices begin at 85 and run up to 175 in pauillac , the range is 67 to 1 , 200 among whites , even a modest stveran from louis jadot \( la chapelle \) costs 32 sweetbreads fans should not miss the rendition here , firm , fresh and perfectly braised and served with a lusty vealstock sauce magret \( breast of a fatted duck \) was rose pink in the center and had a mild aged flavor it came in a faintly sharp sherry vinegar sauce with sweet turnips both lamb dishes sampled were exquisitely homey saddle of lamb stuffed with zucchini , carrots and leeks along with a crusty potato cake on the side , and rack of lamb with gratin potatoes one might think it ludicrous to order oxtail , at a little more than 2 a pound , in a restaurant with a 68 prix fixe but i could n't help it , for braised oxtail in a thick redwine sauce as dark as texas crude is irresistible the tender , gelatinous meat came with golden paillasson potatoes \( pancakes made with shredded potatoes \) and a sweet turnip puree quenelles are sort of the dickeys of haute cuisine , almost impossible to find here they are a paragon of the art , ineffably light dumplings made with french pike and sole mousse this may not be the kind of innovative fourstar cooking that leaves you shaking your head , but it sure prompts a smile a special one evening of cod fillet over creamy mashed potatoes with a drizzling of olive oil needed a bit of seasoning to come together juicy roast split lobster , however , had ample herbs among the seafood offerings , grilled dover sole was well executed but the fiery mustard sauce with it was better suited for pastrami than for fish sauteed salmon was right on the mark , surrounded by a light redwine sauce and with sauteed cabbage on the side a seafood mixed grill included buttery crosshatched sea scallops , tuna that had been on the fires a bit too long , and moist salmon if pressed to choose a top dessert here , it would be the warm semisweet chocolate torte afloat on a pond of chocolate sauce runnerup would be the apple tart with an airy and buttery puffpastry crust cherry clafouti was rich and custardy and full of ripe fruit , and the splendid grand marnier souffle was big enough for three crepes souffles , another dish rarely seen these days , is a beltstretching delight two crepes puffed up with cointreau sabayon surrounded by creme anglaise indeed , the economy is bad and could

omaha , dec 27 when senator bob kerrey of nebraska introduced a bill last summer calling for the government to provide comprehensive health insurance for all americans , he said the runaway costs of health care were severely hampering the nation s businesses , forcing them to choose between providing jobs and providing medical coverage for their employees senator kerrey , a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination , knows firsthand the predicament he described he and his brotherinlaw own a chain of nine restaurants and three health clubs here in omaha and in lincoln , neb , and most of the employees cannot get health insurance through the kerrey companies the companies do offer health coverage to fulltime employees but fulltimers account for a small proportion of the companies' total work force senator kerrey s brotherinlaw , dean f rasmussen , president of the restaurant company , grandmother s inc , estimates that only 75 to 100 of the company s 700 to 800 restaurant employees get health insurance through the company david k putensen , general manager of operations at the three health clubs , says only 25 to 30 of the 300 employees have employerprovided health insurance most of our employees are vulnerable to the high cost of health care , and they are just as unshielded as a turtle without its shell , said mr putensen we 're doing the best we can , and it s none too good many parttime workers mr kerrey has emphasized health care as the central issue of his presidential campaign , and he often cites his business experience as evidence of his leadership ability investment in the right of every american to quality health care is a cornerstone of his political platform but his own businesses have not made a major investment in health care for their workers mr kerrey and his brotherinlaw founded the restaurant chain in 1973 with the help of two other men the senator is chairman of the company , and now owns 35 percent of it the restaurants make heavy use of parttime workers , including many high school and college students but the restaurants do not offer health insurance coverage to such parttime employees , who work as waiters , hostesses , cashiers and food preparers it would be exorbitantly expensive , mr rasmussen said in an interview at his office here local union leaders say mr kerrey is being hypocritical , or at least inconsistent , when he advocates a national health insurance plan , including coverage of doctors' services , hospital care and nursing home care when he s campaigning he gives the impression that he is for the bluecollar worker , but he does n't even treat his own employees right , said jenny brown , vice president of the local hotel employees and restaurant employees union mr rasmussen said he would prefer that his employees not be interviewed , and the employees generally declined to discuss their health insurance arrangements a woman in her 20 s who works at a waitress at one of the restaurants , insisting on anonymity , said she was applying for jobs at other restaurants where she could get higher wages and health insurance coverage but thomas c nielsen , an 18yearold cook , said he enjoyed working 20 to 30 hours a week at a grandmother s restaurant in lincoln mr nielsen , a freshman at the university of nebraska said he was in perfect health and was covered under his parents' health insurance policy business experience cited mr kerrey says his experience as a businessman demonstrates why he wants to uncouple health care coverage from employment and why he wants to establish the federal government as the principal payer of all medical bills i do n't think it s hypocritical at all , the senator said in an interview today as a smallbusiness man , i know from experience how difficult it is to get health care on an affordable basis for employees what would be hypocritical , he said , is if he opposed national health insurance after receiving free medical care from the government as a disabled vietnam veteran and subsidized care as a united states senator nationwide , 34 million people have no health insurance of this number , 19 million are working adults , and 10 million more live in families headed by workers labor law violations as a candidate , mr kerrey has often complained of government inertia , asserting , for example , that the labor department fails to protect workers but on dec 17 , the labor department said the senator s restaurants had violated child labor laws by flouting limits on the hours that could be worked by employees 14 or 15 years of age the government said the violations involved seven of mr kerrey s restaurants and 116 employees , or about 15 percent of the restaurants' work force the labor department assessed civil penalties of 64 , 650 against the restaurants mr rasmussen acknowledged that we were in violation in numerous instances he said most of the violations had occurred on friday evenings , when the restaurants were busy and 15yearold employees continued working beyond 7 pm under federal regulations , children under 16 are not supposed to work before 7 am or after 7 pm on fridays or other school days
onda among the scores of restaurateurs who are trying to reel in elusive patrons with the alluring bait of economy , len allison and karen hubert may be the most eccentric the former owners of huberts on park avenue , which closed last year , moved downtown to smaller and less costly quarters , hired a barebones staff and opened a restaurant that defies a simple label what do you call a place that on one menu offers shrimp with radish pudding and chinese sausage , goat cheese lasagna , indonesianstyle vealshank stew , and roast chicken with lemon the united nations \? they call it onda the mahoganylined rectangular dining room is as offbeat as the food bronze candle sconces and little religious paintings line the walls while the shirelles coo over the sound system wellspaced tables are draped in paper , reinforcing the relaxed theme servers are casually attired , taking a cue from the gregarious manager , who comes to your table wearing a plaid sport shirt , a nascent beard and a little gold fish dangling from one ear hey , this place could be fun and it is fun if you order the right dishes , but doing that takes some investigation many of the menu items have two prices , one as an appetizer , one as a main course this is a good idea for those who like to mix and match an appetizer of sauteed tenderloin of pork is pleasing , the thin slices of meat served on skewers with a spicy peanut sauce and a cooling cucumber salad roasted peanuts resurface in a melange of chinese ricestick noodles with butterflied shrimp , tofu and bean sprouts it s a lively combination , on the sweet side , with good textural contrast the sweet tooth is sated again in the softshell crabs with a sweethot sauce of fish stock , sake , red pepper and chili pepper a nice communal munchie is the crisply fried baby calamari with pungent tamarind sauce pastas also can be a starter or a main course lasagna with sundried tomatoes , bound with a mortar of dense goat cheese , was too heavy and assertive you might instead try the pansotti , a ligurian ravioli that is filled with spinach and enlivened with a pastelike sauce of ground walnuts and herbs onda has a small but wellselected wine inventory prices are very modest across the board you might try the fruity , dry 1988 chinon from domaine de la chapellerie \( 19 \) with succulent roasted quails that are oddly paired with a chinatownstyle egg roll filled with cabbage , carrots and chinese greens roasted chicken with a parsley puree under the skin , asparagus and lemon garnish is deftly done it is crisp outside and moist within , sitting in a clear lemony broth another good choice is a twist on osso buco , sinewy but tender veal shank with a rich , sweetish caramelized onion sauce and toasted polenta sticks the indelicate indonesian vealshank stew , however , is overpowered by coconut milk the chinesestyle roasted duck is probably the best effort of all , served with bok choy and water chestnuts seafood does not fare so well fried red snapper thai style with scallops and roasted sweet pepper is colorful but bland , and the highly perfumed steamed flounder with ginger and scallion has nothing over what might be served at a runofthemill cantonese restaurant the ingenuous summer desserts are more fun than throwing your sister into a swimming pool the banana splits reminded me of my teenage pigouts on a jersey shore boardwalk , and the hot fudge sundae is just as excessive , sans bananas chocolate rum espresso cheesecake is every bit as iniquitous as it sounds lemon pound cake was crumbly dry on one tasting , better the next time onda s funky international approach to budget dining may not be to everyone s taste but if the idea of a culinary cook s tour intrigues you , it can be recommended andiamo when andiamo opened in 1987 , it was the biggest thing to hit the lincoln center area since luciano pavarotti first strolled up to the footlights this stagy northern italian restaurant boasted a firstrate chef , an energetic staff and a stylish loft setting nearly four years later , it is still going at a relatively brisk pace the original chef , frank crispo , moved on last year and was replaced by his second , gregory godon mr godon s menu is similar in style to his predecesor s , if perhaps just a little less consistent andiamo is hidden down a corridor behind a casual streetfront spot called cafe bel canto , under the same ownership at the entrance is a soaring loft with a balcony reached by an iron staircase track lights illuminate abstract paintings , and a papiermache saloon pianist is frozen in midsong on a wide platform at the back of the room tables are generously separated , and conversation tends to float away in this soaring space nonsmokers may be pleased to know that smoking is prohibited anywhere in the restaurant two upbeat starters are the mussels steamed in a subtle tomatocream broth , and the mild , beefytasting venison carpaccio , which is seared outside , then sliced and served with tomatoes , red onions , cucumbers and provolone fried calamari , served over mixed greens and deepfried spinach , would have been fine had they not lingered backstage too long , arriving flaccid
lakehead , calif , july 19 as a stinking , bubbling glob of spilled pesticide sinks slowly into california s largest reservoir , people who live along the wooded shoreline want to know why so little seems to be understood about it , nearly a week after it spilled from a derailed train the unanswered questions are urgent not just in this stunningly scenic woodland , in the shadow of mount shasta near the california border , but all over california will the chemicals in shasta lake disperse or remain condensed \? how quickly will they reach shasta dam , at the southern end of the lake 11 miles away \? in a state already parched by drought , will the chemicals endanger the drinking water that flows from the dam into the state s water supply \? and how will they affect the health of an area that depends on its pristine environment for pure water and for the fish , deer and hiking trails that draw tens of thousands of tourists a year \? for now , it is clear that the pesticide has been deadly to everything it has touched jim pedri , supervising engineer for the california regional water quality control board s central valley office , called it the worst chemicalenvironmental disaster inland in california history finding dead fish now that the spill has entered the reservoir , officials said today they were taking more aggressive action , pumping out some areas of heavy concentrations of the pesticide and pumping in air elsewhere to disperse the spill and speed its decomposition on friday , testers in motorboats , wearing gas masks and rubber gloves , scooped some of the tens of thousands of dead fish from the water s surface but officials said they were still conducting analyses to determine how the chemical would affect wildlife and whether drinking water would be contaminated they do not know how long the chemicals take to decompose or what their longterm health risks are i think it s kind of tight that they could n't figure out right at the beginning what was going on , said sean harrington , a waiter in one of the resorts around the shasta lake reservoir , 175 miles northeast of san francisco it s weird this is the 20th century , is n't it \? the spill occurred sunday , when seven cars of a 97car freight train of the southern pacific transportation company slipped off the track in a steep canyon a tanker car tumbled into the sacramento river 45 miles north of the lake and ruptured , spilling up to 19 , 500 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium the chemical is marketed under the name vapam it is used to rid soil of weeds , nematodes and insects before planting several crops , including fruits , vegetables and cotton chemicals in suspension the chemical blob , now about half a mile long and 200 yards wide , entered the northern branch of the reservoir on wednesday , and is now suspended in 40 feet of water in the lake , which supplies drinking water throughout california , the effects of the drought are all too plain the water level has sunk to 547 billion gallons , about 55 percent of its capacity , leaving a vast , stark strip of naked red earth and rock around its rim officials said the lower water level only made the spill s effect worse attorney general dan lungren said friday that he would file a lawsuit over the spill , and his spokesman said the railroad company was likely to be one defendant a spokesman for the railroad said the cause of the accident had not been determined but said that it might have been less likely if the train had had an extra locomotive at the rear a second locomotive can help prevent the slack that can lead to a derailment this week the company added these extra locomotives to similar trains on the route criticism of federal officials other criticisms have focused on the fact that the pesticide was not listed as a regulated substance by the federal department of transportation and that , therefore , precautions were not taken regulated substances are carried in doublehulled tanker cars and information on the handling of the substances is furnished to train crews at a news conference in san francisco on friday , william k reilly , administrator of the federal environmental protection agency , said the spill should occasion a review of the nation s pesticide regulations , which he called totally anachronistic some of the residents of the tiny town of dunsmuir , where the spill occurred , were evacuated , and about 200 people were treated in local hospitals for symptoms that included nausea , headaches , eye irritations , rashes and respiratory complaints then , to the growing agitation of residents , officials watched , tested and issued warnings , but took no action to combat the spill as it swirled downstream , giving off the stink of rotten eggs and killing all aquatic life in its path dragonflies , mayflies , mosquitoes and fish , including at least 100 , 000 rare , aggressive rainbow trout sight of dying fish as the spill flowed downriver , hundreds of fish could be seen churning the smooth surface ahead of it , leaping into the air , flapping and dying charlie jakobs , a fire captain with the california department of forestry , said it was understandable that residents were frightened and angry when officials were unable to give them quick answers or to take quick action the scientists just do n't know what this much volume of this chemical in this much water will do , he said peter bontadelli , director of the state department of fish and game , said how could we possibly know how it would react \? we thought it would sink , but it s suspended now it s a landbased chemical , not waterbased that s the problem with all this knowledge we have , there are still gaps in what we know years until recovery as the week drew to an end , the moss along the banks of the sacramento river began to turn brown and the indian rhubarb plants to curl up and wilt biologists said the possibility that willows , oaks and alders along the riverbank might also die could greatly extend the current 10year estimate for the river s return to full vigor so far , scientists have found no confirmation that the otters , deer , beaver , raccoons or bears , or the birds including bald eagles , that feed along the river have been affected now that the spill has passed , the river is running clear , clean and empty of life residents have returned to their homes and officials have stopped advising travelers to roll up their windows as they pass by on interstate 5 but signs are still posted warning no swimming no drinking do n't touch the water ! and the summer tourists on whom much of the economy depends are staying away at dunsmuir , jan garrigus , owner of the splash of color clothing store , said , as far as business goes , there really is none but the summer activities of boating , fishing , water skiing and houseboat rentals continued around most of the 365mile perimeter of shasta lake photo testers wearing gas masks and rubber gloves , removing some of the tens of thousands of dead fish from shasta lake , in lakehead , calif , on friday a train derailment on july 14 caused 19 , 500 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium to spill into the sacramento river , which feeds the lake \( jim wilson the new york times \) \( pg 14 \) map of california , indicating shasta lake
they fly to the next gig or the next game , to the next political rally or the next board meeting another day , another town , and another ride in a corporate jet , chartered plane , helicopter or whatever other conveyance seems convenient , sometimes regardless of risk when their planes crash , the headlines name another musician , politician or athlete killed in an aviation accident will rogers , knute rockne , otis redding , hale boggs , rocky marciano , thurman munson , rick nelson and john g tower , to name just a few the song american pie memorializes the crash in february 1959 that killed buddy holly , ritchie valens and j p \( the big bopper \) richardson because they are busy and prosperous , prominent people often fly in planes not operated by major airlines by doing so , accident statistics show , they increase their chances of crashing senator john heinz and the band that played behind the country singer reba mcentire are recent examples of busy travelers flying through hectic schedules who may not have fully understood the risks and who died in crashes on march 16 , when eight members of the mcentire entourage were killed taking off from san diego , they were on a plane owned not by the charter company they had paid to rush them to their next engagement , but rather by an airplane sales company the federal aviation administration is investigating whether it was a violation of its rules for an air charter company to use a plane being flown as a sales demonstration in fulfilling a commercial contract to carry passengers when senator heinz , a trained recreational pilot , booked the services of lycoming air services to fly him around pennsylvania during the april congressional recess , his staff , following senate custom , requested a twoengine plane with two pilots on board , federal aviation investigators said as it turned out , the captain of the piper aerostar had flown just nine hours as pilot in command of that kind of airplane , and never before with a copilot , the investigators said he had flown only 34 hours , and his copilot just 26 hours , in the past three months while nothing in this violated regulations , aviation experts say the pairing of two pilots with little recent experience is worrisome when problems with the landing gear developed , the crew tried a difficult maneuver , allowing a helicopter to fly nearby to inspect their plane the two craft collided , killing all five people on board and two children on the ground incidents like these are a reminder that even though federal regulations have grown stricter and aviation has grown safer , crashes continue to plague the industry , especially outside the major airlines checking with the experts the risks of such accidents stem from many causes older and smaller planes , less experienced pilots , fewer federal inspections and pressures brought by demanding customers who want to fly even when the weather is bad despite the risks , many people still take a haphazard approach to selecting how to fly not quite as random as hailing the next cab on the street , but often without much more research than a glance at the yellow pages federal officials said the risks could be lowered if travelers took steps to check the credentials , experience and proficiency of those providing the transportation this could be done by buying the plane and hiring the pilots , a step taken by sports teams and big corporations or an agent could examine the credentials of the company or individual providing air transportation or the client might simply call the nearest office of the federal aviation administration , which keeps records on every plane , every pilot and every aviation company in the country michael harrington , a senior official in the flight standards branch of the faa , said the agency welcomed inquiries from people wondering if the company or individual providing air service to them was qualified folks should remember that the faa is here , he said if there is some question , or you think there is a gimmick involved , call the faa we are happy to respond we have n't done a very good job of advertising that taking the company jet a fulltime crew pays off in safety the best way to control the risks of flying may be to own the airplane and hire a fulltime professional crew to fly it although corporate aviation is expensive , over the years it has become the safest way to fly four years ago the detroit pistons , now champions in the national basketball association , broke ground when they bought their own beechcraft bac111 the plane s flight and maintenance crews are on the team s payroll it s nice to know your own mechanic and crew , said dusty graves , manager of the pistons' flight department that way you 're confident the next time you go up we do have a few whiteknuckle fliers , and i think they feel safer on this than a commercial flight since 1980 , flying a corporate plane with a fulltime pilot has gone from being nine times riskier than flying a big airline , to a record that equals and even exceeds that of the major airlines , federal statistics show in the music world , too , a new safety consciousness seems to be taking hold , in part because the stars are the linchpin of a 95 billionayear industry
gramercy park , an elegant square where patricians and artists share quiet brownstones and keys to a private park , has long been known as the bloomsbury of new york residents consider it an oasis , the last vestige of a gentler era that edith wharton , who grew up in the neighborhood , once described as the safe daylight world of nice people and reputable doings except that lately , some of the nicest people in gramercy park are accusing each other of doings that are utterly disreputable charges of election fraud , slander , threats and worst of all a breach of good manners and fair play , have caused a group of residents to rise up against the gramercy park trustees a select and selfselecting group that clings jealously to its sovereignty over keys to the park and the planting of flowers and shrubs even harsher words have pitted tenants of the national arts club at 15 gramercy park against club officers the dispute , which began over a 5 , 000fee imposed by the trustees on each property owner , is not about money or even the placement of tulips to some , it is about change , an unwelcome word in a neighborhood that prides itself , as one resident put it , in preserving what used to be 'like that iraq affair' it is about human nature and power , said constance d gibson , the 85yearold chairwoman of the board , whose own absolute power is being contested , gingerly she spoke in airy bryn mawr tones of the insurrection it is something like that iraq affair iraq wants to get in as a leader and so does the us , and both are having a very gloomy time it is also about mrs gibson s protege , steven u leitner , a florida realestate developer who recently became a trusteeelect of the park and whose combative personality and fierce , open politicking have driven appalled residents to court to fight his ascension mr leitner refused to be interviewed for this article mr leitner , who lives at the national arts club , is also involved in lawsuits there his allies defend him as a victim of prejudice an outsider resented by oldfashioned residents but his critics paint him as a kind of zero mostel figure from the movie the producers , ingratiating himself with elderly women and bullying rivals to further his own ends the challenge to mrs gibson s authority began last winter gramercy park s 60some property owners were dismayed when the trustees assessed the cost of repairing the bluestone sidewalk around the park at 5 , 000 each for the first time in decades , a group of property owners held an election last march to fill vacancies on the board membership had recently dwindled to two from five mrs gibson and frances munnell a second election the trustees and their lawyers contested that election , and both sides agreed to hold another months later , after a sequence of maneuvers by the trustees and mr leitner that many residents described in their lawsuit as improper , three different trustees were elected , none of whom were among the dissidents' first choices mr leitner was one of them all of a sudden , these people show all this interest in the park , said robert de benedictis , a leader of the gramercy neighborhood association i did n't see them out on 'clean and green' he was referring to a day of rigorous gardening , which along with the annual flower show , is a hallowed park tradition mr de benedictis was also dismayed that nancy zuger , the leading plaintiff in the suit , had not been elected she is a member of community board no 6 and a vassar graduate , he said , who better to protect our interests \? the property owners won a temporary restraining order prohibiting the new trustees from taking office until the lawsuit is resolved changing of the keys a secret society was formed , gramercy residents for integrity of the park , also known as grip , which circulated passionate manifestoes documenting such lapses in moral integrity as campaigning too strenuously and outright cheating grip membership remains anonymous people are afraid to come out against the trusteeselect publicly , said one grip member who declined to be identified , for fear that their keys to the park will be taken away fiercely coveted keys to the park are changed once a year people copy them and loan them to their friends , mrs gibson explained and we ca n't have that , can we \? mr leitner , who is jewish , circulated a letter from one of his adversaries that he complained was antisemitic this dismayed even his supporters , who shrank from the thought that their neighborhood might harbor such unattractive sentiments i felt it was really one man speaking for himself and not for the community , said rabbi irving j bloch , whose brotherhood synagogue on gramercy park covers several lots rabbi bloch , who supports mrs gibson s leadership , described her generosity toward his congregation with the kind of reverence that william collins , the clergyman in pride and prejudice , reserved for his patroness , lady catherine de bourgh 'very , very generous'
when patrick ewing was beginning his second season with the knicks in the fall of 1986 , hubie brown wanted him to play power forward on the hot seat , the coach needed a competitive start by his team to save his job he decided his best chance was to have the immobile bill cartwright play in the middle , with the far more athletic ewing chasing the smaller , quicker power forwards tactically speaking , this was n't really an illogical deployment , except that ewing wanted no part of it and ewing , not brown , was the future of the franchise ewing had been raised to be a center critics hailed him as the second coming of bill russell , not ralph sampson , and no selfrespecting 7footer could let himself be moved from his pedestal in the low post in this confrontation of egos , brown pitted his basketball logic and coaching principle against ewing s 10year , 33million contract the coach lost the battle , ewing s attention , too many games , and soon after , his job that brings us to the nets s bill fitch , who last night sunk lower into the same bunker that brown fell into in 1986 , as the nets disintegrated again in the fourth quarter and lost to the knicks , 10294 , at madison square garden fitch s prize rookie , kenny anderson , played just 13 minutes and afterward appeared ready to make a federal case out of it that s just ridiculous , anderson said they drafted me no 2 , i thought i 'd at least be out there i thought at least 20 , 25 minutes i could see it if we were winning and i was n't playing anderson , unfortunately for fitch , has somehow convinced himself that all of his problems in a difficult transition to the national basketball association are about minutes he missed all of training camp due to a contract dispute , reported finally as the team s backup at the position to incumbent mookie blaylock and , despite recent benchings , still has averaged a very respectable 224 minutes i ai n't getting the opportunity , he said while most players have a difficult time admitting their personal failures , no crime in itself , anderson s statements underscore the lack of maturity this 21yearold has demonstrated in making his oncourt choices there has been enough opportunity for him to launch 198 shots , more than twothirds of the 282 shots blaylock has taken in slightly more than half the minutes in anderson s 417 minutes , he has turned the ball over 42 times in blaylock s 797 minutes , he has 53 turnovers on a small handful of nights , anderson has been electric , a peek at what the nets hope will be their future more often he has been a coach s nightmare , an incessant dribbler into turnovers and poorpercentage shots he is shooting 359 percent but has shown little desire in backing off , as greg anthony granted , a lesser talent has done with the knicks anderson certainly has the ability to make the spectacular pass but even here , he seldom distinguishes between making a brilliant snap pass to the capable derrick coleman from foolishly attempting a similar connection with the clumsy chris dudley we 've got to realize that we 're not going to get from kenny this season what we might 've gotten had he been with us for training camp or if we 'd drafted an older player , said willis reed , the team s senior vice president so what s a coach , particularly one whose job clock is rigged with ticking explosives , supposed to do \? judging from the most recent games , including last night s 1for6 shooting , oneassist performance , the frustrated fitch appears to be more inclined to stick to his principle a player , he reasons , can learn by watching , too it is true that by playing anderson consistent minutes , fitch right now is giving himself less of a chance to win yet an unhappy , unproductive anderson , earning close to 3 million per year for the next five years , is n't going to help fitch keep whatever support still remains for him within the organization no question , fitch has been dealt a lousy hand this war he finds himself in is a coach s vietnam needing to succeed now , he would have preferred to live with blaylock at the point and to have drafted a player who could offer the nets immediate help at small forward when management cut reserve swing man jud buechler out from under him , it was a clear signal to the students that the teacher no longer had the support of the school board fitch could no longer win he now appears to have two choices be bitter as the clock winds down and stick to his principle , or become the good corporate soldier and do what s right for the team s future the right thing , according to the payroll , is kenny anderson no matter how much anderson plays , this bunch is not going anywhere but back to the lottery all they stand to gain from this season is valuable experience for their young players , and none are more needy than anderson all that s gained by having him sit is having him retake the course a year from now win or lose , layup or air ball , assist or turnover , night in , night out , the kid just has to play
detroit , nov 12 the six major democratic presidential contenders vied for support before the aflcio convention here today , pledging their commitment to the unemployed and the economically squeezed , hammering president bush and promising drastic new measures to spur economic growth senator tom harkin of iowa seemed to be the emotional favorite of the crowd , judging from the frequency and decibel level of applause when he railed against scabhiring employers and promised to be a friend of labor in the white house but many officials here said the race for organized labor was still wide open , particularly since it is unclear whether gov mario m cuomo of new york will seek the democratic nomination what was clear was the elated mood among labor officials after last week s democratic victory in the pennsylvania senate race it was widely seen here as vindication for a labororiented message particularly the healthcare issue and a sign of new possibilities in the 1992 presidential race we 've got some very acceptable candidates and they 're all singing from the hymn book now , since pennsylvania middleclass , economic populism , said frank garrison , president of the michigan aflcio , alluding to senator harris wofford s sound defeat of former attorney general dick thornburgh last tuesday videotaped for membership indeed , the candidates spent considerable time preaching to the choir today , assailing the bush administration s handling of the economy , calling for major investments in roads and bridges , for instance , and urging a new emphasis on education and job training the candidates' forum was videotaped and will be circulated throughout the 89 affiliated unions of the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations a crucial component of the democratic nominating process gov bill clinton of arkansas outlined a plan to jump start the economy that included extending unemployment benefits , cutting the interest rates on credit cards , expanding mortgage availability and cutting taxes on the middle class mr clinton has some critics among the ranks of organized labor , stemming , in part , from his days as head of the democratic leadership council , a group that has often faulted the party for seeming out of touch with middle america and too much in thrall of constituent groups like organized labor today , mr clinton told the more than 700 labor delegates here , we wo n't always agree , but if i'm your president , we 'll be full partners in restoring the middle class and america s greatness after the forum , david wilhelm , the clinton campaign manager , said , we stayed true to our message , we did n't pander , and we made some friends edmund g brown jr , the former governor of california , used the forum to highlight his message , turning nearly every question into a relentless attack on modern politics and the influence of special interest money upon it while none matched him in vehemence , others candidates took time to rail against washington today , reflecting the new popularity of outsider campaigns senator bob kerrey of nebraska , who is trying to cast himself as the changeoriented candidate , argued that there was a life and death struggle occurring among working people increasingly squeezed by the recession he used the forum to highlight his plan to provide universal health care , which he asserted was at the heart of much of the nation s economic strain wilder on fiscal care gov l douglas wilder of virginia , whose message often centers around fiscal responsibility , was striking a different tone today he accused republicans of conducting a decade of code word politics that has exacerbated racial divisions but he also criticized democrats who suggest the party has grown too close to minorities and labor former senator paul e tsongas of massachusetts , who is trying to position himself as a probusiness liberal , was the only candidate today who said he would oppose a bill now at the top of organized labor s agenda , a measure that would outlaw the hiring of permanent replacements for striking workers mr tsongas sought to use today s forum to present himself as the candidate with a detailed plan to rebuild the nation s manufacturing base and halt the country s economic decline it was mr harkin who made the most fullthroated appeal to labor today i come from labor , he said i'm proud of labor , and i'm proud of what labor s done for america and i wo n't just take your money and your support and then treat you like some illegitimate cousin many labor officials here said they were doubtful that the aflcio would reach an early endorsement of a candidate for the nomination

washington , march 4 hundreds of articles , scores of scholarly papers and more than a dozen fulllength books have been written in the last two years alone on the causes of the savings and loan mess but they were not authoritative enough for congress on the night of saturday , oct 27 , just before adjournment of the 101st congress , without a recorded vote and almost unnoticed in the press , the lawmakers established a commission to study the savings and loan issue the national commission on financial institution reform , recovery and enforcement at a cost of 1 million , the commission will take its place beside the interamerican tropical tuna commission , the ukraine famine commission and who knows how many other panels that have been set up because congress wanted to do something and did not know what nothing much has happened since the law was passed the commission is supposed to have eight private citizens as members two appointed by the president , two by the senate democratic leadership , two by the house democratic leadership and one each by the senate and house republican leadership none have been named yet , and the 1 million has not been appropriated what with the war and everything else , people have been busy , and this has not been on a fast track , said representative charles e schumer , a brooklyn democrat who was the house sponsor still , a law is a law treasury secretary nicholas f brady said last week that he had submitted the names of potential commission members to the white house the congressional leaders said they were working on it \( house speaker thomas s foley has a staff assistant whose fulltime job is to find people for the slots on more than 150 commissions and boards he is responsible for filling \) sooner or later the panel members will be appointed , the money will be allocated , a staff will be formed and office space will be found after nine months , the life span of the panel set by the law , the commissioners will call a news conference and distribute a thick report the findings are entirely predictable in brief , economic circumstances in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s , particularly unusually high interest rates , made the savings and loans unprofitable they were saddled with longterm , lowinterest mortgage loans at a time when they were forced to pay high rates to depositors to keep them in business , congress , which was unusually tight with some of the lobbyists and operators , changed the rules and permitted savings and loans to get into risky areas like commercial real estate and junk bonds meanwhile , the state and federal regulatory agencies were understaffed and illequipped the reagan administration preferred not to intervene in unpleasant economic problems , saying the free market should be allowed to take its course but freemarket principles did not apply federal deposit insurance meant that the government and not the operators of the savings and loans bore most of the financial risk so when speculative deals went sour , sometimes because of incompetence and sometimes because of corruption , the taxpayers were left holding the bag , to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in other words , there is plenty of blame to go around administration officials say they will cooperate with the commission , though they see it as a pain in the neck it s going to take an enormous amount of everyone s time , collecting documents and preparing testimony , and in the end they 're just going to come up with what everyone already knows , said one official so why yet another commission \? surely , the lawmakers would have accomplished more and earned more political credit if they had used the 1 million , say , to hire more clerks at understaffed unemployment offices mr schumer and senator christopher j dodd , democrat of connecticut , one of the chief senate sponsors , say their primary motive was to get an authoritative report that would persuade their colleagues that allowing banks to enter new businesses would not run the risk of another savings and loan disaster but even the sponsors' enthusiasm seems to have waned i do n't consider it to be one of my monumental legislative accomplishments , said senator dodd

chicago , aug 12 dwight gooden s stare in the locker room today was n't one of scorn or even heartfelt disappointment those emotions had faded over the last month , when the mets pleaded no contest after being offered a fair fight by the slipping pirates no , the look , shocking to see in a man with a career record in the major leagues of 13152 , was the one that was worn by every other met after today s 32 failure in 10 innings against the cubs it was the look of a loser perhaps it was indelicate to say , but it was unavoidable to notice and record of course , gooden , with a 126 record this season and with another solid seven innings of work registered against the cubs earlier in the afternoon , did n't deserve to wear that look but he was a member of the mets , and the look , like his cap and his shirt , was now a part of the organization s uniform i look around the clubhouse , at the guys we have , said gooden i never thought we 'd play this badly the mets , who are now a game removed from falling into fourth place in the national league east , today lost their eighth straight game to the cubs , completing the rare capitulation of being swept in a pair of fourgame series in barely more than a week the defeat , their 16th in the last 20 games , left the mets eight games behind the pirates in the national league east and one game ahead of the 5655 cubs ca n't say it s over until it s over , said gooden but , shoot , it does n't look good the finishing touches on gooden s grim vision were applied in the 10th inning today , and they were replete with all the absurd touches the club has specialized in doug dascenzo , the parttime outfielder for the cubs who had n't had a hit since the allstar game break , broke out of his 0for32 slump with a sharp leadoff single against reliever tim burke then doug simons , the rookie lefthanded reliever who has combined ineffectiveness with inexperience , came on to yield a sacrifice to chico walker , the lone man he faced before being replaced by jeff innis the righthanded innis then went to 22 in the count against jerome walton , the backup outfielder with a 234 average who was sent up to pinchhit for ced landrum the next pitch was a fastball , and walton smoked it past innis and into center field for the victory i wish i 'd thrown another pitch i wish i 'd thrown that pitch somewhere else , said innis i wish anything would have happened but what did his was a refrain that has echoed through the mets' clubhouse for weeks these four defeats only added further distressing entries to the club s catalogue of recent failures there was david cone s latest unraveling on the mound in friday s 54 loss , the third time in four starts that cone had failed to last past the fourth inning there was tim burke s disposal of wally whitehurst s five shutout innings in saturday s 62 defeat burke , the official loser again today , gave up five runs in one and twothirds innings on saturday there was the mets' inability to get a run over 11 straight innings in sunday s 14inning , 32 loss , including failing to score with the bases loaded and none out in the fourth another kick in the teeth , manager bud harrelson said after sunday night s loss holes in the bats today s wounds were equally deep and familiarly selfinflicted the mets , after scoring a run against mike bielecki on mackey sasser s single in the second , managed only a single run after posting men at first and third with none out in the fifth the mets then brought their bats and nothing else to the plate for the next five innings bielecki and les lancaster combined to retire the last 17 mets in a row you do n't get hits when it counts , and you do n't win , said harrelson ditto , ditto , ditto , ditto for the four games the mets , in a reprise of their offensive ineptitude from early in the season , scored 10 runs in the four games , only six over the last three over the last 20 games , the mets have averaged a paltry 265 runs per game this is as bad as i could have imagined it could get , said hubie brooks , who was on the bench because of his slump and who struck out in his appearance as a pinchhitter and there ai n't no excuses hitting \?

united nations , nov 21 boutros ghali , egypt s 69year old deputy prime minister , was unanimously recommended to become the next united nations secretary general by the 15 members of the security council tonight and appeared set to win final approval from the 166nation general assembly mr ghali would become the first arab and the first person from africa to hold the top post at the united nations he would replace javier perez de cuellar of peru , who has said he wants to step down at the end of this year after serving two fiveyear terms in the post the council closed ranks to give mr ghali its unanimous endorsement tonight after 11 members had cast their ballots in his favor on an earlier vote and none of the five members with permanent seats the united states , britain , france , the soviet union and china used a veto four members abstained votes for rivals mr ghali s two closest rivals for the 185 , 000 post , zimbabwe s finance minister , bernard chidzero , and olusegun obasanjo , a former nigerian head of state , each got seven votes in this first official council ballot , or two less than the nine needed to force a runoff against mr ghali no general assembly vote was immediately scheduled , but diplomats said approval is a foregone conclusion in view of the security council s unanimous endorsement and the fact that he was one of six official african candidates nominated for the post by the organization of african unity and endorsed by the 106member nonaligned movement campaign for african african countries had mounted a successful campaign to choose one of their own as the next secretary general but during the political maneuvering that led up to tonight s vote , several black african diplomats made clear that they preferred a black african over mr ghali i'm very glad we have a new secretary general and that no negative votes were cast against him , france s united nations representative , jeanbernard merimee , said as members left the closeddoor meeting britain s representative , sir david hannay , described the choice as excellent though he declined to say whether britain voted for him on the first secret ballot he said the result showed the security council has entered a new era because no vetoes were cast during the selection process in 1981 when the floor was littered with vetoes egypt s united nations representative , nabil elaraby , said it was a great day for africa , for the third world and for my own country mr ghali , a coptic christian , is fluent in french , english and arabic question raised on age although the united states and britain both voted to recommend mr ghali to the general assembly this evening , american and british officials were saying openly until a few days ago that they felt he was too old for the job and that they would prefer a younger candidate , able to serve two terms mr ghali , who is only a year younger than mr perez de cuellar , has said he is seeking the post for just a single fiveyear term until recently american and british officials , and to a lesser extent those from the soviet union , also appeared opposed to any of the declared african candidates they complained that none of them had the stature and political experience they felt the next secretary general needs in the postcoldwar world when the united nations is playing an increasingly important role in world affairs instead , they said , the security council should headhunt the world to find the best qualified man or woman but african countries insisted they had qualified candidates for the post and said that one of these should be chosen because africa is the only major region of the world which has not yet provided a secretary general 3 were from europe of the five previous secretaries general , three trygve lie of norway , dag hammarskjold of sweden and kurt waldheim of austria were europeans , while u thant of burma , now myanmar , came from asia and mr perez de cuellar from the western hemisphere france supported mr ghali from the start , while china made clear that it favored an african candidate faced with this opposition , the united states and britain appeared to change their attitude in recent days , diplomats say , apparently deciding that they could not prevent the election of an african secretary general without severely damaging their political relations with the continent and that they could live with mr ghali in an informal straw poll on nov 11 , mr chidzero emerged as the frontrunner with 11 votes , followed by mr ghali with 10 and mr obasanjo with 8 but by tonight mr ghali had moved into a decisive lead diplomats suggested that once the united states realized that an african secretary general was inevitable , it favored mr ghali because he was the most sympathetic to its interests and was only seeking a single term although the first ballot was secret , some diplomats also suspect that britain , perhaps the united states and two or more of the council s african members were the four that abstained when mr ghali s name was put to the vote the security council currently has three african members , the ivory coast , zimbabwe and zaire in addition to the permanent members , the remaining nations with seats on the council are austria , belgium , romania , india , yemen , cuba and ecuador mr chidzero , a respected technician who sought successfully to dissuade zimbabwe s white farmers from fleeing blackmajority rule at independence , presided over an economy dominated by large governmentowned corporations some diplomats suspect the united states was one of the two countries that voted against him tonight , while another six abstained among the other candidates , kenneth k s dadzie , a united nations official from ghana , received 6 votes , with 4 security council members voting against him and 5 abstaining michel doo kingue , a united nations official from cameroon , received 6 votes , with 4 against and 5 abstaining james jonah , a united nations official from sierra leone , got 5 votes , with 5 against and 5 abstaining , and msanze terrence , a former burundi diplomat , got 4 votes , with 4 against and 7 abstaining the leading nonafrican candidate , foreign minister hans van den broek of the netherlands , got only 5 votes , with 7 against and 3 abstaining prince sadruddin aga khan , the united nations official in charge of persian gulf war relief efforts , received 4 votes , with 7 against and 4 abstaining nguema francois owono , a gabonese official , was supported by 3 members , with 3 against and 9 abstentions norway s foreign minister , thorvald stoltenberg , got just 2 votes , with 9 against and 4 abstentions , while the country s prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , fared even worse ,

washington , nov 26 in the hours before congress was to begin its thanksgiving recess , lawmakers worked today to resolve differences on a slimmeddown banking bill that would provide new money for the bank insurance fund , as the administration had asked but the bill included none of the broad changes in the halfcenturyold laws governing the banking industry that the white house proposed in february by late in the afternoon , house and senate negotiators had agreed to drop provisions in the senate bill that would have eased barriers to interstate banking the interstate banking measure had been the last significant white house recommendation left measure bogs down but the bill bogged down in the evening over a variety of smaller provisions that would give regulators greater authority to take over weak institutions and limit the insurance coverage on bank deposits sold by wall street investment houses the key provision of the legislation emerging from the conference committee tonight would provide an increase to 30 billion , from 5 billion , in the credit line that the federal deposit insurance corporation has with the treasury the loans would be repaid through higher premiums paid by banks to the fund the legislation would also provide tens of billions of dollars more in loans that would be used as working capital and repaid from the proceeds of the assets of ailing banks seized by regulators the loan amount is unspecified administration s new tack treasury secretary nicholas f brady conceded today that the administration had lost its yearlong struggle with congress , and began to express a new administration strategy charging the lawmakers with failure on the issue continued congressional inaction is a recipe for trouble , he said this kind of attack will doubtless be adopted by the white house once president bush s reelection campaign moves into high gear , even though the president himself never really put any serious lobbying effort behind the administration s recommendations senator donald w riegle jr , the michigan democrat who heads the banking committee and has been the administration s strongest ally , moved swiftly to defend congress we need the president s help , he said asked whether mr bush had done enough for the legislation , mr riegle said , the answer is clearly no in the days leading up to the conference , the white house left the legislation entirely in the hands of the treasury department congress has been prodded this week to move swiftly to refinance the rapidly depleted fund that insures bank deposits the fund , which protects about 2 trillion in deposits , is worth about 2 billion and is expected to be out of money by the end of next month , battered by a wave of bank failures at a meeting on saturday , the nation s top bank officials told mr riegle that even after congress provided new money , the insurance fund would still be unable to handle a failure of one of the nation s largest banks they also expressed concern that a large bank collapse could lead to a regionwide financial crisis because the government did not have the money to act swiftly and avert runs the meeting was called by alan greenspan , the chairman of the federal reserve board , and its participants included william taylor , the new head of the fdic , and senate aides aides said the meeting deeply concerned mr riegle , who tried with no success to set up a meeting between mr greenspan and the president to discuss problems in the banking industry fund in trouble on friday mr taylor also described the difficulties of the fund , saying in an interview that its depletion had begun to slow regulators in seizing bigger banks at an emergency hearing yesterday , mr taylor urged the lawmakers to lay aside their differences and quickly provide new money for the insurance fund through this afternoon and into the evening the lawmakers haggled over the fine print of the legislation , going over it line by line in a room jammed with lobbyists representing banks , wall street , the insurance industry and consumers other measures stripped from the senate bill would have reduced the potential liability of lenders for environmental damage by borrowers and put a 14 percent cap on the interest rates that banks charge their credit card customers since the treasury department issued its recommendations for a comprehensive banking overhaul in february , congress has already rejected the proposals to permit banks to enter the insurance and securities business more freely , and to be owned by industrial enterprises the lawmakers also rejected the treasury s recommendations to combine four regulatory agencies into two and to put modest limits on the coverage of deposit insurance seriousness of the situation it is shocking to me that some in congress are only now coming to realize the seriousness of the situation , mr brady wrote in a letter today to mr riegle fundamental reform of our banking laws , already delayed , is not a wecangetitlater issue congressional leaders also said they expected the house and senate to provide new money for the savings and loan bailout before congress adjourned , although by early evening it was unclear how much would be provided and when decisive votes on a spending measure would be cast key lawmakers in the senate appeared close to an agreement that would have given the administration the 80 billion it has requested to continue the bailout , which has already cost nearly 80 billion since it began more than two years ago risks of symbolism but in the house , a financing measure was still in question , because a wing of the republican party , led by representative newt gingrich of georgia , had sought to attach what it called a broader economic stimulus package to the legislation the bush administration has praised the package , and thus found itself on the verge of perhaps losing the savings and loan bailout financing for the symbolic support of a program that it knew stood no chance of being adopted today the lawmakers have had enormous difficulty providing new money for the unpopular program , and some members of congress today predicted that a spending bill might not be taken up until the early hours of wednesday morning last year congress adjourned without providing additional money for the rescue effort , but regulators received 18 billion in new financing after the adminstration found what it said was a drafting glitch in the savings and loan legislation that permitted the additional money in march , the house rejected four bills before it finally approved one that provided 30 billion for the bailout photo lawmakers from the house and senate met yesterday to reconcile competing banking

cambridge , mass fifty years ago , on aug 12 , 1941 , the house passed a measure that the press called the draft extension bill the vote was 203 to 202 for a halfcentury , reputable historians have misstated the bill s purpose and exaggerated its importance the selective service act of 1940 provided that a drafted man should serve for one year and then spend 10 years in the reserves , subject to callup in case of war in august 1941 , the army persuaded president roosevelt to support a bill lengthening every draftee s service from one year to two and a half years when the newspapers called this a a draft extension bill , many thought it was a measure to renew the act this mistake quickly became conventional wisdom a week after roosevelt s death , time magazine wrote of the onevote margin in the house , when the draft came up for extension four months before pearl harbor the mistake was given a respectable gloss when distinguished historians fell into the same trap samuel eliot morison , a cousin of mine , wrote that an administration bill to extend conscription for the duration of the emergency passed the house by a majority of only one vote much later , barbara tuchman wrote in the march of folly of the renewal of the oneyear draft law this is nonsense the selective service act was not a oneyear draft law it did not have to be renewed but the mistake s repetition led to further error the notion that if one house vote had gone the other way , the army would have been virtually disbanded by the time japan struck actually , if the bill had been defeated , less than 17 , 000 drafted men would have gone home before dec 7 perhaps the historians should not be blamed too much it was obvious from the letters i received from alarmed constituents in 1941 that thousands of citizens thought the draft s continuation was at stake maybe the white house should shoulder some blame sam rosenman , a roosevelt speechwriter , wrote one vote the other way and the army would have been thoroughly disorganized and crippled the army did argue that if draftees were n't kept in uniform for longer than one year , the disruption would be disastrous it failed to convince 60 representatives , including myself , who were staunch new dealers and ordinarily followed roosevelt s lead our skepticism was justified shortly after the bill s passage , the army announced that it was releasing all conscripts over 26 , about 200 , 000 men , none of whom had completed even one year of training this surprising act of selfdisruption may have been caused partly by a shortage of equipment , but the obvious reason for it was the trainees' discontent over the bill s enactment so , august 12 , 1991 is the 50th anniversary of the passage of a measure that did not save the army indeed , if the bill had been defeated , we would have had a larger army on dec 7 than we actually had
the admiral was a wellbuilt man of more than average stature , the face long , the cheeks somewhat high , his body neither fat nor lean he had an aquiline nose and lightcolored eyes his complexion , too , was light and tending to bright red in youth his hair was blond , but when he reached the age of thirty , it all turned white that s how ferdinand columbus described his famous father but the library of congress recently pointed out that , five centuries later , no one knows what he really looked like there are no known likenesses of christopher columbus that were done in his lifetime \( there are none of his royal spanish sponsors , either portrait painting was n't in fashion yet \) while his own offspring s description should be reliable , albeit flattering , other contemporaries differed in some respects all of them seem to agree on his height and the aquiline nose , but one says he had red hair and another that he had freckles the three pictures reproduced here illustrate , if nothing else , how different artists at different times have seen a different man on the left , a painting from the early 1500 s , which fits ferdinand columbus s description in the center , a 19thcentury etching that portrays a heroic swashbuckler the cesar romero , jose ferrer type and finally , a 1984 intaglio by professor leonardo lasansky of hamline university for the minneapolis institute of arts , depicting a jowly seaman with his face , like his life , half obscured in shadow as much as these three artists' representations vary , so do scholarly interpretations of columbus s roots , his motives and his impact like the 400th anniversary a century ago , the approach of the quincentenary in 1992 has launched legions of scholars in renewed rummaging for the real columbus much of what the world thinks it knows about him is myth much remains mystery exploring for the truth about this great explorer is the stuff of history , a fascinating exercise that should enrich even those who too often ignore it drawings
damascus , syria , sept 16 the release of more western hostages from lebanon , which seemed imminent a few days ago has become embroiled in complicated negotiations surrounding the logistical details of an exchange , western diplomats say our understanding is that we are in the preliminary stages of the negotiations to determine the logistical arrangements for any trade , a highranking western diplomat in damascus said the obstacles , however , have not dampened the optimism here that the 10 western hostages believed to be held in lebanon will be freed eventually in return for the release of about 300 arabs under the control of israel and information on the fate of seven missing israeli servicemen frenzy of diplomacy syrian , israeli , american , german , lebanese , iranian and united nations officials have been scurrying from one capital to another during the last few days to work out agreements the syrian foreign minister , farouk alsharaa , left for bonn on sunday for talks with the german government on the hostage issue there are two germans among the 10 hostages israel s top negotiator , uri lubrani , met with the united nations secretary general , javier perez de cuellar , on sunday in paris , and the lebanese foreign minister is in teheran for talks about the hostage situation john kelly , the united states assistant secretary of state for middle east and african affairs , held talks on saturday in beirut with lebanese officials all those engaged in the facetoface negotiations insist that a solution is not far away i'm optimistic there could be something , mr sharaa said the syrian foreign minister said he had no idea whether the next hostage to be released would be british or american , though speculation has centered around a british hostage , jack mann , a 77yearold former airline pilot who had lived in beirut for 43 years before his abduction on may 12 , 1989 there are five americans , two britons , two germans and an italian currently believed to be held by the party of god , an iranianbacked militant shiite group the party of god is reportedly the umbrella organization for the kidnappers of most of the hostages when sheik abdel karim obeid , who was kidnapped from his home in lebanon by israeli commandos on july 28 , 1989 , was not released on wednesday with 51 arab prisoners , many in the leadership of the party of god expressed anger israel also turned over the bodies of nine guerrillas israeli officials insist that it is up to the party of god to make the next move and have said that the sheik , arguably israel s best bargaining chip , would be among the last to be released mr lubrani said that if another hostage was released , israel would reciprocate two held in germany perhaps one of the thorniest issues revolves around the imprisonment in germany of two brothers , mohammed and abbas ali hamadei mohammed hamadei was sentenced to life in prison for his part in the hijacking of a trans world airlines flight in 1985 abbas ali hamadei was arrested on charges of carrying explosives and ordered to stand trial in the abduction of two germans in beirut , who were taken shortly after mohammed hamadei was jailed a third brother , abdul hadi hamadei , is in charge of the party of god s security apparatus in beirut and is wanted on terrorism charges in the united states the syrian and german officials who are meeting to discuss the hostage issue in bonn have rejected demands that the release of the hamadeis be tied to the freeing of western hostages but many western diplomats expect there will have to be some understanding involving the fate of the two brothers the issue of iranian hostages is also one that negotiators must solve before any deal is completed , western diplomats said the christian lebanese forces militiamen captured four iranians in north lebanon during the israeli invasion in july 1982 the men are widely believed to have been killed by their captors , but the iranians have repeatedly said they would only help to free western hostages if their own missing were included in any deal finally , the israelis continued to demand a complete accounting of all of their missing soldiers the body of one of the seven , sgt samir assad , was returned to the israeli authorities from syria by a radical palestinian group in the last week the secretary general of the party of god said in may that the organization was holding two of the israelis the remaining four are believed to be dead , and recent reports out of lebanon seem to suggest that the other two may also have been killed party hardens stand beirut , lebanon , sept 16 \( special to the new york times \) the party of god , in a hardening of its position on freeing the 10 western hostages believed held in lebanon , said today that none of the captives would be freed until israel released lebanese prisoners including sheik obeid sheik abbas musawi , the party s secretary general , said the hostage problem can only be solved

' he said , 'because you 're a great jockey' every time i saw mehrtens after that in the paddock , he 'd raise his eyebrows at me but nobody s safe the next year , i rode a horse named phalanx for c v whitney we lost the kentucky derby by about an inch to jet pilot in the preakness two weeks later , phalanx just ran a poor race and before the belmont three weeks after that , i was taken off no kidding , i rode another horse in the belmont while roberto donoso rode phalanx how did he do \? he won sure , my feelings were hurt phalanx looked like a lock , anyway wide turns at belmont , he was a mileandahalf horse and a 3to5 shot and i got taken off him he paused again , rolling with the injustice of it all , and said , how many guys got taken off horses for bill shoemaker \? but shed no tears for arcaro he won the kentucky derby five times and the woodward four times , and he won 6 , 541 other races on horses that won 145 million and , when he switched to his tuxedo after racing hours , no other jockey was safe in 1952 , he said , laughing at the thought of it , nearly 40 years later , ted atkinson won the santa anita derby on hill gail i rode an irish horse that finished second and even broke down but , that night , i went to the santa anita ball and happened to dance with mrs gene markey , who owned calumet farm while we were dancing , i said , 'mrs markey , i want to ride hill gail in the kentucky derby' she said , 'you 've got him' three weeks later , i'm riding hill gail and we win the derby by two lengths atkinson \? he was 11th on a horse named gushing oil , about 20 lengths back the next time i came into the jockeys' room , atkinson called over to me and said , 'you 've got to tell me how you did that \? ' i said , 'i just went out and did some dancing' none of this will necessarily comfort chris antley , who may be watching on television this sunday when cordero again takes his place in the saddle on strike the gold and tries to outrun the senior stars farma way , festin , in excess and jolie s halo he was acclaimed for brilliant riding in the derby after steering strike the gold wide in the stretch and shooting home in the clear but he was criticized for racing too far back in the next three races , although strike the gold lost the belmont stakes by only a head strike the gold puts you in a precarious position , arcaro said , reaching out to antley across the generations he s no whirlaway whirlaway , the first of the calumet farm superstars , rocketed from eighth place to first to win the 1941 kentucky derby by eight lengths he went on to win the triple crown , too , and nobody sacked arcaro from the saddle whirlaway \? the master asked he would 've made his move and run right around those guys
in all the commotion over bo jackson s future as an athlete , it should be remembered that he defied what happened to happen and it did midway through the 1987 baseball season , the kansas city royals outfielder decided that he would also join the los angeles raiders as a running back jim thorpe in nike commercials when he glibly described playing pro football as a hobby , he was reminded that stamp collecting is a hobby , that being mauled by linebackers is not a hobby , that a serious football injury could diminish , if not jeopardize , his baseball career but like so many other gifted athletes who consider themselves to be indestructible , bo knows insistence whatever comes after the baseball season , he said at the time , is a hobby for bo jackson , just like hunting and fishing but now , sadly , bo s hobby has hobbled him one of the fastest athletes in the world is on crutches after having suffered a fracturedislocation of his left hip in a openfield , oneonone tackle during a national football league playoff game on jan 13 , he developed traumatic chondrolysis of the hip joint and avascular necrosis of the femoral head , a condition as serious as it sounds because of a lack of blood supply , his hipsocket cartilage and the top of his thighbone are deteriorating , not healing bo s future in both baseball and football is uncertain his hobby has turned into a horror bo thought it would be fun to play both sports at least that s what he thought back in 1987 the more i thought about playing football and baseball i knew jim thorpe had done it a long time ago i saw the movie about him the more it sounded like fun , he recalled in his bestseller autobiography , bo knows bo \( doubleday \) , written in collaboration with dick schaap that really was the attraction i thought it 'd be fun it had nothing to do with wanting to prove anything i 'd proved in college that i could play football i 'd proved in kansas city that i could play baseball and it had nothing to do with money i did n't need any more money than i was getting from the royals , and i knew i could live on a lot less i just did n't want to cheat myself out of some fun i did n't want to look back in 20 years and think , 'would n't it have been fun doing that \? but in enjoying the fun of four years of playing both baseball and football , bo may have cheated himself out of the fun of developing into one of baseball s true superstars even if bo returns to the big leagues , it s difficult to believe that he will be as fast or as reckless as he was his speed is sure to be slowed by his damaged hip perhaps his bat speed will be slowed too that was the risk he took when he joined the raiders , the risk that just about everybody but bo accepted as inevitable for a running back , the usual injury is a knee , as football people call it torn ligaments , torn cartilage but being different , bo went down with a hip what nfl orthopedists call a hip pointer occurs every so often originally , that s how bo s injury was diagnosed but instead of getting better , it got worse just as bo was a rarity , so was his injury other football players have recovered from a similar injury , notably george adams , a new england patriots running back after having been the giants' firstround draft choice in 1985 , he missed the entire 1986 season with what the giants then called a chipped pelvic bone but what has recently been described as almost identical to jackson s ailment george was on crutches that whole season , said ottis anderson , the giants running back , on friday after accepting the potamkin male athlete of the year award but george came back in 1987 , and he s been playing ever since maybe that s why al davis , the raiders' managing general genius , keeps predicting that bo jackson will be a running back again , possibly in the upcoming season but will he be the same running back \? and when bo was on waivers after the royals released him last monday , none of the 26 majorleague teams considered him worth the risk of assuming his royals salary of 2 , 375 , 000 this season the yankees had first crack , but according to general manager gene michael , there was n't one doctor who felt we should take the risk the new yankee front office decided not to throw bad money after bad , such as the threeyear 56 million investment in pascual perez that produced a 12 record last season more important , george steinbrenner apparently had no say in the decision that s progress sooner or later , look for bo to return to baseball with an if contract a modest signing bonus plus a graduated salary depending on how soon and how much he plays do n't worry about bo s finances like most multimillion dollar athletes , he is insured for millions against the possibility of a careerending injury or accident the shame is that bo had the power tools to be one of baseball s most dominant players if he had concentrated on baseball he hit brokenbat home runs to the opposite field he once nailed a baserunner at the plate with a 300foot arrow to the catcher , on the fly he outran infielders' throws to first base bo could do it all in baseball all but work on reducing his strikeouts
indianapolis , oct 20 the jets and the colts played predictable roles this afternoon , and the outcome of their game was no surprise , either the jets , using a little flash in the passing game and showing very little spark in the rushing attack , defeated the colts , 176 , before a mostly emotionless crowd of 53 , 025 spectators here at the hoosier dome the jets improved their record to 44 and the colts dropped to 08 the jets playoff hopes remain strong , while indianapolis' season is quickly turning to dust the jets will have a bye next weekend and return to action nov 3 against green bay at giants stadium the game today did not produce a points explosion or a sack bonanza for the jets , although the colts have proved to be the perfect foil for every other team looking to roll up offensive and defensive statistics this season in the main , it was a workmanlike effort that simply produced a victory for the new york team it was not clear whether the game was also injuryfree for the jets quarterback ken o'brien , who came out of the game twice with injuries but missed only two offensive plays , sprained his ankle and had his foot in a cast after the game jets spokesman frank ramos said he did n't know how serious o'brien s injury was none of the jets players expressed disappointment with the way things unfolded today we did n't come in here expecting to steamroll over them , regardless of how many we were favored by , said tackle irv eatman they played very hard all we cared about was coming in and getting a win now we go back to 500 , take a week off , relax a little bit and get ready for green bay the jets were a heavy favorite heading into the game coach bruce coslet said afterward that he had n't known how his team , which has been an underdog in most of its other games this season , would react to being favored over a home team , even the colts , who have n't won a game this year coslet said his team handled itself very well they set their jaw , the coach said they were determined they were n't in a frenzy they were n't emotionally too up it was really epitomized by the performance of our defense they just were n't going to allow those guys to score a touchdown period indianapolis was held without a touchdown for a fourth consecutive game colts quarterback jeff george , who finished the game with a bruised right shoulder , an injured hand and a sprained ankle , said he spent most of the day looking from side to side to guard against blindside hits , rather than looking downfield for receivers he was sacked four times george did n't do it to his credit , and to the amazement of most onlookers , george completed 14 of 22 passes for 107 yards and was not intercepted but he was tepidly booed by a crowd that does n't seem to know just how to react to an 08 team i do n't care when they boo , george said i kind of take it as a challenge when they boo , because i want to see if i can do something to turn the boos into cheers that challenge is getting tougher and tougher each week and george s body might not be able stand up to the task my goal right now is just to win two or three games and finish the season healthy , he said knock wood , i'm still walking while the jets' defense was flourishing , the jets' offense looked ordinary for most of the day for a third straight game , the jets' rushing attack lacked power , as the team gained 138 yards on 41 carries against a colts defense that was giving up an average 1594 yards a game , the most in the league brad baxter , who had 20 carries for 59 yards to lead the jets in rushing , deemed his performance pitiful i do n't know what the reason is , we 're just not getting it done , baxter said it s not like we 're not capable of it flea flicker for a scoretd the jets scored on only three of nine possessions , striking for a 47yard touchdown with a catch by receiver rob moore on a flea flicker in the first quarter , a 1yard touchdown run by baxter on a fourthandgoal at the 1 late in the second quarter and a 19yard field goal by pat leahy late in the third quarter the one bright spot was the flea flicker , which coslet said he called to keep the colts from loading up to stop the run moore played his role perfectly , lazily running a route to sell the run when o'brien pitched the ball to running back johnny hector , then taking off when the indianapolis safety bit on the run when hector pitched the ball back to o'brien , moore shifted into another gear and was behind his closest defender by at least 10 yards i knew i was going to be open when i came in the middle and i saw the safeties shoot up , moore said the corner came up to play the line and the only question was whether i would be able to get behind the safeties with the outcome of the game never in doubt , about the only drama came during the drive on which baxter scored the touchdown it was a 16play , 72yard drive that consumed 9 minutes 48 seconds of the second quarter the jets spent 5 minutes of the drive inside the colts' 20 , attempting to put the ball in the end zone coslet bristled when he was continually questioned about the jets' lack of production on the ground did we win or did we lose \? coslet said hey , we won the game guys photo the jets' defense , which held the colts to 170 yards , shoving pat beach out of bounds after short gain \( mary ann carter

browningferris industries had little to celebrate as it quietly reached a preliminary agreement last week to sell its stateoftheart hazardous waste disposal site 70 miles east of denver to the concord resources group , a recently formed joint venture of the consolidated rail corporation and the ohm corporation although the price was not disclosed , interviews with company executives and bankers suggest that it was 20 percent less than had been hoped for when the site was put up for sale last summer the price was even slightly under an internal valuation by houstonbased browningferris , which has a reputation for conservative accounting the gap between browningferris s dream deal and the one it finally struck reflected in part the weak market for most types of corporate assets in this recession but it also highlighted uncertainties peculiar to environmental businesses , especially those in fields like hazardous waste where the investment demands as well as the regulatory and technology risks are substantial browningferris had reason to believe that it was in an enviable bargaining position when it began the process of selling its last chance site , which takes its nickname from a nearby hamlet the environmental protection agency has called last chance the best designed land disposal site in the nation moreover , analysts who follow environmental companies say that hazardous waste disposal , currently a 3 billion to 4 billion business , may be the most lucrative segment of the waste management industry over the next 20 years the basic reason as new regulations continue to expand the range of materials classified as hazardous waste , the number of legal disposal sites is declining despite such prospects , browningferris decided last april to bail out of the hazardous waste business and concentrate on solid waste disposal and recycling browningferris is the secondlargest solidwaste disposal company in the nation after waste management inc browningferris had tripped from one financial setback to another in hazardous waste , damaging its reputation with regulators and environmental groups it was never able overcome a history of shoddy operations at landfills it acquired in new york , ohio and louisiana when william d ruckleshaus , the company s chief executive , decided to retreat last spring , the company set aside 295 million after taxes to cover the costs of discontinuing the business in last chance , buyers were being offered the company s one hazardous waste jewel i think they basically put it together as well as humanly possible , said tanelle roberts , the engineer overseeing the permit process for the colorado health department moreover , the new owner would be taking over at an ideal time , just as the last regulatory reviews were completed , wiping away any fear that previous operations had created unknown perils that could lead to fines , remediation expenses or closures browningferris s expectations were also colored by its pride in last chance , formally known as the highway 36 treatment storage and disposal facility it is the first and so far only new hazardous waste site to receive state and federal operating permits under new regulations established by the epa in 1984 more than 50 million had been sunk into the site since acquisition of its 5 , 700 acres began in 1980 last chance is intended to handle a variety of liquid and solid wastes , including incinerator ash , sludges from other waste treatment operations , toxic metal plating sludge , contaminated soil and asbestos materials to be sent to the site must be pretested at a laboratory in denver and can only be accepted if they come in a scheduled delivery they also will be retested at the site all wastes to be buried will be solidified the permit calls for disposal in fouracre cells that are 40 feet deep , lined with alternating layers of plastic and compacted clay and ringed with leak detectors concord s second acquisition the last chance deal came within days after concord resources , based in pittsburgh , had announced its first acquisition , the purchase of stablex , a montreal hazardous waste firm this is a great time to be buying hazardous waste assets , said swep t davis , concord s chief executive , reflecting on the leverage willing buyers have in a slow market from 1984 to 1988 , sellers could be very rigid on bidding specifications , which sometimes read like ultimatums , acknowledged clay lifflander , the smith barney , harris upham company banker who led the sales effort people do n't like to feel like they are in an auction today it s more like a negotiation the sales process began last june , when thick booklets describing the site were sent to those who had expressed an interest , along with a letter hinting that browningferris would welcome a preemptive bid none came smith barney executives began to realize that while the site clearly did not have any skeletons in its closet , it also had no record by which to judge browningferris s income projections
albany , april 12 as new york struggles through a fiscal crisis , its everexpanding medicaid program , already the most expensive in the nation , has emerged as discouraging proof of just how profound and intractable the state s budget problems are over the last five years , annual spending on medicaid has increased by 60 percent , to roughly 12 billion so expensive is the program that it now consumes almost one of every seven state tax dollars many county governments are being forced to raise taxes as they , too , strain to pay their share but to look just at the spending side is to miss the full magnitude of the medicaid problem that can be found only in the distressed faces of recipients like william cummings , an unemployed 31yearold typist who suffers from asthma mr cummings receives virtually all of his care through hospital emergency rooms , waiting up to eight hours each time to see a physician i very much would like to have my own doctor , mr cummings said during a recent wait at jacobi hospital in the north bronx but where i live , there is no doctor nearby that takes medicaid medicaid is the primary government healthcare program for the poor , financed with federal , state and in some cases local funds despite the vast sums spent on medicaid in new york , there is widespread agreement that the program fails to deliver adequate services to the people for whom it was intended poor people like mr cummings more and more of its resources are funneled to the elderly many of them middleclass while for the poor , health care is still often limited to overcrowded clinics and emergency rooms and at a time when many other social services for the poor are shrinking , many experts say that what is needed is not less medicaid spending but more stripped of its technical details , new york s gathering medicaid crisis is a grim metaphor for the quandary facing the state as its social problems and its budget deficit now estimated at 6 billion for the current fiscal year grow simultaneously it illustrates the essential conflict between new york s need to cut costs and its reluctance to retreat from the policies that have made its socialwelfare programs some of the most generous , and expensive , in the nation efforts to revamp medicaid and rein in its runaway costs have been stalled for years by a slowmoving bureaucracy and a battery of specialinterest groups and while the state is finally making some genuine efforts to revise the system under the enormous pressure of its budget squeeze , even the most optimistic forecasters acknowledge that medicaid will remain a drag on the budget process at least through the 1990 s your best hope with medicaid is that you can control the rate of spending increase , said michael j dowling , gov mario m cuomo s deputy secretary for human services new york is by no means the only state where expenses for medicaid are growing rapidly several forces are responsible for this seemingly inexorable growth the aging population , the aids epidemic and the unchecked inflation in healthcare costs but by almost any standard , new york s medicaid spending dwarfs that of other states while new york , for instance , has roughly onetenth of the country s medicaid recipients , it accounts for almost onefifth of the money spent the high cost of medicaid in new york reflects many of the state s peculiar problems , including high labor costs , a heavy reliance on hospital care , and poor people who are on the whole sicker and more troubled than in other states but it is also a reflection of state policy not only is it easier to qualify for medicaid in new york than in most other states , but once you qualify you are entitled to greater benefits new york provides levels of services that would be unthinkable in other parts of the country , said joshua m weiner , senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington new york also reimburses hospitals at higher rates than many other states , pegging medicaid reimbursement to private insurance rates the costs of new york s medicaid program are staggering not only for the state , but also for its local governments washington pays for half of all medicaid costs new york splits the other half with its localities , one of 14 states to require a local contribution for new york city , where more than 15 million of the state s 23 million medicaid recipients live , the local share of the program came to 16 billion last year over the years , to take advantage of federal funds available for the program , the state has shifted so many health programs into medicaid that a comprehensive overview is almost impossible but an examination of major elements of the program shows how medicaid has become so expensive , and why it is so difficult to bring the cost down the program broad access and many services the federal medicaid program , begun in 1965 , is a vast collection of benefits that , like a weather system , changes form as it passes from region to region each state administers its own program , and federal guidelines give states wide latitude to fashion their own package of services and eligibility rules

in a bitter round of fiscal wrangling yesterday , mayor david n dinkins accused the state legislature of failing to provide the 250 million in extra aid that the mayor said he needed to balance his budget the assembly speaker , mel miller , dismissed mr dinkins s charge as stupid mr dinkins s uncharacteristic attack came amid a convulsion of charges and countercharges in albany and manhattan , as gov mario m cuomo renewed his vow to veto parts of the state budget passed by the legislature and the city council speaker , peter f vallone , sharply rebuked the mayor s handling of the city s budget despite repeated demands by the city for 250 million in aid and pledges from mr cuomo and legislative leaders to provide it mr dinkins said the state budget bills passed this week were so full of conditions and restrictions on spending , and of extra costs , that they provided virtually none of it but mr miller , who had staunchly fought to restore aid to the city that mr cuomo orginally proposed to cut , flatly rejected that he said the legislature had given the city 227 million in restored aid , and then flayed the mayor , a fellow democrat i told the mayor before he made that stupid statement , why should i fight to get money for new york city when you do n't like the form in which it comes \? ' mr miller said in a telephone interview they do n't know how to run the city here you want to know why the city s in trouble \? they do n't know how to run the city mr dinkins did not deny that the state had restored some aid to the city , but he said it had tied his hands his salvo seemed to be a tactical move aimed at maximizing his flexibility in closing a 35 billion gap in the city s 29 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts on july 1 , and in trying to spread the blame that has so often stuck to him like glue in particular , city officials were upset that more than a third of the 100 million in aid restored to the board of education was earmarked by the legislature for a program that required it to be used to supplement teachers' salaries mr dinkins , who bore harsh criticism for raising teachers' wages last fall , said the legislature should take some heat for that the mayor acknowledged that he could remove an equal amount of city money from the education budget to plug holes elsewhere in the budget , but he said he had not decided what to do but in giving the city education aid , the legislature routinely puts in restrictions , and did so this time precisely so the city would not seek the money for education , and then use it for something else but by attacking mr miller , mr dinkins also risked more trouble , since he is still seeking approval for 335 million in higher taxes from the legislature my feeling now is , mr miller said , if you do n't want it , the rest of the state would be happy to take back the money vallone takes aim even as mr dinkins fought to wring more from albany , mr vallone denounced the mayor for demanding too much in higher property taxes from the council and for not negotiating more swiftly to win moneysaving concessions from municipal unions to help hold down taxes and avoid deep cuts in city services is there anybody home \? mr vallone said , rapping on his desk , referring derisively to mr dinkins is there anybody listening \? only the mayor can conclude these budget negotiations on time , he added we cannot be the mayor we cannot negotiate with the unions he s got to be the mayor he s got to bring them in , close the doors and stay there until it s finished mr vallone made his comments as he issued the council s latest response to the mayor s proposed budget , which calls for less than a third of the 646 million in new realestate taxes the mayor wants and restores a 400 million grabbag of programs , using a mix of onetime revenues and labor concessions like early retirement , wage deferrals and eliminating one paid holiday for city workers the council also proposed eliminating a number of smaller city departments like the mayor s office of operations , which oversees management of city agencies , and the department of records and information services obstacles to council plan first deputy mayor norman steisel said the council s proposal was an interesting financial plan but he said there were serious obstacles to getting it done , including resistance by bondrating agencies to the city s using onetime revenues to balance the budget the issue is not what it would like after it s all done , he said the question is implementing it labor leaders have said they want to see what other parties would do before agreeing to any concessions , but mr vallone said the mayor could not afford to wait this council will not simply raise taxes to balance a budget that slashes services and ruins this city , he said on the question of state aid , city officials also said that a range of obscure new regulations passed as part of the state budget making it more difficult for the city to issue parking tickets would cost it 60 million , offsetting part of the aid the state restored overall they said this was so , in part , because of a new requirement that the city send official notice of any unpaid fines within 30 days city officials said they could not meet this demand for some tickets , like those issued to outofstate cars , because it takes more time to get accurate addresses for such violators mr miller dismissed this as a technical flaw in the bill that could be easily remedied specifics on medicaid savings in addition , mr dinkins said , the city could not obtain specifics on some 63 million in medicaid savings that mr miller said was included in the budget mr dinkins s acting press secretary , leland t jones , said , despite all the things that the speaker and the legislature force us to do in our budget , they do n't really seem to want to provide enough money to help us do that mr dinkins said he had not decided whether to ask mr cuomo to veto the school aid portion of the budget , because of the restrictions on the money for teachers' salaries mr cuomo said that he would have to analyze the disagreements between mr miller and the mayor , but that he was still committed to trying to provide the city with 250 million in relief one way or the other mr miller said of the mayor i think that he thought that we were giving him a check for 250 million to use as he wants we ca n't there s no such animal
rutherford when one of the three forlorn characters entrapped in oliver hailey s i wo n't dance asks , at the top of the second act , what is the point here , assuming that there is one \? , reverberations of the same question could almost be heard throughout the audience , what was left of it , after the intermission at a saturday night performance giving another chance to an unacknowledged play is an important purpose of regional theater , but choosing this one must be more an act of defiance than boldness on the part of the rivoli stage company in its first season at the william carlos williams center for the arts in 1981 , beyond being a playwright s muddle , i wo n't dance was a broadway riddle , not insofar as what it meant \( who cared \? \) as concerning why it opened then , the producer david merrick withdrew the play after a single performance on a sunday matinee on the last day of a season that had opened with his blockbuster , 42d street a decade later , the play remains an exercise in obfuscation mr hailey s writing comes off as pseudoclever indulgence in parrying , doublespeak and wisecracks of the sort that partners in captivity might turn into a game during , say , a boring journey or any extended wait , but would have the good sense not to repeat or , for that matter , acknowledge upon the restoration of choice and coherence mr hailey , who built up a record of onenight stands on broadway \( first one asleep , whistle , in 1966 father s day in 1971 , the latter having had a deserved revival years later \) , is here depicting a hostile young man , a paraplegic , who in fantasy walks , dances , even flies and whose active but far from rich inner life also has him confessing to the murder of his brother and sisterinlaw mr hailey once commented that all his plays were about reality and illusion since the murder is apparently real , mr hailey comes up with two suspects one is the victim s sister , lil , who makes an epiphanic moment of discovering the word sororicide , and talks of having the courage to take a fullblooded indian lover it s a mistake to go the white trash route , lil says the other suspect is kay , who sometimes sits in a spare wheelchair and admits that she s an untalented actress but not a prostitute i'm a hook , but that does n't make me a hooker , kay insists good will overtaking him , dom says , i hope none of us did it if there is an important stage effect here , it s the lighting , which must dim , or perhaps brighten , during dom s mental , as opposed to medical , sequences under william macneil s perfunctory direction , it dims , and nowhere is mr hailey s murkiness illuminated what a director could do with such material is highlight or diminish dom s violent streak assumedly , it is here underplayed dom simply knocks the head off an already dead accident victim \( do n't ask who \) and goes at lil \( or is it kay \? \) with a plastic cast of a leg , it seems getting serious , mr hailey bears messages , many of them one concerns the tinsel values of hollywood where it all takes place and that s evident when dom is said to have taken his wheelchair onto the ventura freeway and attached it to a moving car , which prompts kay to deliver the play s best explanatory line , you 'd have to be pretty fed up with california but does this mean the hideous set design is intentional \? moving along with meaning , there s an inescapable statement about a universal bond among the handicapped , or something like that this is what must be meant by the line , we are all cripples and do n't forget mr hailey s comments on destructive family relationships and society s denial of the humanity of the handicapped dom says it makes perfect , at least motivational and natural , sense to kill your kin , instead of strangers he also says something about the convenience of simulated madness it always helps to be crazy a failed attempt at such faddishness of its time as black comedy and absurdist humor , this play is one of the contemporary theater s least likely candidates for resuscitation i wo n't dance is not to be confused with a new cabaret revue to open off broadway next month it is a tribute to fred astaire i wo n't dance by oliver hailey , produced by the rivoli stage company , at the william carlos center for the arts , 1 williams plaza , in rutherford remaining performances are today and next sunday at 3 pm and thursday , friday and saturday at 8 pm box office number \( 201 \) 9392323 photo judy chesnutt , left , with brent black and laura margolis in i wo n't dance , being presented in rutherford \( a noren sterling images \)
seiyun , yemen the man from the french total oil company broke into a wide grin as he glanced at a convoy of cars making their way toward sana , the yemeni capital smuggled , perhaps recycled , he said with satisfaction , confirming his suspicion that none of the vehicles had genuine license plates in yemen these days , a recycled car is one that is stolen from one of the two dozen oil companies prospecting for crude in yemen , repainted , and then leased by their proud new bedouin owners , sometimes back to the oil companies that lost the cars in the first place smuggled vehicles , mostly fourwheel drive , are bought taxfree in saudi arabia , driven across the rub al khali , or empty quarter desert , into yemen , where they can fetch three times their original prices smuggling thrives it is a long trek in one of the most desolate and dangerous deserts of the region , braving not only jittery , armed saudi patrols , but also the distinct possibility , even for the most experienced bedouin , of getting lost but the smuggling of cars , machinery , consumer goods , bulldozers , cement mixers and food is a thriving business estimated by foreign embassies and government officials at close to 13 billion a year , creating virtually an entire economy that works parallel to the regulated one yemen is perhaps the last place in the arabian peninsula where the desert still truly belongs to its bedouins and where much of the country is still divided among tribes nowhere is that more evident than in this vast desert and surrounding terraced mountains where a significant number of yemenis live and grow their food despite the advent of some democratization , government efforts to spread its military presence , and the existence of 38 registered political parties , tribal influence still runs according to invisible boundaries known only to the bedouins and mountain people after the discovery of oil in significant quantities over the last two years , the growing number of largely western foreign oil companies coming to explore in the desert have come to learn about tribal taboos and controls first through disappearing cars and then through the allocation of local contracts sometimes we have to switch bulldozers and working teams in a region as they cross a line over which one tribe has to yield to another , said the french executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity you ca n't see it , but in their minds the region of influence of any tribe is as clear as black and white with oil money beginning to trickle in , smuggling is bound to become an even more thriving business , even more so since saudi arabia and yemen have never determined where their border lies , and as taxes and tariffs here are much higher than in nearby saudi arabia and oman , the primary sources of contraband the sight of men walking around with automatic guns , belts of ammunition , daggers and sometimes even an odd rocket launcher , is common , although a foreign envoy chuckled that lately they have succeeded in banning weapons in classrooms he added , however , that by and large yemen is still a place where the writ of government stops right out of town yemenis and foreign envoys say that so far the most visible result of the 1990 union , which brought yemen , with its 10 million largely tribal inhabitants , together with former marxist southern yemen , with about 2 million inhabitants , has been the spread of tribal and fundamentalist muslim values of the north to the somewhat socially emancipated and largely secularist south the saudi influence , which is strong in the north , can be felt traveling down to us , a former official of the southern yemen government said but many here think the oil money , when it comes , will take care of the perennial yemeni obsession standing up to the richer saudi cousins we think we will be a modest oil exporter in the near future , said ahmad k barakat , who is a deputy minister at the yemeni oil ministry in sana , understating what has become the most talked about subject in yemen while no one predicts oil gushers of the scale of those in saudi arabia , it is widely believed by several of the executives of the 18 oil companies prospecting in the south and the north that yemen will be exporting 500 , 000 to 700 , 000 barrels a day within the next five years outside of the substantial lift this will bring to one of the most impoverished populations of the arab world , the intensely proud yemenis feel oil revenues will finally give their country a strategic and geopolitical weight that matches the fact that yemenis represent half the total population of the arabian peninsula most particularly , many say , oil will enable them to resist economic and political pressures from the far wealthier saudis it is an old grudge yemenis maintain that saudi arabia forcibly expropriated the fertile asir province , which lies by the red sea , back in 1934 they also resent the way the saudis have used cheap labor from yemen to build up their oilbased economy in the 1970 s and 80 s , and the way saudi arabia abruptly sent about 800 , 000 yemenis back to their country when yemen appeared to sympathize with iraq in baghdad s takeover of kuwait last year the expulsions cost yemen some 800 million in remittances from these expatriate yemenis to their country but the oil that has been found and the bonuses and expenditures brought along by the oil companies have more than made up for the loss , bringing in some 900 million over the last 18 months once we get the oil out , everything will be fine , said saleh alsharif , a bedouin from northern yemen , as he looked toward saudi arabia we will be better than anyone else photo the desert in yemen still belongs to the bedouins and tribal influence extends even to oil exploration workers drilled holes near marib in preparation for seismic testing by a western oil company \( daniel simon gamma for the new york times

baton rouge , nov 6 in his strongest comments to date on the louisiana governor s race , president bush said today that state representative david duke was a charlatan unfit to hold public office because he has espoused racist and neonazi beliefs the president s remarks came after a statement by mr duke on tuesday that equated the extermination of jews in nazi germany with affirmative action programs in the united states speaking at a news conference in washington , president bush said when someone asserts the holocaust never took place , then i do n't believe that person ever deserves one iota of public trust when someone has so recently endorsed nazism , it is inconceivable that someone can reasonably aspire to a leadership role in a free society mr duke , who was openly associated with neonazi groups in the 1970 s and was a grand wizard of the ku klux klan from 1975 to 1980 , has proved a major embarrassment to the president and the national leadership of the republican party mr duke got nearly 500 , 000 votes to finish second in an open primary oct 19 and won the right to contest a runoff election nov 16 dirt on both sides even though mr duke did not seek the endorsement of the state republican convention last summer and has been repudiated by state and national republican organizations alike , he calls himself the republican candidate in the governor s race because he is a registered republican his opponent is edwin w edwards , a democrat who served three terms as governor from 1971 to 1987 mr edwards , who finished first in the primary , has been endorsed by some of the state s most prominent republicans as well as the leaders of his own party , along with major business groups and women s organizations but mr edwards is also burdened by his past he is widely known as a flamboyant rake whose last term was marred by scandal and his penchant for gambling and young women recent public opinion polls indicate that the two candidates are running virtually even both are vigorously courting supporters of gov buddy roemer , the incumbent who was shut out of the runoff when he finished third in the nonpartisan primary mr roemer switched to the republican party last spring and received enthusiastic support from president bush the president and other republican leaders in washington have repeatedly disavowed mr duke since the october primary , but none has been as harshly critical or has come as close to endorsing a vote for mr edwards as president bush did today the president said , i have got to be careful , because i do n't want to tell the voters of louisiana how to cast their ballot yet he said when someone has a long record , an ugly record of racism and of bigotry , that record simply cannot be erased by the glib rhetoric of a political campaign so i believe david duke is an insincere charlatan i believe he s attempting to hoodwink the voters of louisiana , i believe he should be rejected for what he is and what he stands for mr duke insists that he has undergone a christian conversion that steered him away from his past bigotry but he continues to make comments that distinctly echo the views he espoused when the swastika and the burning cross were his favorite political symbols in an appearance on the cbs interview show donahue , which was broadcast in most of the country today , he was asked by phil donahue , do you think the holocaust is exaggerated by jews \? mr duke replied of course there were terrible atrocities in europe and i condemn that and there were terrible atrocities as well in the soviet union and , i oppose any oppression of people and i think there is a lot of the closest thing that i know to the policies of germany in this country is the socalled affirmative action or quota systems they had quotas in germany as well on the basis of race i do n't think you should have racial preferences in a televised debate this evening mr duke said of course i apologize for things that i have said that have been intolerant and improper and i do repudiate the klan or any other racist organization or intolerant organization that exists in this state or in this country i think we have to all work together , but you do n't make up for past discrimination by putting new discrimination on people with these affirmative actions programs and policies mr edwards responded mr duke has given us 20 years of hate and hurt if he is really reformed , let him go back into the community and give us 20 years of healing and help and then come back and ask to be governor the most extensive public opinion poll made public since the open primary shows mr edwards gaining considerable strength from mr roemer s supporters in the past polls often understated mr duke s popularity because many of his backers were reluctant to admit their support for him even so , those polls tended to show him gaining strength as his campaigns developed this most recent poll , however , conducted by the marketing research institute of jackson , miss , shows mr duke actually losing momentum as the runoff nears the poll involved two surveys of separate samples of 800 registered voters the first was conducted between oct 22 and 24 the second was taken between oct 30 and nov 4 the surveys had a margin of error of plus or minus three and a half percentage points the respondents who said they either favored mr edwards or were leaning toward voting for him rose to 554 percent from 492 percent between the two surveys meanwhile , mr duke s support dropped to 333 percent from 397 percent , with 11 percent of the respondents saying they were undecided the survey also found that 58 percent of former roemer backers were leaning toward mr edwards
harry j hartley was chosen last month from 117 candidates to be the 12th president of the university of connecticut a 52yearold native of pennsylvania who has spent his entire career in public higher education , dr hartley came to uconn in 1972 as a professor of educational finance , served the school three years as dean of the school of education and seven years as vice president for finance and administration he is wellliked on campus , chosen by the student newspaper as man of the year in 1978 , and by the faculty senate as distinguished professor of the year in 1984 when his selection was announced during a basketball game at the university s new gampel pavilion , the crowd of students , faculty members and alumni rose and shouted , harry ! harry ! the walls of his office at storrs are lined with cards , and the tables covered with flowers , from wellwishers in a recent interview in that office , dr hartley discussed his plans here are some excerpts from the conversation q with all the financial and other problems facing the state and its institutions , why did you want to become uconn s president \? a how much different is that from being its chief fiscal officer \? to me , it is n't that much different , and i really think a person familiar with financial issues has the right background for connecticut in 1990 i trust my judgment better than i would someone who is n't in finance but recessions come and go it s the economic cycle i think it will be nice to plan for the economic recovery q a lot was made of the fact that your immediate predecessors were here only a few years how much did your being here 19 years have to do with your selection , and how long are you going to be here \? a i'm not going to dwell on that , but i would simply say that with the last three presidents , and i did serve under all three of them as a fiscal vice president , it began to look like uconn was a stepping stone each one had the same pattern each one came from outside , each one stayed exactly five years , and then each one went back outside there was a view , and it s coming out now as i read editorials and letters and so on , that there ought to be someone from connecticut , someone from uconn , capable of doing this , who is committed to staying at the university of connecticut i think i fit that mold i plan to retire here , and i 've said that to anyone who has asked me q there were 117 candidates for the job if you were running the search , would you have hired someone without interviewing more than one of them \? a well , eight of the trustees did interview the three finalists some of the others met some of the finalists as i understand it , they were eventually down to two , because one of the finalists withdrew , and the other person had not been a president , was from out of state and was not familiar with connecticut i think the other trustees asked the screening committee , what do you think \? the key thing in selecting any administrator is not the absolute values of the individual but ratherthe fit what is the institution , what are its needs right now , and what skills does that person have \? you may have an outstanding candidate , but it may not be the right fit q is that fit one reason you seem to be enjoying such popularity among faculty , students , legislators , alumni and so on \? a i guess the answer is yes i'm very humbled by this i do n't know if you saw that first game at gampel , but when you get a standing ovation , when you get students chanting , harry ! harry ! i had goosebumps , i had tears but my hat still fits a good percentage of it is what i represent it s not harry , it s that i represent blue and white i care about uconn if there is one thing i understand it s the organizational culture of uconn i think that s what the reaction was q is that going to help you \? a one way it s going to help me is that we are a united family right now for example , the thomas commission made some controversial suggestions about reorganizing uconn the consultants , who were from florida , did n't understand the tradition and culture of uconn they talked about abolishing the board of trustees and abolishing the system of regional campuses a board of trustees gives us what little autonomy we have and brings decision making closer to our clients , the students and closing the regional campuses would make us the university of storrs sometimes it takes that external threat to unite the family and i do intend to build on it q you have some tough decisions ahead of you is that good relationship going to hinder that process \? a yes , but i 've made tough decisions before as the chief fiscal officer many of the decisions i 've had to make were against people , to reduce staffing levels i try to make the decisions as fairly and objectively as i can , but i'm very sensitive to the fact that any negative decision i make affects real , live human beings there is no pleasant way to offer up cuts , but i'm going to try to do it as fairly as i can q governor weicker has suggested some state agencies could face as much as a 20 percent cut in their budget how would uconn deal with that \?
philadelphia , jan 5 joe gibbs had made a pact with his players , and the washington redskins wanted to fulfill their side of the bargain in their playoff showdown here today with the philadelphia eagles coach gibbs made a commitment to us early in the week by saying that he would do his part in preparing us for the playoffs , said monte coleman , a 12thyear redskin linebacker he said he had never worked harder on a game plan he said that all of the coaches had never worked harder they really had done their homework and had done their part we were bent on doing ours this redskin team , which gibbs had said would play so efficiently one week this season and then look like elmer and the boys in the next , coalesced and picked apart the eagles today , snuffing randall cunningham and exploiting the eagles' rowdy defense for a 206 victory here before 65 , 287 fans the showing was especially gratifying for gibbs and his crew because they had been dismantled here nearly two months ago in a 2814 monday night loss to the eagles in which nine redskins left with injuries there was none of that on this cold afternoon full of big plays , most of them by the redskins , and one disputed one , a fumble return for an apparent eagle touchdown , which was called back just before halftime the redskins watched philadelphia spurt to a 60 edge , then shut out the eagles on their last 12 possessions they rushed cunningham , the eagles' star quarterback , with discipline , with each pass rusher remaining in his lanes and with the ends keeping cunningham cooped up on offense , the redskins threw a variety of formations at the eagles and featured balance 35 runs , 31 passes philadelphia s fierce pass rushers , who had knocked two redskins quarterbacks out of the last meeting this time failed to sack mark rypien gibbs credited washington s focus and precision to veterans like coleman , russ grimm , don warren and darrell green , super bowl champions all , who grabbed the younger players by their jerseys in practices this week and in the game , bringing them along to victory our guys really prepared well , and that s what showed , said gibbs , whose playoff record improved to 123 i 've been really blessed to have seven or eight guys here who are n't loud , who know how to win , who can lead and cause the other guys to jump in that s what happened today not for the eagles philadelphia had begun talking before the game about a possible matchup with the san francisco 49ers , just as they had last season before losing to the rams in a playoff game here now the eagles are 03 under buddy ryan and with cunningham in playoff games cunningham \( 15 of 29 , 205 passing yards , no touchdowns , one interception and 80 rushing yards today \) was even pulled by ryan for one series in the second half jim mcmahon came in and threw three straight incomplete passes maybe he was trying to get me more pumped up and make something happen , cunningham said about ryan s ploy i ca n't control that i do n't worry about it cunningham had plenty to worry about , given the redskins' defense , which sacked him five times it s hard to win a ball game when you do n't block anybody , ryan said i thought a different pitcher might get something going , but it did n't make any difference byars catches two no eagle wide receiver made a catch until the final quarter keith byars , cunningham s favorite target , caught only two passes , both in the second half the redskins and eagles had talked before kickoff about the playoffs bringing out the best in all of the participants no eagle fan in veterans stadium needed to be convinced of that through the first half when spirits swung exceedingly high and then desperately low the eagles dominated the game through the first 20 minutes , building a 60 lead on field goals of 37 and 28 yards by roger ruzek the redskins , beginning a drive on their 32 with 8 15 left in the half , rode a 28yard pass to art monk , a 23yard bootleg , a backside screen pass to earnest byner and monk s 16yard scoring grab to a 76 lead with 5 54 left cunningham scrambles after the next kickoff , philadelphia moved from its 20 to the washington 25 , with the big plays being cunningham s 26yard scramble and a 15yard personalfoul penalty against the redskins' darryl grant then a holding penalty against the guard bruce collie pushed the eagles to their 35 with 2 49 remaining in the half , heath sherman fumbled , and alvin walton recovered at the washington 30 one minute 50 seconds were left when another eagle turnover green s interception at midfield set up the half s critical play rypien passed 15 yards to byner and then 18 to byner then , at the philadelphia 17 , he tried byner again , in the right flat ben smith , a rookie cornerback , was lurking smith flattened byner and scooped up byner s apparent fumble and scampered 88 yards to the end zone although the onfield officials ruled the play a fumble and a touchdown , replay officials ruled the ground had caused byner s fumble that returned the ball to washington at the eagles' 6 field goal by lohmiller the crowd was angry so were the eagles their defense kept washington out of the end zone , and chip lohmiller booted a 20yard field goal with four seconds left in the half to give washington its 106 halftime lead the eagles led in rushing yards in the first half \( 6937 \) but washington led in passing yards \( 15176 \) we went in at halftime thinking , 'well , it ca n't get much worse than this , ' said jerome brown , the eagles' defensive tackle but it did redskins vs 49ers in the third quarter , lohmiller s 19yard field goal and gary clark s 3yard scoring catch put washington too far ahead of the eagles' struggling offense the redskins will play at san francisco next weekend if chicago defeats new orleans or at the meadowlands against the giants if new orleans wins who cares where we go \? said tim johnson , who had one crunching sack of cunningham the main thing is we 're going we knew what the deal was today cunningham is one dangerous dude but today , we were one dangerous and united team photos randall cunningham

lexington , va , april 3 it has been more than a month since breakout , the mudandglory ritual by which freshmen at the virginia military institute achieve the school s version of manhood forced into a blinding mud bath , they wrestle upperclassmen until they can crawl , clamber and tug each other up two steep hills once atop the hills , these firstyear students are no longer rats , whose faults in posture or uniform could doom them to verbal assaults and dozens of pushups they are ready to take up the burden of tradition at this 152yearold institution , a place where tradition is a virtue second only to honor central to the vmi tradition , according to the institute s students , faculty and administrators , is its maleness central to its 259 million budget is the 9 million provided this year by the state no problem with tradition lawyers for the justice department will argue in federal district court in roanoke on thursday that tradition is fine , but sex discrimination

here , you 'd still get a military education , but it would n't be vmi for guillermo caredo , 21 , a bolivian firstclassman , the inclusion of women in the cadet corps would be death it would be the utter nullification of everything that s here at vmi today , said mr caredo in many ways , vmi seems a throwback to the 1950 s , or perhaps even the 1850 s , when the hazy blue hills that surround the school guarded some of the country s richest grain farms the monuments that stand between the forbidding buildings here are few there is one to stonewall jackson , the vmi professor who became the

mayor david n dinkins says that he will seek to build a broader consensus on how his administration should handle the problems of the homeless before he begins scattering homeless shelters in neighborhoods across the city the mayor said his approach would be to find the common ground and build from there on an issue that has left his administration besieged with criticism from communities and their elected officials we must turn down the rhetorical heat while turning up the substantive discussions , mr dinkins said in a statement wait for recommendations mr dinkins said he would defer submitting formal proposals on two dozen sites until a mayoral commission headed by andrew cuomo makes comprehensive recommendations on homeless policy late next month that is precisely what the city council and other politicians have been urging since before mr dinkins released his plan in october his aides said this new stance was effectively an acknowledgment that their proposal for breaking up large shelters for single men and women and building smaller ones with better services many in middleclass areas had unleashed such an uproar , and in their view been so misunderstood , that it was for all practical purposes paralyzed no real progress could be made , they reasoned , until the whole issue was hashed out , specifically in mr cuomo s commission mr dinkins he had asked mr cuomo to hold four more hearings , the first of them at city hall today senior mayoral aides were quick to play down the announcement , saying it stated the obvious , and would have little practical impact since they had never intended to begin landuse reviews until next spring anyway they said they were not scrapping the thrust of their plan to improve care for single men and women , generally considered the most troubled part of the homeless population because many of them are mentally ill or suffer from addictions mr dinkins first announced his new stance in a written statement issued over the weekend he elaborated on it in a letter yesterday to peter f vallone , the city council speaker it does not mean we 're going to revamp the whole plan , said deputy mayor bill lynch we 're not he said the administration was moving forward to solicit alternative proposals for sites in a 90day comment period that ends next month but other officials have not offered alternatives , and the political significance of the mayor s move seemed aimed at breaking a political logjam because mr vallone has bitterly opposed the plan and urged the mayor to rethink it even mr cuomo has raised doubts about just how such shelters would work and who would run them the mayor s statement seemed a tactical retreat aimed at soothing such concerns and giving both mr vallone and himself some political cover , which was one of the reasons for appointing a blueribbon commission in the first place open to criticism mr vallone and the mayor s critics have said the administration left itself open to trouble by releasing the list of 35 potential sites without adequate explanation of the treatment programs at them yesterday , mr vallone said the mayor s statement was a healthy sign that a cooperative effort can be achieved the mayor s plan is meant to conform with legal requirements for a fiveyear blueprint for sheltering the homeless it comes as the onset of winter aggravates the problems of the homeless and as transit officials are themselves grappling with new policies to keep the homeless from loitering in subway stations and bus terminals in his statement yesterday , mr vallone welcomed the mayor s decision to postpone any further action until the cuomo commission reports that prompted the mayor to issue a clarifying letter to mr vallone last night , stressing that he had asked for more hearings to insure that our proposal has been informed by the broadest possible public input before the sites are submitted for review by the council however , this neither requires nor implies a delay , mr dinkins s letter said , since the formal review was not to begin until spring mr cuomo , the governor s son , who runs a nonprofit group that builds housing for the homeless , said the more substantive the dialogue , the greater the process there s been enough rhetoric on the issue to last us for quite some time the mayor s trying to say , 'put substance over rhetoric let cooler heads prevail' in a sign of the stress he is under on the topic , mr dinkins gave vent to a rare burst of public temper with a knot of hecklers who repeatedly interrupted his remarks at a ceremony on the steps of city hall yesterday honoring human rights as the mayor recounted the privations he saw in squatter camps on his recent trip to south africa , a handful of squatters from the area around tompkins square park , where the city recently bulldozed shanties , asked why he did not express more concern for the homeless here as mr dinkins tried to explain , the hecklers kept yelling and finally mr dinkins shouted back , just shut up a minute ! as the crowd of about 50 ministers there for the rights ceremony cheered if you are as committed as you claim to be , listen a minute , the mayor told the hecklers , who carried a sign reading , lord mayor dinkins visits south african shantytowns because none exist in new york , god bless america if you would direct your attention where it belongs , if you would recognize that the federal government has abandoned our cities , instead of trying to disrupt a legitimate effort about apartheid in south africa , you might get more support for your effort
nasa s proposed space station continues to grind forward , propelled more by momentum than common sense last month it survived an effort to kill it in the house , and last week it was approved for another year of funding by the senate appropriations committee but as the full senate prepares to vote on the extravagant project , it needs to ask itself one critical question is n't there a better way to perform the primary mission of this costly platform \? the answer , almost assuredly , is yes even after a redesign that reduced its size and cost , the station will remain a white elephant , providing small gains while costing more than 30 billion to build it would be wiser to replace this station with cheaper and probably superior alternatives the shocking surprise is how little the station would contribute to the nation s longrange space goals president bush has called for a permanent colony on the moon early in the next century , followed by a mission to mars by the year 2019 to determine how to do it , he appointed a distinguished panel of experts , called the synthesis group , which tapped the expertise of dozens of government laboratories and scores of aerospace companies the panel proposed four different trips to the moon and mars none would use the space station as a stepping stone most of the arguments for the station are specious the station is not likely to capture the public s imagination , thereby inspiring youngsters to become scientists or engineers and enhancing the nation s prestige soviet cosmonauts have orbited the earth for as long as a year in the space station mir without exciting much attention it s hard to believe that american astronauts on a somewhat bigger station would make the heart pound nor is the station needed for materials research in low gravity , the key mission for its early years industrial and scientific interest in such research has been waning and while the process of building and maintaining the station in orbit would provide valuable engineering experience , such experience could surely be gained from space projects of more central importance the only vital mission for a space station , virtually all experts agree , is to obtain the biomedical data needed to insure the safety of astronauts on the harsh , yearslong journey to mars and back radiation and weightlessness are both potentially harmful , and much remains to be learned about coping with them for some studies , a laboratory in space is essential but the proposed station will offer only limited capabilities for its astronomical price the data will be slow in coming , since the key human and animal studies will not even start until after the turn of the century and the national academy of sciences is concerned that biomedical research on the multipurpose station is not being given adequate priority , space , power , funding or crew support cheaper alternatives might well produce the same or even better information the institute of electrical and electronics engineers , for example , has estimated that a smaller , potentially more capable station , devoted solely to biomedical studies , would cost less than 10 billion other scientists urge that sophisticated american instruments be placed aboard the soviet mir , thus providing some of the necessary human data far faster none of these or several other proposed alternatives are perfect but they warrant intensive study before the nation is irrevocably committed to the current overpriced design the attack on the space station has been characterized as an assault on the manned space program , on big science projects and on investment in the future when the present is so needy it has all those elements but it is also remarkable how many critics are strong supporters of manned space exploration they simply oppose this particular station as a costly diversion given the sorry history of government technology programs , the space station is certain to be plagued by delays and cost overruns it will eat up funds better spent on more pressing national needs or on developing powerful new rockets and machines required for truly exciting exploration of the solar system
tokyo japan s auto companies are emerging from the recession in the united states with a far bigger slice of that market than they had two years ago , but the political problems from their success in the united states have persisted in the first six months of this year , japanese companies supplied just less than 30 percent of all the passenger cars sold in the united states an increase of more than four percentage points in market share since 1989 in recent interviews , top executives of japanese auto makers attributed their gains to their quick success in marketing new lines of luxury cars like the acura by honda and the lexus by toyota they also said their willingness to invest in new factories and research and development , even as their profits were badly hurt during the recession , had led to continual improvements in many of their cars many analysts agree american auto executives , meanwhile , point more to what they say are new and more subtle forms of unfair trade practices by the japanese to be sure , the japanese auto makers have not been immune to the downturn in the united states , but they have suffered far less , in terms of declining profits and sales , than their american competitors the contrast between the conditions of the american and japanese auto industries is striking while detroit , reeling from billions of dollars in losses , sheds thousands of workers and closes plants , some japanese auto companies complain of a shortage of workers just the other day , for example , toyota said it would begin to rehire its japanese retirees but for the japanese , crossing the 30 percent barrier in the united states brings a host of political problems among them increased pressure to assure that american auto makers fare better in japan and that the japanese sharply raise their use of american auto parts to their surprise , the japanese companies are discovering that few of those problems have eased because japan now produces a significant percentage of its cars in the united states , with american workers we still have to become far more americanized , shoichiro irimajiri , a top executive at the honda motor company , said in a recent interview it took 80 years for ford and gm to be considered domestic producers in europe and it might take us that long mr irimajiri was the architect of honda s manufacturing strategy in the united states nearly all of the japanese manufacturers' marketshare gain in the united states came from japaneseowned factories in north america these socalled transplant factories of toyota , honda , nissan and others are not subject to the voluntary export restraints on which detroit has relied in the last decade to suppress japanese competition similar plans for europe as a result , actual exports of japanese cars to the united states have fallen precipitously in recent months in fact , this strategy of basing plants where the sales are is seen as so successful that japan is planning to add capacity for at least a million cars a year in europe , its next big target the success of the transplants has not dispelled new american complaints about the huge contribution that autos and auto parts make to the american trade deficit with japan upward of 70 percent of the deficit partnerships between japanese concerns and each of the big three auto companies did not prevent detroit from filing charges several months ago that their japanese competitors were dumping vehicles , especially minivans dumping is selling goods at below fairmarket value to drive out competitors and for the last three months , american officials , led by vice president dan quayle during a recent visit to tokyo , have hammered at a longstanding sore point the continuing failure of american car makers to do more than dent japan s own auto market , the world s secondlargest national market after the united states american auto makers have long contended that the japanese market is rigged against them because of the expense and difficulties of establishing dealerships but it is a complaint for which japanese executives have no patience they say the success of mercedesbenz , volkswagen and bmw in japan is evidence that american car makers are simply not trying hard enough no one else is going to help them while they are sitting on their hands , yutaka kume , the president of the nissan motor company , said in an interview recently mr quayle , he added , is wrong about the market being closed no american auto manufacturer has designed a car specifically for the japanese market , he said , and none builds vehicles here recession strategies differ in interviews over the last several weeks , the top executives of several of japan s auto companies have expressed little surprise that their competitive position has improved so much in the united states detroit auto makers , they said , were unprepared to deal with the recession there is still a basic , fundamental difference between japanese and us manufacturers in a time of downturn , said mr irimajiri , who spent most of the 1980 s at honda s assembly plant in marysville , ohio the japanese bring out new models and try to revitalize their lines they use a recession to rebuild their capacity the big three tend to delay introductions or cut the budget to develop new models they tend to wait

few businesses have such a long list of enemies and such a short list of friends as the billboard industry local activists and a broad range of specialinterest groups regard billboards as clutter , disfiguring roads and buildings across the country healthconscious activists hate the big signs because they are often used to push tobacco and alcohol and now the biggest threat of all congress , in a bill recently emerged from committee , is considering banning billboards along some 350 , 000 miles of federal interstates and primary roads that is a grim prospect for what in recent years has been a low to nogrowth business last year , the industry , which rarely uses the word signs , had revenues of just under 15 billion virtually unchanged from the year before according to the outdoor advertising association of america , a washingtonbased trade group the industry is comprised of three giant companies , some mediumsized ventures and almost 600 momandpop operations most of these smaller companies , which together make up roughly 64 percent of the industry , according to the association , bill less than 1 million a year on the signs they erect the momandpop customers are mostly local advertisers that cannot afford costlier radio and television commercials or newspaper advertisements the three giants of the business deal mostly with national advertisers who use the space to augment their other campaigns first in size is the patrick media group , based in scranton , pa then there s the gannett outdoor group , a new york citybased division of the gannett company , followed by lamar advertising , based in baton rouge , la of the 500 , 000 or so traditional billboards across the country , patrick media has about 36 , 000 , gannett has 25 , 000 , and lamar has about 24 , 000 none of them discloses earnings from their billboard operations just saying no tobacco and alcohol are n't welcome the billboard industry is very sensitive about who its advertisers are tobacco companies , which are barred from advertising on television and radio , form the single largest category of billboard users , a sore point for the industry and one it would like to change in the first quarter of last year , the tobacco industry spent about 41 million on billboard advertisements , down from 55 million for the same period in 1989 that continues a downward trend in tobacco advertising and one that has been afflicting outdoor advertising for about nine years overall tobacco advertising revenue dropped to 200 million in 1989 from 358 million in 1988 the outdoor advertising association has not yet released figures for last year the secondlargest billboard users are retailers , who spent 156 million in 1989 business products \( from fax machines to car phones \) came in third with 130 million and the automotive industry was fourth , with 127 million beer , wine and liquor companies another category that brings the industry criticism form the eighthlargest group of advertisers in 1989 , brewers and distillers spent about 91 million on roadside ads , down from 112 million in 1988 that decline , too , is continuing last year some of the industry s most active critics whitewashed billboards advertising cigarettes and alcohol in some urban black neighborhoods in response to the protests , the outdoor advertising association recommended that its members voluntarily limit the number of billboards in any market that carry ads for products that cannot be sold to minors the trade group also asked its members to keep the controversial advertisements at least 500 feet from schools , hospitals and houses of worship patrick , gannett and lamar have since set aside about 18 , 000 billboards where ads for anything not for sale to minors will not appear the industry has also sought a more wholesome mix of advertisers that has helped prop up sales despite the decreases in tobacco and alcohol , our revenue numbers are generally going up because other categories are growing , said b roland mcelroy , president of the outdoor advertising association among the categories of fastgrowing outdoor advertisers are healthcare , entertainment and amusement companies we 've done very well in packaged goods and in the apparel category and in the entertainment field , said donald davidson , president of gannett outdoor gannett has not only had increasing success in reaching the packaged consumer goods advertisers like colgatepalmolive and procter gamble , he said , but has also found that hollywood has rediscovered the power of billboards how and where location determines almost everything in the old days , advertisements were painstakingly painted onto wooden billboards by workers hoisted high above the ground by cranes or supported by scaffolding the gradual appearance of the ad was drama in itself today , there are many more options for designing , installing and servicing billboard faces the industry still uses painters , but they are rarely seen most of that work is now done in a factory and trucked in sections for a quick mounting it costs about 3 , 000 to print a standard 14footby48foot vinyl advertisement , and it s done by computer
washington , april 30 the bush administration today disclosed the details of its plan for a significant increase in the supervision of the governmentsponsored companies that help finance home purchases , higher education and agriculture the whole purpose here is to avoid another financial mess , said jerome h powell , an assistant treasury secretary , referring to the collapse of the governmentsponsored enterprise that protected depositors at savings and loan associations that collapse will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in a report to congress , treasury officials said an independent bureau should be set up within the department of housing and urban development to oversee the companies that help finance one in every four residential mortgages fannie mae and freddie mac the companies are the federal national mortgage assocation , known as fannie mae , and the federal home loan mortgage corporation , or freddie mac , which have posted record profits in the last year they are now overseen by fewer than a halfdozen officials at the housing agency , whose authority to control the companies is in dispute , and who insist they are unable to control or monitor the companies effectively the proposed bureau would have the authority to set more stringent regulatory standards and capital levels , which is the cushion that could be drawn upon should financial difficulties occur its director would be appointed by the president , with the consent of the senate , and would report to the housing secretary tougher plan avoided the recommendation stops short of a more stringent proposal , the removal of fannie mae and freddie mac from agency supervision to a different regulatory body with greater independence the idea had been considered by the treasury through last week , and was only recently dropped after being vetoed by the officials at the white house and office of management and budget , which by some accounts had been heavily lobbied by representatives of the government enterprises but an independent regulatory agency for the enterprises will soon be recommended by the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , which has also been studying the governmentbacked lenders the treasury also recommended tighter control over the other leading governmentsponsored enterprises , or gse s the student loan marketing association , or sallie mae , the federal agriculture mortgage corporation , or farmer mac , the farm credit system and the federal home loan bank system no imminent financial threat treasury officials and independent auditors have emphasized that none of the companies , which hold implicit and explicit government guarantees of more than 1 trillion , pose an imminent financial threat to the federal budget but the report also states that the government cannot adequately control or monitor the companies now , and that their chance of encountering financial difficulty is more than a hypothetical possibility executives at fannie mae and freddie mac said that they were studying the report , which was issued late in the day , but that in general they supported its conclusions , particularly those that would continue to put them under the department of housing and urban development in general , our initial reaction is very positive , said david r jeffers , a fannie mae spokesman we 've always said we prefer to be under hud a housing gse should be regulated by a regulator that has an understanding of housing leland c brendsel , freddie mac s chairman and chief executive , said we have a responsibility to our stockholders , to our customers , and to the nation s homeowners , and that s what drives this company it s a mistake to think it is regulation or law that is the only mechanism to ensure responsible behavior s p rates agencies as part of treasury s report , the standard poor s corporation assessed the likelihood that a governmentsponsored enterprise might not be able to meet its future obligations from its own resources based on the assessment , s p assigned the farm credit system a bb rating , or speculative grade the federal home loan bank system and sallie mae aaa , or top grade freddie mac a , or medium grade , and fannie mae a , or medium grade the ratings do not supersede the triplea ratings on the securities of most of the governmentsponsored enterprises , but were an exercise intended to determine the risks to the government now the treasury report , which provides the basis for legislation that mr powell , the assistant treasury secretary , said would be introduced shortly , noted that the bush administration s proposed regulatory structure was intended to avoid the problem of the regulators being captured by the entities they regulate , particularly if the enterprises and the government departments become involved in the same projects
for some magazine publishers , 25 pages of articles critical of advertising might be considered commercial suicide , particularly when they are featured on the cover then there is the utne reader the articles , in the magazine s januaryfebruary issue , decry the pervasiveness of advertising in everyday life but rather than see the editorial content as a source of indigestion for advertising executives , craig neal , the utne reader s publisher in minneapolis , insisted that its frankness would make the magazine all the more appealing the magazine , which consists largely of articles reprinted from small magazines and alternative newspapers , guarantees advertisers a circulation of 260 , 000 the coverage advances the image of utne reader advertisers as being a cut above the rest , of not being afraid , mr neal said and the kind of marketer that would advertise in his magazine is likely not to sponsor the practices attacked in the magazine , like aiming inappropriate ad messages at children or placing ads in doctors' offices utne s advertisers include naturalfood companies and general motors' saturn division , and none of them has complained , mr neal said

rocky hill hard times beget anxiety in the art world , as in any other , and for some museums and galleries the solution seems to be generating more paper never one copy of a press release when six will do seems to be the order of the day now artists , however , have their own ways of attracting attention , and these have not changed in the current fiscal crisis some write , implying that they should go to the head of the line just for having slogged through the critic s reviews of other artists others highlight their own names in announcements of group shows but now the unimaginable has happened an exhibition by an artist who wants not to be known the assemblages at the magenta gallery here are by j doe , who offers no biography and did not appear at the show s opening faced with the inconvenience of using his or her every time a pronoun was called for , the reviewer prevailed upon the dealer , alicia nieves , to disclose at least the artist s sex , which is female mrs nieves also provided an explanation for the endearing modesty fond of mystery , ms doe believes it is better served by allowing the work to speak for itself and , anyway , does n't want the job of explaining it most anons are dead , but this one is very much alive and , seemingly , aware of the social element in art appreciation certainly , artists , dealers , collectors and critics are united in believing the art to be the thing but still , an exhibition of contemporary work without signposts \? ms doe must be testing the art public s love of art the artist may also be battling waste of words and the paper they are written on , for she is , mrs nieves says , an ardent environmentalist many of the objects used are made of nondegradable plastic plastic that goes to make art is plastic that does not clutter up the earth the only thing wrong with this idea is that the mailorder houses that pack dry goods in plastic pellets \( lest they break \) are even less likely to desist once they discover they are contributing to culture her work being without naivete , compulsiveness or narcissism , ms doe can hardly be classified as an amateur but there is no reason to suppose that she is a professional in hiding , either , or that she has had much formal training \( drawings might prove the point , but there are none \) what is clear , though , is her knowledge of 20thcentury art representing minimalism is the first work in the show , a freestanding construction made of two brass bands about two inches wide one is bent into a step form with supporting diagonal and , garnished with a twist of cable , cantilevered over the rectangle made from the other homage is paid to louise nevelson with several wall pieces painted black emerging is a vertical mold like an egg box that has seemingly been burned and that accommodates five fake lemons painted black face to face , a horizontal mold with irregular forms , is embellished with a small mirror and a pair of smiling lips , photographed the mold in secret games , another vertical , is the color of raspberries mixed with cream , and its cavities are sprinkled with beads that look like salmon caviar perhaps because of the colors , this relief has a mildly disagreeable presence , although it is nothing beside the show s piece de resistance titled day sleeper , it is a cubic box on its side that contains a baby doll suspended by one arm from the ceiling the infant is clad in an undergarment stained with a trickle of blood , and it hangs against broken mirror on the back wall and over vertical shards of glass imbedded in the floor a nylon stocking is stretched over the opening of the box as if to keep out the flies though no one has duplicated the horror of the assemblages that the film maker bruce conner used to make , ms doe comes close with this item there is something macabre , too , about the upended flatiron with its innards replaced by chunks of a plasterlike substance painted black , some green marble and a metal object shaped like a buoy with a flag the artist has her humorous moments , as in the small shrine occupied by a bottle of vodka and screened by orange netting but her old pez candy stands filled with miscellaneous objects marbles , coins , colored thread and the like are fussy and inconclusive the best of the decorative structures is the wall piece involving an irregular brown plastic box containing studs that are ornamented with pictures the size of commemorative stamps these could be matchbox labels from a far eastern culture , and their nearfluorescent colors rival those of the cartons doing duty as sculpture pedestals ms doe does her best work when inspired by her feelings rather than by what she sees there is no question that she could be a formidable expressionist if she chose , but the work starts in 1976 and ends in 1982 and there is no indication of more to come these assemblages lack finish and do n't all make a point , but that does n't alter the general impression of a highly intelligent sensibility at work most of all , this is a great opportunity to experience art cold turkey the show closes april 30 magenta is at 131 washington street \( route 518 \) and is open monday through saturday from 10 am to 5 pm photo day sleeper , by artist who wished to remain anonymous
there is n't a player in the national basketball association who has n't been touched or beaten off the dribble , for that matter by magic johnson but none more so than the young point guards of the league , gradeschoolers when johnson first appeared as a 6foot9inch curiosity in los angeles and proceeded to revolutionize the position there has n't been another point guard like johnson , the body so big , the leadership so strong , the package so complete but those who followed johnson , if they had any vision to their game , learned their trade from the manual he wrote they dreamed of being like him he was their idol , and he was sensitive to their worship , regardless of how good they really were when i was trying to make the decision about whether to come out of school last spring , i called him up , said kenny anderson , who one day soon will be good enough to carry on in the tradition of the retired lakers captain he told me , 'if you feel you ca n't grow anymore and have accomplished everything you can as a college player , then maybe you should move on' but he also told me that i should go back to school some day and finish my degree nets to play knicks tonight for now , anderson is only cramming to learn a pro offense his next opportunity to demonstrate how quick a study he is will be tonight , when the nets visit the knicks at madison square garden anderson , who will again work off the bench as the backup for mookie blaylock , has taken those minutes from tate george , who has also taken much advice from magic johnson , as have the knicks' point guards , mark jackson and greg anthony there are undoubtedly players in every city who could tell a story like the one jackson did the night johnson revealed he had contracted the virus that causes aids magic always just seemed to take an interest in me , jackson said he would say nice things to me when i was a rookie he called me up and invited me to play in his charity game but what really got me was when i had my knee scoped during my second year i was down , worried because i 'd never really been hurt before i was in the hospital for a couple of hours and when i got home , there s a knock at the door and there s this big delivery of balloons i open the card it s from magic i ca n't tell you how great that made me feel a member of johnson s team disbelief was tate george s reaction when the telephone rang in his dorm room at the university of connecticut one day in the spring of 1990 , weeks after his buzzerbeating jump shot had advanced his team to another round of the national collegiate athletic association tournament hello , this is earvin , george recalled johnson saying george handed the phone to his roommate with the assignment to determine if this was someone s idea of a gag it was n't johnson was calling to recruit george for his agent , lon rosen , who was seaching for lowerechelon national basketball association players who would enjoy being part of johnson s marketing team george was invited out to los angeles johnson became a studentteacher to him george spent part of last summer with johnson the two remain close , george having spoken to johnson two days ago , before johnson and his wife , cookie , left to vacation in hawaii more than just a player he s special , george said once i was signed up with lon , he could 've just said , ok , we 've got him but it was like he wanted me to know everything he knew about the business to me , knowing earvin has been the best thing about being in the league admiring him from afar , though not too far , is anthony , who grew up in las vegas , nev , where the lakers' games were televised i remember watching the sports highlights on tv the day after he played his first game with the lakers , the knick rookie said at the buzzer , he jumped into kareem abduljabbar s arms and kareem gave him this look but you could tell he was different i 've watched him his entire career him being 69 , and me being 61 , our games were n't the same but it s his presence and his class i 've tried to emulate the fact that he cares about people , that you can make it and still care rebounds kenny anderson has played at madison square garden once before , as a georgia tech freshman against fordham he remembered scoring 19 points and handing out 14 assists he said that being so far behind after missing all of training camp and the first three games of the season will detract from his first pro game in new york city nets coach bill fitch is hoping jud buechler will want to rejoin the club if he clears waivers today buechler was cut to make room for anderson within the salary cap despite what he said were recent promises that his 300 , 000 pact would be guaranteed photos battle of the rookie point guards the knicks' greg anthony , left , and kenny anderson of the nets \( barton silverman the new york times , left michelle v agins the new york times \)
jeffrey foote stood on 20th avenue in bensonhurst yesterday , midway between the spots where the rev al sharpton was stabbed on saturday and where yusuf k hawkins died in 1989 , to watch protesters marching in support of mr sharpton i'm here to show respect to reverend sharpton , the 34yearold contractor said quietly i feel hurt i'm sorry what happened yesterday to him thank god he s still alive the media like to quote the hotheads who scream stuff against him , but i live here and i think i speak for the neighborhood today we 're saying a prayer for al sharpton maybe you are , but i'm not , said mary mcguire , a retired court reporter standing nearby , who like mr foote is white how can you be saved by a prayer if you do n't have a soul \? he s only interested in inciting riots he wants blood he wants to prevent his own people getting ahead by antagonizing whites he s an absolute mongrel weary of confrontation a few jeers greeted the protesters yesterday , but bensonhurst residents seemed mainly weary of it all they were sorry that mr sharpton had been stabbed in their brooklyn neighborhood in some cases , if only because it would mean more publicity , more animosity and more marches the incident was really very sad , said pearl safti , the owner of klassi kids discount boutique at 7412 20th avenue , along the marchers' route i'm afraid it s just going to cause more problems , and it s unfair to keep blaming a neighborhood for what a few hotheads did we 're innocent we just happen to live nearby and they keep coming here shouting at us we feel violated , in a way bensonhurst , an insular , predominantly white neighborhood with shops where italian is often spoken , has felt besieged ever since a crowd of white youths ran down 20th avenue the night of aug 23 , 1989 , and surrounded mr hawkins , a 16yearold black youth he was killed , and the death prompted mr sharpton to lead protesters , mainly black , down the avenue on weekends on saturday he was about to lead the 29th march , to protest the minimal sentences handed down last week to several defendants in the case , when he was stabbed a white man from the neighborhood , michael riccardi , has been charged in the attack the stabbing inspired the 30th march , yesterday afternoon , and the several hundred protesters chanted mr sharpton s rallying cry , no justice , no peace , as they held signs reading , we love al sharpton and we know where you live 'more trouble for us' a few neighborhood residents muttered regrets that mr sharpton had survived the stabbing but even vehement critics of mr sharpton and there are plenty in bensonhurst , where his popularity seems to rival saddam hussein s expressed regret over the stabbing i would n't be surprised , said vinnie ragozzino , 16 , if sharpton is sitting in a hospital bed laughing right now and saying , 'now they 're dead' the stabbing caused an uproar , and that s all he wants all this means is more trouble for us , and we do n't want any more trouble let yusuf rest in his grave none of this is going to bring him back the rev al barozzi , associate pastor at st dominic s catholic church at 20th avenue and 74th street , discussed the stabbing in his sermon at the 10 45 mass , which was in italian later he chatted about it in english we hope that the attacker will be judged and punished as quickly as possible , father barozzi said even though people here do n't like sharpton , the vast majority deplore the behavior of this fellow people have been saying to me that nobody has the right to do violence , and nobody has the right to deny people their constitutional right to march heavy police presence there were more than 300 police officers escorting the marchers yesterday , and they probably outnumbered the spectators along the seven blocks the people in small groups scattered along the sidewalks watched the dozens of motorcycles go by and complained about how much money the police protection was costing the city they also insisted , as they have been insisting for more than a year to the hordes of reporters descending upon their neighborhood , that they have no animosity against blacks the people of bensonhurst are n't prejudiced , said cory manganaro , 23 , a resident who works at an investment bank there are plenty of blacks who work around here these marches just make the average hardworking black person look bad , because they 're so ridiculous if you 're talking prejudice , sharpton has got to be more prejudiced than any of us , because he only cares about black people being hurt laurie wagner , 28 , said that she got along fine with black employees at the roy rogers restaurant where she worked as she was heading home yesterday , an hour before the march on 20th avenue , she said that she had no intention of staying for any confrontation between the races the whole thing is so stupid , she said it s just going to make people in brooklyn look worse , and for what \? sharpton comes in here to prove something , and some stupid kid does something , and now we just have more anger and stupidity black and white have to learn to live together we do n't need this garbage
former bronx congressman robert garcia , on trial a second time for his role in the wedtech scandal , was convicted of a single count of extortion yesterday but as a result of a misunderstanding between the judge and the jury , the jury was dismissed without reaching a verdict on two other felony counts prosecutors , who had objected to the dismissal , immediately said they would seek a new trial on the remaining charges we thought we would be able to deliberate on the rest of the charges , the jury s forewoman , roxanne carver , said , and the next thing we knew we were dismissed jurors said they had been close to convicting mr garcia on at least one other charge on thursday , the jury had told the judge , david n edelstein of federal district court in manhattan , that it was unable to reach a unanimous decision but after receiving special instructions yesterday morning known as the allen charge , informing them that they could return a verdict on some counts , the jury came back with a a partial verdict the judge confers it convicted mr garcia , his wife , jane lee , and a lawyer from puerto rico , ralph vallone jr , for their dealings with the wedtech corporation , a bronxbased military contractor that collapsed in 1986 amid a tangle of illegal payments and subsequent coverups mr garcia and mr vallone each face a maximum of 20 years in prison and a 250 , 000 fine , and mrs garcia faces a maximum of 25 years and a 500 , 000 fine , although none is likely to receive such harsh punishment after the verdicts were read , the judge conferred with prosecutors and defense lawyers , telling them that in view of the earlier notes from the jury he was reluctant to continue deliberations over the objection of the prosecution , he decided to dismiss the jury the jurors , who had assumed they would be allowed to resume deliberations on the remaining counts , were stunned we were very close , said john santiago , the only man on the 11member jury , who said all but one or two people were holding out against convicting mr garcia on another count i do n't see why they rushed us no mistrial \? legal experts said such confusion on the part of the jury was not uncommon juries generally have no sense of when they 're done or when they should return partial verdicts , said john siliciano , a cornell university law professor there s nothing stupid about a jury coming out after eight days and saying this is what we have if anything , there should have been questions to the jury about how extensively they 'd reached a verdict no such questioning took place , and the judge never declared a mistrial on the outstanding counts , lawyers involved in the case said i do n't think it will be construed as a mistrial , if the court never obtained a direct statement from the jury that they were unable to agree , said h richard uviller , an expert in criminal law at columbia university sentencing in the case was scheduled for jan 6 , at which time lawyers for the garcias and mr vallone plan to file an appeal in an unusually mixed verdict , the jury found mr garcia guilty of extorting a 20 , 000 loan from wedtech executives , but did not reach a decision on whether he extorted another 76 , 000 in payments from the company or engaged in a conspiracy to commit extortion 'deeply disappointed' the jury did find mrs garcia guilty of conspiracy and of extorting 76 , 000 , but did not reach a decision on her role in the loan extortion they did not reach a decision on mr vallone s participation in the conspiracy , but found him guilty of extorting 76 , 000 , which prosecutors charged involved a roundabout scheme that had wedtech officials making payments to mr vallone for legal services , which he then funneled to mrs garcia for consulting work my wife and i are deeply disappointed , mr garcia , one of the nation s most influential hispanic politicians before his conviction forced him to resign from congress , said yesterday outside the courtroom we had hoped for better results this time mrs garcia , who called the verdict absolutely crazy , added this is the system that we live with we have not given up , we will appeal and we will continue the fight somehow , this is going to end the way we want it to the garcias were convicted of extortion in 1989 , but the conviction was thrown out and a new trial ordered last year by a federal appeals court the appeals court found that the evidence presented had supported only one of two types of extortion defined in the law , and that it was impossible to tell whether the jury had been convinced that the garcias committed that type of extortion the retrial closely resembled the original , relying heavily on the testimony of a former wedtech executive , mario moreno , who defense lawyers insisted was a selfserving liar mr vallone , 44 , was excused from the original trial because of illness the prosecutors described a 1984 lunch at an expensive manhattan restaurant which they said began the garcias' campaign to extort money from wedtech , in those days a gravy train for many politicians , one prosecutor , jeh c johnson , said at that lunch , the government charged , the garcias said they would help the company obtain government contracts , to build things like navy pontoon boats and mail bins photos mario biaggi stanley simon lyn nofziger john c

gramercy park , an elegant square where patricians and artists share quiet brownstones and keys to a private park , has long been known as the bloomsbury of new york residents consider it an oasis , the last vestige of a gentler era that edith wharton , who grew up in the neighborhood , once described as the safe daylight world of nice people and reputable doings except that lately , some of the nicest people in gramercy park are accusing each other of doings that are utterly disreputable charges of election fraud , slander , threats and worst of all a breach of good manners and fair play , have caused a group of residents to rise up against the gramercy park trustees a select and selfselecting group that clings jealously to its sovereignty over keys to the park and the planting of flowers and shrubs even harsher words have pitted tenants of the national arts club at 15 gramercy park against club officers the dispute , which began over a 5 , 000fee imposed by the trustees on each property owner , is not about money or even the placement of tulips to some , it is about change , an unwelcome word in a neighborhood that prides itself , as one resident put it , in preserving what used to be 'like that iraq affair' it is about human nature and power , said constance d gibson , the 85yearold chairwoman of the board , whose own absolute power is being contested , gingerly she spoke in airy bryn mawr tones of the insurrection it is something like that iraq affair iraq wants to get in as a leader and so does the us , and both are having a very gloomy time it is also about mrs gibson s protege , steven u leitner , a florida realestate developer who recently became a trusteeelect of the park and whose combative personality and fierce , open politicking have driven appalled residents to court to fight his ascension mr leitner refused to be interviewed for this article mr leitner , who lives at the national arts club , is also involved in lawsuits there his allies defend him as a victim of prejudice an outsider resented by oldfashioned residents but his critics paint him as a kind of zero mostel figure from the movie the producers , ingratiating himself with elderly women and bullying rivals to further his own ends the challenge to mrs gibson s authority began last winter gramercy park s 60some property owners were dismayed when the trustees assessed the cost of repairing the bluestone sidewalk around the park at 5 , 000 each for the first time in decades , a group of property owners held an election last march to fill vacancies on the board membership had recently dwindled to two from five mrs gibson and frances munnell a second election the trustees and their lawyers contested that election , and both sides agreed to hold another months later , after a sequence of maneuvers by the trustees and mr leitner that many residents described in their lawsuit as improper , three different trustees were elected , none of whom were among the dissidents' first choices mr leitner was one of them all of a sudden , these people show all this interest in the park , said robert de benedictis , a leader of the gramercy neighborhood association i did n't see them out on 'clean and green' he was referring to a day of rigorous gardening , which along with the annual flower show , is a hallowed park tradition mr de benedictis was also dismayed that nancy zuger , the leading plaintiff in the suit , had not been elected she is a member of community board no 6 and a vassar graduate , he said , who better to protect our interests \? the property owners won a temporary restraining order prohibiting the new trustees from taking office until the lawsuit is resolved changing of the keys a secret society was formed , gramercy residents for integrity of the park , also known as grip , which circulated passionate manifestoes documenting such lapses in moral integrity as campaigning too strenuously and outright cheating grip membership remains anonymous people are afraid to come out against the trusteeselect publicly , said one grip member who declined to be identified , for fear that their keys to the park will be taken away fiercely coveted keys to the park are changed once a year people copy them and loan them to their friends , mrs gibson explained and we ca n't have that , can we \? mr leitner , who is jewish , circulated a letter from one of his adversaries that he complained was antisemitic this dismayed even his supporters , who shrank from the thought that their neighborhood might harbor such unattractive sentiments i felt it was really one man speaking for himself and not for the community , said rabbi irving j bloch , whose brotherhood synagogue on gramercy park covers several lots rabbi bloch , who supports mrs gibson s leadership , described her generosity toward his congregation with the kind of reverence that william collins , the clergyman in pride and prejudice , reserved for his patroness , lady catherine de bourgh 'very , very generous'
about six million barrels of oil , weighing roughly a million tons , around 10 percent of the world s daily oil ration , are going up in smoke every day from the 550 kuwaiti wells set afire by iraqi occupiers none of the fires have yet been put out , and at the projected extinction rate of five days per well , the job could take as long as two years meanwhile , the burning wells emit a daily load of 50 , 000 tons of sulfur dioxide a prime cause of acid rain and 100 , 000 tons of sooty smoke into the atmosphere the remainder is mostly carbon dioxide scientific experts disagree on how bad the environmental consequences might be but us authorities seem to have been worried about causing a real disaster just as they controlled information about the desert war itself , they also clamped down on discussion by department of energy officials in this country about environmental impacts of fires oil spills in the middle east this is reported , along with details of the conflagration and its results , by john horgan in the may issue of scientific american the order limiting information to the media a copy of which was obtained by mr horgan was issued in writing on jan 25 , just after the war began , by the doe office in san francisco a department spokesman told me that the purpose was to deny information useful to the iraqis but it was the iraqis who set the fires and the same office told mr horgan the order was not rescinded until march 22 , well after hostilities ended , by telephone was it feared in washington that dire environmental forecasts about oilwell fires might dim enthusiasm for the war \? that seems possible , since saddam hussein threatened as early as september to destroy kuwait s wells if the allies tried to drive him out by january , few could have doubted that he would do it there s no doubt that kuwait itself has suffered what raymond henry , an american firefighting expert , called an environmental catastrophe daytime temperatures beneath the thick smoke clouds are far below normal , hospitals are jammed with respiratory patients , black rain is damaging crops and water supplies , and the fierce fires rage on farther away , estimates vary some authorities predict a global warming effect owing to an increase of as much as 5 percent in emissions of carbon dioxide others foresee a sort of nuclear winter caused by the 30odd million tons of smoke the burning wells are expected to emit in a year if only 1 percent of the smoke reaches the stratosphere , richard crutzen of the max planck institute has calculated , by the end of the year the northern hemisphere would be cooled by two degrees celsius other experts dispute such predictions but even one of them , richard small of the pacificsierra research corporation , told mr horgan that we have never seen a pollution event of this scale damage , he said , might be felt over an area extending 1 , 000 kilometers from kuwait saddam hussein s forces , of course , actually set the fires and caused this immense environmental threat he had plainly warned that he would do it , however so the us , by its decision to launch the war anyway rather than rely on noncombat pressures , bears some responsibility the administration insists it had no real alternative to war but if environmental damage from kuwaiti fires proves as bad as pessimists predict , the resulting damage and casualties may again appear out of proportion to iraq s offense already a un report concludes that iraq has been bombed back to the preindustrial age , its infrastructure destroyed , its people beset by famine and disease was that degree of destruction unavoidable or warranted \? to free kuwait s 750 , 000 nationals , for another example , the allies are estimated to have killed more than 100 , 000 of the 18 million iraqis john allen paulos of temple university , the author of innumeracy , compared that casualty rate with the population of the us and found that , had the tables been turned , more than 14 million americans would have died in the same period as for environmental damage , joel s levine of nasa , an authority on biomass burning , told mr horgan the kuwaiti well fires were the most intense burning source , probably , in the history of the world
as long as there have been hungry young rockers , there have been independent record labels , or indies , as they 're known from sun records in the 60 s to rap labels like def jam in the 80 s , the independents smallstaffed , lowbudget operations have helped steer the course of pop music even the beatles' first singles in america were released on veejay , an independent doowop label from chicago more recently , the independents have played an important role in the development of the alternative rock music scene the equivalent of the small presses , independent record companies stumble upon young talent before the huge , slothful corporations step in i have to believe that the majors will overlook some great bands and the indies will fill that void , says michael gallelli , a director of artists and repertory for columbia independents are still responsible for much of the folk , jazz , blues and gospel found in record stores but with the recent consolidation of the record business \( six conglomerates are responsible for 93 percent of all records released \) , the independent labels are in trouble at one time , underground rock stars like rem , sonic youth , the replacements , nirvana and the meat puppets all recorded for guerrilla companies like irs \( now distributed by cema \) , homestead , sst and twin tone , which released their albums when no one else would but today many of the independents face cashflow problems stemming from a slump in the record business , the defection of their most popular bands to the major labels and the financial burden of switching from lp s to cd s in the last two years , such prominent independents as enigma \( which recorded such diverse groups as the smithereens and stryper \) and coyote \( the feelies and yo la tengo \) have closed shop others have laid off employees the sharpest blow to the world of the indies occurred last may , when the record company rough trade , a leading distributor of independent labels in america and great britain , filed for bankruptcy by overextending itself in both recording and distributing , the company went heavily into debt , estimated at 13 million in the united states alone it was a real confidence shaker , says robert haber , publisher of the college media journal new music report , the collegeradio tip sheet two years ago , it would have been unheard of that rough trade would have folded combined with the economy and no one getting paid , it does n't bode well for the future of new music it s not a pretty picture the alternative music of the early 80 s was never pretty a refined outgrowth of punk and hardcore , it was brash , feisty , rooted in suburban ennui and disdain for the mainstream the music and attitude found a sizable audience of mostly confused , disgruntled collegeage rock fans suddenly it spread like wildfire , says the guitarist thurston moore , whose band , sonic youth , recorded for four independent labels homestead , neutral , blast first and sst before signing with david geffen s bigtime dgc label the replacements' let it be became a bestselling record for twin tone , with 120 , 000 albums sold to date , a huge figure for an independent it was only a matter of time before companies like cbs and warner brothers swooped in by the end of the decade , many of the leading alternative bands were sharing record company accountants with madonna and sting according to gerard cosloy , comanager of matador records , a new yorkbased independent label , the major labels are vultures they 're eager to step in and take the lead from the indies , he says and when major labels start taking bands away , there s nothing left to support the indie network even college radio , one of the last bastions of freeform radio , became more institutionalized whereas independently produced records once represented at least 30 percent of the albums played on college radio , a look at the oct 18 issue of the new music report shows that the share is down to 20 percent the turning point was the success of rem , says greg ginn , the owner of sst records and formerly the guitarist for black flag , one of sst s leading bands rem started with the ultraobscure hibtone records , then moved to irs before hitting the big time at warner brothers records in 1988 a lot of groups went chasing after that dream , mr ginn says , and it produced worse music without reaching the goal of selling more records just because you can build up sales of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 records does n't mean you can move on to a major and sell more than that \( indeed , a number of musicians who moved from the independents to the majors the mekons , husker du s bob mould , big dipper , redd kross had disappointing sales and are now without

washington , sept 14 united states army forces buried alive scores of iraqi soldiers in their trenches in the early hours of the allied ground attack that ended the persian gulf war , army commanders said this week the deaths took place during the operation in which american m1a1 tanks of the first infantry division cut lanes through a 10milewide stretch of barbed wire , minefields , bunkers and trenches north of the iraqisaudi arabian border on feb 24 as the allied ground offensive unfolded army officials said the iraqi soldiers who died remained in their trenches as plowequipped tanks dumped tons of earth and sand onto them , filling the trenches to insure that they could not be used as cover from which to fire on allied units that were poised to pour through the gaps avoiding handtohand combat the army said it knew the operation would kill iraqis who did not surrender or otherwise get out of the way , but said the tactic spared the lives of american soldiers who would have had to leave the safety of their armored vehicles and fight iraqi troops hand to hand in the trenches people somehow have the notion that burying guys alive is nastier than blowing them up with hand grenades or sticking them in gut with bayonets , said col lon maggart well it s not colonel maggart , commander of one of two brigades that led assaults on a key line of iraqi defenses , said in a telephone interview from fort riley , kan , that between 80 and 250 iraqis had been buried alive army officials said the first infantry s experiences had been the only incidents of live burials during the war at a news conference here on thursday , the pentagon spokesman , pete williams , defended the tactic and said it did not violate the geneva conventions on the conduct of warfare i do n't mean to be flippant , but there s no nice way to kill somebody in war , mr williams said the disclosure of the live burials , which were first reported in newsday this week , seems likely to add to the debate about how forthcoming the pentagon has been in providing details about the toll suffered by the iraqi army at the hands of american forces army officials strongly denied any attempts to hide the breaching operation , and pointed out that senior commanders had given extensive interviews about the maneuver after the war journalists in combat pools were assigned to the first infantry during the breaching operation , but none of their reports mentioned the live burials in fact , the reports noted that few slain iraqis had been visible in the bunkers and trenches the pentagon has provided no official estimate of iraq s overall casualties the defense intelligence agency issued a heavily qualified analysis in june estimating that 100 , 000 iraqis had been killed and 300 , 000 wounded in the war but said the figures had a 50 percent margin of error breaching operations are among the most dangerous maneuvers for ground troops obstacles like minefields and barbed wire can slow advancing forces , leaving them particularly vulnerable to enemy attack colonel maggart said two the first infantry units had punched 16 tankwidth lanes in the iraqi defenses in most cases m1a1 abrams tanks mounted with a plow were positioned on either side of and parallel to the iraqi trenches , the colonel said the ditches were typically several hundred yards long , three feet wide and four feet deep operating like snowplows , the tanks drove alongside the ditches , filling them in colonel maggart said that in most cases , iraqi troops had enough time to see the plows coming , jump out of the trenches and surrender gunners beside plow tanks for those iraqi soldiers who continued to resist from outside the trenches , bradley fighting vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns and 25millimeter cannon drove alongside the plow tanks , colonel maggart said the iraqi soldiers that were killed in this process were those that chose to stay in their trenches or behind obstacles and fight during the breaching operation , mr williams said but neither colonel maggart nor mr williams said how they could be sure that wounded iraqi soldiers had been able to get out of the trenches in time colonel maggart estimated that the iraqi forces he had faced had numbered between 800 and 1 , 000 the 110th brigade of the 26th iraqi infantry division and had had four t55 tanks no one was killed in colonel maggart s brigade , which consisted of 5 , 222 soldiers , 125 m1a1 tanks and more than 50 bradle fighting vehicles he said that the daytime breaching operation , including the ditch filling , had been completed in about three hours , and that the brigade had continued its advance after securing its breach zone , an area of roughly 35 square miles
beginners are taught that they should never give an opponent a ruff and sluff , but as with most such rules there are many exceptions this generous offering might be the only way to give the declarer problems , and was on the diagramed deal the occasion was the bob johnke memorial team event in new jersey , which has an unusual format a swiss team qualifies eight squads for knockout play the winners earlier this month , all from new jersey , were leonard karp of tenafly , lenore server of river vale , tod thorgersen and joe adamo , both of ridgefield park , and wayne and rosemary carr of hasbrouck heights against a normal fourspade contract west took two diamond tricks and followed by leading a third diamond this gave adamo as south a ruff and sluff , and also a headache he began by throwing a club from the dummy and ruffing in his hand the routine play at this point was to cash the club ace , ruff a club , and return to the spade ace for another club ruff that would have landed south in trouble , however , for west can ruff when a heart is led to the ace instead adamo decided to test the trumps by cashing the ace the bad break gave him something to think about , and he solved the problem neatly he finessed the eight of spades , knowing it would win , and ran the club jack this surrendered a trick to west s king , but it guaranteed the contract with any return south would be in his hand to take his club winners and pick up the missing trumps sometimes , points out karp , losing one trick in a suit is better than losing none diagram
after inspiring the premature thought that last night might be the night of the first nohitter in met history , david cone was merely extremely efficient cone held san francisco to four singles over eight innings in the 30 mets victory six days after allowing five earned runs in five innings against pittsburgh , cone took advantage of adjustments in his breaking pitch and splitfinger fastball and a slower delivery to strike out nine giants , his high for the season to me , that was the real david cone , said met manager bud harrelson i 've been waiting for him that s the david cone i 've been looking for , said mel stottlemyre , the mets' pitching coach it s the best splitfinger i 've had in recent memory , said cone \( 31 \) on a night that featured a chilly candlestickstyle breeze at shea stadium , cone made use of a firstinning run that was supplied by vince coleman without the benefit of a ball leaving the infield , and made that run stand up kelly downs \( 11 \) , the 30yearold giant righthander who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery last april , allowed three runs in six innings and pitched well enough to stay close on many nights in command from the start but from the start , when cone struck out three of the first four batters he faced , he successfully transmitted the message that this would not be just another night by slowing his motion slightly and altering the way he held the splitfinger pitch , adjustments that were made after evaluating his last start on videotape , cone controlled the thirdbest hitting team in the league but mike felder s twoout single in the sixth , beyond the backhand reach of first baseman dave magadan , kept intact baseball s longest current wait for a nohitter the mets have played 4 , 689 games , including 40 in postseason play , without holding the opposition hitless i would have been lying if i said it was n't in the back of my mind , cone said thinking it would be a really nice feeling to be the first guy to do it the correction that cone made on his grip of the splitfinger fastball was an important element that made such thinking possible if you can prove you can throw it for a strike when you need to , cone said , that will entice them to swing at some out of the strike zone even in the early innings , the crowd of 28 , 055 began to allow itself to think that one thin run might be enough coleman creates a run coleman manufactured that run in the first inning when he beat the throw of shortstop dave anderson after a ground ball , stole his 13th base of the season , went to third on a throwing error by catcher steve decker , and scored on a wild pitch by downs cone retired the first 16 hitters he faced , striking out eight in that stretch twice getting will clark to swing at a third strike and allowing just one ball to be hit out of the infield until there was one out in the sixth anderson then hit a sinking drive to rightcenter field , where hubie brooks , after a long run , saw the ball carom off his glove the crowd soon cheered at the scoreboard s news that the play had been scored an error against brooks that was when harrelson began to think about a nohitter but after downs grounded into a force , felder , who was in the lineup while kevin mitchell served a onegame national league suspension , hit the soft liner that ended the suspense a firstandsecond , noneout problem in the eighth carried cone as far as the coaching staff would allow cone understood , as soon as he reached the dugout , that john franco would be called in for his sixth save they all shook my hand , cone said that s usually a sign that things are done inside pitch kevin mitchell s suspension was the result of an incident in a game against san diego on april 10 mitchell charged padres pitcher bruce hurst after he was hit by a pitch in the second game of the season league president bill white reduced the original twogame suspension after a hearing friday morning by an unofficial pressbox count , david cone threw 112 pitches vince coleman stole a second base to increase his majorleague leading total to 14 but coleman was thrown out on an attempted steal of home in the fifth , the fourth time he has been caught the mets stole three bases and were caught twice for a majorleague leading total of 33 in 43 attempts photo mets' vince coleman stealing second in first inning giants' robby thompson tried to make the play as dave anderson covered \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
new york chamber sinfonia winter garden world financial center a little of glenn branca s music goes a long way there was , at any rate , no clamor for more after the hourandaquarter branca concert presented by glen cortese and his chamber sinfonia of new york on wednesday evening the group offered in whole or in part five works written since 1989 most were rooted in minimalism , and some amounted to little more than a premise , stretched out for 10 or 15 interminable minutes things could have been worse , it is true until recent years , mr branca s principal medium for his serious music was a band of electric guitars , amplified to a deafening and painful roar here he used a more or less standard 40piece orchestra but kept the amplification to a moderate level not that all those different instruments availed him much the opening temple of venus \( part 1 \) , from the ballet the world upside down , began with a bright , appealing sonority , but the texture soon thickened to mud much of the rhythmic counterpoint visible in the string bowings failed to register audibly even at its best , in those clear , vibrant sonorities early on , the piece succeeded only in evoking steve reich , and the comparison worked severely to the disadvantage of mr branca , for he showed none of mr reich s sustained inventiveness still , one quickly learned to be thankful for such small favors after shivering air , which went through the same motions , freeform offered another brief respite an appealing passage of jazzy syncopation in harmonic series chords , mr branca revived the microtonal meanderings of some of his earlier works two sections of les honneurs du pied , a ballet in progress to be presented in france this year , concluded the program here , at least , there were some variety and a bit of mildly interesting dissonance , but the musical ideas remained so rudimentary that the listener soon grasped at desperate choreographic imaginings for relief from the stultifying repetition the orchestra labored earnestly and well at its thankless tasks a fancy turn from strauss s till eulenspiegel spun out by a horn player in the preconcert warmup gnawed in the memory as a reminder of what these talented young players might have produced in more promising material the portion of the audience that remained for the duration , it should be acknowledged , greeted the composer warmly at the end of the evening photo new york chamber sinfonia performed in a concert wednesday at the world financial center \( johan elbers \)

detroit , aug 5 the yankees needed innings from scott sanderson at tiger stadium tonight their relievers were weary , their starters were having trouble getting past the fourth inning and they needed their stopper to stop the tigers he did , barely , and with a lot of help from mel hall sanderson had a jekyllandhydetype night as he struck out a careerhigh 12 batters in six innings but also allowed three homers and almost let the game slip away the yankees held on for a 75 victory over detroit because sanderson gave them a credible start when they needed it most , hall had a monster game by driving in five runs with four hits and manager stump merrill performed a successful juggling act in the late innings with a lean bullpen hold that broom the allornothing tigers were ready to break out the broom and sweep the yankees in a fourgame series for the first time since 1958 , but it did not happen new york salvaged the final game of the series after three straight losses had left merrill saying he did not have the answers sanderson provided an answer with the second decent outing by a starter in seven days i proved , he said , that i still knew how to pitch how big was sanderson s effort \? in losing seven of the last eight , yankee pitchers averaged about four innings a start , had an 1194 earned run average and were pretty pathetic he gave us what we had to get , said merrill of sanderson the tigers almost left merrill searching for more solutions when they put the tying runs on in the ninth lee guetterman , who replaced eric plunk after plunk walked rob deer to start the inning , retired skeeter barnes on a fly ball to center for the first out but he then gave up a single to milt cuyler and had a tall order as lou whitaker came up to the plate before the game , pitching coach mark connor said guetterman was unavailable because he had pitched two straight days guetterman would have none of it with steve howe resting an elbow injury and steve farr simply resting , guetterman told merrill he could pitch and pitch he did he got whitaker on a groundout to first and retired tony phillips on a tapper to short to notch his sixth save fielder was next a relieved merrill was elated when guetterman picked up the third out because he would have faced a ticklish situation otherwise if phillips had reached base , merrill planned to summon dave eiland to pitch to cecil fielder , who had already homered earlier in the game to raise his season total to 32 , tops in the major leagues eiland , who joined the team before the game , had not pitched in the majors since may 27 it would have been some way to welcome him back sanderson toyed with the tigers in the first five innings , limiting them to two hits while striking out 10 he looked like the pitcher who tossed a onehitter at tiger stadium in april , not like the pitcher who was lugging a fourgame losing streak then came the sixth and the gem was spoiled as sanderson walked cuyler and yielded a tworun homer to whitaker phillips followed with a basesempty homer and , suddenly , the yankees' 51 lead had been trimmed to 54 sanderson rebounded with two strikeouts and a popout to get out of the inning if you want to compare it to a boxing match , sanderson said , i got knocked down , but i did n't get knocked out hall s tworun homer in the seventh gave the yankees some breathing room at 74 even so , hall could not wait to get away from the tigers get me out of this place , he said those guys do n't quit inside pitch dave eiland was recalled from columbus to replace scott kamieniecki , who was placed on the 15day disabled list with a strained muscle in his left upper back eiland , who was 61 with a 240 earned run average in the minors , may start wednesday don mattingly hit his seventh homer in the first inning , his first in 158 times at bat the yankee pitchers struck out 15 batters , the most against any opponent since july 1987 steve howe , who has an abrasion on his left elbow , said he may be able to pitch tuesday in chicago howe was unhappy about being used in the fifth inning of sunday s game with the tigers i do n't know what was going through his mind , he said of manager stump merrill it amazed me , brother

amid all the fuss that s been made over miss saigon , the one person who seems to have been forgotten is miss saigon though jonathan pryce is the bestknown actor in the london musical , and the source of its ethnic casting controversy , it is lea salonga , a filipino actress , who starred in the title role in london and is now in new york to do the same on broadway her own reputation as the most singleminded , disciplined stage performer since ethel merman precedes her you can count on her to hit her top notes today exactly the way she hit them yesterday , and exactly the way she 'll hit them tomorrow she rarely , if ever , blows a line if someone else messes up , she keeps on going , no matter what with lea salonga , a producer gets his money s worth lea has been brought up to go out on a stage and deliver , says cameron mackintosh , the producer of miss saigon she knows exactly what she can do and wants to do when performing she has a computer brain in a way she s very nice to everybody but likes to get on with the show in rehearsal most actors wander through it unless you goose them not her , and thank god for it she s indomitable it s what you pray for at the age of 20 , miss salonga has been acting for 13 years she has certainly come a long way from belting tomorrow in the manila company of annie to making her broadway debut , after being discovered by mr mackintosh in a highly publicized worldwide talent search she has moved to manhattan for the next year or so , settling into a midtown apartment close to the broadway theater where miss saigon begins previews on saturday and opens april 11 her mother is living with her and her father , a mechanical engineer who works in the shipping industry , was in new york long enough to help them get settled miss salonga s 17yearold brother , a freshman in college in the philippines , will join his mother and sister when his semester ends in march we meet for lunch on a recent sunday at serendipity , a restaurant on the upper east side of manhattan famous for its desserts miss salonga is accompanied by her mother , who is not so much a mama rose type as a tender shepherd without the tender joy salonga has spent years protecting her daughter from every kind of show biz predator and she seems suspicious by nature at the age of 50 , she has accepted her daughter s career choice and appears to be genuinely unimpressed with the glitz factor of backstage life she does n't talk much , and there are none of those stage mother moments where you can see the child being exploited because , when it comes to ambitions of any shape and size , miss salonga seems able to realize them all by herself today , the actress s black hair is pulled back in a long braid , and she wears no makeup she is dressed plainly in a beige , irishknit sweater and blackandwhite pinstripe slacks that just misses as an outfit when she speaks , without an accent , her voice is loud you can hear her bouncing those solos off the back of the balcony but mostly , she does n't speak unless spoken to her smile is consistent , yet small and , she s not shy after all , she s been giving interviews , she says , for 10 years her conversation remains polite and she neatly dodges or flatout ignores any question she does n't like if she has a sense of humor , it did n't come to lunch when we sit down , she places a big box of kleenex in the middle of the table , without explanation what is it for \? she makes a vague , circular gesture near her nose and says weather at the end of the meal when i point out that she never used them , she takes one and blows her nose then her mother hands her a bottle of eye drops , which she applies at the table make no mistake the care and feeding of lea salonga is a fulltime job mostly her mother s but the feeding part is causing the actress some trouble despite serendipity s quintessentially american menu of treats , its footlong hot dog is laying an egg at our table it seems that miss salonga s achilles' heel is her hips , and she has promised mr mackintosh to slim down she orders a slice of whole wheat bread topped with plain steamed vegetables , which she chews with tremendous determination is n't she ever tempted to pig out \? no , she says sternly mrs salonga rolls her eyes , making the universal mother face at a dieting daughter it s my fault , she says i raised her too healthy then , something unexpected happens a waiter walks by with a tray loaded down with oversized entrees , and miss salonga , glaring at him , says , they should ship it to us we need the food she is referring to hunger in the philippines , and she and her mother criticize the incredible excess and waste they say they have observed in this country at precisely this moment , a child at the next table begins to scream it seems that an order of potato skins filled with sour cream and caviar is not to his liking i guess there are a lot of kids in your country who do n't have anything to eat , much less caviar , huh \? i ask , lamely tightlipped , they nod their heads the boy s screams escalate finally , his father pushes the plate away and turns to order something else at our table , mother and daughter look at their laps no one speaks
drexel burnham lambert s bankruptcy case moved a giant step closer to a settlement yesterday as the main parties agreed in principle on how to divide up what is left of the firm and the agreement , if it holds , could even make it possible for drexel to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy one of the two judges involved , federal district judge milton pollack , said last night that the case could be concluded in a couple of months like most complex bankruptcies , the case had been expected to drag on for years the accord was reached after intensive negotiations among drexel s creditors , including its banks , and the central litigants , including the federal deposit insurance corporation and the resolution trust corporation agreement to reduce claims the parties agreed to reduce their claims against the firm to around 2 billion judge pollack estimated that total claims might have amounted to 20 billion no exact details of how the 2 billion would be divided were released the agreement in principle , which judge pollack sent back to the lawyers to work on , does not cover a claim by the internal revenue service that was filed last week and seeks more than 5 billion judge pollack said in an interview that the lawyers would have to work out an agreement with the irs to bring that figure down considerably but he said , as did lawyers involved in the case , that the irs claim was overblown when the irs has a claim for 5 , it asks for 50 , 000 , the judge said unusual holiday session the court action came on an unusual holiday session for which the court in manhattan had to be opened drexel is estimated to have about 28 billion in assets but some of that has to be set aside for the continuing operation and expenses of the firm judge pollack also said some money should be set aside so the firm has a chance to reorganize and come out of bankruptcy under chapter 11 , which it chose last year to protect itself from its creditors judge pollack said about 2 billion would remain for creditors and other parties after expenses and reorganization costs were deducted lawyers announced the agreement in a morning session moments after agreeing to the outline the agreement was on a piece of paper with the initials of the lawyers written alongside various portions of the outline we have reached a general outline for such an agreement , thomas d barr , a lawyer for the fdic and resolution trust , told judge pollack and judge francis g conrad , the bankruptcy court judge hearing the case mr barr , a member of the law firm cravath , swaine moore , added the that lawyers involved were prepared to recommend the terms that we have agreed to to our clients and to urge them strongly to accept our recommendation the intensity of the negotiations began to build as yesterday s session approached judge pollack had warned the lawyers that if an agreement could not be reached the company might be liquidated one lawyer said the parties had been meeting virutally around the clock since thursday lawyers involved in the case said yesterday that the agreement was a major breakthrough and that judge pollack s approach to the case may have taken years off of the settlement process one lawyer involved in the negotiations , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the move might shorten the case by as much as five years but some difficult issues still must be worked out during the court session , mr barr asked that the agreement not be made public immediately , saying that such an action could harm the agreement there are many lawyers here who have just made commitments which they have not had a chance even to share with their client , he said another lawyer for the fdic , david boies of cravath , said of the agreement , it is an important step but not the final step but judge pollack , by starting a process that could lead to the final dissolution of drexel under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code , moved to insure that the parties would not lose their momentum a liquidation of the company , he said , would result in most of drexel s assets being spent on legal and other fees and little or none of the money going to the creditors or the groups , like the fdic , that have legal claims against drexel in an interview , judge pollack said his goal in the case was to get it settled quickly because of the enormous cost to the government and the enormous waste of expenses to run this affair but he said any settlement was difficult because of the enormous claims that had been made against drexel in normal circumstances , it would take years and use up much of drexel s assets to try to agree in court on an exact figure for many of the claims , including those from the fdic and many other parties judge pollack became involved in the case when he was petitioned to make a determination of the value of the claims he said his tack was to force an agreement he did this by making clear about six weeks ago that he could move to liquidate drexel , which he said would benefit no one and use up all the assets finally it dawned on them , he continued , that i was right , and serious negotiations were undertaken asked if he had used the liquidation of drexel as a threat , judge pollack said no i just called their attention to what was going to happen drexel was at the heart of the rise of the junk bond market that fed the corporate takeovers of the 1980 s but it was also , subsequently , at the center of the scandals that rocked wall street at the end of the decade before filing for protection from its creditors , drexel admitted to six felonies and agreed with the securities and exchange commission and the united states attorney in manhattan to pay 650 million in fines and penalties the head of the junk bond division , michael r milken , pleaded guilty to six felonies and was sentenced last year to 10 years in prision some 13 , 000 claims have been filed against drexel , but the total amount has not been officially calculated the govermant claims total about 16 billion , including the 11 billion claim of the fdic the agency has also filed claims against mr milken , numerous other drexel officials and officials at many large savings and loan associations the largest creditor is the equitable life assurance society of the united states , which is owed 208 million

johannesburg , june 17 the law that laid the legal foundation of apartheid by classifying all south africans by race from birth , with resulting privileges or handicaps , was scrapped today by parliament , more than four decades after it was enacted the population registration act , enacted first in 1950 and periodically refined since , became the final pillar of statutory apartheid to be pulled down by president f w de klerk , after the repeal of the three other discriminatory laws that underpinned white domination of other south africans now it belongs to history , mr de klerk said of the system of discrimination that was introduced and for many years maintained by his national party as late as 16 months ago , when mr de klerk ordered the release of nelson mandela , the longimprisoned leader of the african national congress , few if any here imagined that the vital legal basis for apartheid would be so quickly swept away the land acts , which set aside 87 percent of property for whites , and the group areas act , which dictated where people could live on the basis of their race , were repealed on june 5 law on public accommodations the separate amenities act , which let municipal officials bar blacks from parks , swimming pools , toilets and other public accommodations , was scrapped a year ago , although the change only became effective last oct 15 although the laws have now been revoked , the system they maintained has become so entrenched in south african society that breaking down its separations and compartments in everyday life at schools , jobs , or distinct neighborhoods and enclaves remains a formidable task blacks remain disfranchised one cannot build security on injustice , mr de klerk told a joint session of parliament after today s repeal , and there is no doubt that the group areas act and other laws that determined the tenure of the land , as well as the population registration act , did lead to injustice he said the end of the laws had resolved a moral dilemma for south africans the elimination of the four laws still leaves the black majority without the right to vote president de klerk has promised that universal franchise will be extended in a new constitution , and has invited black leaders to join him in drafting one as an early step , he suggested today that a conference of all political parties be convened before the end of the year mr de klerk said the proposed nonracial constitution has to be reached by negotiation , and i want to say here today that it is within our reach within a few years i do not for a moment doubt that we will succeed today s watershed repeal leaves south africa without a statutory justification for apartheid for the first time since after the national party came to power in 1948 but other vestiges of racial discrimination have yet to disappear schools largely segregated for example , public schools , but for a few exceptions , remain racially segregated disparities between whites and blacks continue in government benefits like oldage pensions neighborhoods may be slow to integrate because most blacks cannot afford better houses the african national congress , in a statement issued tonight , welcomed the repeal of the population registration act , but said little would change as long as blatantly racist practices continue still , the action today marked the most significant milestone yet in the dismantling of apartheid undertaken by mr de klerk the population registration act , which gained international notoriety for south africa , established four compulsory racial categories white , mixed race , asian and black the mixedrace category was subsequently expanded to include bureaucratic variations tests for racial identity white officials devised pseudoscientific tests to determine the race of south africans by examining their eyelids , gums , nostrils and fingernails one test entailed sticking a pencil in the hair to see if it fell out the conclusion determined whether a person could vote or own land , where he could live , eat , work and relax and whom he could legally love and marry as many as three and a half million people , the vast majority of them nonwhite , lost their homes as part of the government s grand design for geographic segregation some lost their spouses or families , who were classified as belonging to a different race the population registration act was expunged from the statute books this afternoon with 38 dissenting votes out of 178 members in the white house of assembly eleven members of parliament abstained , the south african press association reported the only opposition came from the rightwing conservative party , which wants apartheid maintained mr de klerk accused the conservatives , who form the official opposition in the house of assembly , of displaying what he called contemptuous disregard of reason and reality he said the vast majority of south africans rejoiced in the changes segregated voters' rolls the end to racial classification has already applied to children born since feb 1 , 1990 , when mr de klerk promised to repeal the law but the government is maintaining racially segregated voters' rolls for parliament , which has a dominant chamber for whites and two less powerful chambers for legislators of mixed race and of indian descent , but none for blacks since the repeal of the population registration act removed the basis for the way in which legislators were chosen and arrayed , the government introduced measures that would maintain current political institutions and practices until constitutional changes were enacted mr de klerk rebutted allegations from critics of the government that these legislative measures to keep parliament functioning constituted a ploy to perpetuate racism in another guise the government is unqualified in its commitment to the removal of racial discrimination from every law and act of government , the south african president said nothing in the repealing legislation is in conflict with this commitment the repeal of the population registration act also addresses an important condition for lifting the american sanctions voted by congress in the comprehensive antiapartheid act of 1986 but mr de klerk said the step was not taken to win international approval we are not working to the agendas of the united states , africa or europe in order to have sanctions lifted or to gain favor , mr de klerk said we wish to do what is right for south africa but , he added , one may expect further international developments to follow if anything like morality exists in international politics photo president f w de klerk of south africa preparing to announce the repeal of the

decided what remains voting the approximately 30 million black people , who make up 77 percent of the population , have no vote in national affairs president de klerk says he is ready to negotiate a new constitution that will give balck people equal voting rights but the african national congress says the government must first release all political prisoners and do more to stop factional fighting

united nations , sept 30 the united nations officials charged with destroying iraq s nuclear weapons sites are searching for an unidentified mastermind who they think had overall charge of president saddam hussein s secret nuclear weapons program , estimated to have cost 10 billion the conviction that there must have be an unknown top official , who could have been a foreigner , in command stems from their belief that none of the iraqi scientists they have met so far appears to have a full grasp of the complex program that involved both production of enriched uranium explosive and attempts to design a weapon in particular , jaafar dhiah jaafar , formally the no 2 official on the iraqi atomic energy commission , appears to know only about the attempt to produce enriched uranium , officials say , while his superior , the head of the commission , is regarded as a figurehead a special commission set up by the united nations security council to destroy iraq s weapons of mass destruction has already established that the authorities in baghdad were seeking to produce enriched uranium by three separate methods its latest inspection team has also established that iraq had some kind of a weapons development program under way by unearthing evidence that it was trying to design a nuclear detonation device but as yet no iraqi official has been found with overall responsibility for both the enrichment and the weapons programs personally i am rather convinced that there must be someone who links the enrichment and the design sides , said rolf ekeus of sweden , the special commission s executive chairman in new orleans today president bush , in terms starkly similar to those he used last year before the invasion of iraq , warned that he would not tolerate saddam hussein defying the united nations any aggression , any defiance of the united nations resolutions now will not stand , mr bush said at a fundraiser for gov buddy roemer i am just as determined to see he does not succeed the united nations commission s inspectors , to test their theory on an overall director , raided the iraqi atomic energy commission s records center last tuesday and took away personnel files of many of the senior people working there that raid led to their detention for four days by the iraqi authorities the commission now wants its inspectors to track down these top iraqi nuclear officials on the team s next visit to baghdad last week , the commission barred the team s american members from sending details of seized documents directly to the state department instead of reporting only to the united nations mr ekeus said he sent a general order to the team to suspend all contacts with washington on wednesday after he discovered american members had been in direct contact with washington by satellite phone however , he denied reports that he had reprimanded them most were americans the team s leader , david kay , is an american he was accompanied on the mission by robert l gallucci , the special commission s american deputy executive chairman altogether , 25 of the 44 team members were americans , and they included government scientists with practical experience in nuclear weapons design in particular , officials say that by sending reports directly to the united states government , the americans helped bolster the iraqis'charge that mr kay is a central intelligence agency spy acting under cover of the viennabased international atomic energy agency we very firmly instructed them not to make such contacts but only to report to the special commission and the iaea , mr ekeus said today commission officials say that the americans argued that they were only trying to get the substance of confiscated material out of the country quickly for fear that the iraqis would take it back by force at a news conference after the team s arrival in bahrain today , mr kay said that the inspectors had removed a total of 25 , 000 pages of documents dealing with iraq s covert nuclear plans as well as 19 hours of videotape and 70 rolls of film used to photograph documents i think we collected a lot of valuable information on iraq s secret nuclear program , he said , adding you ca n't help but be impressed by the sophistication of it you walk around those sites and you shake your head because they are far better than most i 've seen he emphasized that the team had uncovered clear evidence , in the form of designs for building a nuclear detonating device , refuting iraq s claim that it had no interest in developing a nuclear weapon the emphasis was on uranium enrichment , virtually every known method , mr kay said this for a country without a single power plant requiring enriched uranium that is a major anomaly the team has also brought out records of nuclear material that iraq purchased for its program from foreign countries and companies while mr kay refused to give details he said , it would be very hard for me to understand , with some of the issues of supply , that they did not know they were going to be used in a nuclear program
washington , june 25 in this city of hyperbole and illusion , myths grow like jack s beanstalk one of the capital s most beloved myths is the one about indispensability important officials begin to believe they are irreplaceable and invulnerable the doppelganger effect sets in , as staff workers confuse themselves with their bosses , the elected officials , and that is where the trouble begins when john h sununu , the white house chief of staff , was chastised for taking military planes to dental appointments in new hampshire and ski vacations in colorado and a government limousine to a stamp auction in manhattan , he turned to the venerable excuse of indispensability he said he could not be out of touch for even the briefest of plane rides and , for national security reasons , could not use a telephone that was not scrambled his rationales shifted from the need for secure communication to the need for constant communication to , once he began hitching rides on corporate jets , the desire for convenience but not all military planes have secure phones , and none of the corporate jets mr sununu solicited had phones at all and could n't he simply take a secure white house mobile phone on a commercial flight \? the white house press office did its best to deflect such questions mr sununu s advisers suggested he could help ease the pressure by taking some commercial flights as a way of showing he was not as imperious as he seemed , but they said he brushed off the idea by saying he did not want to give his critics the satisfaction as he wrestles with the most crucial public relations battle of his white house career , mr sununu , a former governor of new hampshire , deserves sympathy on one point it was easier for donald t regan , the chief of staff to president ronald reagan who also liked to treat the government fleet as though he was still a corporate executive , to argue that he was indispensable even mr reagan s admirers said he was disengaged from daytoday operations of the white house but how does one portray himself as indispensable to a president whose domestic policy is defensive rather than offensive and who likes to act as his own chief of staff , making his own appointments and telephone calls and keeping his own lines of communication open to the cabinet and to capitol hill \? the chief of staff job became important under president dwight d eisenhower , who brought the notion of a centralized staff chief to politics from the army ever since , with few exceptions , like john f kennedy , presidents have had chiefs of staff , and the role became imbedded in the white house structure under richard m nixon and his chief of staff , h r haldeman in a capital that is as much symbol as city , it never hurts to ask white house officials to go back to basic questions , like exactly why mr sununu is indispensable 'i just do n't know' you 're not going to get me to comment on that , said edward m rogers , mr sununu s personal aide pressed for examples of nowornever chiefofstaff business , he replied i'm calling you back , but i'm really not calling you back the governor wants to put all this stuff behind him he does n't want to participate in any of these stories three of mr sununu s other aides , andrew card , david m carney and philip brady , refused to respond to telephone calls seeking more information about ways the chief of staff performs what he has called his sevendayaweek , 24houraday job marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman , offered this response i do n't know i just do n't know no , leave it at one 'i do n't know' judy smith , the deputy white house press secretary , said that s a darn good question i 'll put it to the 5 o'clock staff meeting after the afternoon session in mr fitzwater s office , she called back and said she had been instructed to reply that white house reporters should know what the chief of staff does mr sununu offered his own explanation on june 16 on the abc news program this week when george f will asked him if the sweep of american history had reached the point that a single chief of staff could never be out of pocket as we move on , , mr sununu replied , the time for response from the white house on issues , whether they have international content , domestic content , whether they are associated with communications that the president is putting out dealing in response to requests from the media on a timely basis , that puts pressure back on my job to help coordinate and approve what goes out there is that demand that is not just national security , but there is that demand of communication pressure that puts the load back into my system he may have been exaggerating a bit for effect while mr sununu has always tried to include himself in the national security cluster around the president , secretary of state james a baker 3d and brent scowcroft , the national security adviser , have managed to keep him at arm s length and curtail his ability to speak out on foreign affairs he also rarely gets involved in the press office or the communications office
to the editor in his letter on jan 6 regarding troubled coops , john p noonan , president of the brooklyn board of realtors , showed a misunderstanding of the role the attorney general s office has played in the regulation of cooperative conversions the attorney general regulates coop conversions under the martin act , the state s securities disclosure law that law requires the attorney general s office to accept for filing all offering plans which provide full disclosure as mr noonan should know , the attorney general has no ability to approve or disapprove of the substantive terms of an offering , however onerous those terms may be to prospective purchasers our legal mandate is to ensure disclosure , not to pass on the merits of a plan even during the coop boom of the early and mid80 s , the attorney general s office consistantly urged the state legislature to pass remedial legislation to strengthen the conversion laws our legislative program has for years included a proposal that 25 percent of the tenants in a building purchase their units before a conversion may proceed \( currently , only 15 percent of the apartments must be sold , to tenants or outsiders , for a noneviction plan to proceed \) we have also proposed legislation to reduce the warehousing of apartments during the conversion process and to require sponsors of conversion plans to correct dangerous and hazardous building conditions before transferring title to purchasers if such legislation had been in place when the market took this downswing , there would perhaps be fewer problem buildings today last year , in response to the weakening coop market and the growing number of sponsor defaults , the attorney general s office fashioned enhanced financial disclosure regulations under the martin act we also proposed several new bills , including a proposal that sponsors be required to post financial security , such as a bond or letter of credit , for their obligations under the offering plan while many of these reform bills have passed in the assembly over the years , none has ever passed in the senate we will again make the enactment of tougher coop legislation a priority of the attorney general s legislative program during this session , and welcome the support of all concerned about protecting the rights of coop shareholders during this difficult economic period frederick k mehlman manhattan the writer is assistant attorney general in charge of the real estate financing bureau
the number of people working in automobile manufacturing in this country has shrunk more than 20 percent since 1978 , and that includes employees at japan s newly established operations here obviously , an even steeper decline has taken place at detroit s big three that means detroit will have fewer employees to fund its retiree benefits obligations that is especially troubling because american companies are now paying for healthcare benefits of retired men and women who contributed to detroit s prosperity years ago this is a burden that japanese transplant companies do n't have to shoulder because almost none of their employees are old enough to be eligible for retirement skyrocketing healthcare costs have made detroit s burden a heavy one in 1988 and 1989 , the general motors corporation paid more than 1 billion in healthcare costs for its retired employees and the healthcare retirement burden is almost certain to get worse as detroit cuts middle management and strives to catch up with the japanese in terms of automation so where is the money for these retiree benefits obligations to come from \? taxpayers could end up bearing some of the burden remember the chrysler corporation bailout in 1979 if chrysler had gone out of business , taxpayers would have had to absorb more than 1 billion in federally insured pension benefits to the company s retired workers in terms of health care , there is a way out congress could take a page from the railroad retirement act of 1935 by that year , the increased use of cars and the effects of the great depression had slashed the number of railroad employees by more than 40 percent from the 1920 s levels congress responded with an act implementing a system of retirement benefits for all railroad employees the railroads and their employees were to be taxed uniformly to pay for those benefits this act solved an important social problem rising unemployment coupled with the number of retired people with little income and helped to create a more level playing field for surviving railroads in these treacherous times , the best way to finance a similar system for auto industry healthcare benefits would be to levy a uniform sales tax on all motor vehicles and parts sold in this country , including imports taxing imported vehicles would prevent them from having an unfair cost advantage over detroit s products and taxing parts would help to compensate for the fact that japanese transplant companies by putting artificially high values on imported parts are able to largely avoid paying any corporate profit taxes to washington detroit s big three , which are now badgering washington for special protection , might add this to their agenda and labor might think about supporting them photo edward renshaw
minneapolis , oct 20 tom glavine will remember two pitches from tonight one was in the first inning , one was in the eighth inning , and both landed in the leftfield seats the dozens of other strikes he threw were rendered meaningless by the two that took off into orbit at the metrodome there was the changeup to chili davis with two out in the first and a runner on base the pitch curved back over the plate goodbye then there was the fastball on the first pitch in the eighth to scott leius with the score tied , 22 it was fat and rested on the middle of the plate good night the long ball buried the lefthander on a night when atlanta catcher greg olson said glavine had pitched as well as he had all season at one point between the homers , glavine retired 15 batters in a row he stymied the twins and quieted the hankiewaving fans but no one will remember that he gave up only four hits in eight innings they will remember the two homers and that the braves lost to the twins , 32 i made two mistakes and they took advantage of them , said glavine , sipping on a can of soda it was as simple as that everything was perfect , said olson , except for two pitches brave offense stymied now everything is not perfect for the braves they trail the world series , two games to none , and they have not shown the ability to score runs or win at the metrodome the series shifts to atlanta for games 3 , 4 and 5 and the braves have to win at least two to make it back to minneapolis we have n't been down , 20 , yet , glavine said we have n't had our backs against the wall this way now we will see how much character we got what the fans will also recall is that glavine has lost all three of his postseason games the favorite for the national league cy young award has come up empty in october he lost by 10 and 51 to pittsburgh in the national league championship series and 32 tonight he may not get the chance to pitch a fourth time frustrating time it s very frustrating , said glavine i pitched well enough to win the last two games and have nothing to show for it it s frustrating enough , particularly in the situation we 're in now the braves were unsettled in the first inning and the noisy fans had something to do with it dan gladden hit a high pop into shallow right and the decibel level rose the ball descended and second baseman mark lemke and right fielder dave justice converged on it the fans hollered they could sense what might happen neither player could hear and it showed lemke caught the ball and justice knocked it out of his glove for a twobase error on the outfielder communication problems lemke had it , but you ca n't take your eye off the ball because of the noise , said manager bobby cox it s hard to hear whose calling the ball chuck knoblauch followed with a walk on a 32 pitch the braves caught a break when kirby puckett proceeded to hit a grounder that terry pendleton turned into a thirdtofirst double play pendleton had to avoid a piece of puckett s flying bat while making the play knoblauch moved to second and scored on davis s homer to give the twins a 20 lead had justice not bumped into lemke and allowed gladden to reach , pendleton might have ended the inning with a secondtofirst double play it would have been difficult , but olson said , they should n't have scored any runs in the first the twins did not have a hit in the second , third , fourth , fifth or sixth brian harper had a single in the seventh , but did not move off the base it looked as if glavine had left the miserable first behind him tommy was pitching as good as he can pitch , olson said the eighth inning hurt atlanta the braves had runners on first and third and one out , but ron gant and justice failed to deliver the goahead run the bottom of the inning was drearier as leius slugged the first pitch over the leftfield fence and minnesota went ahead , 32 glavine was trying to sneak a fastball over he was trying to be aggressive as he always does nine times out of 10 , when you throw a first pitch strike they are not going to get a hit , never mind a home run , glavine said that s how i try to pitch unfortunately , i got beat by it photo tom glavine after giving up home run to scott leius in eighth inning \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
i would like to comment on richard weizel s article , shore towns rule the waves parking fees limit beach use \( july 28 \) discrimination is a relative thing there is none at the westport public beaches anyone can , without a fee from the town beaches be dropped off at the beach , bicycle to it \( many do from the rail station \) , take a bus \( they run frequently \) or a taxi , walk , shower or change clothes in the public dressing rooms the reason for the higher parking fees for outoftown residents is so that westporters can find a place to park on crowded summer weekends the parking lots are often full town taxes , not the state , pay for the lifeguards , facilities , general maintenance and police protection there are other town beaches in connecticut where nonresidents , unless they can prove they are guests , cannot even use the beaches private clubs defend their territory and exclusive right to it , vigorously and there are vast areas of beachfront all along the connecticut shore owned by private citizens who can , and do , prevent anyone from trespassing above the hightide line or gaining access to the beach by land so , do n't knock westport too hard it s much more liberal than most coastal towns and , except for the crowded summer months , anyone can park there free sherwood island , a state park in westport , has several miles of wonderful beaches , picnic groves , a food concession and walks along beaches and in shaded areas andrew t wolfson westport
secretary of state baker , senator albert gore and others urge americans to think about the peace to follow the persian gulf war the peace \? how can anyone think sensibly about that prospect when there s so much uncertain about the war \? there s a practical answer decisions made in the coming weeks about how to fight , where to fight and even whom to fight will determine the terrain of postwar diplomacy the discussion is already well begun secretary baker , in congressional testimony last week , and senator gore , several days earlier , wrestled conscientiously with a basic challenge america has neither the means nor the will to maintain a large military presence in the middle east yet if it fails to deal adequately with the war s underlying causes , today s sacrifices could prove wasted america cannot expect to impose solutions it can only strive to promote efforts by middle eastern and other nations to organize a just and lasting peace mr baker suggested five themes for further discussion gulf security the administration would rely on the states in the region , including iran , to build postwar security alliances the us would maintain a small naval force in the gulf , as it has for four decades a multinational presence might also continue the key would be to restore a rough balance of power between iran , iraq and syria that requires preserving iraq s ability to defend itself after its aggressive military force is destroyed regional arms control iraq could not have acquired its menacing modern weapons without eager sellers in western europe , the soviet union , china and brazil and iraq is not the only country in the area with fearsome military capabilities five middle eastern nations , secretary baker noted , have more main battle tanks than france or britain the obvious need is regional arms control agreements , with strict onsite verification for , at a minimum , iraq selfrestraint by suppliers is equally necessary economic recovery the plight of millions of poor arabs helps explain why so many cheered saddam hussein for sacking rich little kuwait one way or another , the poverty and inequality will have to be addressed israel , the palestinians and arab states the war gives dramatic evidence that israel is an integral part of the middle east arab states will have to recognize it as such that s the most practical way of assuring that israel is included in future provisions for regional arms control israel , for its part , will have to accept the need for an early end to its military occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and will also have to somehow accommodate palestinian political rights reduced us energy dependence perhaps , by now , americans have learned the true cost of energy security , particularly with so much of the world s energy lifeline potentially within saddam hussein s grip secretary baker , like others before him , called for conservation , development , stockpiling and alternate fuels legislative incentives can make them a reality last month s debate over going to war showed how conscientiously congress can address momentous questions it s none too soon to devote the same conscientious attention to what happens when the shooting stops
an inexpensive pill taken three times a week can be extremely effective in preventing a deadly pneumonia in people with aids , a new study has found the disorder , pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , is the leading killer of people with aids , and doctors have been unsure what is the best way to prevent it the only preventative approved for people with aids by the food and drug administration is the drug pentamidine , which is normally inhaled once a month but at least 20 percent of the people who use pentamidine in the aerosol form get the pneumonia anyway , and the drug is very expensive the new study , to be published tomorrow in the lancet , a british medical journal , indicates that when the drug is given three times a week , most patients can tolerate it , and it appears to be extraordinarily effective in preventing pneumocystis carinii pneumonia it costs only 7 a year the drug , a pill combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazoleis , is sold as bactrim by hoffmannlaroche inc and as septra by the burroughs wellcome company approved for treatment many doctors already give patients bactrim or septra to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , but they give it every day rather than three days a week the drug has been approved for the treatment of pneumonia , not for its prevention but many people cannot tolerate daily doses of the drug , which can cause allergic reactions and can damage the bone marrow and it remains unclear just how effective the drug is in preventing pneumonia in the study , dr joel ruskin and dr marc lariviere of kaiser permanente medical center in los angeles reviewed the records of 116 patients who had received bactrim or septra three days a week over the last three years the patients had taken the drug for 3 to 42 months the researchers reported that none of these patients had developed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , even the 71 patients who had had at least one bout with the pneumonia in the past and so were more susceptible to subsequent pneumonia infections about 10 percent of the patients were allergic to the drug or had such serious side effects that they could not take it but because of its design , the study is not conclusive , cautioned dr judith feinberg , an aids researcher at johns hopkins university school of medicine these are nice supportive data , but they are not the critical data , she said chart reviews are chart reviews , she said , explaining that without a standardized protocol and a study that randomly assigns people to bactrim or another treatment and then follows them to see who gets pneumonia , the data cannot be considered definitive still , dr feinberg said the study does give some evidence that people should look prospectively at threetimesaweek bactrim therapy others are more enthusiastic i'm very excited about it , said dr merle sande , chief of infectious medicine at san francisco general hospital for any of us in public hospitals who are trying to keep costs down without sacrificing efficacy , this is very important although dr sande said he would like to see the sort of definitive study that dr feinberg suggested , he said he would feel comfortable recommending bactrim or septra three times a week to people with aids it is obviously easy to take , it s inexpensive , and i think it works , dr sande said some private doctors who treat large numbers of aids patients said they already prescribe bactrim or septra taken three times a week even without a study to back them up dr joseph sonnabend , a new york doctor , said he began giving bactrim three times a week after learning that the dose helped prevent pneumocystis pneumonia in children with leukemia , who also are susceptible to the pneumonia
in a city seething with change , frank p schubert is a beacon for 31 years , the part of new york that sailors saw first , and the last bit they glimpsed over the horizon long after they shipped out , has been the red flash of mr schubert s lighthouse blinking at the tip of coney island this is no ordinary lighthouse mr schubert no ordinary lighthouse keeper coney island light , a homely 85foothigh cone of cast iron , is the last lighthouse in the country run by a civilian lighthouse keeper it is also the only lighthouse where the keeper , by regulation , is always on duty , except for monday nights , when he goes bowling and leaves his 37yearold son , kenneth , in charge and , because it is tucked behind houses on beach 47th street , a dead end in the old city resort of sea gate , it is most likely the only one to get a newspaper delivered , or have pizza brought to the door as automation came to lighthouses , lighthouse keepers , generally , left six other lighthouses in new york harbor are run by timers coney island is , too , and mr schubert acknowledges that he has little left to do these days 'fine and heroic tradition' five years ago , 34 lighthouses in united states waters were still operated by the coast guard now only one , in boston harbor , has coast guard officers stationed there , and that was a result of a bill that senator edward m kennedy sponsored largely , the coast guard says , for sentimental reasons mr schubert , a salty 75 , was honored earlier this year by the coast guard and the commerce department as the lone survivor of the old lighthouse service , whose civilian members , according to a plaque mr shubert received , upheld the fine and heroic tradition of lightkeepers by serving as the first line of assistance when disaster strikes and maintaining a guiding beacon for those marines returning home from sea sounds great , do n't it , mr schubert said with a shade of admiration one recent afternoon after 31 years at coney island light , witnessing awesome sunsets and an unimaginable armada of ships , mr schubert has reached an understanding with life that does n't leave much room for superlatives beyond absolutely , a word he often substitutes for conversation good job \? absolutely cold \? absolutely regrets \? none absolutely he has been there so long , guided so many sealegged pilots , felt the fog roll off the atlantic so often , that there is almost nothing he has n't seen , no question he has n't already answered the kids counted 87 steps , so do n't bother , he said right off , opening the heavy iron doors at the base of the 1890 lighthouse a single fivepointed star is embossed above the doorframe , the only embellishment on the light s stark white surface , a bit of whimsy in the deadly business of keeping the sea from wrecking ships and stealing men s lives the stairs twist around a central pole in the same manner as those inside the statue of liberty it takes a minute , no more , for mr schubert to make it to the top , a climb that tests the stamina of much younger men he explains , without being asked , that the light has six sides it can be seen for 14 miles flashes threetenths of a second every five seconds makes two full revolutions per minute used to burn kerosene and float in a pool of liquid mercury changed to electric about 30 years ago now it s just a 150watt bulb the size of your pinky no , he said , he does n't daydream about faroff places , nor does he hear the sirens of the sea during the long , lonely hours of his watch i used to love to come up , but not so much anymore , mr schubert admitted before blowing his nose it s like anything else inside the tiny perch atop the lighthouse , above the shingled roofs of sea gate , it is easy to picture a far different city , one with a harbor that was a rushhour highway of boats and freighters , bringing goods , famous people and bits of overseas news that made new york tingle for days now , peering through mr schubert s navyissue bausch lomb binoculars , the water is an empty ache , a wonder at where all the ships have gone , how things could have changed so much , so fast and yet there are people like mr schubert for whom the currents of change have been only minor eddys by rough count , he has climbed the lighthouse stairs , all 87 of them , at least 10 , 950 times since he took over in 1960 , although he says it seems like a hell of a lot more than that not much to do now now that the light is automated , there is n't much left for him to do anymore , but that s just as well he s alway busy with cub scouts and brownies and neighborhood kids wanting to see the light in the quiet of night he still dabbles in marquetry , making intricate wood artworks of cutters and barques if mr schubert does n't fit the romantic notion of a lightkeeper , he does n't carry the mantle of loneliness either in a trim victorian cottage next to the light , he and his wife , marie , raised three children francine , thomas and kenneth , who said he would have gladly become a lightkeeper instead of a stock analyst if he could in february , coast guard officials took some big brass down to the lighthouse to meet mr schubert , who they admit has been kept on more for sentiment than efficiency frank represents a fine tradition , said richard m larrabee , coast guard captain of the port of new york and mr schubert s boss captain larrabee said there are no specific plans for what to do when mr schubert decides he s had enough of coney island maybe we all wish it could just go on forever , he said mr schubert says he 'll keep on going until they tell me to get out much of what he says , when he says anything , comes out in the same selfdeprecating way it s the young sailor in him who ca n't quite believe he s been lucky enough to have kept on doing what he always wanted to do in a storybook lighthouse on the shore of new york do i like it here \? you figure it out , he said private beaches , lot of open space it s beautiful in summer the kids had a ball so did he absolutely photos coney island light , above , on beach 47th street in sea gate , is the last lighthouse in the country run by a civilian lighthouse keeper , frank p schubert , right he has been the lighthouse keeper since 1960 \( photographs by keith meyers the new york times \) \( pg 25 \) i used to love to come up , but not so much anymore , frank p shubert said on top of the coney island light it s like anything else \( keith meyers the new york times \) \( pg 26 \)

washington , march 19 the bush administration s efforts to elevate federal district judge kenneth l ryskamp to a pivotal appeals court seat may have been put in jeopardy today after a contentious senate hearing several democrats on the senate judiciary committee expressed exasperation with his explanations about his membership in a florida country club with a reputation for excluding jews and blacks , and about remarks he made that they said suggested an insensitivity to civil rights president bush has nominated judge ryskamp , a 58yearold trial court judge in miami , to the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit , which comprises florida , alabama and georgia the committee rarely rejects judicial nominees , and all of the several dozen candidates mr bush has nominated have been confirmed the two principal issues that threaten judge ryskamp s confirmation are his membership of more than 20 years in the riviera club in coral gables and comments he has made from the bench that provoked outrage from civil rights groups urged to remove cloud judge ryskamp \( pronounced ricecamp \) announced less than a week ago that he was resigning from the club because supporters had urged him to remove this cloud from his confirmation hearing but the resignation did little to stem the anger of some members of the judiciary committee , which approved a resolution last summer saying membership in such a club would disqualify someone from the bench judge ryskamp , who was named to the federal bench by president ronald reagan in 1986 , told the committee today that he did not believe the club discriminated he said that he thought it always had some jewish members and that no blacks belonged because none had ever applied still , he said , he is resigning to avoid the appearance of impropriety caused by what he called distorted news articles you seem to miss the point completely , said senator howard m metzenbaum , democrat of ohio it is not enough for a judge to resign on the point of confirmation senator edward m kennedy , a massachusetts democrat , listed a series of articles published in the miami herald over the last five years about the riviera club s discriminatory policy he seemed incredulous at judge ryskamp s contention that he was little aware of the club s reputation because the club s board members told him that there were some jewish members senator kennedy asked judge ryskamp about his resignation a week before the hearings why 'd it take you so long to resign \? he asked the nominee judge ryskamp replied that when he saw the news articles he went to the club s board of directors and said i was disturbed by them and they said it was n't true he added that he was given names of people identified to me as jewish members arthur n teitelbaum , the southern regional director of the antidefamation league of b'nai b'rith , said that judge ryskamp s contention that the club did not discriminate was preposterous testifying afer judge ryskamp had finished , mr teitelbaum said it was impossible to be a resident of south florida and unaware that the riviera did not welcome jews and blacks senator orrin g hatch , a utah republican who is judge ryskamp s most vociferous supporter , said he believed the charges against the nominee are a lot of nonsense under questioning by senator hatch , judge ryskamp said that he only used the club for lunch about twice a month , and joined it because his wife liked the book club and so that his daughter could use the swimming pool the concern over whether judge ryskamp has made illconsidered remarks from the bench was reinforced today when senator paul simon , an illinois democrat , said that members of his staff had earlier interviewed judge ryskamp about his views on a 1980 resolution passed by the riviera club that prohibited any language but english from being spoken there miami as a foreign city in response , judge ryskamp told the staff members that the resolution was a mistake and was soon withdrawn , but that one had to consider it in its context miami , he said , is like a foreign city , and his wife is frustrated that the grocery she has gone to for 20 years has all spanishspeaking clerks , offers only spanish food and she ca n't find food i like to eat the judge said club members simply wanted a place where we did n't have to hear spanish the remarks from the bench that raised the sensitivity issue occurred during a 1987 case in which some black plaintiffs sued the west palm beach police department , saying they were mauled by police dogs during a search for criminal suspects in the trial , judge ryskamp mused aloud that some countries maim theives by cutting off their hands and that it might be a good idea for some of the plaintiffs to carry around a few scars to remind them of their wrongdoing if they had done anything wrong after much questioning over the comments today , judge ryskamp eventually said he wished he had not made those comments but he added that he was commenting on the irony that our civil rights laws might provide these plaintiffs with a settlement because of the police dogs , and such a reward might encourage them to commit further crimes senator joseph r biden jr , a democrat from delaware who is chairman of the judiciary committee , said those remarks were shocking the 11th circuit has a rich diet of civil rights and death penalty cases , and is one of the few federal circuits that is not yet dominated by conservative judges senator howell heflin , an alabama democrat who is the only committee member from one of the states served by the 11th circuit , praised judge ryskamp as a superb judicial craftsman but the senator added that he was concerned because any judge on that court must have some sensitivity to that region and what has occurred there photo senator joseph r biden jr , right , talking with judge kenneth l ryskamp before yesterday s senate confirmation hearing judge ryskamp has been nominated to the court of appeals for the 11th circuit \( michael geissinger for the new york times \)
east rutherford , nj , oct 28 the problem with the giants is that they seem to have forgotten how to win in their last two games , they have looked like killers in the first half and sleepwalkers in the second the big plays they made last season en route to their super bowl victory are now being made by the opposition the breaks they once got seem to be going against them their big plays have become scarce in sunday night s game against the unbeaten washington redskins , the giants looked like world beaters in the first half in the second half , the redskins hit two touchdown passes from mark rypien to gary clark and won , 1713 the loss dropped the giants' record to 44 a year ago , this team went 133 in the regular season and 30 in the playoffs last year , said stephen baker , the giants' wide receiver , we were winning these games search for answers something is missing no one is sure what it is , although everyone has an opinion if i knew what it was , coach ray handley said today , i would certainly address it we 're capable of playing with anybody we just have n't shown the capacity to beat those good teams perhaps the giants need a secondhalf rally , the kind that other teams have used to beat them handley disagreed i do n't need any comefrombehind victory , he said all i need is to go out and clobber somebody looks are deceivingieving the giants are not a bad team they can still make the playoffs on a wild card their four losses have been by 6 , 3 , 5 and 4 points , which is not bad but their four victories have been by 2 , 3 , 11 and 3 points , which is not earthshaking two of those victories have come on field goals with four seconds left the giants allowed the redskins to score on a drive that gained 84 yards in 20 plays and ate up 8 minutes 55 seconds that was something the giants used to do to other teams obviously , the giants are not what they used to be why \? here are possible reasons they have not acclimated themselves to a new head coach and a new quarterback their leadership is not as strong they are not as hungry this season , handley became the head coach after a worndown bill parcells retired handley named jeff hostetler over the incumbent phil simms as his starting quarterback the team was accustomed to the emotional , yelling parcells handley uses a quieter approach handley acknowledges he has made rookie mistakes , but none of that should make such a big difference hostetler has played well handley said he had no thought of returning to simms now because , he said , that certainly would be change for change s sake following the leaders the leadership situation is subtle when george martin and harry carson were the team leaders , they knew how to get their teammates to play their best both retired after the 1988 season , and the team leadership has not been the same on offense , the leaders included simms , who is emotional , and ottis anderson , who can be but simms has not taken a snap all season and anderson has been all but phased out at running back in favor of a younger rodney hampton if leaders do not play , their influence diminishes the new offensive leaders include hostetler and bart oates neither is a screamer , as lawrence taylor can be with the defense , and at times closeddoor screaming is effective if a team is not hungry , none of that makes a difference , either it is not a matter of merely wanting to win , but how badly the players want to win after the redskins' game , the giants' locker room was placid , almost as if the players had accepted their fate of win today , lose tomorrow handley said he thought that was a false impression we had played very hard , he said our players had trouble understanding why they lost the game they 're having a hard time accepting it i do n't think any of these guys will decide that the season is over i do n't think they do n't care if they win or lose i think they 're distressed that they lost we 're not a team in disarray i think we 're going to turn out ok will they \? if we go 62 the rest of the way , taylor said , we will make the playoffs i think 62 would do it , handley said i 'd rather go 80 and guarantee it when the playoffs start , taylor said , anybody can win true but first you have to get to the playoffs extra points the giants' most serious injury against the redskins was adrian white s dislocated right shoulder coach ray handley listed the backup safety as doubtful for next monday night s game against the eagles in philadelphia the other injured giants were doug riesenberg \( sprained left ankle \) , mark collins \( bruised right knee \) , carl banks \( bruised ribs \) , zeke mowatt \( hyperextended big toe \) and everson walls \( bruised right shoulder \) riesenberg , banks and mowatt will be limited when practice resumes wednesday matt bahr may kick wednesday , but raul allegre will probably stay for now photo the redskins , with players like ricky ervins , are making the big plays this season while the giants are missing them \( vic delucia the new york times \)
the brooklyn district attorney s office said yesterday that it had cut its backlog of felony cases by 15 percent in an unusual threeweek campaign of plea bargains , reduced charges and dismissals that gave many defendants a windfall and helped smooth a reorganization of courts and the prosecutor s office in the clash of criminal law , where accused muggers and thieves and the lawyers who defend them rarely see eye to eye with prosecutors , and judges are frequently overwhelmed by caseloads , the campaign offered a rare glimpse of common ground that left all sides generally satisfied , if not downright happy very pleased a better deal maybe we 're getting back to reality these were some of the comments yesterday by judges , prosecutors and defense lawyers who were asked about the results searching for settlements in a hectic series of conferences from sept 19 to oct 11 , top prosecutors , defense lawyers , defendants and state supreme court justices in brooklyn screened 5 , 200 felony cases ranging from drugs and weapons charges to burglary , assault and murder , searching for settlements that would serve justice and avoid trials such plea bargains are a regular practice in the judicial system , but the recent campaign was the most concentrated in the memory of senior prosecutors to sharply cut the felony caseload in brooklyn , where some 14 , 000 people are indicted on felonies each year normally , fewer than 800 cases are cleared by plea bargains , dismissals and verdicts in a threeweek period in the brooklyn courts the campaign succeeded in clearing some 2 , 100 cases 1 , 944 through guilty pleas to reduced charges , and 157 more through the dismissal of cases flawed by absent witnesses or other problems , officials said the backlog was not cut by the full 2 , 100 , however , because new indictments were enlarging the total , but the caseload was cut to 4 , 400 , from 5 , 200 , or 15 percent , in the three weeks and for hundreds of people accused of drug crimes , auto theft , manslaughter and other felonies , the deals meant the reduction of felonies to lesser charges , and correspondingly reduced jail time , in some cases to none at all 'we got a good deal' i 'd like to think we got a good deal , said barry schreiber , executive assistant to the chief of the trial division for district attorney charles j hynes some defendants were offered more attractive deals than they had been offered in the past , but 35 percent of these 5 , 200 cases had been pending six months or longer they were cases that were not getting any younger , and we 'd like to think we disposed of them reasonably , within our office s guidelines mr schreiber said the courts and the prosecutor s office in brooklyn used to be organized around categories of crime , with special trial sections and prosecutorial bureaus to handle drug cases , sex crimes , homicides and other kinds of cases during the recent changes , however , only a handful of the specialized sections were kept most were reorganized into five geographical areas , each with seven judges and a group of prosecutors handling all crimes that occur within those zones reports on the changes appeared yesterday in the daily news and the new york post the purpose of the reorganization , mr hynes said in an interview yesterday , is to more closely track crime in specific neighborhoods , especially by repeat offenders like drug addicts who mug people to support their habit , and to coordinate the efforts of different agencies in snaring such criminals 'not a sale of any kind' he said a pilot reorganization last february succeeded in identifying , prosecuting and jailing a number of muggers and cutting street robberies in one neighborhood by 40 percent we 're very pleased , said justice ronald j aiello , the administrative judge for the courts in brooklyn i'm absolutely convinced it was not a sale of any kind it was a realistic , hard look at the merits of these cases a number of them were overindictments paul madden , director of the brooklyn branch of the legal aid society , called the plea bargaining realistic and for some of the defendants , he added , it was a better deal than they might have expected james dipietro , a private defense lawyer , said no one was giving anything away , because a lot of the charges are overinflated they were getting down to plea offers that maybe should have been made in the first place maybe we 're getting back to reality
three burnedout steel piers stand like eerily twisted skeletons in upper new york bay as teenagers swim past the rusted shell of a halfsubmerged chevy cutlass off the sunset park section of brooklyn just to the north , beyond the stench of the gowanus canal and a huge , unused grain terminal , a shortlived port authority project called fishport stands empty , and row upon row of scofflaws' cars fill an impoundment lot further north are the littleused piers beneath the brooklyn heights promenade , the subject of long , bitter debate , and the industrial waterfront in williamsburg and greenpoint , where a few factories and wasteprocessing plants operate , but much of the land remains a foreboding , fencedoff noman s land this is the north brooklyn waterfront 'neglect and decay , ' and studies despite years of voluminous studies including a comprehensive waterfront plan being prepared by the city planning department much of this waterfront continues to suffer from neglect and decay , said marcia reiss , the policy director for the parks council , a private group , and author of a 1990 report , creating public access to the brooklyn waterfront no real changes , no development or creation of public access has moved forward substantially , she added the city has no comprehensive thinking , because they do n't have the confidence that they will derive sufficient revenues from the waterfront there have been some commercial success stories , like the red hook marine terminal , the only active container port in new york city the cocoaport at the still mostly empty south brooklyn marine terminal in sunset park , and the industrial revitalization of the old brooklyn navy yard along the east river and the brooklyn army terminal in sunset park but this winding , 10mile stretch of waterfront is largely an economic , esthetic and recreational disaster few stevedores and fewer parks commercially , it is a pale shadow of a waterfront once teeming with stevedores unloading cargo ships and bustling shipbuilding and repair yards and , in the borough with the city s lowest percentage of parkland , virtually none of this coastline , with its views of manhattan and new york s harbor is accessible to the public new york city was built around the water , said richard j aneiro , the president of the brooklyn navy yard development corporation but it turned its back on the water because the city wanted to be whitecollar consequently , he added , as traditionally waterfrontbased industry fled the city during the last 40 years , nothing was done to develop industry only whitecollar business and luxury housing officials of the city s planning department , economic development corporation and department of business services which last month superseded the department of ports and trade as well as the port authority of new york and new jersey , all express cautious optimism about the waterfront s future , and point to a net gain in industrial tenants near the waterfront during the mid1980 s yet , many brooklynites feel frustrated and bitter about the waterfront , saying that new york city has done pitifully little to attract commerce or visitors to its waterfront , compared with cities like boston , baltimore , miami and san francisco with the development on the manhattan side of the river , the neglect on this side makes one angry , said marilyn gelber , the executive assistant to the brooklyn borough president , howard golden prostitutes sleeping on benches and pompilio rosario , who often rides his bicycle to the tiny , debrisstrewn waterside park between the amstar sugar factory and the pfizer pharmaceuticals plant at the end of grand street in williamsburg , said during the day , you see prostitutes sleeping on the benches people leave garbage here and the city does n't even put in garbage cans it could be a lot better after world war ii , waterfront businesses gradually left brooklyn , as traditional cargo shipping gave way to giant container ships because brooklyn lacked enough inexpensive land for container storage , much of the region s shipping industry moved to new jersey , where the port authority developed container ports in elizabeth and newark many brooklyn piers and warehouse sheds were abandoned and allowed to deteriorate and the brooklyn navy yard which employed 70 , 000 people at its peak during world war ii closed in 1966 the waterfront s problems are further aggravated by its divided ownership by a patchwork of city agencies , the port authority , new york state , private developers hungering to build and other individuals some disputed claims date to titles issued three centuries ago by english monarchs , said ann buttenwieser , vice president for waterfront planning with the economic development corporation the number of groups involved makes comprehensive planning and concrete action difficult , said alfred ng , the director of port and aviation development for the department of business services the north brooklyn waterfront is in fact a series of somewhat discrete areas including , from south to north , sunset park , the gowanus canal area , the erie basin , red hook , brooklyn heights , the fulton ferry area , the navy yard , williamsburg and greenpoint each has its own problems , controversies and promise the sunset park waterfront , from about 69th street north to the gowanus canal , illustrates both the legacy of neglect and successful attempts at economic redevelopment
the career of murray perahia on records has been an exercise in cautious expansion eighteen years ago , columbia masterworks \( to become cbs masterworks and then sony classical \) issued performances of schumann s fantasiestucke and davidsbundlertanze they presented to the public a young american pianist , frail in appearance and slender in tone , who brought to the lyric romantic repertory a rare equipoise between passion and taste the grace in this playing seemed not manufactured at all alterations in tempo , points of emphasis and the interpretation of phrase marks were free of laborious calculation but instead the product of instinctive choices confirmed by intelligence at the age of 44 , mr perahia continues to test his talents slowly and carefully , matching them against music demanding ever grander stages and bigger sound two of four new releases follow this direction the original preoccupations with chopin and mendelssohn persist , with basic items continuing to be rethought and redone over the years there are also the mozart concertos , recorded and in some cases rerecorded with orchestras the pianist himself conducts there have been two bartok releases , including the sonata for two pianos and percussion with sir georg solti , but except for some rachmaninoff solo pieces , little else of the 20th century in the early 1980 s came the first beethoven sonatas , mostly early ones newly married at the time , mr perahia told this writer half jokingly that he had begun on beethoven sonatas because his wife liked them , but there was obviously more one saw here a new stretching process in motion he chose wisely listeners interested in the sheer joy and power of young beethoven should investigate mr perahia s recordings of the opus 7 and the opus 22 sonatas \( sony mt 36695 cassette \) recently he has recorded the five concertos as well now come new releases from sony a brahms cd , another disk given to franck and liszt and two more to mozart the brahms repertory \( sk 47181 cd and cassette \) seems chosen for its big gestures , including the fminor sonata s tortured grandeur , ponderous length and pockets of great lyricism the rest comprises late piano pieces , and almost all except the bminor capriccio from opus 76 are the large impassioned works that seem almost anomalous among the private reveries of op 76 , 116 , 117 , 118 and 119

president bush will soon face his biggest and most challenging test in shaping a new world order since the persian gulf war beginning in midnovember , secretary of state baker and later mr bush himself will spend the better part of a month traveling in asia , ending symbolically on dec 7 in pearl harbor they will be trying to pull together a policy for the asianpacific rim , an area of the world that will probably have a greater impact on america than all the latest sovietamerican arms control announcements and the middle east negotiations mr bush and mr baker will be dealing with the core issue of any new world order foreign economic policy in the largest , most dynamic economic region of the globe the bushbaker challenge will be to replace the historic antisoviet focus of us asian policy with a new emphasis on geoeconomics , to forge new economic bonds and use them to resolve political problems and prevent economic disputes from exploding into political confrontations the stakes are investment , jobs , growth , trade and trade wars , and most delicate and dangerous of all relations with china and japan washington s troubles with these two asian giants edge ever closer to a blowup no country is more important to the us than japan , and with no other country are its economic ties so strained mr bush has managed to keep things together through his personal relationship with the departing prime minister , toshiki kaifu , but personal friendships will not substitute for the tough political decisions needed in both capitals to sidetrack economic warfare the two sides are talking about the right issues \( american budget deficits and education and japanese restrictive trade and investment practices \) , but they just are not getting anywhere japan will be mr baker s principal stop in a trip that will begin with a nov 12 meeting with asia s leading freemarket countries later in november mr bush will journey to japan , south korea , indonesia and australia neither now plans to stop in china chinese leaders are approaching a full boil over congressional pressures on human rights , mr bush s visit with tibet s dalai lama and a host of other such matters us leaders are steaming over china s 15 billion trade surplus with the us , some of it the fruits of slave labor some china experts would like mr baker to stop in beijing and defuse the tension but the secretary and the president worry that such a highlevel contact would send american human rights watchers into orbit the solution , and administration diplomats are working on it secretly , is to see if beijing will agree in advance to certain concessions to be announced during a baker visit america s hold on china turns on trade , technology and investment , all of which beijing requires to modernize that hold , tragically , has done little to alleviate beijing s human and political rights abuses but washington has used its leverage well to gain china s critical neutrality at the un during the war against iraq , pressure on communist rebels to end the fighting in cambodia and agreement to restrict missile sales to the volatile mideast and elsewhere the power of the purse is everywhere evident in asia japan is using it to pry its northern islands away from the soviet union tokyo is employing the same bait to persuade north korea to halt its nonetoosecret nuclear arms program north korea is coming out of its nasty and dangerous shell because it is an economic basket case vietnam will also sink into economic oblivion without aid , which explains its recent help in concluding cambodia s civil war overarching all this are the worldwide gatt freetrade negotiations , a vast multilateral gabfest now in an ominous stalemate a breakdown in these talks could lead to western european and north american trade blocs to guard against such possibilities , some asians are flirting with establishing their own trade bloc fortunately , asian nations still depend on free trade , oppose protectionism and fear japanese domination if america is excluded every pacific rim nation wants full american involvement in the region , which gives the us an inherent longterm advantage that mr bush and mr baker can start using next month to mold the emerging geoeconomic order
the persian gulf war obviously has wide public support , enough to intimidate dissident politicians from standing up to oppose it someone , probably but not necessarily a democrat , nevertheless may be missing an opportunity by holding his or her tongue a number of factors suggest that support for the war will fade , perhaps even rapidly for one thing , not every patriotic american who backs the troops and hopes for his country s victory agrees that war was necessary or wise before the shooting started , the nation was deeply divided and today s enthusiasm may fade as prewar doubts and questions reemerge for another thing , the inevitable ground war is beginning , once again confounding the rosy claims of airpower buffs in gen norman schwarzkopf s words , that means the best is still to come he might better have said the worst , since he referred to the major allied effort to drive the iraqis out of kuwait , a push expected to bring hard fighting and high casualties soviet generals long familiar with the iraqi military , as well as us analysts , believe the us has underestimated saddam hus sein s and iraq s fighting potential unsettled war aims also may portend declining unity the recent bakerbessmertnykh statement seemed to suggest , for instance , that iraq might end the war with a commitment and concrete steps to withdraw from kuwait , rather than the previously specified withdrawal itself but israel s foreign minister , david levy , says the war will not end until the iraqi regime is destroyed , an aim neither the arab allies nor moscow embraces and one that the us has not yet formally avowed what happens if , after hard fighting , the iraqis are driven from kuwait but do not give up \? the un mandate will have been satisfied but not israeli demands or the desire of many americans probably including george bush that saddam hussein be removed and iraq s military potential destroyed will the war go on in that event \? would it then enjoy such wide support \? sooner or later , moreover , many americans will question the priorities that place the gulf war ahead of crying domestic needs barely acknowledged by the bush administration how long can it be contended that war against iraq is more important than the nation s failing education system , its inadequate health services , its massive crime problem \? how long can or should superpower pretensions be maintained , in spite of the nation s weakened economic and social bases \? for all these reasons , and perhaps others , the potential for a strong opposition to the gulf war exists on the home front , too , the recession may well be longer and harder than president bush says he expects and alan greenspan , the chairman of the federal reserve , suggests that a long war might well cause a deeper recession thus , war and the economy might cause public opinion to move sharply against mr bush who , in that case , would be the political beneficiary \? at the moment , it s not surprising that none of those most often mentioned as possible democratic nominees in 1992 are speaking out most no doubt remember that even an active and powerful domestic reaction against the vietnam war failed to produce an outright opposition candidate in 1968 and that george mcgovern , as such a candidate in 1972 , lost a landslide an opposition leader would have to weigh his words carefully in order not to be seen as undercutting brave american troops in the field but the ambiguity of the administration s intentions , the dark uncertainties surrounding a postwar settlement and numerous neglected domestic problems would provide such a leader with legitimate causes for his stand he might genuinely argue , for example , that the most useful support for american troops is to spare them needless casualties in unwise battles senator sam nunn of georgia , whom some consider a potential democratic candidate , voted against authorizing the president to start the war his current support for american forces and american victory ca n't change that vote , or the impression that he believed the war unnecessary up to the moment it was started a democratic dark horse , senator robert kerrey of nebraska , also voted against war he has a medal of honor , and senator nunn has a history of military support and expertise , as a defense against charges of being soft but it s probably too much to expect that either would take the undeniable political risk of leading the opposition even to a war that s likely to lose acceptability as the months go along
could it be that the best of jackie joynerkersee is now recalled from memory \? she has been regarded as the finest female athlete of the united states for so long that merely suggesting the possibility might be considered folly nowhere in the world looms another woman capable of matching her scores in the grueling heptathlon , the throne room of her remarkable career since 1986 in that time , she has extended the heptathlon world record four times , shared a world longjump record once and earned recognition as few other track and field athletes have in the united states as a role model for young people through success , charitable works and commercial endorsements yet the vagaries of life have not left her safe from intrusion , and one can only wonder if frequent bouts with asthma , now worsening , and her age , now 29 , are expediting the pace that leads all athletes to their inevitable competitive conclusion for the moment , the evidence is suggestive but incomplete , although more might emerge this week as the national track and field championships return to randalls island in manhattan for the first time in 25 years the fourday meet opens wednesday , and the top three finishers in each event qualify for the world championships in tokyo , which start aug 23 also , two athletes from each event will form the team for the pan american games in havana , starting aug 2 joynerkersee intends to compete in the heptathlon and long jump , and if confidence alone could propel her to yet another record in either , the achievement would be assured after a 1990 season in which her coach and husband , bob kersee , had to coax and prod her through the summer , she has returned to the track this spring with a renewed joy and enthusiasm even if periodically bothered by soreness in her hamstring and groin muscles her enjoyment is back , kersee said recently in spirit , she is remindful of the indomitable force she once was , the athlete who stretched the heptathlon world record to 7 , 148 points at the 1986 goodwill games in moscow , to 7 , 158 a month later at the united states olympic festival in houston , to 7 , 215 at the olympic trials in 1988 , to the current mark , 7 , 291 , that to win the olympic gold medal in seoul , south korea , where she also won the longjump competition with an effort of 740 but there the progression ended , leaving not so much as a hint of better to come in 1989 , she left heptathlons and the long jump to concentrate on hurdles events , earning a no 3 ranking at 400 meters and no 8 at 100 in the united states last summer , she shifted her focus again , finishing the year ranked first in the world in the heptathlon , first in the united states and seventh in the world in the long jump and fourth in the united states in the 100meter hurdles in no event , though , was she especially imposing with her mind stretched sideways , toward ever more activities off the track , and forward to the world championships and the olympics in barcelona , spain , next summer , her best mark was the 6 , 783 points she scored to win the heptathlon at the goodwill games in seattle her year s best efforts in the long jump , 23 feet 4 1 2 inches , and hurdles , 1279 seconds , were ordinary to whatever degree joynerkersee was distracted or disinterested last season , the condition was compounded by recurring asthma attacks she has suffered from them for 10 years initially , she thought they were brought on only by exercise in discussions with various doctors , she has since learned their onset can be triggered by stress and change in environment , which are unavoidable in keeping her various outside commitments , including work with the jackie joynerkersee community foundation , which sponsors education and recreation programs for disadvantaged youngsters you get worse each year , kersee told her , as they stood on the infield of san jose city college stadium at the recent bruce jenner classic , when she was trying to remember if the asthma had shown any pattern she knew but she cowers at the thought she might have to curtail her activities because of something so simple as asthma kersee has a head for figures , as a heptathlon coach must thus , his admonition continued you know , jackie , you were not at home 284 nights in 1990 then he turned to a reporter when she slows down , it does n't affect her as much in one 10day period last year , she was in california , phoenix , st louis , new york and los angeles and this year , pollen levels are up everywhere the attacks are sometimes exacerbated by her allergies , and pollen is only one of them cut grass bothers her so do dust , seafood , peanuts , almonds , peaches , plums , other pitted fruits and apples i eat the fruit , anyway , she said , laughing in november , an asthma attack led to pneumonia in march , she was hospitalized twice the second time , she had been downstairs in their home when the attack occurred kersee , who was upstairs in his office , did n't hear her calls for help at first she grew anxious and frightened , which only made the episode worse
madrid , nov 2 despite syria s serious hesitation in the last two days over joining the next stage of the middle east peace conference here , arab delegates say neither syria , nor any other participant , can afford to stay out of the process indefinitely most of those attending the talks , including the israelis , say they view the syrian position as part of what they predict will be years of exhaustive negotiations the general sentiment here is that the syrians will eventually take up a role in the talks , if not sunday , then in a few days or a few weeks otherwise , according to this line of thought , they will face an intolerable isolation in a fastchanging world , especially since the palestinians , jordanians and israelis have agreed to talk whether the syrians come or not lotfy alkhouli , a wellknown arab columnist and expert on arab and palestinian affairs who is a member of the egyptian delegation , summed up the general opinion when he said today that the syrians would come back because the country that issued the invitation for the talks was the united states now the world s solitary superpower and , he added , a nation none of the participants could afford to alienate fear of being left out everyone is inside the peace cage and the door has been closed , mr khouli said it s an american cage from which syrians , just like israelis and palestinians , cannot really get out anyone who thinks otherwise is engaged in wishful thinking there are other factors in the assessments here of syria s future role several arab delegates here said the syrians were also concerned that talks between palestinians and israelis might move much faster than talks between the syrians and the israelis , leaving syria stranded as other arabs settle with israel experts here say syria is maneuvering with its traditional politics in a different arab world from the one it used to inhabit the persian gulf states have been freed from syrian and iraqi intimidation by the gulf crisis palestinians , who never had much affection for syria , have appeared to win publicity points here , and they see these talks as their last chance to win a measure of autonomy iraq , because of the gulf war , has been wiped out as an arab force for years to come all these changes affect the mix among the sea changes of the last few years is a fundamental and revolutionary transformation in the arab mindset , a diminution of israel s role as the foremost regional ally of the united states and the emergence of the united states as the world power changing old patterns together , these factors have deeply affected the nature of the discourse among arabs and with the rest of the world they have also swept up both israel and the arabs in a process that many here regard as one made in the united states the process is annihilating stereotypes of the past and forcing changes in old patterns of action among palestinians , this evolution has been starkly expressed by the chief palestinian spokeswoman at the madrid talks , hanan ashrawi , when she proclaimed the other day that 40 years of violence have got us nowhwere for syria , far beyond any concern over the surface issue of the venue of the talks , there is a deep concern about forging ahead with the talks and thus giving the appearance that it is too quickly abandoning the hardline public statements it has endorsed for a quarter of century on the topic of the israelioccupied territories between the arabs themselves , the new attitudes are illustrated by what the egyptian foreign minister , amr moussa , calls the civilized modalities of dealing with each other themes from sadat these themes began to evolve more than a decade ago , when president anwar elsadat of egypt visited israel and called for peace between arabs and jews from the podium of the parliament faced at first with utter arab rejection , the themes mr sadat advocated have now found their way to the arab mainstream the madrid negotiations are in fact picking up after the camp david accords , which brought peace between egypt and israel they have emerged as an acceptable arab choice as a consequence of the gulf crisis and the gulf war the war also emboldened arab moderates in other respects too many are openly stating now what they have always whispered in private that their vital interests are firmly attached to an enduring alliance with the west support from saudis king fahd of saudi arabia , whose country hardly uttered the word israel a few years ago , is declaring almost weekly now his support of the american peace initiative , vowing to support it , and pouring lavish praise on president bush and secretary of state james a baker 3d for its part , the united states has framed the parameters of the red line of which it is the author by adopting an increasingly firm tone with israel the word evenhanded has been pronounced repeatedly by american officials to describe their shifting approach to the middle east peace process to get israel to attend the peace conference , mr bush used the carrot of 10 billion in loan guarantees for helping settle soviet jewish immigrants moreover , the united states leaned on israel to swallow the presence of palestinian delegates who are demonstrably affiliated with the palestine liberation organization although the israelis have vowed never to do business with the plo arab gulf countries have advanced a proposition to end their economic boycott of israel if it were to stop jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip egypt s leadership president hosni mubarak of egypt , heir to mr sadat s legacy , treated as a pariah for having supported the peace treaty with israel , has recaptured much of egypt s traditional leadership in the region almost every week arab diginitaries travel to cairo , and the league of arab states moved back there this year , to a home not far from where the israeli flag flutters over the country s embassy in downtown cairo after the persian gulf war , a sort of stampede has been under way among arab leaders , including president hafez alassad of syria , to fashion a political and strategic relationship with the united states after its emergence as the world s only superpower in this , many of them hope to emulate the special relationship that the israelis cultivated over the last three decades in their ties to the united states this new mindset is buttressed by the continuing collapse of the communist empire , leaving intransigent mideast regimes , like iraq , libya , syria and iran , with poor alternatives and even poorer arguments to justify their stands pressures on syria over the last few weeks , a conference held in teheran to inveigh against the peace process went largely unremarked in many arab capitals and in yet another sign of the new era that is affecting the syrians' situation , palestinian youths poured out into the streets of the israelioccupied west bank on wednesday to place olive branches on israeli armored cars patrolling their cities these and other events have added to the pressures on the syrians to come to the table , delegates here agree as mr moussa of egypt said in a conversation today there is a red line no one can cross time and the evolution of things in the region make it imperative to change the way we think there is a new order being fashioned with the good offices of the united states and no one can be excepted from it
when on that great day in 1918 americans and others celebrated the end of world war i , they could not have known that the dreadful conflict was going to produce great art the poems of rupert brooke , such films as grand illusion , plays like what price glory \? and hundreds of other works once again , americans are celebrating a traditional tickertape parade will be held in new york tomorrow for the victors of the persian gulf war but if this war has produced a surge of national pride reminiscent of 1918 and 1945 , there is no guarantee that it will , like the civil war , the two world wars , and the conflicts in korea and vietnam , produce a commensurate art it seems as though the gulf war , rapid and militarily successful as it was , fell short of several of the ingredients that previous wars had in great quantities happily , it lacked length it lacked arduousness it lacked the sense of national anguish , disillusionment and painful selfscrutiny that inspired many of the books and movies that emerged , in particular , from the vietnam war it was a war so carefully scripted for television that it was in a way already a movie it s hard to imagine what a film maker could do that the war itself , and previous movies , have n't done already in a sense , said oliver stone , whose movies platoon and born on the fourth of july were two of several major films about the vietnam war and its aftermath , tom cruise already did the persian gulf war in 'top gun' robert stone , author of the novel dog soldiers , also inspired by vietnam , said when i think of the cultural impact of the persian gulf war , what i end up with literally is commercials on cnn , some of which became noticeably more patriotic for a war shown 24 hours a day on television , the gulf war seems to have been short of the sorts of scenes that have exercised imaginations in the past in every other war , said john eskow , a screenwriter whose credits include air america , about the secret cia airline in laos during the vietnam war , there were dynamic central images that were almost like jungian archetypes , from mathew brady s photos in the civil war to iwo jima in world war ii , or that naked vietnamese girl in tears running away from an american bombing this war s image is of a smart bomb hitting a target , but that has no emotional reverberation he said that if a producer called him asking for a screenplay on the gulf war , he would have no idea where to begin perhaps among the soldiers fighting in the gulf there was some future norman mailer or joseph heller or oliver stone , whose vision a decade or so from now will transform desert storm into biting satire or transfixing drama , a naked and the dead or a catch22 one hollywood publicity agent advised against underestimating the entertainment world s ability to come up with something salable to both advertisers and the television public a fivepart miniseries , say , on the life of gen h norman schwarzkopf but it would be hard to see that in the same vein as works whose purpose was to depict human beings and their dilemmas in the situation of ultimate intensity that war creates when the young steven crane wrote the red badge of courage , he was doing for the civil war what the young ernest hemingway did for world war i in a farewell to arms they were both dramatizing conflicts between men and what others were demanding of them what would there be to dramatize about the gulf war \? surely , as a battlefield episode , america s latest war was scary , a crucible of experience for the men and women who fought in it yet the war s pushbutton , longdistance nature seems to have sucked it dry of the juice of human drama even with vietnam , nobody made a movie about b52 pilots based in guam who dropped their payloads after a monotonous sixhour flight across the pacific except for the last three days of the gulf war there were almost no mantoman confrontations and the ground war itself was over so quickly that it was devoid of the suspense that drama requires it was the perfect war for antonioni , said ken burns , creator of the acclaimed 10part civil war documentary he was speaking of the italian film director who has made a virtue out of depicting alienation from real events but insofar as war stories require proximity to experience , mr burns said , the gulf war will prove to be lacking there s no reality to this war , but only a kind of virtual reality oliver stone said the war picked up hollywood s expectations of what war is there was none of the grittiness , the dirt , the sweat of hard ground combat that there was in the korean war or in vietnam rather than scenes of battle , americans and others saw scenes of briefings and hightech video clips during the gulf war and what they saw was so carefully orchestrated , as mr eskow put it , that no movie or play or novel could surpass it as a created event schwarzkopf and powell were a perfect buddy team , he said schwarzkopf was a gene hackman character and powell was like danny glover one the big , burly , gruff but friendly white lead , the other the brilliant black sidekick they even came up with the perfect title , desert storm , and you know how important titles are in the movies to paul fussell , author of the great war and modern memory about the ways war often enters into the collective conscience as falsification and myth , the gulf war had another aspect that makes it an unlikely source of art for the first time in american history , a major war was fought by an allprofessional army probably not very rich in poets the poets of the two world wars were mainly civilians , and they brought a highly civilian viewpoint to the conflict , he said even in vietnam , most people who wrote were there unwillingly , and therefore they had the great literary opportunity of contrasting what they were doing with what they thought they ought to be doing as human beings a professional soldier is less likely to have that point of view and yet , perhaps there s more material in the gulf war than one would think the evil personified by saddam hussein , the clash of western and arab societies , the tragedy of the kurds after the battlefield victory any of that could produce novels , plays or movies and , of course , there are those things that nobody has thought of yet nobody can predict the wellsprings of art after world war ii would anyone have imagined that one of the best movies to emerge from the conflict would be set not on the fields of france but in an obscure north african backwater called casablanca \? photo a scene from grand illusion previous wars had more of the juice of human drama , but the gulf war seems sucked dry
chicago , april 6 in a nationwide alliance of political convenience , republicans have joined with traditionally democratic hispanic and black groups in the battle to redraw congressional districts before the 1992 elections , with both pressing for districts in which minority populations would dominate what the minorities hope to gain is more of their own in the house of representatives the republicans' goal is more complicated by concentrating members of minorities in urban districts , and therefore conceding them to democrats , they hope to improve their chances of defeating democrats in suburban districts the alliance has left democratic house incumbents , including some of the most influential members , in the uncomfortable position of fighting for their survival against the people whose causes they have long championed voting rights act invoked the republicans are invoking amendments to the voting rights act , which many in the party have long opposed , that require state legislatures to draw more districts that would elect black or hispanic representatives illinois , florida , texas , new jersey , virginia , maryland , georgia , california , arkansas and alabama are among the states where incumbent white democrats are threatened by proposals for minority districts if successful , these efforts would not only lead to early retirement for some veteran lawmakers but would also fundamentally change the house nowhere is the tension over reapportionment as high as in chicago , where eight house democrats recently agreed in a private meeting to resist efforts to carve out a hispanic district in the middle of the city their move provoked outcries from hispanic groups , republicans and even some democratic politicians , who said hispanic people deserved representation the situation here is particularly dicey for incumbents because illinois will lose two of its 22 seats in 1992 , and three existing districts that are largely black cannot be wiped out because they are protected by the voting rights act while one republican , edward r madigan , recently vacated his seat to become secretary of agriculture , none of the other incumbents are ready to retire the incumbents include representatives dan rostenkowski and william o lipinski , veteran democrats whose downtown districts have the largest hispanic populations , and who would be most threatened by a new hispanic district rostenkowski tells of meeting from the start of the meeting , which he convened in washington , it was clear that none of his colleagues were willing to relinquish their turf , mr rostenkowski recalled later in an interview mr rostenkowski , chairman of the ways and means committee , said he told his colleagues ladies and gentlemen , there are eight in this room , and there will only be seven after the reapportionment someone s got to go no one stepped forward , he said , and after a long discussion , there was an agreement that there s no way you can contiguously draw a hispanic district advocates of a hispanic district argue , however , that it would not be a stretch to take the bottom portion of mr rostenkowski s district in the north , with a high concentration of puerto ricans the top of mr lipinski s district in the south , which has many mexican americans , and a slice of cardiss collins s district between the two to shape a hispanic district feeling locked out it strikes me that it was rather foolish to have eight members of congress decide the future of chicago s hispanic community , said ruben castillo , associate counsel of the mexican american legal defense and education fund , which for months has pushed for a hispanic district hispanics are the ones who have gained the most population , but we do n't get invited to these backroom little meetings as she worked the polls for the city elections on tuesday , iris martinez said she was insulted by the incumbents' meeting it s a racist gesture by them implying that there s not even room for us , she said responding angrily to the attacks , mr rostenkowski said are they saying , 'hispanic at any cost \? ' it was n't a backroom deal we did n't draw a map my god , it s our future though many would expect mr rostenkowski to exert his signficant influence , he insisted he would do nothing to sway the democraticcontrolled legislature , which will draw the new maps hinting that he may even retire , the 32year house veteran added , i do n't know if the younger guys are looking at me and saying , 'when is that guy going to get out \? ' the speaker is heard but on the day that mr rostenkowski vowed in the interview not to interfere with the state legislature , the illinois house speaker , michael j madigan , perhaps feeling more pressure from the hispanic community than from the congressional delegation , announced he would back a redistricting plan only if it contained a new hispanic district gary j lapaille , chairman of the state democratic party and mr madigan s chief of staff , explained that the speaker wanted to put those congressmen on alert it s very early in the process to tell people no no matter how the legislature acts , most people involved in reapportionment say they expect the fate of a hispanic district to be settled in court even if they do not force veteran democrats into early retirement , or dilute democratic strength in suburban districts , republican strategists are pleased that the predicament is embarrassing democrats this will shake things up , said benjamin l ginsberg , the chief counsel for the republican national committee a democrat detects cynicism representative martin frost , a texas democrat who heads impac 2000 , his party s strategy group on redistricting , denounced the republicans' effort as pretty cynical and driven purely by partisanship but a similar accusation could be hurled at democrats , as they are fighting back by proposing drawing of minority districts in a way that would least affect the party s incumbents you ca n't absolutely protect every democratic incumbent in every state , mr frost said however , you do n't start out with the point of view of republicans to try to destroy democratic districts mr frost s dallas district is among the targets of republicans , who want to redraw the existing configuration with a district that has a black majority but he sought to head off republicans last week by proposing minority status for each of the three new districts the state is expected to get under their plan , the incumbents' districts would not be appreciably altered but in texas and other states that are gaining population , democratic incumbents have more flexibility than in states like illinois , which are losing congressional districts while they are being pressed to create minority ones while mr ginsberg said the republicans were proud of their common cause with minority groups whom the democrats have been slicing and dicing for years , other advocates of greater minority representation say it is an uneasy alliance as a lifelong democrat , mr castillo of the mexican american legal group noted the irony that he is plotting redistricting strategies with republicans we know where they 're coming from , he said we 're in this with our eyes open we do n't want to be used , and we do n't want to be manipulated but the crucial question is , who is going to be more fair to the hispanics \? photo ruben castillo , left , associate counsel of the mexican american legal defense and education fund in chicago , talking with gary j lapaille , chairman of the illinois democratic party they talked during the state democratic party s reapportionment advisory session eight house democrats recently agreed to resist efforts to create a hispanic district in chicago illinois will lose two seats in 1992 \( steve kagan for the new york times \) \( pg a11 \) map of illinois highlighting proposed district change in chicago \( pg a11 \)
it was a reunion that drew rhona lantin to the new york area , a chance to mix with old high school friends from the philippines , trade memories , catch up on too many years apart it was also a chance to see the town , take in the theater , watch the fireworks explode over new york harbor on a warm , beautiful night the best kind of things the area has to offer but a bullet ended that it just happened at 11 30 pm thursday , as ms lantin and friends were driving north on a chinatown street , headed for a latenight snack after the mammoth fireworks display , members of a notorious chinatown gang , the ghost shadows , began to fight , the police say by the time the car reached the crowded intersection , the dispute had become a gun battle gunfire erupted and a bullet hit ms lantin , sitting in the passenger seat , in the head she died yesterday morning at 8 53 at st vincent s hospital yesterday , friends of ms lantin were left to contemplate the fate that linked their 26yearold friend , a government economist known for her gentleness , her devotion to her family and her fondness for filipino handicrafts , to the brutality of a chinatown gunfight when tragedy strikes , you always hear people say , 'it could n't have happened to a nicer , gentler person , ' said hallis seitz , a neighbor of ms lantin s in silver spring , md well , in this case it really does apply the randomness of the shooting was unusual for chinatown , where violent gangs like the ghost shadows usually choose their victims carefully , then stalk them on foot on narrow , winding streets that are almost always congested the killers are usually precise , walking up to the targets and striking them at close range but the police were at a loss yesterday to explain what led to the chance killing of ms lantin at the intersection of mulberry and bayard streets , in the part of chinatown that the ghost shadows call their turf the police say the gang terrorizes storeowners and people in the neighborhood through extortion , robbery and a constant threat of violence there were no suspects last night chief joseph g demartino said he did not know what the dispute was about we 've been talking to people in the chinese community about this , he said this was a particularly happy time for ms lantin , who as an economist studied environmental and natural resources for the department of agriculture in washington she had traveled to a friend s home in jersey city for a reunion of alumni of the rural high school at the university of the philippines in los banos on sunday , friends say , she was to return home to maryland and then fly out to join her fiance , who had already started on a crosscountry pleasure trip they were to be married next spring mr seitz said ms lantin had met her fiance , 29yearold patrick canning , two years ago at the university of maryland , where they were doing graduate work mr canning had recently moved to maryland from a rough neighborhood on 14th street in washington because ms lantin was afraid of being shot there , mr seitz said ms lantin lived with her twin cousins , two women in their early 20 s , on the third floor of a condominium complex , the brownbrick americana finnmark in silver spring she was absolutely nice , mr seitz said she was a really intelligent girl , really smart she was a devout catholic her family was a really close family they did a lot of stuff together , like have barbeques and gatherings it s just tragic , mr seitz said it does n't make any sense she was just at the wrong place at the time , i guess a family friend , tom schruben , said that although she was born in the united states , ms lantin had lived much of her life in the philippines and had returned to this country only in 1987 in choosing the field of agricultural economics , she was following the footsteps of her parents , both of whom were agricultural researchers in the philippines , where they still live 'always wore a smile' mr schruben described ms lantin as a woman who always wore a smile she was always making traditional filipino handicrafts , he said she made dolls and baskets and was always knitting on thursday night , she joined five of her classmates at liberty state park in jersey city , where they watched a fireworks display , chief demartino said all six of the friends then piled into a friend s 1991 ford explorer and headed for chinatown , the chief said the police believe that at 11 30 pm , as the car passed through the intersection , one member of the ghost shadows pulled out a gun and fired at least two shots at several other gang members though the shots missed their targets , one bullet pierced the front passenger window on the right side of the car and struck ms lantin in the head , chief demartino said the driver , seeing ms lantin slump forward , steered the car onto canal street and called the police no one else in the car was injured , chief demartino said no one arrested none of the suspects in the shooting had been identified or arrested yesterday , chief demartino said detectives were canvassing chinatown but no witnesses had come forward , he said though the police have questioned some members of the ghost shadows , witnesses had fled from the intersection by the time the police arrived late thursday evening , chief demartino said in the past , it has been nearly impossible to persuade chinese witnesses to testify in court against the gangs , lawenforcement officials have said chinatown has increasingly become a hotbed of gang warfare as its neighborhoods have continued to swell with chinese and southeast asian immigrants , lawenforcement officials say members of the ghost shadows , who often congregate on mulberry , bayard and mott streets , have been routinely linked to a number of crimes in the area , including extortion , robbery , the protection of illegal gambling establishments and the sale of fireworks , chief demartino said it was not known if the dispute on thursday evening had any connection to the sale of fireworks , he said they 're just another chinese gang , sgt michael wagner , who has spent more than five years monitoring asian gangs , said of the ghost shadows they do the same things as other gangs the authorities have had some success prosecuting the ghost shadows five years ago , the federal attorney s office overcame a lack of witnesses by using the flexible federal racketeering conspiracy laws to convict 21 of the gang s members photo rhona lantin , 26 years old , was a government

all new yorkers want a private beach they want to flipflop down a lonely path , unfold their chairs or spread their towels on an empty patch of sand , and bask in the security of isolation certainly a public beach is a more perilous prospect one risks being boinged by a stray paddle ball or sprinkled with sand as some carefree teenager races past one risks empty coke cans in the sand , and having one s physical imperfections exposed to strangers one risks humanity , perhaps throngs of it , all united in the same democratic pursuit of sun , open air , the smell of salt water , the song of crashing surf yet public beaches offer pleasures that no private beach can rival there is junk food , sumptuous arrays of it , from french fries to pretzels to lemony italian ices to good humor ice cream the feel of a popsicle stick against the tongue captures the essence of summer there are boardwalks , those casual roadways of beach traffic that never stray off a parallel line with the water s edge there are brawny dudes and voluptuous babes , all wearing bathing suits more outrageous and colorful than you 'd ever dare public beaches offer an unusual and intriguing sense of community impervious to class , race or income , they encourage you to drown your identity in an ocean of bodies , coconut oil , laughter and warmth from astroland amusement park at coney island to the terrace at orchard beach , new york city s public beaches present a rare opportunity for adventure early architecture and oldfashioned signs allow a glimpse into the past , while the weathered snack shacks and sturdy , wellkept boardwalks bring it smoothly into the present these beaches are more than just sand and surf they 're culture , experience , a history of a city at play brighton beach 25 miles , on the atlantic ocean , from brighton 15th street to west 37th street , brooklyn , \( 718 \) 9461350 atmosphere brighton beach is from another place , another time it has a ghostly , romantic quality that comes as much from the old apartment buildings and slightly rundown seaside concession stands as from the aging soviet emigres who wander the boardwalk , murmuring in their native tongue the ocean view stretches all the way to the horizon , suggesting distant lands people predominantly soviet immigrants , many of them over age 50 men with white chest hair and straw fedoras women wearing kerchiefs on their heads and embroidered sweaters to shade themselves from the sun , the men wear white noseguards the women simply hold their purses or newspapers above their heads sand hazardous broken glass , jagged pieces of shells , bottle tops but then , the beach itself is n't really the point here surf swimming is n't the point , either boardwalk the center of activity people gossip and philosophize , walking with unhurried steps or perched on benches like pigeons on a wire riegelmann boardwalk continues all the way to coney island \( a 10to15minute walk \) , and the barren frame of the parachute jump is clearly visible in the distance a plank mural between the two beaches asks rhetorical questions like will listening to the ocean add years to your life \?

annandaleonhudson , ny , aug 25 there were times , during claire bloom s highly charged reading of an adaptation of sophocles' antigone at bard college here on saturday night , when the orchestra arrayed behind her seemed superfluous the greek tragedy tells of the ruler creon forbidding the burial of a traitor , and of antigone s defiance of his order as she proclaims a higher law even though the playwright s words were pruned and supplemented by bernard jacobson s narration , the drama was still so coherent in its conflicts , so musical in its passionate unfolding and so balanced about its own allegiances that music might have been a distraction but mendelssohn , in creating his incidental music for antigone \( commissioned by frederick william iv of prussia in 1841 \) , solved the problem by turning the traditional greek choruses into two male choirs musically reacting to and commenting upon the intricate turnings of the spoken plot when antigone marches to her death , for example , the music is pictorial funereal , somber , processional then , between antigone s strophic , spoken cries of agony , the music changes character the chorus offers a hint of comfort antigone is going to join the immortal gods the music becomes a chorale , invoking bach s serene and unsentimental faith it is a moving moment , one of many in this peculiar work , once popular , now rarely heard and unavailable on recording it was also one that leon botstein , the president of bard and the impresario for this twoweek mendelssohn festival , and the conductor of the festival orchestra in three concerts this weekend , handled fervently and revealingly the work s pseudobaroque stylization its french overture rhythms , its word painting , its static musical numbers and narrative commentary turn it into a secular passion antigone is led to her death almost as is the divine hero of bach s st matthew passion her suffering , though , like creon s , is due to the conflict between the state and the family , between secular politics and religious conviction michael steinberg , a historian from cornell university , pointed out in a subtly perceptive preconcert talk how central the play antigone was during the 19th century , when the modern state was coming into being , and how crucial these issues were for mendelssohn himself this performance was also a highlight of a musically distinctive weekend , with seven programs that kept the mind as active as the ears antigone stood out , in part , because mendelssohn was not otherwise much concerned with tragic conflict or with the irreconcilable claims of life he was almost baroque in his sensitivity , creating works around single affects rather than epic tensions one smallscaled recital , for example , paid tribute to the 19thcentury bach revival inspired by mendelssohn s landmark performance of the st matthew passion in 1829 the pianist diane walsh gave finely crafted performances of two of mendelssohn s preludes and fugues and then joined eugene drucker , whose crisply articulated violin playing of unusual romantic arrangements of bach s solo violin works made the invented piano parts by mendelssohn , schumann and brahms irrelevant the baritone william sharp gave tasteful and intelligent performances of multiple settings of goethe poems , preceded by a talk by lawrence kramer of fordham university , who argued that mendelssohn s four published settings of goethe texts were actually love songs paying homage to the greatest cultural authority of the time another concert , devoted to mendelssohn s friends , included works by the danish composer niels gade and the british composer william sterndale bennett , who , following mendelssohn s example , went on to lead performances of the st matthew passion in their native lands but their own orchestral compositions echoes of ossian by gade and the naiads by bennett were compendiums of romantic gestures , with gade s sweetness just barely winning one s affections and though mendelssohn s sister , fanny , was represented by her schumannesque piano cycle das jahr \( played with mixed success by sarah rothenberg \) , that , too , turned out to be more of biographical and historical interest than musical as for mendelssohn himself , a genius at miniature tone poems and elegant energy , mr botstein , i think , wants to claim too much for him even when conducting the scottish symphony , mr botstein strained against the fabric of mendelssohn s graciousness , emphasizing subsidiary beats in an attempt to give weight where there was none and though the choral lobgesang symphony is , as mr botstein explained , an assertion of universalist religious faith , the work itself seems tritely and overly assertive in fact , as antigone showed , the issues of faith and allegiance for mendelssohn were intricate both mr botstein and mr steinberg argued that the characters' struggle between public law and religious tradition , between accommodation and absolutism , was a struggle felt by the mendelssohn family itself felix s grandfather was a great jewish philosopher , his father was a protestant convert , and he himself was a devout protestant who refused to jettison his jewish name or identification , despite his father s pleas the resultant conflicts arose again , as mr botstein intended , in a rare performance of die erste walpurgisnacht on sunday afternoon goethe s text tells of ancient druids fighting off christians intent on destroying their religious world after the defeat of the christians , the priest , sung by mr sharp , joined the pagan chorus in triumphant song even if they rob us of our ancient ritual who can take your light from us \? the words dein licht your light reverberated through the final pages of the work , mendelssohn s simultaneous homage to the ancient rituals of his family and to the enlightenment in which he heartily believed that light of transcendent faith and the enlightenment faith in reason are not always reconciled with each other or with darker forces in mendelssohn s music , which is one reason why charm sometimes fades into triteness , drama into formula , classic models into cliches but it is also why , out of simple material , foursquare rhythms and confident craftsmanship , the faith can sometimes lead to grandeur the bard festival was forgiving , understanding and , finally , celebratory that is how we should welcome its remarkable achievement as well
bethesda , md , july 17 the first attempt to treat cancer patients by inserting potent antitumor genes into their blood cells has not proved dangerous , as some had feared , a scientist said today , but whether it is working remains to be seen in his first comprehensive report on the status of the effort to use human gene therapy against terminal cancer , the scientist , dr steven a rosenberg of the national cancer institute , said that the first two patients to take part in the pilot project were still alive they suffer from malignant melanoma so severe that they had not been expected to survive more than a few months when the trial began on jan 29 two other patients with advanced melanoma have since been added to the program , he said , and he plans to include another six very soon none of the four has shown ill effects from the gene therapy , but dr rosenberg said that it was too early to tell whether any were benefiting from their twiceweekly infusions of genetically altered white blood cells the cells have been designed to deliver a powerful cancerfighting compound , tumor necrosis factor , to the many pockets of malignant tissue in the patients' bodies but dr rosenberg admitted that the project remains plagued by technical difficulties we 're working at the limits of scientific technology , he told an audience of scientists and surgical residents at the national institutes of health here it will take some time to see if we can improve the therapy for the cautious approach in an interview afterwards , dr rosenberg contended that the cautious approach demanded by the food and drug administration before it approved the therapy had forced him in the initial stages to administer the altered white blood cells in doses too small to have any immediate effect only now , he said , is he able to give doses large enough to make a difference but he said he hoped that the treatment would prove to be the first effective therapy for advanced melanoma , which conventional methods like radiation and chemotherapy fail to cure i'm desperate and i'm optimistic , dr rosenberg said i just wish it happened faster dr w french anderson of the national heart , lung and blood institute , said i'm very excited by what i saw today you do n't just do one experimental therapy and wait until it ends before you do another you have to get a lot of things going at once , and i'm confident at least one or two of the ideas he has will have spectacular effects dr anderson heads a project to treat an inherited immune disease with gene therapy , an experiment he says is going beautifully doctors concur that the need for new ammunition against malignant melanoma is dire the incidence of the cancer worldwide is rising faster than that for any other tumor this year about 10 , 000 people in the united states will contract advanced melanoma and most will die in less than 12 months new projects dr rosenberg is so convinced that gene therapy offers the best prospect for a novel generation of cancer treatments that he also presented several other new projects that are at various stages of gestation one proposal was approved this month by two of the eight government agencies that monitor human gene therapy experiments it is an effort to treat advanced breast and colon cancer by adding genes to tumor cells that would make the malignant tissue easier for the body s immune system to attack , if it clears the remaining regulatory hurdles , the experiment could begin next year in the gene therapy experiment , dr rosenberg focused on tumor necrosis factor , which has been shown to be an extremely effective anticancer agent when high doses of the factor are injected into mice with multiple tumors , even the bulkiest malignancies vanish in hours or days but in humans , the raw compound is so toxic that if given in shots strong enough to dissolve the cancer , it would kill the patient dr rosenberg reasoned that if the factor could be delivered to the tumor sites exclusively , it would have a chance to destroy malignant outposts while leaving the rest of the body unharmed to manage the feat , he isolated from patients a class of white blood cell , called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes , known to home in specifically on cancerous tissue with genetic altering techniques , he installed in the lymphocytes the gene that dictates the production of tumor necrosis factor those doctored cells were then grown in the laboratory and reinfused into the patients in gradually increasing doses dr rosenberg and his colleagues have had difficulty keeping the inserted gene active once it is inside the blood cells as a result , the scientists do not know if the lymphocytes that they are injecting into the melanoma patients are producing enough tumor necrosis factor to battle the cancer
stravinsky concert robert craft avery fisher hall two worthy causes were served by robert craft s stravinsky concert at avery fisher hall on saturday evening one was a commemoration of the 20th anniversary of stravinsky s death mr craft , the composer s assistant for many years , paid tribute to his mentor by conducting the too infrequently heard requiem canticles , as well as symphony of psalms and oedipus rex , and the pas de deux from apollo the concert was also a benefit for the hole in the wall gang camp for children with cancer and blood diseases , established by the actor paul newman mr newman contributed a narration of the oedipus rex text in e e cummings s translation the narration , of course , merely provides landmarks the real drama is in stravinsky s setting of a latin text , and mr craft saw to it that none of the music s passion and power was dissipated he had excellent forces at his command the tenors and basses of the new york choral artists sang the rhythmically tricky chorus parts robustly and precisely the soloists john humphrey as oedipus , wendy white as jocasta , john ostendorf as creon , john cheek as tiresias and jon garrison as the shepherd conveyed the drama , helplessness , pain and tragedy of their roles the orchestra of st luke s , one of new york city s most consistently polished ensembles , played superbly for mr craft , who drew a rich , velvety tone from the strings in the apollo movement , and from the choir in symphony of psalms but he did not soften the characteristically acerbic undercurrent that stravinsky s wind scoring provides and his account of the requiem canticles , a late work that embodies reminiscences of stravinsky s early style , was both incisive and , in the deathknell postlude , eerily moving
aerobic exercise by itself does not appear to be an effective treatment for mild high blood pressure , according to the results of a carefully designed new study but the director of the study , dr james a blumenthal , a psychologist at duke university medical center , emphasized that physical activity still had potential value in helping people to lower their blood pressure the study , conducted among 99 sedentary men and women with moderately elevated blood pressure levels , sought to determine whether exercise , apart from any effect of diet and weight loss , would help to lower the blood pressure the study found no difference in blood pressure reduction among those who participated in aerobic exercise , those who did strength and flexibility exercises or those who did no exercise at all pressure dropped somewhat in all three groups in a phenomenon that is attributed to participation in a study previous studies had shown conflicting results and their conclusions were tempered by such limitations as small numbers of study subjects and failure to control for changes in body weight dr marvin moser , an expert on hypertension , said in an interview yesterday , of all the nonpharmacological treatments for lowering blood pressure , weight reduction has consistently been the most potent far more effective than reducing salt to the extent that exercise can help people lose weight and keep it off , it can be a useful adjunct to treatment , said dr moser , of white plains , who is the senior medical consultant to the federally sponsored national high blood pressure education program dr blumenthal s study , being published in today s issue of the journal of the american medical association , suggested that a longer or more intensive exercise program might indeed provide an independent benefit in the study , the declines in blood pressure levels were the greatest among participants whose physical conditioning showed the most improvement volunteers in the study all had blood pressure levels in the range of 140 to 180 systolic pressure \( when the heart pumps \) over 90 to 105 diastolic pressure \( when the heart is between beats \) a normal blood pressure usually falls in the range of 110 to 130 systolic over 70 to 80 diastolic participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups the aerobic exercise group participated three times a week in a supervised walking or jogging program designed to raise their heart rates to a level that results in cardiovascular conditioning a second group participated in exercises designed to enhance only strength and flexibility a third group did no exercise the entire program lasted four months all participants were told to make no changes in their diets or body weight , and none apparently did exercise was the point the point was to try to isolate exercise to see if it had an independent benefit in efforts to lower blood pressure but while blood pressure dropped in the group participating in aerobic exercise , it also dropped to a similar degree in the nonaerobic exercise group and in the nonexercising group blood pressure measurements were taken under a number of circumstances , including in the course of the participants' regular activities dr blumenthal , who conducted the study with dr william c siegel of new england deaconess hospital in boston and dr mark appelbaum of vanderbilt university , said the findings do not mean that if the exercise program were more intensive or longer or if it was combined with dietary intervention and weight loss it would n't be effective he said he hoped next to study the combined effects of exercise and weight loss on high blood pressure i thought this more rigorously controlled study would demonstrate that exercise helped to lower blood pressure outside of a clinical setting , dr blumenthal said i still think there is something to exercise now it s a question of finding out exactly what it is
when claudia shuster conducted a study of new parents who returned to work soon after their babies were born , she found many who considered their parental leaves too short , missed their babies and worried about the quality of available child care dr shuster , a bloomfield resident , is an assistant professor in the school of family studies at the university of connecticut at storrs she noted that since 1987 , connecticut state employees' benefits have included up to 24 weeks of unpaid parental leave she also pointed out that since july , connecticut employers of 250 or more people are required to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave , and that the law will be extended until , by 1994 , it will encompass companies with as few as 75 employees and will require leaves of up to 16 weeks for birth , adoption or serious illness in a family as a consultant to the capitol region education council , dr shuster helped develop childcare resources and referral services she began her study when she was a fellow at the bush center in child development and social policy at yale university in a recent interview in her office at uconn , dr shuster said that in the study \( which she said she hopes to continue \) , she looked at the expectations and experiences of 44 middleclass working couples all the mothers planned to return to work shortly after their baby was born , and 37 of them did here are some excerpts from the conversation q what range in parentalleave policies do you see in connecticut \? a connecticut policies are reflective of national ones some women have no leave at all when they have a baby the service occupations tend to have few benefits many leaves are based on the federal pregnancy disability act of 1978 you get disability leave that is like your employer s other disability leaves but as one woman in my study put it , having a baby is not like having gallbladder surgery most women who have leave have six weeks leave with some companies , if they have a caesarean , they have eight weeks one mother told me which shows how your perspective gets skewed by your needs i was so lucky i had a csection q how do america s parentalleave policies compare to those of other western countries \? a france may be a fairer comparison than sweden where parents are given up to nine months' leave and often get shorter workdays because france is not a highly socialized country in france , mothers get paid leave of 16 weeks fathers get 4 days this leave is funded through the employers , on a principle like social security the cost is spread across all employers if you have a largely young , female work force , you 're not penalized if you have an elderly work force , it does n't mean you get off from supporting the development of the french family q in your study , mothers took the primary responsibility for care , and their average leave time was 10 1 2 weeks how did they feel about going back to work \? a there was a range some were eager to return , but there were strong feelings of guilt , of being torn more than 50 percent wanted longer leaves they felt they did n't have enough time to spend with their little babies seventyfive percent said they would like to work part time but did not have the option both mothers and fathers worried that they missed seeing the baby do new things more than 50 percent of fathers expressed some interest in working part time the national panels that have studied parental leave from a psychosocial standpoint have suggested anywhere from four to six months for the parent that actually takes the primary caregiving role q in your study , you cited a father who did n't even get time off to take his wife and baby home from the hospital when the mother gives the primary care , what kind of leave do you recommend for the father \? a the french policy four days is not ideal being realistic about what corporations might consider , i 'd like to see a minimum of two weeks' leave for fathers q you mentioned in your study that people need time and support to make a transition to parenthood what do you mean \? a it s a huge change there s an impact on your relationship with your spouse there s a separation of oneself as a worker and oneself as a parent and women who give birth must deal with chemical and biological changes in france , the 16week leave is for 4 weeks before delivery and 12 weeks after when a baby is born into the community of brothers , a christian fellowship with several communities around the united states , the mother , father and baby are given a special place to spend a few days together they 're taken care of while they get to know each other that s a valuable example q how can employers implement leaves , deal with having employees away for weeks \? a we might look to our european friends western european countries have had parental leave policies for many years , and they 're becoming more competitive and we might look to leadership corporations in this country ibm has had a leave policy for some time obviously , it s quite possible there is a cost of doing business i'm sure many of us recall when we did n't have insurance coverage as part of the cost of doing business q how can people manage with unpaid leaves \? a i suggest that just as companies now help their employees to plan for retirement , they help people to prepare to develop fiscal strategies for parental leave
to the editor profs david w brady and douglas rivers deserve credit for advancing an utterly unique argument in support of term limits \( term limits make sense , oped , oct 5 \) that they would somehow strengthen the political parties however , the professors overlook the fact that there is a much simpler and far less damaging way to revitalize our moribund political parties comprehensive campaign finance reform for example , a package that limits campaign spending , restricts the franking privilege , cuts congressional staffs , enhances the parties' ability to raise money and distribute it to candidates , and mandates free party political broadcasts during elections would certainly strengthen the parties it would also greatly increase the number of competitive elections and reduce the influence of special interests term limitations will do none of the above specialinterest lobbyists will run rings around neophyte legislators elections will still be dominated by money and will be run in districts still demographically predisposed to favor one party or the other and despite the professors' tortured logic , there is little evidence to suggest the parties would not continue their decline under a new system most important , the professors ignore the preeminent reason why term limits make no sense they are fundamentally undemocratic term limits deny citizens the right to vote whomever they want into office if people like the job their incumbents are doing , term limits would deprive voters of their incumbents' service and citizens who do n't like their incumbents already have the only tool they need to fire them the vote ! we do n't need artificial term limitations because we have them today in natural form every two and six years , representatives' and senators' terms end they must win approval from the voters to continue to serve of course , in the tenured world of academia , it s easy to ignore trivial concerns like democracy but when it comes to the question of whom we elect to serve us , nothing could be more critical victor kamber washington , oct 10 , 1991 the writer heads a public relations company and is a consultant to democratic candidates
gjirokaster , albania , jan 15 images pile up ox and donkeydrawn carts , grimy steampowered factories , tractors and threshers dating from the 50 s , towns and villages with few shops , endless lines of people waiting for exit visas , streams of laborers trudging to work or piling into rickety buses , and hardly a car on the streets but for the gleaming limousines of the ruling communist elite amid it all , dotting the countryside , thousands of steel and cement pillboxes with gun turrets , a reminder of the government s command that the public maintain a constant state of readiness against the supposed threat of a foreign invasion known to its people as the land of the eagles , albania is small but strategically placed , tucked among italy , greece and yugoslavia , close to the heart of the european continent it is also a country of gloom , with hope just beginning to dawn for the average european or american visitor to this nation of 33 million , just now opening its doors to the outside world as it begins a slow process of democratization , albania seems to be caught in a time warp smiles are rare the people in the streets , unkempt and poorly dressed , rarely smile most gaze aimlessly , expressionless fortyfive years of stalinist rule first under enver hoxha , who led the communist party from 1943 until his death in 1985 , and now under ramiz alia have deadened their senses their main window to the west are the broadcasts they see on italian and greek television but more than the sadlooking people , what remains most striking after a twoday tour of towns and villages is the large number of oval concrete gun posts sprouting like mushrooms from fields , roadsides and beaches uncamouflaged , most are empty and unused , but some still harbor antiquated antiaircraft guns the pillboxes were methodically planted by mr hoxha to scare people into believing that a foreign invasion was imminent and to convince them that solidarity with the ruling elite was a patriotic duty to drum in the message still further , slogans adorning public buildings and walls laud the albanian communist party and president alia soldiers patrol the streets , machine gun or rifle in arm spartan architecture in the capital , tirana , the military atmosphere is complemented by spartan , rundown communist architecture minor exceptions are some buildings on and close to the central skanderbeg square , like party offices , the hall of culture and the museum of national history but apart from these and a few wellpreserved traditional buildings , tirana is a combination of drab apartment blocks and dismal shanties the apartment blocks resemble the eastern european style of the 50 s they are crude , many unfinished , displaying raw brick and concrete , with little or no heating and no elevators worse are the shanty dwellings that house the majority of the population sprawling away from the main streets , many are prewar buildings that appear on the verge of collapse the streets themselves have a chinese feel , with bicycles the main means of transport tirana has 10 traffic lights other towns have none battered buses or dilapidated chinese and russian trucks , crammed to capacity , cart people to work but albanians are inventive to avoid miles of daily walking , people use donkeys and oxen to draw wooden carts these are no ordinary carts some have plastic roofs and are heated by woodburning stoves vehicles are a rarity there are so few vehicles here that when the party limousines and cars belonging to foreign missions and visitors pass by , heads turn to gape the foreigner on foot is observed for clues to life in the outside world children are more daring , approaching foreigners in quest of money or gifts like pens and chewing gum shops display their few wares behind dusty broken windows the biggest grocery store in this southern town exhibits a handful of jam jars , spaghetti packets and wearylooking fruits and vegetables there are no restaurants or taverns , not even a cafe albania prides itself on having no foreign debt not surprising , considering its ban on foreign capital though recently rescinded , it is one of the main

rebels the irish rising of 1916 by peter de rosa illustrated 536 pp new york doubleday 25 on easter monday 75 years ago , april 24 , 1916 , some 1 , 600 illarmed irish separatists seized buildings in central dublin and proclaimed a republic from the steps of the general post office the easter rising had been intended as a general insurrection , but an ensnarlment of orders , counterorders and countercounterorders had limited it to the city , and , as its leaders well knew , had sentenced it to failure we are going out to be slaughtered , one of them told a colleague the organizers the poets patrick pearse , joseph plunkett , thomas macdonagh the implacable conspirators thomas clarke and sean macdermott , the labor organizer james connolly knew that their rebellion was doomed at its end , they and 10 others were executed by firing squads in the stonebreakers' yard of kilmainham jail but for six days the rebels maintained a fierce and heroic battle against the greatly superior forces of the british crown they were relying , beyond the battle , upon the irish historic imagination , the unimaginativeness of empires and what ruth dudley edwards , in her fine biography of pearse , calls the triumph of failure at first the rising had horrified most irishmen , many of whose sons and brothers were serving in the british army in the war against germany but the sentiment changed when martial law was declared , for , as f s l lyons says in ireland since the famine , the military were bent on doing what the civil government had so signally failed to do destroy revolutionary nationalism root and branch this they attempted first by shelling the center of dublin and then by dragging out the executions over a period of more than a week you are letting loose a river of blood , the moderate nationalist john dillon warned the house of commons two days before the last of the executions , those of macdermott and of the wounded connolly , who was strapped to a chair because he could not stand in a letter not quoted in rebels , the portrait painter john butler yeats wrote to his daughter these men are now embalmed in the irish memory , and hatred of england , which might have died out , is now revived kept alive in prison , ireland would have pitied and loved and smiled at these men , knowing them to be mad fools but it was left to yeats s son , in easter 1916 , to give the rebels' transformation to martyrdom its most celebrated expression i write it out in a verse macdonagh and macbride and connolly and pearse now and in time to be , wherever green is worn , are changed , changed utterly a terrible beauty is born by october 1920 , when william butler yeats s poem was first given a public printing , ireland was in the midst of a guerrilla war inspired partly by the cult of the easter rising terence macswiney , an irish republican army commandant , lay dying on a hunger strike in a london prison , and an 18yearold ira soldier , kevin barry , awaited the gallows in dublin as pearse had said at the graveside of the aged rebel jeremiah o 'donovan rossa a year before the rising , so the young soldiers could have said of pearse four years after life springs from death and from the graves of patriot men and women spring living nations the rising , tragic in its own terms and crucial to the history of modern ireland , has garnered a small library of both scholarly and popular narrative and analysis , not to mention the devotional literature of the cult in the 1960 s alone , three reliable , hourbyhour accounts were published the easter rebellion by max caulfield , agony at easter by thomas coffey , and six days to shake an empire by charles duff none rises above the level of vivid popular history all are preferable to peter de rosa s rebels the irish rising of 1916 mr de rosa , the author of vicars of christ and formerly the dean of theology at corpus christi college in london , dedicates rebels to irish people everywhere with profound respect and begins with a declaration of principle rebels is not faction , still less is it fiction this is a true story , but so extraordinary that it is only believable because it happened with talleyrand , i say , 'je ne blame , ni n'approuve je raconte , ' 'i blame not , i approve not i merely tell a tale' the foreboding roused by this heady combination of the bathetic and the fatuous is borne out by the rest of the book for instance , when the old rebel o 'donovan rossa died in new york city , the decision to return his body to ireland was made by john devoy , his fellow exile , and according to mr de rosa was expressed thus why not send the old bugger home \? in plain fact , devoy was an old man himself and had always regarded rossa with affection and respect if this quotation is neither faction nor fiction , some other word must be found , and fact will not serve mr de rosa deals with the conspirator tom clarke in a similar way since clarke had served a long sentence in a prison in england , and had lived in america before settling in ireland , mr de rosa has him estimating pearse s capabilities in words that strive to fuse the three national varieties of english too many rebels funk the ultimate test pearse ai n't one of them under that schoolmasterly exterior , i reckon , is a spine of steel clarke is supposed to have spoken thus to sean macdermott , and there is reason to believe that this was his judgment , but de rosa does not tell us which of the notoriously tightlipped conspirators chose to preserve clarke s words for posterity , or how rebels is furnished with photographs , maps , a select bibliography and an elaborate index perhaps advisedly , though , it lacks footnotes mr de rosa s method is to take a fact and hammer it into a cartoon thus pearse , evaluating the moderate john macneill , thinks him capable of chickening out constance markievicz , an angloirish gentlewoman who had espoused the rebel cause , never appears without cries of old bean , absolutely spiffing , dear old darling , old chaps , and other utterances supposed by mr de rosa to be appropriate to her social rank a halfblind rebel lad asks her permission to fire and she helpfully points his rifle in the direction of the shelbourne hotel , saying the enemies of arland , sonnie , are over thar , and i reckon you have as much right as anyone to take a few potshots at 'em it may seem impolite to cavil at mr de rosa s verbal ineptitude , from which the heavens themselves are not safe the sun went down in glory as though it had been dynamited , leaving a grapepurple glow in the sky his tin ear prevents him from listening to the story he is telling and gaining a sense of its historical and moral complexities here is a judgment of pearse the mystical element in him , his lyrical lunacy could not be reached he probably dreamed in his dreams he wanted to make necklaces out of dewdrops , carve statues out of clouds these thoughts are attributed to michael joseph o'rahilly , who initially had sought to prevent the rising , but then , in a characteristically chivalrous and reckless act , joined it , and was shot dead leading a final lost charge out of the post office there is no reason to imagine he thought of pearse in such vulgar and grotesque terms there is also no need for mr de rosa either to blame or to approve , but he seems not to know that there is no such thing as merely telling a tale to be told , a tale must be understood and the understanding expressed the teller must know the shape and weight and color of the words he uses to tell it at one point mr de rosa describes john o 'reilly , who served in the rebels' city hall garrison , as a spindly giant of a man it may be said that he himself has written a spindly giant of a book he has taken a magnificent if ofttold tale , and transformed it into a puppet show whose figures move jerkily across the stage and are made to speak in eerie and uncouth tongues if this is the way he displays his profound respect for the irish people , then may the blessed saints in heaven , as he might phrase it , shield them from his scorn photo the labor organizer james connolly , who was wxecuted for his part in the irish uprising of 1916 \( from rebels \) \( pg 10 \)
twelveyearold chanterelle , like a jester in a mardi gras parade , wears two different faces the tribeca restaurant s stark setting , serious prices and sophisticated food all contribute to a climate of formality but there is a flip side servers wear casual outfits befitting a bistro the menu cover looks like something from an upstate diner , with eat glaring in giant letters across the cover , and the liberal dress code results in a dining room where patrons wear everything from dark suits and elegant dresses to loud summer sports shirts and loafers with no socks there is nothing ambiguous , however , about the cooking of david waltuck , the chef and owner \( his wife , karen , tends the front of the house \) since chanterelle was reviewed in 1989 , the kitchen has become more focused and increasingly inventive the soaring dining room in the landmark mercantile exchange building has a simple and symmetrical grace pale yellow walls are a backdrop for a stunning flower arrangement near the entrance decorative wood columns , brass chandeliers , oversize windows all add to a feeling that something significant is happening here mr waltuck s menus change every month , so not all the dishes described here will be available throughout the summer i hope the terrine of beef shin , foie gras and good beef gelatin stays around the combination of faintly salty beef and silken foie gras with a garnish of star anise is scintillating zucchini blossoms seem to defy physics by holding twice their volume of chicken mousse and black truffles a chicken stock sauce stippled with black truffles rounds it out dry cured tuna is exquisite paired with sundry edible flowers , bean sprouts and mustard mayonnaise in the center the same cannot be said for the wellfleet oysters topped with oyster aspic , caviar and a slice of smoked salmon the poor concealed oysters could have been white bread for all the flavor that escaped potatofilled ravioli with white truffle garnish were seductive atop a mixed vegetable sauce , although a smoked salmon terrine with foie gras and caviar packed too much salt a house signature dish that remains on the menu is as good as ever grilled seafood sausage studded with pine nuts and ringed with beurre blanc chanterelle has a firstclass wine list that is rife with prestigious labels , mostly from france and california a maitre d'hotel is well

lot they stake out the 15 tables like panthers tracking prey main courses are almost universally delightful guinea hen is superb , its moist slices of breast fanned around the plate , the crispskinned leg in the center with a richly reduced sauce of red wine and minced black olives alongside the leg is a twirl of fettuccine brightened with grated lemon zest , a nice foil to the sauce sweetbreads are deftly cooked , well browned and garnished with gingered carrots a snappy sauce with vinegar , honey , soy sauce and green peppercorns enlivened meaty softshell crabs , while perfectly cooked swordfish with lime butter and a sweet corn custard was another enticing match cuminencrusted rack of lamb with green beans and an eggplant mousse was bonegnawingly good venturesome diners would do well to try the roasted baby goat , which has paler meat but somewhat resembles lamb the loin was extremely tender and juicy , as were the tiny chops along with their garnish of green beans , sauteed potatoes , trumpet mushrooms and tarragonscented sauce i could n't resist a dish described as poached grouper and fennel with pigs' feet and clams now there s a bold combination the grouper was unassailably fresh and the pigs' feet added some gelatin and flavor to the shellfish sauce the only drawback was lack of seasoning , which left the composite flat if after all this you are in the mood

savage inequalities children in america s schools by jonathan kozol 262 pp new york crown publishers 20 jonathan kozol has written an impassioned book , laced with anger and indignation , about how our public education system scorns so many of our children savage inequalities is also an important book , and warrants widespread attention at heart , it has a simple thesis public schools are public facilities , which means they should offer the same quality of education to pupils in every part of the nation we may tolerate disparities in the private sector , but the sphere served by government must meet another set of standards after all , we expect fire departments to speed to tenements as quickly as they do to mansions savage inequalities takes us inside a dozen dreary and decaying schools , in cities like chicago , camden , nj , and east st louis , ill , as well as the bronx not surprisingly , the student bodies of these schools are predominantly black or hispanic but mr kozol also shows us an equally bleak building in cincinnati , filled with whiteblond pupils from appalachia , suggesting that even if racial barriers were broken , class differences would still take a toll then , as a counterpoint , we visit the campuslike settings of new trier s public high school in suburban chicago and rye s outside new york city , where classrooms overflow with computers and every child seems destined for yale mr kozol retains the faith in education he displayed more than two decades ago in death at an early age , the chronicle of a year he spent teaching in a boston school he is impatient with arguments that schools cannot compensate for apathetic parents or the distractions of the streets he urges us to give schoolchildren something so spectacular , so wonderful and special that they might be able somehow to soar up above the hopelessness , the clouds of smoke and sense of degradation all around them he also rejects the view that throwing money at problems seldom if ever helps after all , mr kozol says , one east st louis teacher has 26 history books for 110 students because the city ran out of money in most parts of the country , the bulk of school budgets still comes from local revenues depressed districts with a dwindling tax base ca n't even fix leaking roofs , let alone pay teachers competitive salaries residents of cities like camden actually give more of their incomes to education than the average american , but since there is n't much they can raise , they lag behind adjoining suburbs states are supposed to have equalization formulas to subsidize poorer systems but to insure political passage , even wellheeled districts get checks , which they can apply to a second swimming pool for the local high school according to mr kozol , each pupil in east aurora , ill , has 38 , 000 spent on him or her from kindergarten through high school , whereas in suburban niles , each youngster is allocated at least 100 , 000 if poorer schools were to receive more money , how should it be spent \? clearly , leaking roofs should be repaired after that , mr kozol insists , a high priority should be reducing class size he is aware that many studies question whether the pupilteacher ratio affects how well students learn but he has taught inner city youngsters and goes with his instincts in a group of 12 , each student can get individual attention , whereas with 28 some will fall through the cracks that is why exeter and andover have so much of their teaching around seminar tables and mr kozol is frank in saying that he would like to see exeter standards extended to the slums readers may find themselves arguing with some of mr kozol s observations , a response i am sure he would welcome much of his space is devoted to charismatic black teachers , who persevere under third world conditions but he also encountered black instructors who turn in desultory performances and show no special identity with children of their own race none of the students he interviewed complained about the curriculum , or asked that it reflect more of their ethnic experience indeed , black pupils in east st louis told him they wanted to be integrated into a nearby white district nor did proposals for greater parental control come up in his conversations without exception , his ghetto children are thoughtful and well spoken it does not take long for little kids to learn they are not wanted , one east st louis teenager remarks to which a classmate adds , to some degree i do believe that this is caused by press reports one of the more disturbing chapters centers on several schools in the bronx , all of which have similar perpupil budgets since they are part of the same city system public school 261 is located in a converted skating rink , with windowless rooms , in one of which 30 sixth graders must share space with a bilingual second grade of the same size the building was designed for 900 children , but now has 1 , 300 in attendance it lacks a playground , and the cafeteria is so crowded that students must finish eating lunch in 10 minutes
antonietta by john hersey 304 pp new york alfred a knopf 21 a few facts , like a little learning , can be a dangerous thing john hersey s new novel , antonietta , is enervated by them the protagonist of mr hersey s title is a violin made by antonio stradivari in 1699 the author has traced its subsequent travels from italy to france to england to switzerland and to the united states tales about the adventures of this fictional violin , which stradivari names antonietta , accumulate along the way its construction is inspired by a sweetheart , mozart plays it , it is used to teach berlioz mr hersey has polished these little barnacles of history , inflated them with air and then let them float where they will evidently intended as the tale of a kind of inanimate orlando propelled through history , the result more nearly resembles woody allen s zelig , except that while zelig s nonentity was benign , antonietta turns out to be somewhat of a pest mr hersey , an enlightened music fan , does n't do a very good job of getting inside the professional mind of the musician he has tried hard to tone down even the tiniest claims for antonietta s influence on music history , but even the hints that a violin might have inspired mozart s composition , energized berlioz s capacious imaginings , improved the quality of a parisian orchestra or , in the case of l'histoire du soldat , solidified the image in stravinsky s mind of the devilasfiddler are a little embarrassing musicians simply do n't think or respond the way the author has them do in this book mr hersey s library time is evident he has received impressions of leopold mozart \( frugal , overly parental \) , wolfgang mozart \( childish , obsessed with excrement \) , berlioz \( emotionally extravagant \) , stravinsky \( manipulative , skirtchasing \) and puffed them into cartoonlike portraits chunks of music biography have been recycled into antonietta the lore of violin construction , care and feeding has been dutifully studied period life styles from stradivari s italy to wall street arbitrage are also attended to stradivari s son eats not just bread but peasant bread made from a mixed meal of corn , rye , millet , and beans later on we are given a blowbyblow recitation of insider trading mr hersey has done his research and , damn it , none is going to waste like so much fiction bound by historical fact , antonietta becomes a body of research trying vainly to invent people in its image it is a novel without a center , for admirable as this violin undoubtedly is , wood , strings and glue do a dubious job of pulling these historical snippets together perhaps mr hersey s view of beautiful instrument as resonant muse has been a little optimistic antonietta , like an intrusive pet , ends up snapping at the heels of music history
in a stroke , poland is about to create capitalism out of the rubble of socialism and to an extent unmatched in the west in a breathtaking announcement , the polish government has proposed making every pole a capitalist by handing over to 27 million adults majority ownership of 400 stateowned factories , representing 25 percent of the country s industrial sales in the us , few own much capital the poorest half of all families owns a mere 3 percent of the nation s assets under the government plan , poland would create more capitalists , relatively , in six months than the us has created in 200 years turning over stateowned factories is a tricky task the polish government ca n't easily sell them because there are no markets to establish fair values besides , the process would take decades and virtually no pole has enough wealth to make a bid nor would widespread giveaways work if every pole owned a fraction of each firm , none would own enough to exercise control diffuse ownership means , effectively , no ownership the managers would be free to enrich themselves the government s solution is to hand over 60 percent of the equity in each of 400 companies to about 20 investment funds ownership of the funds , in turn , would be handed over to every pole over 18 initially each adult would receive vouchers worth one share of each fund the investment funds would be run by financial experts from the west and work much like westernstyle mutual funds one more wrinkle 33 percent of each company , out of the 60 percent , would be concentrated in just one investment fund that would give this lead fund a stake in the financial health of the company , compelling it to tightly supervise management the upshot ownership is diffuse , but control is concentrated that s astonishingly clever the balance of the firm would be owned by the state , with 30 percent , and workers , with 10 percent over time , investment funds would trade shares in companies , leading to a stock market where individuals could buy and sell shares on their own the plan works spectacularly on paper but whether it will work in practice is impossible to say nothing close has ever been tried and there are obvious dangers by concentrating control in a handful of investment funds , the poles may be inviting them to act like cartels indeed , czechoslovakia is so afraid of cartels that it has drawn up a privatization plan that would use vouchers to sell firms directly to citizens and hungary , which has experimented with decentralized control for decades , will avoid vouchers altogether by selling off firms to the highest bidder , foreign or domestic the beauty of the polish plan is that it would make every pole a capitalist an ambition unmatched in the west and to make sure the lofty achievement survives , the plan turns over control to financial experts until ordinary poles learn to manage finances for themselves that way naive investors wo n't be prey to knaves operating in competitive markets karl marx promised workers of the world their rightful share a capitalist overthrow is on the verge of delivering that promise
xining , china if solzhenitsyn were chinese , then the windswept plains here in qinghai province might be as notorious as siberia , and the word laogai might be as common and ominous as gulag qinghai province , the northeastern part of what was once tibet , is a sparsely populated region of prairies and mountains , 10 , 000 feet or more in elevation with few trees or shrubs and bitterly cold winds that leave cheeks dry and cracked soon after the 1949 communist revolution , it was made the centerpiece of china s gulag the site of harsh , remote labor camps where counterrevolutionaries and criminals fought for survival and often lost laogai \( pronounced laoguy , the first syllable rhyming with cow \) means reform through labor , but that is a euphemism for the cold and starvation and illness that offenders faced the first prisoners , in the early 1950 s , were forced to build the mud walls that confined those who came later rations were so meager that felons working in the fields caught earthworms and regarded them as a great delicacy in the 1980 s , the number of prisoners in qinghai apparently declined and conditions improved , but wei jingsheng , one of china s most articulate advocates of democracy , was sent to a qinghai laogai in 1984 , where he suffered from altitude sickness mr wei , now serving the 13th year of a 15year sentence , is believed to be in a prison in hebei province , and no one connected with the 1989 democracy movement is known to have been sent to qinghai an embarrassment to officials for officials in qinghai province , who are now trying to attract foreign investors and tourists , the province s history and reputation constitute a serious embarrassment a room full of provincial officials erupted in indignation when a reporter brought up the topic of laogai camps there s this prejudice against qinghai , said wang yinhui , director of the qinghai foreign affairs office sure we have laogai but so does every country suonan tsering , a tibetan who is in charge of minority affairs in qinghai , said qinghai people are unhappy about this prejudice some people in other places think that we 're all criminals , all involved in laogai production wu zhengyun , vice chairman of the provincial planning commission , said there were fewer than 10 , 000 prisonzers in qinghai s laogai camps he added that since 1985 , qinghai had not accepted any more prisoners from other provinces there are still a few prisoners from other provinces who were sent some time ago , but soon there will be none , mr wu said he added that while it was now impossible for foreigners to see a laogai camp , such a visit might be allowed some time in the future it is impossible to know whether the official figure of 10 , 000 prisoners is accurate the reliability of the official national total of 126 million chinese in prisons , laogai and reeducationthroughlabor camps is also uncertain the chinese authorities do not normally invent economic and social statistics entirely these days , although they do manipulate them to their advantage , but the credibility of official information about prisons is particularly low during a tour of beijing no 1 prison two years ago , for example , the authorities turned down a request to visit other prisons on the ground that there were no others in beijing many former inmates can attest that this is untrue , and the official new china news agency recently published references to the supposedly excellent care at beijing no 2 prison by all accounts the overwhelming majority of prisoners are common criminals rather than political offenders and a range of qinghai residents interviewed privately over the course of a week agreed that there were many fewer inmates in the laogai system now than in the maoist period they said that camps remained but that treatment was now reasonably humane they 're fed well and they sleep on bunks now instead of on the floor , said a peasant who based his information on a fellow villager who was recently released from a laogai map of china showing location of qinghai province
president bush s willingness to be flexible about dates for a meeting with iraq has now been rewarded by a positive iraqi response but the talks set for wednesday in geneva between secretary of state baker and iraq s foreign minister , tariq aziz , will not be worth much if both men treat them only as a public relations prelude to war with more than a million soldiers mobilized at the front , it is none too soon for both sides truly to walk the last mile for peace for iraq , that means finally accepting what a united world has consistently demanded for five months get out of kuwait completely and unconditionally for the united states , diplomacy means recalling what has been american policy all along that is , there s no inconsistency between president bush rightly refusing to bargain with a blackmailer and the world s hoping for productive talks the honorable approach is to remind iraq again of the diplomatic opportunities it has foreclosed by its aggression and intransigence president bush spelled out these opportunities before the united nations on oct 1 he drew his formulations from existing us policies , policies propounded before iraq invaded kuwait following an iraqi withdrawal , mr bush noted in october , differences between iraq and kuwait over oilfields and strategic islands could be fairly negotiated kuwait s future form of government might also be discussed the president also spoke of opportunities for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability this is diplomatic code for destroying chemical weapons and their means of production , curbing the spread of nuclear technology and negotiating the size and composition of military forces such arrangements would require provision for international inspection if they turned out to be credible , they could be extended to israeli chemical and nuclear weapons as well finally , mr bush referred to opportunities for all the states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that divides the arabs from israel that emphatically does not mean serving israel up as a sacrifice for peace in the gulf , or allowing saddam hussein to claim a role as the armed champion of the palestinian cause american policy on the arabisraeli conflict calls for terminating the existing state of war , with arab states finally recognizing the state of israel meanwhile , washington remains committed to fostering direct negotiations between israel and the palestinians saddam hussein deserves no rewards for his actions in kuwait but neither should his actions be allowed to overturn longstanding and sensible us policies by agreeing to withdraw all his forces from kuwait , now , he can make it possible to take these ideas to the appropriate negotiating tables , sparing his country and the world a ruinous , needless war secretary baker s mission to geneva is to convey to iraq the gravity of the situation and the determination of the international community to overcome iraq s aggression against kuwait , the president said yesterday that mission can bring the peace both sides insist they want if saddam hussein at last chooses to respond to the honorable terms mr bush has already put forth
san salvador after taking part in washington s decadelong effort to train and reform the salvadoran army , many american military advisers have left here angry over the salvadorans' resistance to change , according to a number of the advisers , who say they feel manipulated and betrayed by the salvadoran officers in various interviews and in one case sworn testimony , the advisers described salvadoran officers as being mainly interested in amassing wealth and power , as willing to deprive troops of equipment to further the officers' own ends and as allowing the regular killing or mistreatment of prisoners the salvadorans will wine you and dine you and womanize you and do all they can to play you like a violin , said an army officer who held a senior post in the american embassy several years ago like others still on active duty , he requested that his name not be published john d waghelstein , a retired army colonel who commanded the military advisory group here at the beginning of the 1980 s , said it s easy to be coopted in el salvador the salvadorans are very adept at telling you what you want to hear none went so far as to say the effort to help the salvadoran armed forces in their war against a leftist insurgency had been futile they thought human rights abuses would have been worse or that the guerrillas might have won the war without their presence trainers limited to 55 embassy officials say there are usually 90 to 100 american military men in el salvador at any given time congress has limited the number of actual trainers to 55 at a time , but those on temporary duty and those serving in the embassy as attaches or supervising the trainers fall outside the limit the most dramatic experience known to have involved an american adviser was that of maj eric buckland , who came forward at the beginning of january 1990 with information pointing to the head of the salvadoran military academy as the man who organized a mass killing at the jesuit university six weeks earlier after major buckland returned home and gave sworn testimony to the fbi on the case , he said he was on the bridge of a nervous breakdown i was used , he said in a videotaped interrogation i do n't know how there was a plot in there somewhere , and i was in there somewhere , and i was somebody s card although major buckland s experience seems the most dramatic because it was linked to the killing of six priests , their housekeeper and her daughter there was an almost uncanny link between the generalizations other former advisers made and the experience he described eight under indictment col guillermo alfredo benavides , the director of the military academy , and seven other military men are under indictment in the killing of the jesuits , although the judicial case has so far been built more on the subsequent confessions of three of the lower ranking participants than on the buckland information the judge prosecuting the jesuit case recently ordered that a new set of questions be put to major buckland and that eight other americans who formerly served in the embassy here be questioned as well the legal process is in recess until sept 2 also in september , legislation to restrict united states aid for the salvadoran military is to be debated in congress in june , the bush administration decided to release up to 21 million in previously frozen military aid to el salvador to help its army acquire spare parts and medicines at a time when both sides were beginning to step up the fighting the american money was part of 424 million in military aid withheld by congress last year to protest the perceived lack of progress in salvadoran government efforts to resolve the jesuit case state department officials emphasized that none of the 21 million would be earmarked for arms major buckland said that about a month after the killings , when the army was publicly blaming the guerrillas , col carlos a aviles , the army' director of psychological operations , told him that colonel benavides had revealed his own responsibility to a third salvadoran colonel and had asked for protection from prosecution nothing happened major buckland said colonel aviles had asked him to keep the information secret , but he said he expected that arrests would be made as a result of the knowledge of colonel aviles and the third colonel after days passed and nothing happened , major buckland said , he told his own military superiors he said colonel aviles , who spoke good english , seemed to confide in him , often expressing criticism of salvadoran officers who resisted the internal reforms the americans were pushing explaining his own perceived role , the major said , i was going to be lawrence of arabia , you know , eric of el salvador subsequently , colonel aviles denied having told major buckland about colonel benavides s reported responsibility in the killings major buckland later came to suspect , he told the fbi , that colonel aviles might have planned to keep secret the information to use later as leverage to promote his career experts on the salvadoran military say it is common for officers to cover one

washington , march 1 with banks in many regions of the country shying away from making new loans , federal banking and savings regulators moved to ease that logjam today by recommending a relaxation of the standards used by banks to put a value on their loans specifically , the regulators called for changes in the way banks evaluate commercial and real estate loans that are in trouble the new accounting standards would enable banks to report greater profits on such loans , providing them with an incentive to extend credit to more borrowers many banks and savings and loans are in trouble , mainly because of loans that went sour in a troubled economy as these troubles mounted , banks and customers started complaining that bank examiners , with the savings and loan fiasco fresh in their minds , were becoming too aggressive in scrutinizing loans this in turn was said to compound the tightening of credit , particularly in new england , where the economy has quickly eroded the goal easier credit officials said the longawaited measures were intended to counter these complaints and to make it easier for people and businesses to get loans there is an atmosphere of fear in financial institutions out there that they are going to get whacked in the back of the head if they make any loan , said john e robson , deputy treasury secretary and the senior administration official coordinating the regulatory changes that is clearly not the atmosphere you want to have but critics said today s measures would eventually come back to haunt the industry and the government because the changes dilute standards at a time when increasing numbers of large banks are failing or reporting lower earnings they likened the proposal to the decisions in the 1980 s to relax standards for savings institutions and to refrain from closing weak institutions it s not as egregious a forbearance standard as the savings and loans , but it mirrors the excesses , said representative jim leach , republican of iowa and a member of the house banking committee it conveys the notion that toying with the books is legitimate , and therefore obviates the need for commercial banks either to raise more capital or shrink mr leach said the new standards would increase the likelihood of a taxpayer bailout of the federal program that insures deposits at banks and would also have the effect of deferring the necessary consolidation of the industry the guidelines clarify the way banks put a value on real estate loans and on their financing of transactions made with a large amount of debt they also call for greater disclosure about loans on which the borrower has stopped paying interest the changes have been urged by alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve board the guidelines were issued jointly today by the federal reserve , the comptroller of the currency , the office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit insurance corporation none of the proposals require legislative action , but the most significant one , involving the treatment of nonperforming loans , is subject to final approval by the bank regulators and the securities and exchange commission , which oversees accounting standards that is expected to occur after the 45day period set aside for comments from accountants and industry representatives allowing some leeway the proposal would allow socalled loansplitting , in which a troubled loan still paying some interest would be divided into good and bad parts instead of being entirely written off existing guidelines require banks to label the entire amount of such loans as nonperforming , which is the category for loans that are 90 days past due or are so troubled that the bank does not expect full repayment as an example of a loan that should not be written off entirely , regulators today cited a homeowner who is delinquent on mortgage payments , but who promises to start making payments after 90 days and then does so currently , the bank would have to write off the entire loan but under the changes the bank would be able to recognize the interest payments these are some of the other changes and guidelines banks and savings associations would not have to put a value on real estate in a troubled market , reflecting the depressed price the property would bring if it was sold immediately rather , the value put on a house , apartment building or commercial property should reflect its market value over a longer period , which would give the bank the chance to benefit from an upturn in the market the definition of highly leveraged transactions , which include company buyouts or other broad changes that rely on a large amount of debt , would be loosened so that it would no longer include certain kinds of debt bankers and regulators keep track of such transactions to help judge an institution s soundness weak banks would be encouraged to make loans to sound borrowers even though such loans would further dilute the bank s capital level , a formula that is generally viewed as an indicator of a bank s health financial institutions would be encouraged to provide greater disclosure of the details of their entire loan portfolio we hope that the actions taken today will encourage lenders to make prudent loans and assure that examiners perform their review in a balanced , sensible way , treasury secretary nicholas f brady said , describing the measures as a sensible approach to the credit crunch the pressure on regulators to act swiftly has been apparent for weeks senators and representatives from new england have threatened to oppose the bush adminstration s proposal to provide more financing for the savings and loan bailout until the administration addressed the tightening of credit quick action urged in a house banking subcommittee hearing on thursday , representative joseph p kennedy 2d pursued an aggressive line of questioning and urged senior regulators to move quickly , even if it meant circumventing the normal process for changing the rules mr kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , suggested that the banks be permitted to ease accounting standards immediately , before the securities and exchange commission formally acted , and then return to the old standards if the agency later objected but that idea was quickly rejected by richard c breeden , the chairman of the sec , who said he could not throw the rules out the window , adding that 'the worst mistake made in the thrift disaster was the move to weaken accounting rules on wednesday , mr breeden said that there is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of loansplitting , but that he wanted the commission to be able to study the concept fully before aprroving it

roy langenberg says that people burst out laughing when he tells them he produces hats how do you make a living \? they ask but mr langenberg , the fourth generation in his family to head the langenberg hat company of washington , mo , says that the headwear business is actually enjoying a comeback no one in the industry expects formal felt hats to recapture the universal popularity they enjoyed before world war ii but most americans own many more caps and leisure hats than they realize and seem eager to accumulate more the headwear institute of america , a new yorkbased group , estimates that sales have been growing at 5 percent to 10 percent for the past few years more precise statistics are hard to come by because all the companies are small , most of them secretive and none publicly traded many manufacturers say that despite the recession , sales are still growing , driven by everything from changing fashions to the awareness that sunburn can contribute to skin cancer hat and cap makers hope that they will scarcely feel the recession because , for every customer who suddenly feels too poor to buy , others decide that they can economize by purchasing a hat instead of a complete outfit everyone was quite pleased with sales over the holidays , said susan tildesley , the headwear institute s executive director she estimated that retail hat sales will top 2 billion this year , up from 750 million in the early 1980 s , not including women s hats and odds and ends like construction hardhats the more fashionoriented 450 million women s hat business is growing 15 percent to 20 percent annually , according to casey bush , director of the millinery information bureau in new york like other apparel sectors , hat and cap makers have long been under pressure from imports the huge cap market is dominated by the chinese , who pay workers as little as 25 cents an hour with no fringe benefits or safety regulations , according to industry consultants taiwan and south korea are also major exporters an antidumping suit against china in 1988 resulted in a finding that imports were being sold below cost but failed to prove that domestic manufacturers had been harmed imported caps typically cost 20 percent to 50 percent less wholesale than domestic products , according to paramount cap manufacturing company , a bourbon , mo , concern that , according to industry executives , is probably the largest producer the industry star a cap , a logo , voila !

the united states attorney in brooklyn concluded six months ago that there was substantial evidence that mayor david n dinkins and his son , david , had provided authorities with a fabricated letter documenting a disputed stock transaction , several officials familiar with the inquiry said the findings by the prosecutor , andrew j maloney , appeared to represent a stronger judgment about the role of the mayor and his son than the conclusion reached this week by an independent city investigator , elkan abramowitz , who said that there was troubling circumstantial evidence that the mayor may have lied under oath mr abramowitz said the evidence was insufficient to warrant prosecution mr maloney had also declined to prosecute , and passed his findings on to mr abramowitz , along with a transcript of grand jury proceedings the officials said mr maloney declined to seek an indictment because , although he found substantial evidence of wrongdoing , that evidence still fell short of the level of proof for a criminal conviction , which requires that prosecutors prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt both investigations focused on mr dinkins s transfer of stock in a company with an interest in a cable television franchise the letter in question was released by mr dinkins during the 1989 mayoral campaign in an effort to defend himself from accusations that the transaction with his son violated federal tax laws or city ethical rules circumstantial evidence the city inquiry concluded that a pattern of circumstantial evidence including the impression of a phone number on the handwritten letter suggested that the letter , dated oct 30 , 1985 , was actually written much later than that , perhaps in the midst of the campaign reacting on thursday to mr abramowitz s report , mr dinkins focused on the broader conclusion that the efforts to prosecute him have come to an end as far as i am concerned , i am cleared , he said but mayoral aides said that mr dinkins was furious at the report , believing that it was irresponsible for the investigator to clear him of any criminal charges while at the same time raising accusations that may never be resolved in conducting his inquiry for the city s department of investigation , mr abramowitz had access to testimony , interview notes and laboratory tests from the federal prosecutor , but he also conducted his own investigation , taking depositions from witnesses the case revolved around 588 shares of stock in inner city broadcasting company , which owns radio stations and has an interest in a queens television franchise mr dinkins transferred the stock to his son about the time he was being sworn in as manhattan borough president in january 1986 issue in campaign during the mayoral campaign , after his republican opponent , rudolph w giuliani , suggested that he should have reported the gift or sale of the stock on his taxes , mr dinkins released the letter from his son in it , his son promised to pay 58 , 000 , plus 8 percent annual interest , for the stock by this month charles stillman , a lawyer hired by the mayor in connection with the investigations , said the younger mr dinkins paid for the stock last november , paying more than 80 , 000 , including more than 22 , 000 in interest mr abramowitz s report cited a number of circumstantial points that troubled him , including the fact that none of mr dinkins s associates , including his counsel and his accountant , knew of the letter until the campaign but the key piece of evidence was the impression on the letter of the phone number of a video production facility that mr abramowitz believed the younger mr dinkins would have had little reason to visit in 1985 , but which he visited during the campaign , shortly before the letter was released city ethics rules in his report , mr abramowitz said he was unable to come to a more definitive conclusion because mr dinkins s son , a sports producer and promoter in las vegas , refused to return to new york to testify before his panel david dinkins jr had testified or been interviewed by the united states attorney in brooklyn four times asked at a news conference on thursday why he did not prevail upon his son to testify , mr dinkins said my son spent an awful lot of time , 10 , 12 , 14 hours , and testified under oath to the united states attorney access to testimony theodore wells , a lawyer for the younger mr dinkins , said yesterday that he advised his client not to testify even though he understood through mr stillman that the mayor wanted his son to cooperate mr abramowitz s report noted that the mayor s son was aware of the issue of the telephone number when asked about it by a federal grand jury mr stillman , mr dinkins s lawyer , said that before the letter was turned over to investigators in november 1989 , he submitted it to an independent expert who detected the impression of the telephone number
sacramento , calif , jan 23 in the past , the january after an election was usually a happy time for powerful democratic lawmakers as they came to receive choice committee assignments and other political plums from willie l brown jr , the speaker of the california state assembly but this week , some of this state s most important and longestlived politicians emerged from mr brown s office pale and drawn after hearing that the cupboard is bare , that they are forced to slash and trim their staffs and sacrifice some of the other perquisites that have helped them rise to power similar painful cuts are taking place in the state senate after all , mr brown himself faces the loss of nearly 30 staff members , including his representative with hispanic voters and his specialist on aids this year , the lawmakers are bowing to the will of the voters , or at least 52 percent of them it was that proportion of the electorate that voted last november to pass a voterinitiated measure , known as proposition 140 , limiting the 80 members of the assembly to three twoyear terms and the 40 senators to two fouryear terms the measure also mandated budget cuts that will require slashing the legislative staff of about 3 , 000 by at least 600 people a threat to democrats \? the race to comply with the measure by the end of june has brought disruption to the legislature , which views it as an attack on the continued dominance of the democratic party despite the election in november of the state s third republican governor in a row , democrats hold 60 percent of the seats in the legislature some observers have said that the requirements of the proposition are so drastic that state government will respond by putting some kind of limits on citizen initiatives the legislative branch of state government will be a plaintiff in a lawsuit , to be filed next week , asserting that the proposition is unconstitutional because it limits voters' choices as to candidates and upsets the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches but even before the lawsuit is filed , backers of the proposition are on the attack at a news conference in los angeles today , pete schabarum , one of the authors , announced his demand to see the records of the rules committees of both houses to determine whether public funds are being spent to retain private lawyers to undermine the will of the people mr schabarum said he would insist that the legislative counsel s office be used to represent the legislature in the suit mr schabarum is to leave the los angeles county board of supervisors in march to head the newly created foundation for citizen representation , a nonprofit group promoting termlimitation measures around the country such measures are increasing in popularity , with the one in california , by far the largest state , the most closely watched 'golden handshakes' offered this month , legislators are extending a golden handshake to staff members , offering up to five months' salary in exchange for voluntary resignation by the end of january early indications are that many dismissals will be required we do n't have any choice , said robert t forsyth , a spokesman for senator david a roberti , the president pro tem of the senate and a democrat from hollywood the senate rules committee is dumping all select and special committees to help , and moving the functions of the office of research to the state library trying to keep it alive legislators' spending must be reduced from the current budget of about 190 million to 114 million in the next fiscal year because staffing is the largest expenditure for each of the 120 legislators , it takes the biggest cut it s pretty bleak here , said a staff member in the assembly all the best people are leaving , knowing they can get a good job on the outside not a pleasant job telling each lawmaker how many staff members to cut , depending on the legislator s seniority and committee assignments , is not a pleasant job for mr brown , who just celebrated his first decade as speaker and 26 years in the assembly mr brown , who represents the western portion of san francisco , said that two of his most stalwart democratic members , assemblyman thomas hannigan of davis , the majority leader , and michael roos of los angeles , the speaker pro tem , have informed him that they are being courted by industry mr hannigan and mr roos have been powerful figures in the assembly but now see their careers ending no later than six years from now in an interview in his office , mr brown , who personally raised nearly 1 million in an attempt to defeat the measure , angrily asserted that it is specifically aimed at ending his leadership since the voters of san francisco appear unwilling to do so mr brown argued that legislative programs will be crippled by an expected 38 percent cut to their budgets and that there has been no misspending of public dollars mr forsyth did not agree there are some employees who are political hacks and serve that function , he said the smart legislators are going to want to retain their solid policy people joseph remcho , the san francisco lawyer who is representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit over the proposition , said that one of the assertions of the lawsuit will be that the measure disrupts the balance of power while governors in this state historically serve no more than two fouryear terms , they are not limited to eight years under the state constitution 'rookies and lame ducks' the law has a profound effect on the ability of the legislature to do its job and act as a coequal branch with the governor , mr remcho said when its full effect is felt in a few years , he said , onehalf of the senate will be rookies and the other half will be lame ducks mr remcho said the lawsuit will also argue that such a profound change to the state constitution cannot be legally accomplished by a voterinitiated measure but must be done by calling a constitutional convention or by amending the constitution through the legislature the people can definitely do the termlimit thing , he said they just have to use a different procedure , not these screwball voterinitiative things anthony t caso , a staff attorney with the pacific legal foundation , which is based in sacramento and represents conservative political interests , said the group will represent the authors of the proposition in defending the measure he said that while the measure may work a change in the balance of power , it is something the electorate can choose to do the plaintiffs will note some broad differences among california s 58 counties for instance , orange county in the south , which has the biggest republican registration in the state at 556 percent , voted for the proposition last november san francisco county , which has the highest democratic registration at 648 percent , voted against it mr remcho said the lawsuit will argue that a measure allowing the voters of one county to decide who may be candidates for office in another violates the first amendment s guarantees of free speech it is an argument mr brown strongly supports i think the court should rule to have limited terms for every district that voted for the measure and none for those who voted against it , he said it would serve these districts right photo willie l brown jr , california assembly speaker , said the term limits and budget constraints were aimed at him
in 1988 , days before federal agents made a surprise arrest of five bank of credit and commerce international executives after a long undercover operation , some of the world s most powerful drug dealers quietly withdrew millions of dollars from their bcci accounts , according to internal bank records some government investigators are now suspicious that the politically connected bank or its customers were tipped off by sources inside the united states government if there was a leak , the source of it is one of several mysteries surrounding the bank and the american government s bungled efforts to investigate its activities in the united states but the very possibility that some of the world s most notorious drug dealers could learn of a long , highly secret investigation into money laundering generally defined as concealing the source of illegally obtained funds heightens concerns that bcci may have used an extraordinary network of political and intelligence connections to help it evade serious scrutiny in addition to raising questions about whether the dangerous investigation was compromised , the bank documents examined by the new york times , including records of hundreds of accounts and correspondence by the bank s own lawyers , underscore the enormous amounts of money that were being cleansed at bcci branches in panama , miami , new york and other cities in turn , these activities raise still more questions as to why the bank was able to settle for a relatively modest 15 million penalty what was then the largest moneylaundering charge in history in all , the bank records , along with interviews with government agents , show that drug dealers made a run on the bank , withdrawing at least 10 million in the few weeks before the undercover operation made its arrests in tampa , fla as money poured out of the bank , the almost daily movement of millions of dollars of drug money from other bcci accounts also seemed to come to an abrupt halt accounts were closed most tellingly , on friday , oct 7 , 1988 the day before the undercover arrests two men described by the government as lieutenants in a large colombian drug ring contacted bcci s panama city branch and insisted that their accounts , totaling about 2 million , be immediately closed that same day , drug ring members withdrew 1 million from a separate bank account in the panama branch government officials have portrayed the investigation that led to the bcci arrests in tampa as one of the most successful moneylaundering cases ever , one that resulted in more than 70 indictments across the country but in recent months , with the disclosure that bcci was involved in international fraud and corruption on a scale far grander than ever imagined , the investigation has been the subject of bitter debate in congress , with the treasury department , the justice department and the federal reserve board fending off allegations unproven so far that bcci s connections to politicians and intelligence agencies prevented federal investigators from going after its top executives customs service officials acknowledged evidence that the colombia based don chepe organization , one of the world s largest drugsmuggling rings , may have learned of the undercover operation , known as cchase but they said this probably resulted from an incident , apparently a blunder , that exposed the investigation s cover , rather than a tipoff they say that the length of the investigation , more than two years , coupled with the fact that reporters and some members of congress were let in on it , widened the possibility of leaks there was a lot of information coming out of customs headquarters , and who knows how far it went , said peter k nunez , assistant secretary of the treasury for enforcement mr nunez said he was not aware of the withdrawals until he was contacted by the times i guarantee , if the agents had known of the pattern of closing accounts , they would have done something , mr nunez said in a series of interviews , some of the lawyers and agents who worked most intimately on the case said they thought the investigation had been compromised one federal agent , orin oakes of the internal revenue service , took the witness stand during the 1990 moneylaundering trial of bcci officials , who testified that on the friday before the weekend arrests aides to the man believed to be the drug ring s leader , gerardo moncada , removed 1 million from a bcci account in panama after that testimony , robert scola , a lawyer for rudolph armbrecht , reputed to be a cartel member , asked mr oakes , would that indicate to you that mr moncada somehow found out about this investigation \? mr oakes replied , i know there was a leak out of washington , dc , that made some of the or a lot of the information available to people other than government employees too many observers others are also convinced there was a leak , while some people say they think a series of blunders exposed the operation
kings point , li trevor de lew will never forget the start of his junior year abroad wearing a rubber suit to protect him from a chemical weapons attack , he steamed into a saudi arabian port on jan 15 , the deadline the united states had set for iraq to withdraw from kuwait mr de lew attends the united states merchant marine academy in kings point , li , and is one of almost 200 cadets who have served on ships supplying the military during the operations in the persian gulf sophomores and juniors are assigned to train on cargo ships , and in times of peace , their jobs are relatively routine but in a war , their duties and the potential for danger are different and this year their training tours happened to coincide with the persian gulf war less than two days after he arrived , mr de lew was helping unload a ship full of tanks and other vehicles when airraid sirens went off i was petrified at that moment , said mr de lew , a marine transportation major from east islip , li , who will be cocaptain of the academy s football team next year i heard that when they got that alert a missile was shot off from iraq and we had only 11 minutes to get prepared the missile was shot down , and during the war , none of the cadets on ships were killed or injured but there was at least one close call , a reminder that during world war ii , shortly after the academy s founding in 1943 , 142 cadets were killed capt perry walter , the academy s head of shipboard training , said that during one scud missile attack , he heard that one missile had landed harmlessly in the ocean but a cadet later described the scene differently he said it was quite scary , captain walker said here s this scud missile coming overhead and it drops 75 yards away from his ship the school , a federal institution under the department of transportation , is one of the five major service academies and the merchant marine s equivalent to west point or annapolis captain walter said the major difference is that its cadets , 10 percent of whom are women , are the only ones permitted to serve during a war and they have gone on supply missions in every major american conflict since world war ii when the cadets graduate , they can accept a commission as an officer in any branch of the military or go into private shipping in peacetime , sophomores and juniors go to sea on private cargo ships for six months at a time they work about eight hours a day and complete academic work toward their bachelor s degrees 'the cadets were invaluable' but when the ships are called up to take supplies to a battle area , life for the cadets becomes more intense captain walter said they work constantly and often stay up 36 hours at a time to complete their duties some of these ships depended on the cadets to get them to where they were going , he said with the shortage of crews , and seamen who in some cases had n't sailed in years , the cadets were invaluable steven buckner , a sophomore from mustang , okla , majoring in marine engineering , said that during his voyage in the fall , a group of marines on the ship noticed that about 50 machine guns and grenade launchers were missing metal pins that held in the ammunition clips one marine asked him if he could fix them , and , using his freshmanyear training , he went into the ship s machine shop and made a set of pins from scratch it was n't really a big deal , but it was something that had to be done , he said
on a court , the chicago bulls' archenemy is the detroit pistons but in a courtroom , where the hardwood is on the walls , jordan co s foe is the national basketball association it may seem odd that this popular team and this successful league should tangle in a federal courtroom yet they are , in a rimrocker of a lawsuit that says much about the relationship of a team to a league and how the nba wants to control television policy about a year ago , the nba got antsy about superstations , local television outlets whose signals are beamed to cable stations nationwide the league had just signed a new cable contract with ted turner that put national games on his tnt network after four years on his wtbs superstation that freed wtbs to carry atlanta hawks games to the 552 million homes that receive the superstation about the same time , the bulls terminated their contract with wfld of chicago and fled for more cash and exposure on wgn , a chicago superstation available to 33 million households with cable league policy at the time allowed superstations like wtbs and wgn to air 25 nba games a year so with the 199091 season looming , the nba was faced with 50 new superstation games , a flood that the league said undercut the value of its new national deals with tnt and nbc fearing overexposure , the league last april ordained that superstations could air only 20 games a season also , basketball commissioner david stern wanted to eliminate five telecasts each year after the 199091 season until there were none , but the league never voted on that proposal in october , the bulls and wgn tagteamed to sue the nba , charging that the league conspired in violation of antitrust law to restrict the number of telecasts , harming the bulls , wgn and fans in january , federal district court judge hubert i will sided with the bulls and wgn , ruling that the nba s reduction of superstation games to 20 was a significant restraint of trade that violated the sherman antitrust act he barred the nba from instituting the policy last week , the nba appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit , in chicago so , tomorrow , the bulls face the miami heat it will be the team s 25th game of the season on wgn if the case is upheld , it will stand as the bulls' declaration of modified independence sure , no team is more important than the nba essentially a 27team joint venture and without the league a single team is nothing but the league does n't possess all the rights by challenging the nba s claim that it was exempt from antitrust law by the graces of the 1961 sports broadcasting act , the bulls proved it had the inalienable right to sell 25 games to wgn gary roberts , a sports law expert at the tulane university law school , said if this decision stands , then any kind of restraint by a league is illegal how can a league justify a restriction to just 25 games \? why do n't the bulls and wgn go after more than 25 \? the nba virtually dribbled away its case on its interpretation of the sports broadcasting act , which says leagues are exempt from antitrust law when they agree to sell or transfer to a television network the rights to a national package of games the law literally refers only to league transfers or sales of games to television and not such transactions by individual teams therefore , judge will found that the games licensed by the bulls to wgn were out of the nba s grasp , and that teams can sell rights to games not on nbc s or tnt s schedules the nba s restriction on superstations was anticompetitive , judge will ruled he wrote the 5game reduction is a classic example of a joint venture attempting to eliminate competition between itself and its members in its appeal , the nba argues that the 20game superstation restraint is designed to promote competition in the national market and enhance the standing of the joint venture that is the league the bulls' sale of 25 games to wgn , it says , constitutes an attempt to steal nba national television revenues for its own profit from its league partners the fivegame cutback , the league says , is a lawful restraint to protect the league the nba argues that its intent in reducing superstation broadcasts was to guarantee the exclusivity and quality of its product in the national market the league stated that the law implied the legality of leaguewide action to protect the value of the national television contracts more bulls games on wgn , the nba says , damages those deals and it had to act to protect the 26 other joint venture partners from the renegade bulls and its tv partner if the bulls and wgn prevail , the implications are fascinating tv patterns are changing new technologies are emerging the sports broadcasting law only protects leagues in selling national rights to sponsored broadcast entities whose revenues come from advertising what happens if rights are sold to subscriberbacked payperview or pay cable outfits like hbo \? will a tv freeforall ensue \? says roberts leagues will have to structure deals with new technologies in ways that will minimize their litigation risks legally , this is as exciting as a michael jordan slam dunk
washington , sept 19 requiring doctors and nurses to be tested for infection with the aids virus would be costly but useless because it would assure no additional protection from infection , representatives of the nation s leading medical organizations told congress today the risk of being infected by a doctor is so remote that it may never be measured , said former surgeon general c everett koop , one of the health experts who testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on health and the environment requiring the tests would be a worthless return to the darker days of the aids epidemic , dr koop said representatives of the centers for disease control , the american medical association , the american college of emergency physicians , the american nurses association , the american dental association and the service employees international union also spoke against mandatory testing many of the witnesses at today s hearing said they believed calls for mandatory testing of health care workers were being prompted by a single case and the emotional reaction to it the case is that of dr david j acer of stuart , fla , a dentist who may have infected five of his patients before his death last year but dr william roper , director of the centers for disease control , said the atlantabased federal agency was aware of about 60 cases of health care workers who are infected with the aids virus tests of 8 , 000 of their patients found none had been infected by a health care worker , he said it is not known how dr acer s patients became infected one of the five patients , 23yearold kimberly bergalis , has called for mandatory tests and has been bitterly critical of health officials for not pressing the matter in a letter to florida health officials that her family made public this summer , she said her life with aids has been sheer hell who do i blame \? miss bergalis wrote i blame dr acer and every single one of you bastards dr acer was infected and had fullblown aids , and stood by not doing a thing about it you are all just as guilty as he was you 've ruined my life and my family s since then , the senate has passed legislation requiring health care workers to be tested and to refrain from certain procedures if they are infected with the aids virus the measure would apply criminal penalities to health workers who do not tell patients that they have the aids virus before surgery rejecting 'the quick answer' representative henry a waxman , a california democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee that held today s hearing , said people must not focus on one emotional case we must focus on the known risks and true responses , not on the feared risks or easy responses , he said the quick answer is often not the right one dr koop agreed that public health policy should not be made on the basis of miss bergalis s case , and said the emotional response to the case ignored science , experience and common sense succumbing to the emotionalism , he added , will separate those who serve patients from those who use patients , those who throw water on the fire from those who throw gasoline on it he and other witnesses said the only method of effective prevention is for doctors , dentists , nurses and other health care workers to follow the precautions recommeded by the centers for disease control and to wear gloves , gowns , and other protective gear when working general guidelines issued in july the agency issued general guidelines saying health care workers should voluntarily be tested for the viruses that cause aids and hepatitis b , and that those infected should stop doing certain exposureprone procedures until they get permission from a panel of experts and have informed their patients it left it up to the professional groups to define which procedures posed the highest risks but several medical organizations have responded by saying that even these restrictions went too far , and refused to draw up lists of exposureprone prodecures by contrast , representative william e dannemeyer , republican of california , said it was an absurdity to rely on voluntary compliance there is a failure of leadership in public health in america , the congressman said too many people are treating aids as a civil rights issue criticizing the voluntary nature of the guidelines , he asked dr roper , are n't you placing the civil rights of the infected above the civil rights of the uninfected \? no , dr roper replied i think you are , mr dannemeyer responded representative bill richardson , a new mexico democrat , criticized dr roper and the bush administration for suggesting that doctors and hospital patients patients be tested for the aids virus but offering nothing to help them get counseling or treatment does n't it seem bitterly ironic to you that these recommendations are to test people to help them , but you do n't plan to help them with treatment \? mr richardson asked dr roper you just tell them they need help \? dr roper said he would check to see how much money would be in next year s budget for early treatment the aids risk from surgery boston , sept 19 \( reuters \) the risk of getting aids from a doctor during surgery is one in 21 million for every hour of the operation , about the same chance that a person will be in a fatal accident on the way to a hospital , two doctors have concluded the doctors , who described their conclusions in a letter in today s issue of the new england journal of medicine , based their prediction on the assumption that fourtenths of 1 percent of surgeons are infected with the virus , that there is a risk of eighttenths of 1 percent that a surgeon will be cut during an operation , and that there is a chance of 15 onehundreths of 1 percent that infected blood from the puncture will get into the patient the doctors , albert b lowenfels and gary wormser of the new york medical college in valhalla , said that even if a surgeon was known to be infected with the aids virus , the best estimate is approximately one chance in 83 , 000 hours of surgery they said their calculations were based on statistics from four previous studies
london in coming together to form a community , europeans have accepted a lot will they now allow brussels to dictate the structure of their cities \? they will if they follow the recommendations presented three weeks ago in madrid by a commission of the european community the prince of wales was there to lend his support and prestige to the sweeping reforms it proposed for a life without overcrowded cities and smelly automobiles its recommendations are lifted almost verbatim from the teachings of the londonbased urban theorist leon krier , often referred to as prince charles s favorite architect a handsome , charismatic figure in wirerimmed spectacles and floating scarves , mr krier , who was born in luxembourg in 1946 , suggests a strange merger of a hardheaded benjamin franklin and a visionary shelley as he explains the ideal relationship between public and private space , and the evils of suburbia , his language is uncompromising the north american city is a place of damnation suffering the agony of the urban block the roof , column , frieze and window are quasidivine mr krier \( pronounced kreer \) fills his treatises with diagrams and doodles damning modernism the monotony of the modernist street , or the comic distribution of the sexes when zoning segregates work from play although he has built only one building a house for himself in seaside , fla he is , according to the london neoclassical architect john simpson , one of the most influential figures in urban design and planning in this century in the united states , where urban design has had little presence in architecture schools since a brief burst in the 1950 s at harvard and penn , leon krier s work is revered and has led to the creation , by andres duany and elizabeth platerzyberk , of a new program at the university of miami it was mr krier s criticism of modernism , which he sees as a disastrous interruption of traditional classicism , that first brought him to public attention in the 1970 s modern buildings , he said , with their divorce of structure and traditional materials , are fragile structures that require constant repair and replacement , turning cities into perpetual building sites and contributing to the overall garbage culture of modernity in the united states , the issue is not just a matter of a wretched quality of life but of how it impinges on the rest of the world the ecological correction to modernism that mr krier advances is a return to the classical principles of urban design he deplores zoning because it separates the basic tasks of life work , leisure , domesticity dispersing them over wide distances and forcing people to waste time and pollute the atmosphere with cars a city should be divided into quarters in which citizens can perform all their tasks , the dimensions to be determined by the comfort of a walking man tiredness sets a natural limit to what a human being is prepared to walk daily , he says , and this limit has taught man all through history the size of rural or urban communities public space streets , squares , parks should amount to no more than 30 percent of a city unlike highrise developments , which are surrounded by wide streets and empty space , the classical city restricts empty space , which is expensive to maintain and difficult to secure what space there is must serve the needs of people to gather and amuse themselves in a quarter that combines living and working , public space is not deserted at night and does not invite crime the bankruptcy of the suburb , in mr krier s view , is proved by the way women and teenagers congregate in malls despite all the open space in the suburb , there is virtually no public space other than the shopping mall , and almost certainly none within walking distance the suburb is a compromise that does not work it negates both the city and the countryside , merging their identities without realizing either the ideal urban environment , to mr krier , is the small town this view led the prince of wales to entrust him in 1988 with one of the largest development schemes in england the design of a new community , called poundbury , an extension to the city of dorchester , in dorset in western england because the area is part of the duchy of cornwall , of which prince charles is hereditary landlord , the prince is in a position to put his muchpublicized architectural convictions into practice accordingly , poundbury is conceived as an 18thcentury english village , with housing of all income levels close to shops and public squares , a direct relationship between the heights of buildings and their public significance , and rules governing such things as materials , signs and the proximity of buildings to the curb the village , spread over 450 acres , will accommodate 2 , 000 to 3 , 200 families the drawings for the project suggest a birdcage setting of spires and pediments and ample windows , a dignified , harmonious world of peace and good order the depressed condition of the realestate market has delayed the construction of this project and allowed criticism to mount an article in the sunday telegraph portrayed mr krier as fatuously attempting to return to a world where squires and gentlefolk lived happily alongside the artisan class , when in fact class difference and the threat of crime determine people s sense of urban design mr krier has also been accused by modernists of promoting disneyland architecture , and of a cowardly retreat into nostalgia supporting conservatism , monarchism , even fascism having written a book about albert speer , an architect hitler admired , mr krier is infuriated by this criticism if a dictator takes up my ideas , the resulting town will survive the political system that commissioned it and stand as a social good , he said besides , modernism rather than classicism has dominated the architecture of totalitarian regimes of both the left and right in his eyes classicism embodies humanity s best discoveries about the relation between the body and the built world , between material and structure , between geometry and the quality of life if classicism has been in eclipse in recent history , its values remain you can play the piano badly for 200 years , and the first person to play it well redeems it mr krier is convinced that a standardized european building code will come about as for his connection with the prince of wales , he has nothing but gratitude toward his royal patron you need a prince to make a town in an intellectual sense developers want to make money if they cared about architecture , they 'd become architects i 've had so many projects that never came off because they had no sponsor , and not because they were utopian i just want to build a town that s normal the meaning of the word normal is at the heart of the dispute mr krier s system of architectural normality is being argued in a context in which it is anything but the norm if the european community translates mr krier s classical norms into law , we may see whether they are the coercive anachronisms deplored by his enemies or the return to sanity he describes are they our one last hope , as leon krier argues , for restoring urbanity to the urban experience \? photo leon krier at homethe bankruptcy of the suburb is proved by the way women and teenagers congregate in malls
none of the three national hockey league teams in the new york area will have a chance to select oshawa , ontario , center eric lindros when the league holds its entry draft tomorrow in buffalo the quebec nordiques , with the first pick , say they will draft the 18yearold junior superstar , even though he might be reluctant to play for them but the rangers , the islanders and especially , the devils could improve their teams soon with wise choices in the early rounds already a competitive team , the devils have the best assortment of selections , with two picks in the first round and one in the second they get 3 of the first 33 choices , beginning with the third selection behind quebec and san jose because they traded tom kurvers to toronto early in the 198990 season they will also exercise their own picks the 11th and the 33d selections the islanders , who have n't drafted a star since pat lafontaine in 1983 , choose fourth over all and have the same position in the second round the rangers must wait for the 15th pick in the first round and have the same position in the second here is what the general managers of the three teams in the metropolitan area have to say about their hopes for the draft neil smith , rangers draft position 15th in the first and second rounds major need i think we are looking for another big , solid defenseman like we took last year in michael stewart we 're trying to build up the depth on our defense because of the age of our defense and that s the one position where we do n't have younger players coming up on draft position i think that we 've got as good a chance of getting a good player as the people who draft sixth , seventh or eighth i do n't think it s going to be somebody you see in our uniform for a couple of years , that s for sure it s just going to be somebody we 're going to have to project on and hope will be on the team three or four years down the road on immediate impact players i think there are maybe a couple of guys who can play in the league after lindros pat faloon really played well in the memorial cup and he looks as if he could help a team that would need that type of player scott lachance played pretty well at the world junior , but i would imagine he would go back to college i do n't think there are too many past lindros who are going to show up in the league right away on possible trades for draft position i think there will be the normal amount of trade talk , quite a bit of it somebody usually likes to make a statement at the draft , so i imagine something will happen there that will be real interesting lou lamoriello , devils draft position third in the first round \( toronto s pick obtained in a trade \) 11th in the first round and 11th in second round major need we certainly would like to get defensemen in the draft but that s not saying that when it comes time for us to pick it would definitely have to be a defenseman but we are looking for a couple of defensemen if we can add a physical defenseman , that would be a positive you ca n't overlook talent and a player who can break a game open on immediate impact i do n't think that you ever can forecast exactly how a player will turn out , but we feel we are going to get a quality player with our first pick whether he will be ready to play in the national hockey league , quite frankly , i doubt very much , just on past record we certainly would like to see it happen we wo n't rush anyone we do n't feel we have to do that but , certainly , if a player comes along and can make our team be better , he 'll be here but it s not a case like it was several years ago when every player had to be here and you had to rush them that s not the case at all on possible trades i would be surprised if we did n't have some personnel changes throughout the summer bill torrey , islanders draft position fourth in both rounds on immediate needs eric lindros would fill my needs to a tee a scoring centerman who might attract some people to my building that s not a bad combination our biggest need is to increase our offensive output there s a lot of ways to do that in this day and age , the way the game is played today , a paul coffey player on defense can increase your output as much as a mike bossy or jari kurri can what we would like to do is to find a player who would obviously impact us in that way on depth of the draft there are five or six players in this draft who , at this stage of their development , appear to be pretty good prospects but i think , quite frankly , other than lindros , to put an 'immediate' tag on anybody would be a bit unfair on doing business while the franchise is for sale any time that you are in this situation it is not helpful that s not to say you ca n't go about some business and we are doing that we are trying to do everything we normally would does the situation we are in impact us in some ways \? to say that it does n't obviously would n't be accurate to the best of our ability , we are trying to go about our business as normal
the failure of the hardline coup in moscow will have many consequences none would be more welcome than a speedy end to soviet captivity of the baltic states president bush spoke for much of the world yesterday when he said the faster that independence is granted , the better the peoples of lithuania , estonia and latvia have earned the freedom their parliaments have proclaimed they have endured , among other things , cruel badgering in recent months and now a thuggish crackdown by the coup plotters a shaken mikhail gorbachev spoke generously yesterday about his hopes for democratic reforms , nonviolent change and the regeneration of soviet society a splendid way to start would be to deal reasonably , fairly and promptly with the special claims of moscow s unwilling subjects in the three states as mr bush reemphasized , the united states has never recognized the forcible annexation of the baltic states by stalin , the dirty booty in a secret protocol of the 1939 nazisoviet pact but as the president also stressed , genuine negotiations are needed to right this historic wrong before the attempted coup , mr gorbachev seemed to accept the principle of baltic sovereignty but demanded a fiveyear transition to independence that timetable can no longer be defended as evidenced by germany s announcement yesterday that it is ready to recognize baltic independence as soon as the three states reach agreement with the soviet government in january , with or without mr gorbachev s assent , moscow struck clumsily , even murderously at the baltics , closing frontiers and using despised black beret irregulars to cow rebellious but unarmed civilians during this week s failed coup , hardliners attacked again , seizing strategic locations and causing at least 18 deaths , egged on by a latvian communist whom mr gorbachev scornfully rebuked though the occupation has ended , the black berets are said to be still roaming the countryside like bandits galvanized and outraged , parliaments in latvia and estonia have now joined lithuania in adopting declarations of independence but though unilateral declarations carry moral force , they cannot be the sole test for diplomatic recognition there are real , difficult differences to work out , like how to assure the rights of ethnic minorities , how to divide disputed property and how to assure mutual economic interests such arrangements are scarcely beyond the wit and good will of mr gorbachev or the baltic leaders the new union treaty whose signing was interrupted by the aborted coup explicitly declares that membership is voluntary nine of fifteen republics are expected to approve the new federation five central asian republics have already agreed to form a regional common market if the same pragmatic spirit is applied to the baltic states , their independence could make economic as well as moral sense but the moral case for freedom should suffice , and it is compelling
sulaimaniya , iraq across northern iraq , kurds , freed for now from the harshness of president saddam hussein s grip , have been uncovering mass graves , torture chambers , elaborate prison systems and documents from secret police files that attest to the inner workings of one of the region s harshest dictatorships in the city of sulaimaniya alone , local officials say they have unearthed more than 200 bodies in the last two months , and new sites to be excavated are being discovered every week kurds have long charged the hussein government with human rights abuses some especially severe cases have been independently substantiated and widely publicized , including attacks with chemical weapons on kurdish villagers at halabja during the war between iran and iraq relative freedom but the graves and other recent discoveries offer evidence of the wide extent of baghdad s repression they are coming to light now that the kurds have been left relatively free to run their affairs and rebuild their lives in the aftermath of the americanled military effort to protect them from mr hussein s forces baghdad crushed a kurdish uprising in the aftermath of its defeat in the persian gulf war , forcing hundreds of thousands of kurds to flee for months into iran and turkey when we first complained about these human rights violations the world did not listen , said jalal talabani , one of two top kurdish guerrilla leaders now that we come forward with the evidence , this information is harder to ignore indiscriminate killing charged kurdish leaders contend that more than 180 , 000 people have disappeared in the last decade at the hands of the iraqi secret police they say the iraqis killed anyone , including young children , who they believe supported the outlawed kurdish guerrilla movement or who belonged to a family that had ties with the kurdish rebels diplomats at iraq s mission to the united nations , its highestlevel diplomatic presence in the united states , could not be reached for comment on the new evidence of abuses middle east watch , a new yorkbased human rights group , said it was planning to send investigators to northern iraq to look into the kurds' accusations when confronted in the past with charges of mass killings or abuses of kurds , iraqi officials have in general denied wrongdoing , saying that any actions in the region would have been carried out against inflitrators from iran or against traitors iraqi officials have also pointed to at least one mass killing by kurdish guerrillas in october , when 60 iraqi soldiers who surrendered during skirmishes in the sulaimaniya area were slain by their kurdish captors , according to the account of a reuters reporter kurdish leaders promised to investigate the killings and bring those guilty to justice , but the investigation has yet to produce any results of graves being uncovered in northern iraq , some reflect vilagers' return only now to the ruins of communities destroyed under an iraqi policy of forced mass relocation begun in 1976 more than 4 , 000 villages primarily those near the turkish or iranian borders that were regarded as sanctuaries for kurdish rebels are believed to have been demolished under the program , which reached its peak of intensity in 1987 and 1988 , toward the end of the iraniraq war other mass graves are thought to be more recent at one , on kalowa hill here in sulaimaniya , pershan hassan clambered quickly up the dirt track leading to the site as she hurried forward , she clutched to her chest a framed black and white

american forces the kurds also control territory below the zone , including the city of sulaimaniya , although the iraqis appear to be positioning themselves to take back it and other cities as

standing on the stage of the arie crown theater in chicago s mccormick place convention center on april 17 , addressing his stockholders , the 56yearold chairman of att sounded a plaintive note as he described the uneven course of his attempt to buy the ncr corporation what we had hoped for , said robert e allen , was a heady courtship of wine and roses , and a quick elopement what he had experienced , far from a smooth romance , was a very public dustup in which the object of his affection had told him in no uncertain terms to get lost yet even on this april morning , several months after att had made its first concrete offer and been turned down , one could detect a note of surprise in allen s voice the leaders of american telephone and telegraph had expected that ncr would welcome their bid , and some of them were said to believe that ncr might be tailoring itself for an att merger a notion that charles e exley jr , the 61yearold chairman of ncr , attributes to selfhypnosis such surprises and confusions were commonplace during the long struggle , which ended may 6 when ncr agreed to be acquired for some 74 billion in att stock sometimes the action seemed drawn from saturday morning television as the giant att , like wile e coyote , lunged at its much smaller target , only to crash in a heap on the spot the ncr road runner had just vacated in november 1990 , exley flew into new york from his dayton , ohio , headquarters for an appearance before the att board , hoping to persuade the directors to drop their takeover efforts i explained our program for the 90 s , he recalls , and i must have gotten carried away with enthusiasm when i sat down , one of the directors said something like , 'this presentation has certainly convinced me that the acquisition of ncr is a very good idea for att' for the business community in general , and wall street in particular , the merger raised a number of intriguing questions did it signal a return to the proxy contests that gathered steam in the 70 s and gave way to the junkbondfueled raids of the late 80 s \? has the country entered a new period of strategic industrial mergers in which companies are purchased to be kept and nurtured rather than to be sold piecemeal for shortterm gain \? how will institutional investors , major players in the attncr battle , use their evergrowing power \? but there is another question of far broader import ncr was a wellmanaged , highly profitable enterprise , the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the nation during the 1980 s , the 106yearold company , long known as national cash register , had done what american companies are supposed to do , and so few actually did the foreign sales of its respected products contributed substantially to the nation s lagging balance of trade , it had bet the company on the development of a widely admired new series of computers and all without sinking into major indebtedness to an important degree , ncr s defense against att centered on the theory that the company was responsible to its stakeholders not just shareholders , but customers , employees , suppliers and the dayton community in exley s view , the success of his company stemmed directly from its success in satisfying the needs of all these constituencies the question why does an ncr have to lose its independence \? att just wanted to be friends the dignified and imageconscious company long known as ma bell had never attempted a hostile takeover in july 1988 , allen and robert m kavner , the head of att s computer division , brought exley a proposal to merge the two companies they said we were the key to their success in the computer business , exley recalls since 1984 , att had lost well over 1 billion in its computer operations the division had never enjoyed a profitable year it had never even had a profitable quarter we did n't see that they would add anything to the picture , exley says kavner was back in dayton in june 1989 and received the same answer eighteen months passed then , on nov 8 , 1990 , a press report stated , inaccurately , that the two companies had entered merger discussions at ncr , the suspicion grew that the story had been planted by att \( though to this day , att professes its innocence \) the suspicion also grew that att was trying to buy ncr on the cheap ncr s stock price had been depressed since the 1987 market crash , and had been further depressed in the general decline of stocks following the iraqi invasion of kuwait the possibility of a merger acted as a positive tonic over the next several days , the price of ncr shares , which had been languishing at 48 , jumped to 53 7 8 six days later , att invested the rumors with substance meeting through dinner , the board approved allen s plan to acquire ncr in a friendly 85ashare stock swap at 9 30 the next morning , allen telephoned exley in dayton and asked for a meeting on an urgent basis when exley suggested sometime the following week , allen responded , i mean urgent today or tomorrow
tel aviv , oct 3 shimon peres , head of the opposition labor party , called today for a halt to israeli settlements in the occupied territories and said there could be no middle east peace unless this country gives up some of the arab land it has held since the 1967 war mr peres proposed the creation of a demilitarized west bank , with israel retaining certain , unspecified areas for security purposes but yielding the rest to a new jordanianpalestinian confederation that would include the present kingdom of jordan the crowded gaza strip would also be a part of this confederation , he said peace cannot be achieved without territorial compromise , mr peres , a former prime minister , said in an interview at his party s headquarters in which he reiterated his party s position on several issues he said that one of the best ways to expedite the middle east peace process being promoted by the united states was to freeze settlement activity in the territories on both counts land concessions and a halt to settlements the labor party leader is diametrically at odds with the nocompromise stand taken by the government and the likud party of prime minister yitzhak shamir when somebody says gaza belongs to us , we are not convinced , mr peres said we think that we belong to gaza more than gaza belongs to us we are more in a way the policemen of gaza than its proprietor we would not like to dominate another people against their will , he continued it s a moral issue it s a political issue throughout our history as a jewish people we have never dominated other people , and whoever dominated us disappeared from history we do n't want to copy that some opinion polls here suggest that a majority of israelis share his views on a settlement freeze , and that their ranks include a significant share of likud voters but the surveys also suggest that agreement on this issue does not necessarily translate into broad popular support for mr peres s party , which had belonged to a shamirled government until the coalition broke apart 19 months ago political commentators say labor is now at a low ebb as it prepares for elections scheduled to be held within a year rejecting this view , mr peres said there will be many new voters in the next election , including a large number of soviet immigrants none of us knows how they 'll vote , he said
what did madonna really have for breakfast on the morning after her marriage to sean penn \? according to madonna revealed by douglas thompson \( birch lane press \) , it was strawberries and cream mr thompson bases this upon the testimony of a hotel chambermaid who claims the penns offered her a beer and they all shared a nuptial toast but christopher andersen , author of madonna unauthorized \( simon schuster \) , says it was raspberries and his witness is the roomservice waiter , one of several who drew lots for the privilege of delivering madonna s meal upon entering her room , the waiter noticed that madonna was reading a book when he congratulated her on her marriage , he reports , she said thank you by the bottomscraping standards of today s celebrity biography genre , this passes for news as events of the past week indicated with sobering clarity , the fine art of keyholepeeping is out of control television viewers could choose between the noholdsbarred nastiness of the judge clarence thomas hearings and a woman named jackie , a threepart miniseries purporting to expose the intimate workings of the kennedy white house one typical scene showed the actress impersonating jacqueline kennedy \( and sounding more like audrey hepburn on sedatives \) , with another playing her mother , janet auchincloss , watching a fake marilyn monroe crooning happy birthday , mr president on television well , i'm glad the children did n't stay up to see that ! the viewer was supposed to imagine that mrs auchincloss said in another scene , the president declares , jackie , you ca n't spend the taxpayers' money like a teenager with her first charge plate ! after thus doing its best to invade its subject s privacy , new york s local nbc affiliate had the temerity to offer a feature called jackie onassis a private life in today s tellall climate , it s not surprising that the distinction between a private life and one pried into on prime time is easily blurred a lot of distinctions , even the ones that separate madonna , mrs onassis and anita f hill , tend to get lost in such an overheated atmosphere all that matters today is that each of them finds herself in the glare of unwanted scrutiny someone else will be there tomorrow for some subjects this treatment is less obviously unjust than it is for others thanks to madonna s status , in mr andersen s words , as our lady of perpetual promotion , this star s private life is fairer game than , say , professor hill s after all , it s madonna who said would n't you rather read an article about a slut than a plainjane wallflower \? i know i would and it s madonna who sanctioned a documentary in which every imaginable private thought \( save those about her business empire \) was revealed on camera indeed , madonna has aired the facts of her life so extensively that mr thompson is able to fill nine pages of his very brief book with nonstop madonna quotes borrowed from someone else s interview naturally , the source is not specifically attributed but does even the heatseeking madonna deserve to be hoodwinked by a reporter pretending to be a nurse at the office of madonna s gynecologist s , as mr andersen reports \? and did mr thompson need to publicize that office s location \? what about the radio reporter in mr andersen s book who arrived on the set of shanghai surprise pretending to be an extra , with a tape recorder hidden in her evening bag \? what about publishing the police report \( mr thompson \) on mr penn s vicious physical attack on his wife in their malibu home , an incident that evidently broke up the marriage \? and what about sifting through debris after they left \( mr thompson \) to cite bills from their exterminator , rubbish collector and cellular telephone company , among others \? then there is russell long , madonna s first sex partner , who spoke to both mr andersen and mr thompson , but not to norman king , author of the forthcoming madonna the book \( william morrow company \) , a straight rewrite of old madonna clippings that does n't even mention the honeymoon breakfast madonna liked the back seat of his cadillac , mr long is gallant enough to report she called out things like oh , baby , he says actually , neither of us had that great a time that night , mr long told mr andersen about the night madonna lost her virginity , but there you go in cobbling together these voyeuristic biographies with the help of mr long and too many others like him , enterprise is where the author finds it mr andersen , who tried hardest and did by far the most creditable job , has learned that madonna got an a in a marriage and family course while in high school that her nicknames have included emmy , mudd and little nonni that she and warren beatty were interrupted in her dick tracy dressing room in what for anyone else would have been an embarrassing situation that when asked to mind a friend s two poodles for a few days she spraypainted one pink and the other orange , and added some unprintable graffiti then there are mr andersen s stranger , more dubious stories about how madonna and prince plastered a hole in her los angeles apartment wall after mr penn punched it in , and how she and michael jackson disrobed and inspected each other like extraterrestrials when they had a date
the 35millimeter view of the world has doubtless affected our perceptions as radically as cubism and surrealism have the view existed somewhat before the cameras did , but the leica made it official in the mid20 s , and other cameras soon followed the small machines with their capacity to stop movement and to picture interiors in ordinary daylight heightened the public s awareness of transient moments , deepened appreciation of the most common occurrences and objects , and raised expectations about what could and should be seen on the page now that film could be advanced quickly , the moment after the moment could also be trapped , giving the photographer better odds on catching history , revelation and coincidence thus the world began to anticipate that the passing scene would be distilled into its most meaningful events and resonant configurations andre kertesz \( 18941985 \) was one of the discoverers of such a vision , and his version influenced many photographers , including brassai and henri cartierbresson two current shows in manhattan andre kertesz the early years , at houk friedman , and andre kertesz the new york years , 193685 at howard greenberg \( both through nov 2 \) present a miniretrospective with a number of images that were not in the metropolitan museum s major exhibition in 1986 houk friedman \( 1094 madison avenue \) , has the variant of satiric dancer that kertesz gave to the subject herself he was a canny editor of his own work the version he published is much more vigorous and gleeful and has deservedly become a classic seeing the other is a useful reminder that even the best images seldom spring fullgrown from the head of a camera god kertesz , born in hungary , bought his first camera in 1912 he said that he worked in the leica spirit before there was a leica , looking for the single moment that said everything it is just such moments that the public came to rely on technology made them easier to preserve , but someone had to define them kertesz snatched an overlooked instant from the rush of time and stamped it significant in the late 20 s , a french poet wrote , in this asylum for the blind , kertesz sees for us a tiny 1915 contact print at houk friedman illustrates how a most particular and unassuming example acquires a universal meaning as a soldier and a peasant woman walk away from the camera , he leans toward her , turns his head with a large , hopeful smile and places a hand gently on her rear end contact prints like these of the 20 s and earlier , some printed on postcards , are the most personal and engaging of all kertesz s prints , standing in relation to his work almost as drawings do to paintings both these shows present fine vintage material prints made years later from the same negatives do not always have such delicacy kertesz moved to paris in 1925 to establish himself as a photographer and soon succeeded he was recognized as both an artist and a leader of the new photojournalism , which fed the growing public appetite for information in what appeared to be a candid and straightforward guise the houk friedman show , which has relatively few of kertesz s street scenes , makes abundantly clear that his meeting with mondrian in 1926 strongly affected his style the howard greenberg \( 120 wooster street \) show indicates that the influence never diminished formalism and naturalism joined forces in such famous early images as chez mondrian \( at houk friedman \) , where the rectilinear purity of the studio is underlined by the fake flower \( the artist , who detested green , had painted its leaf white \) and undercut by both the curving banister and the painter s stubbornly circular hat art and photography danced cheek to cheek all over paris kertesz looked at city life and saw echoes of the rigorous artistic movement known as de stijl when a couple walked behind a wire fence , both figures and fence got tilted on the diagonal , as if one of mondrian s diamond paintings had been righted on the wall the photographer cropped some pictures severely , isolating , as a painter might , a more abstract element and shifting toward the invention rather than the discovery of a moment at the same time , kertesz was experimenting with surrealist distortion photography , a generous medium , is a truly protean art painters could scarcely try out naturalism , abstract formalism and biomorphic surrealism in the space of a couple of years with such ease his 1933 nude transformations ran lightyears in advance of industrial light and magic the head of one small figure melts into the head of a huge , misshapen , upsidedown other self that leaks ectoplasmically into yet another body the model , no doubt accustomed to believing that photographs were truthful , insisted that none of the photographs were of her photography , not for the first time , joined the other modern arts in making a mess of human selfregard \( when james joyce s father saw brancusi s drawing of joyce , he exclaimed , my god , how the boy has changed ! \) in 1936 , kertesz sailed to new york to expand his art and make some money , but fame and fortune snubbed him life magazine told him his pictures talked too much , and a publisher said they were n't brutal enough he was damned for his distinctions in 1946 he signed a contract with house and garden later he said that meant 20 years of his creative life were wasted paris remained his great subject , but kertesz had his high points here too while he looked down on washington square park in the snow , where tree branches tentatively fanned out like experiments with an etching needle , he waited for two tiny walking figures whose silhouettes would make a merely pretty landscape light up and sing in buy long island , another of those views from above he delighted in , he looked past a billboard advertising budweiser to a sidewalk slipping across the picture , a slanted stop sign , and two isolated men the image can be read as an oblique and cleverly designed comment on the loneliness of the commercial culture in the howard greenberg show , kertesz s new york is only occasionally punctuated by people but consistently composes itself into a fugue of elegant patterns in the best of the formal images he recreates the city after mondrian with lapidary grace and precision , but after a while there is a surfeit of austerity even the trees have no leaves , as if kertesz had banished summer from his camera s calendar by all accounts he was heavily invested in his grudges bitterness is not easily conveyed by photographs of urban architecture , but remoteness is , and he appears to have withdrawn further and further into formalism mondrian might have been stuck in his lens design occasionally crowded out insight there s a glimpse here of the kind of human warmth he had displayed so often in his early years in hungary , when gypsy children and flirtatious soldiers still seemed new to photographers in 1959 he photographed a blind man playing an accordion , a blind woman with a cup and a dwarf putting a coin in it one outsider recognizing another , perhaps a comment on his own state but for a passionate view of new york and a revolutionary way to see it , one should turn to a man kertesz revered mondrian , whose broadway boogiewoogie has precisely the energy and sense of connection that kertesz in his later years , when he was no longer discovering a vision but consolidating one , could not always compress within a 35millemeter frame photo chez mondrian art and photography danced cheek to cheek all over paris \( houk friedman gallery \)
pittsburgh , april 6 although patrik sundstrom s performance this season has bordered on mediocrity , given his usual standards , there are those in the new jersey devils camp who believe the team cannot advance in the stanley cup playoffs without him sundstrom , whose production fell from 76 points last season to 46 this season , might not play sunday night in the third game of the devils' patrick division semifinal playoff series with the penguins the series is shifting to byrne meadowlands arena in new jersey for the next two games , with the devils and the penguins tied at a victory each in the third period of the devils' 31 victory in the opening game of the series wednesday night , sundstrom suffered a shoulder injury that the devils are calling a bruise he missed pittsburgh s 54 overtime victory friday night although he was the center for the team s top wings , john maclean and brendan shanahan , until he left the game early in the third period wednesday , sundstrom and his linemates went without a point in that first game morris steps in jon morris , the rookie center , was inserted in place of sundstrom between maclean and shanahan on friday night , and that line produced 7 points , giving the devils the lead three times maclean had two goals and an assist morris assisted on both goals by maclean with good passes before maclean s shots and shanahan had a goal and an assist , on maclean s second goal of the night but the line also had its problems defensively and that s where sundstrom s supporters have a legitimate claim as morris and maclean were the victims of two of pittsburgh s goals morris was beaten on phil bourque s goal with 2 minutes 59 seconds left in the second , which tied the game at 33 maclean was beaten on jaromir jagr s game winner , 8 52 into the overtime the devils dominated the overtime with 7 shots for a total of 40 , but penguin goalie tom barrasso , who played rather poorly in regulation , came up big in the extra session , with two saves on claude lemieux and one on doug brown his most remarkable chris terreri faced 26 shots in goal for the devils , including two in the overtime , and was not responsible for any of the goals he did well enough in the first two games to be rewarded with the next start best twoway player sundstrom s offensive production fell considerably this season , but the swedish forward has lost none of his defensive skills and still remains the devils' best twoway player he s a very valuable man to this organization coach tom mcvie said about the 29yearold sundstrom , who played 71 games despite chronic back and groin problems mcvie has the highest regard for sundstrom sundstrom was the second player mcvie had a meeting with after kirk muller , the captain when mcvie replaced john cunniff as coach march 4 a lingering respiratory problem , which began with a case of the flu early in the season , weakened sundstrom a great deal for most of the season , but in a conversation before the playoffs , he did n't offer that as an excuse for his play like most europeans in the national hockey league , sundstrom tends to raise his level of play to higher standards in the playoffs it s hard to put everything behind you , sundstrom said about his mediocre production in the regular season the playoffs is a new season and i hope my play and the team will be better taking a spectator role when the devils made their remarkable run in the playoffs four seasons ago , falling one game short of the stanley cup finals , sundstrom was the key , along with sean burke in goal sundstrom had 52 points in 78 games that season , but he led the devils in the playoffs with 20 points , including seven goals on friday night , sundstrom was watching from the civic arena press box as his two wings were on the ice when jagr scored the winner the scoring play was started by jiri hrdina , a 33yearold czechoslovak who was acquired from calgary before christmas to be a companion for jagr slow to adjust jagr had had so much trouble with the english language and adjustment to life in the united states that he had thoughts of returning home , but his homesickness apparently disappeared the day hrdina arrived here , dec 13 they have some great individual players , said peter stastny , a 34yearold czechoslovak who is a devil , said of the penguins we played them equally , but they came up with a couple of individual efforts stastny has played a role similar to hrdina s for the penguins , looking after zdeno ciger , a 20yearold rookie from czechoslovakia who is gifted enough to reach stastny s level one day
paris , july 3 president francois mitterrand announced today that he would visit iran before the end of the year , becoming the first head of state from the european community to visit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution french officials said the visit would take place this year , but they gave no date iranian officials said that after mr mitterrand s visit , they would fix a time for a return visit to france by president hashemi rafsanjani of iran it would be the iranian leader s first trip to a major western country since the revolution , and would further cement the improvement in iranian relations with the european community president kurt waldheim of austria is the only western head of state to visit iran since the revolution that toppled shah mohammad riza pahlevi and brought the islamic government to power austria is not a member of the 12nation european community the announcement of the invitation , which was made by the iranian foreign minister , ali akbar velayati , was timed to coincide with another major step in improving ties the settlement of a dispute over a 1 billion loan that the shah made to france in the 1970 s frenchiranian thaw the announcement follows two other moves to normalize ties between the countries over the last four years those are the release of french hostages held in lebanon by proiranian terrorists and the resumption of diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level french officials and businessmen have been waiting for a settlement on the financial dispute between the countries , aware that iran is undertaking a fiveyear plan in which french companies stand to realize as much as 5 billion from exporting technology and from ventures with iranian firms french companies are at work repairing the iranian oil terminal at kharg island , and peugot has made cars in iran since the start of the year the loan , which has been the subject of lengthy and complicated negotiations over the last 12 years , was made by the iranian government in 1974 to france s agency for nuclear energy , the cea it was extended in return for french assistance to iran to set up its own nuclear reactors and feed them with enriched uranium imported from the french agency and its affiliates the deal was frozen in 1979 after the revolution and france asserted that part of the money should be used to compensate french companies whose assets were seized in iran iran has since said it would not embark on building nuclear reactors and asked for the money , plus interest totaling another 1 billion , to be refunded france made payments of about 330 million and 300 million in 1986 and 1987 , after which french hostages were released in beirut french officials as well as iranian officials have said those moves were part of a comprehensive accord aimed at resuming normal economic and political contacts between the countries diplomatic ties were fully restored in may 1988 although none of the details of the accords were announced , french officials and foreign diplomats have said that among other things , iran agreed to stop all terrorist activities by any of its agents or by those of its lebanese allies against france in 1986 , a series of bombings in paris were traced back to iranianbacked terrorists france for its part said it would lead the way for iran to normalize ties with the rest of the european community iran has over the last few years resumed its ties with all 12 members of the community , including britain , which still has hostages in lebanon american hostages are still held in beirut and a financial dispute has existed between the united states and iran since 1979 and remains to be resolved , but there was no indication today from mr velayati that any progress on that front has been made lebanese terrorists are holding six americans in lebanon and iran maintains that the united states owes it 10 billion in frozen assets and interest on money paid by the shah to buy weapons that were never delivered by the united states after the iranian revolution the united states has refused to enter any talks with iran before the american hostages are freed
money is generally a crucial factor in political campaigns , but political strategists say it will play an even bigger role than usual in the city council elections this fall that is because the allimportant democratic primary has become a short fourweek sprint with a field of more than 250 candidates , none of them household names and most of them complete unknowns , political experts said so candidates who are able to publicize their names and platforms most effectively have a better chance at the polls , the strategists say , especially since voter turnout is expected to be light in a year without a national or citywide race this is one of those elections where money will talk , said norman adler , a political consultant to the council speaker , peter f vallone the election is being run in such a short period of time and there are so many names that whoever has the most name recognition will win and the only way to get more name recognition is to buy it 'the right political writers' the most dangerous thing in any district this year is money , a highranking democratic party official said i can take a nobody and if you give me the right political writers , the right layout people , the right mailing house , he can become a dangerous candidate money makes the candidacy money speaks loudest for incumbents , a review of dozens of financialdisclosure documents at the state board of elections shows no overall figures are available for how much money incumbents and challengers have raised because the financial disclosure documents on file with the board are not computerized , and dozens of candidates have failed to file the latest forms , naomi bernstein , a spokeswoman for the board , said but a review of several candidates' filings showed that political campaign donations tended to flow toward power , and in race after race , most of the challengers appeared to be scraping together a few thousand dollars from individual contributors , while sitting council members are receiving the largess of various politicalaction committees for unions and other special interests that hope to curry favor trying to counter the incumbents' advantage , a progressive group of unionists and politicians , the majority coalition for a new new york , will today endorse 23 candidates , most of them outside the liberal mainstream substantial treasuries the amount in incumbents' campaign treasuries varies from race to race , with most of the sitting council members hovering in the 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 range , depending on the power of the council member at the top of the spectrum is councilman noach dear , a brooklyn democrat , who has raised more than 205 , 000 since the last election and has 90 , 400 left to spend in the primary by comparison , his closest competitor , bob miller , has raised 23 , 275 other incumbents with substantial treasuries include june eisland of queens , who has raised more than 133 , 000 this year despite facing no primary , and archie spigner , the queens democrat who heads the council s housing committee and who has raised more than 84 , 275 , propelled in large part by donations from unions and contractors affected by legislation his committee drafts mr spigner is facing a challenge from garth marchand , a newcomer to politics who has raised less than 10 , 000 the expansion of the council to 51 seats , from 35 , has created 19 districts with no incumbents and fields of as many as a dozen untested candidates here too , money will matter in city council races , polls have shown that even longtime incumbents are not well known to the public , so voters given a choice among eight challengers they have heard little about will probably choose the one they are most familiar with , strategists said those who have the wherewithal to get their names out there will have a better shot at winning , said assemblyman clarence norman , the kings county democratic party leader endorsing 23 candidates complicating the picture are two political organizations with large war chests and diametrically opposed missions who have promised to funnel large amounts of money and advice to crucial campaigns the majority coalition , led by dennis rivera , the president of the hospital workers union , says it will spend nearly 500 , 000 on advertising on behalf of the 23 candidates it is endorsing , hoping to elect a council with more advocates for the working class and the poor among those endorsed are four incumbents who have traditionally opposed mr vallone miriam friedlander , ronnie eldridge , sal albanese and c virginia fields the other powerhouse is the council political action committee , known as cpac , a political apparatus of mr vallone s that is sworn to help incumbents and the speaker s political allies according to board of election documents , cpac has already disbursed 12 , 000 of the 192 , 000 currently in its coffers to nine candidates , among them the incumbents susan alter , karen koslowitz and mr spigner ms alter hardly needs the financial help a longtime incumbent , she has raised more that 37 , 000 since the 1989 election , and has 18 , 888 left , state records show of the other challengers in district 45 who have filed with the board of elections none have raised more than 8 , 500 other incumbents have similar advantages mary pinkett , the democratic councilwoman from bedfordstuyvesant , has raised more than 27 , 000 and spent about 5 , 000 since january on aug 8 , unions for civil servants , the police and firefighters gave her a shot in the arm totaling 3 , 000 , two months after she became the chairwoman of the state and federal legislation committee , which has the power to alter the pensions of city employees , campaign records show her competitors have had less luck raising money one democrat in the race , peter l williams , has collected 13 , 000 from individuals another democratic contender , ernest emmanuel , has raised 9 , 280 , again all from individual donors where there are no incumbents , the politically wellconnected are faring better than outsiders , records show for instance , in the eighth district in east harlem , one republican and nine democrats are running none have held elected office but william del toro , the brother of assemblyman angelo del toro and a member of a powerful political family , has raised more than 20 , 045 , helped along by a 1 , 000 contribution from congressman charles rangel and 1 , 500 from mr vallone s cpac philip reed , a democratic district leader from the upper west side who has much support within the party organization , has also succeeded in raising 20 , 895 and adam clayton powell iv , grandson of the famous harlem congressman , who has the support of the majority coalition , has collected 18 , 591 lacking such connections , the others in the race have fared less well william perkins , a board of elections official , has raised 5 , 300 nelson antonio dennis , 8 , 695 dollars and philip shelly , 2 , 510 george espada has raised nothing , records show
bethesda , md , march 24 they like neither the name nor the implication , but a group of investigators working in cramped quarters at the national institutes of health here are known to some as the science police the sprawling nih campus , where worldrenowned research teams study cancer , aids , heart disease and other maladies , is also the home of the office of scientific integrity for more than two years , this government office has been looking into an ailment in research itself scientific misconduct and fraud in recent weeks , several investigations have brought the work of the littlenoticed office to the attention of the public , and scores of pending cases suggest it may be less obscure in the future for instance , the investigators concluded that crucial data were faked in an important research paper that listed among its authors dr david baltimore , a leading molecular biologist and nobel laureate dr baltimore , who is president of rockefeller university , was not involved in the work by another scientist , but until recently he had defended the paper and condemned investigations by the nih and congress he has now asked that the paper be retracted inquiry in aids dispute the agency is also leading the inquiry into who first isolated the virus that causes aids dr robert gallo of the national cancer institute , whose claim to have discovered the virus in 1984 is disputed by dr luc montagnier of the pasteur institute in paris , is trying to rebut charges that a virus isolated by french researchers made its way into his laboratory through theft or contamination the outcome of the investigation could influence a future nobel prize the health institutes , which finances most of the nation s medical research , previously relied primarily on its institutional liaison office to look into misconduct and fraud that office had other responsibilities , however , and its staff of fewer than a half dozen had little time for investigation the new office of scientific integrity , a result of congressional concern over the billions of dollars in tax money spent on academic science , has a 1 million annual budget and is directed by dr jules v hallum , former chairman of microbiology and immunology at oregon health sciences university , and his deputy , dr suzanne w hadley , a clinical psychologist who was formerly the misconduct officer for the national institute of mental health the office has nine investigators , including the directors , and seven staff workers all but one of the investigators have doctorate degrees , in fields like biochemistry , genetics , biostatistics or medicine the investigators received training in interviewing and casebuilding from experts in the offices of united states attorney and inspector general one person also received secret service training on inspecting documents , and all are scheduled for training by food and drug administration investigators this is not a paper tiger office , dr hallum said none of us is on a witch hunt , but we are taking this job seriously we as scientists have to do this job of examining other scientists ourselves or there are others out there who will do it for us review , not confrontation the office s philosophy is to avoid confrontations like those in legal proceedings rather , dr hadley said , it reviews disputed data and makes scientific judgments on who is right in a conflict the office is not a police agency but an arbitrator of facts , she said but if misconduct is found , the office can recommend sanctions ranging from reprimands to permanent ineligibility to receive federal money its recommendations are reviewed by the nih director and other officials of the department of health and human services , the parent agency of the health institutes anyone facing the loss of federal money can demand a legal hearing criminal matters can be referred to the justice department most scientists believe that instances of misconduct like falsifying data , stealing another s work , misappropriating money or lying on grant applications are relatively rare although such problems have received more attention in the past decade , these scientists do not think misconduct has increased greatly most conflicts about research results are differences in judgment and interpretation , they say , not evidence of misconduct considering the tens of thousands of federal grants and contracts given to thousands of scientists each year , researchersnote , little malfeasance has turned up the nih investigators usually have about 70 cases open at a time , a few going back a decade or more dr hadley , who will soon leave her post to take a position in the nih administrative offices , said her unit has closed 105 cases in its first two years the majority did not result in findings of wrongdoing twentyone of these cases resulted in formal investigations , and misconduct was determined in 15 of them , she said , this does n't seem to indicate there are widespread problems but in recent years , a few wellpublicized cases that caught the attention of the public and congress have provoked questions about the ways science has traditionally kept itself honest , like the appointment of investigating committees by college deans the preferred solution
boston at the end of the battle of agincourt in shakespeare s henry the fifth king henry says this note doth tell me of ten thousand french that in the field lie slain where is the number of our english dead \? edward the duke of york , the earl of suffolk , sir richard ketly , davy gam , esquire none else of name and of all other men but five and twenty o god , thy arm was here victory in the war with iraq leaves us with such feelings of awe with half a million soldiers on each side , the united states and its coalition partners had only about 140 killed how did it happen \? what are the consequences \? even at this early hour we can begin to draw some lessons for the future first , the united states had outstanding political and military leadership having decided on war , months ago , president bush prosecuted it with impressive skill in colin powell and norman schwarzkopf he had generals of uncommon intellect and resourcefulness to pay those deserved compliments is to recognize a second feature of this war going it alone treating it as an american show would not have worked our leaders were successful in good part because they understood that president bush and secretary of state baker worked hard to organize the coalition mr bush even managed to handle the lastminute soviet peace initiative with just enough politeness to avoid fatal injury to ussoviet relations general schwarzkopf s concern was evident at his victory briefing in the praise he carefully gave each participating force the united nations played a crucial role a third point the security council s resolutions shaped the coalition and the politics of the conflict to the very end its authorization to use force was essential if mr bush s talk of a new world order is to have any meaning , the united nations will have to play a much greater part in future in preventing war the un system can work we know that now and prevention is far better than war that is a practical point , not just an idealistic one for a fourth lesson of the persian gulf war is that neither the united states nor the world can afford to repeat it we fought the war on money promised from others the us will not want that to be a pattern , making itself a provider of mercenaries the colossal effort of sending 500 , 000 soldiers halfway around the world cannot be made again soon , if ever it is not just a question of money the particular combination of interests and opportunities that made this war go as it did is not likely to recur do n't get the idea it will always be this easy there is a fifth lesson , put that way by prof barry posen , a military expert at mit the terrain was favorable to our hightech weapons , and we were up against a secondrate gangster we must not confuse what we did here with using military power to redirect the domestic politics of a society saddam hussein did make it easier seldom has a tyrant had more military confidence with less reason seldom has one missed with such consistent folly every chance to save something from defeat there is another factor that made it possible to win this war so quickly one that we have mostly put out of our minds that is the terrible punishment that we inflicted on iraqis from the air the casualties are as disproportionate as they were at agincourt estimates of the number of iraqi soldiers killed approach 50 , 000 an unknown number of civilians died in the bombing , too , and civilian deaths are likely to increase as a result of the destruction of water , power and sewage facilities in iraq s major cities arabs and others who were entranced by saddam hussein will quickly be disenchanted , i think but they may go on asking themselves whether the world would have paid so little attention to western deaths in such numbers weaponry has been glorified in this war but we have to remember that the war occurred because of the weapons the world supplied to saddam hussein over the years the fundamental lesson has to be that we must control the sale of arms to the whole region from here on not just to iraq but to all the players if we arm saudi arabia , then israel will want more , then syria , then iran at a minimum , this war should teach us that the middle east is too dangerous a place for limitless weaponry
the use of professional athletes as product spokesmen is about to undergo a landmark test now that ervin \( magic \) johnson , who has earned more than 12 million a year from commercials and other endorsements , has become the first such star to announce publicly that he has the aids virus some advertising and sports marketing executives said yesterday it was likely that johnson , one of the most visible spokesmen in american professional sports , would all but vanish from his endorsing venues others suggested that companies deciding to end their relationships with the los angeles lakers' star could face a backlash from a sympathetic public john l taylor , vice chairman at jordan , mcgrath , case taylor in new york , said that he doubted his ad agency would run a new series of television commercials , which were produced last month , for the nestle crunch candy bar the contract that johnson signed with the company , announced on sept 30 , was predicated on his being an active basketball player , taylor added we need to wait for all the information to come out , he continued but there is a gap between what he was yesterday and what he will be tomorrow we have a lot of people in this country with a lot of prejudice about aids marty blackman , a principal at blackman raber , a sports and entertainment marketing consulting firm in new york , said that there would probably be no company bold enough to use johnson for any new commercials he speculated that those already having contracts with johnson would allow them to expire quietly so as to avoid a public relations disaster several other companies that have hired johnson as an endorser or spokesman , including pepsicola and converse , expressed deep concern and support about his condition , but said in statements that their future ad plans would await direct discussions with him we 'll do the right thing , said a spokeswoman for pepsi , but right now , he has more important things to think about howard bragman , a publicrelations executive in beverly hills , calif , who represents celebrity clients as well as aids organizations , called the implications of the announcement a devastating personal tragedy , adding , it offers incredible potential for the public good bragman said he believed that if johnson had made his disclosure five years ago , people would have rushed to drop him but since then , we 've made some incredible strides , bragman said the announcement may make mainstream advertisers get involved in the aids crisis , he added bragman suggested that johnson could now appear in publicservice announcements , aimed at young people , about aids and the virus that causes it indeed , at his news conference , johnson said that he wants to be a spokesman for the virus among the companies with which johnson has contracts are pepsi , for which he has worked since 1989 , for diet pepsi and mandarin orange slice soft drinks converse , for which he has worked since 1979 kentucky fried chicken , for which he appeared in commercials last spring nba properties spalding , and nintendo coincidentally , none of the companies are running any ads featuring johnson
washington , nov 22 senator charles e grassley is an iowa farmer not known among his colleagues for any particularly strong interest in banking legislation but late thursday evening , shortly before a final vote on a bank bill , mr grassley , a republican , stepped up on the floor of the senate and introduced a complex provision on the regulation of the sale of credit cards it turns out that norwest bank , the largest bank in des moines , has been pursuing an aggressive strategy of buying credit card companies it does not want interference from the regulators over certain terms of the mergers the bank bill would now give the regulators the right to waive rules when an institution like norwest buys the credit card business of a weaker sister tucked away in the large and complex banking bill that was approved by a handful of senators by voice vote on thursday evening are a host of provisions written with specific constituents in mind with no tax bill this year , the bank legislation has become this session s vehicle to attach goodies for interest groups back home that have little relevance to refinancing the nearly empty deposit insurance fund many provisions were inserted by aides on the instruction of their bosses just minutes before final passage and were not publicly available until today they have contributed to a standoff today between the senate and the house that is bogging down efforts to iron out the differences between the senate bill and legislation the house adopted thursday one measure in the senate bill shortly before it was adopted came from alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york it would require the government to pay the uninsured depositors , many of whom were charitible organizations , at the collapsed freedom national bank of harlem john kerry , democrat of massachusetts , attached a provision helpful to massachusetts statechartered banks it would allow them to hold on to their investments in corporate stock all these banks have more than 2 percent of their assets already tied up in such investments , which they would have to divest themselves of unless his measure survives the bill also includes a provision by pete v domenici , republican of new mexico , for the production of a 1 coin that would clearly help the sagging minerals industry in his state the measure had been cosponsored by alan dixon , democrat of illinois , who was pushing a suggestion by the chicago transit authority , which would find the new coin convenient but that , of course , concerned richard h bryan , democrat of nevada , because his state has so many slot machines that would be costly to reconfigure so he made certain to introduce into the record a statement that the legislation would permit the 136 , 000 slot machines in nevada to continue to accept metal tokens while such provisions are important badges of constituent service , and important in the lawmakers' neverending search for campaign money , most will never become law instead , they will fall out during the negotiations , whenever they start no one expects , for instance , that the resolution attached to the banking bill by robert w kasten jr , republican of wisconsin , and approved by a vote of 82 to 14 , will be incorporated into the tax code any time soon it would drop the 10 percent luxury tax for purchases of boats mr kasten s state is one of the nation s largest manufacturers of boats , and the industry has been suffering under the new tax delaware s situation a closer call will come on the amendment pushed by william v roth , republican of delaware , to protect the insurance businesses of citibank and bankers trust in mr roth s state , which permits the banking companies to sell insurance nationwide efforts to include similar language have already failed in the house , but not by much , and representative tom carper , the state s sole member of the house , along with bank lobbyists , is pushing to revive it unlike previous years , lawmakers , lobbyists and congressional aides this time around have been reluctant to boast about special interest provisions put in the legislation i ca n't talk to you because it would violate my sense of selfpreservation , said one banking aide who insisted on not being identified the shyness this year stems largely from the new atmosphere on capitol hill in the wake of the ethics proceedings brought against the keating five , the senators accused of intervening on behalf of charles h keating jr , the owner of a large savings association that failed and will cost taxpayers more than 2 billion senate aides were also nervous about the growing prospect that the bill might be seen as too loaded down with special interest provisions and be scrapped for the house measure the impasse led treasury secretary nicholas f brady to return to capitol hill today and conduct a kind of shuttle diplomacy by early evening still fruitless between the leaders of the senate and house both measures would provide tens of billions of dollars for the nearly insolvent federal program that insures more than 2 trillion of bank deposits but the house , having rejected two measures already this month , has voted a considerably slimmer measure that includes none of the administration s proposals for overhauling the banking system the senate bill includes a limited version of the white house s proposal to ease decades of restrictions on interstate banking , a proposal the house was never able to pass in an effort to avert the possibility that the house will again reject a bank bill , the house today sent its bill to the senate but senate leaders are not willing to consider it , and are instead expecting to send their measure to the house
i have never actually met prof leonard jeffries jr but i have heard him speak in many parts of the world for instance , when he was an indian civil servant i heard him at a dinner party in new delhi saying that no hindu could ever trust a muslim cook because they were taught from childhood how to poison hindus , slowly , slowly , over the years another time when he was a white businessman in cape town i heard him explain that blacks had a genetic heritage that made them uncomfortable out of the jungle and therefore in the cities had to be treated with a particularly firm hand that was when we were both adults but i heard him first when we were both small , growing up on decatur avenue in the bronx he belonged to a gang of boys who used to scream at me that i killed jesus christ then too he was white now he is grown up , black and a college teacher he teaches that whites are ice people , born cold and greedy he says that blacks are sun people , warm and humanistic clearly ice and greed are inferior to warmth and humanism and whites to blacks like all preachers of racial superiority , he singles out one inferior tribe for special attention , to provide a specific target for his hatred jew , jew , jew this , jew that professor jeffries could not live without the jews he says they conspired with the mafia to hold africanamericans up to contempt and ridicule and he says in a public forum that the jews financed the slave trade that is not quite the equivalent of christkiller , but coming close , make no mistake in his present incarnation he is just one more windy bigot but no question , it is a matter of special pain , anger and some danger , that he teaches at city college of new york , which has had a great and unique role in the history of american education and in the intellectual and cultural enrichment of new york for generations it has been the only road to the future for young new yorkers of small means or in my case , none but large hope and energy once its student body was heavily jewish and italian now africanamericans and hispanicamericans are in the majority professor jeffries is severely damaging the reputation of city college it never had much of a football team , usually none at all but it could field a squad of graduates who became nobel laureates and fill a stadium with alumni who made names in the arts , business and government a jeffries would have been laughed out of his classroom the first day we had too much respect for intellectual endeavor , and for ourselves alone , the racism and bigotry of a jeffries could not destroy city college alone , he would be just one more unpleasant piece of urban nastiness to step over he can only permanently damage the reputation of the college if its student body and its faculty apologize for him , or rationalize his bigotry in the name of the first amendment , which is not involved , or say , well , prove he is wrong no , jews do not have to prove they did not kill christ or run the slave trade , they and other whites do not have to prove they are not born icegreedy , and blacks do not have to prove that genetically they are not better off in the jungle the jeffrieses of the world , white and black , preach hatred and paranoia those others are plotting against us , they are not really people like us but creatures of evil never forget those who teach that those others killed christ , or betrayed our reich and our superior aryan race , or enslaved and still conspire to subjugate our superior black race , they are not only preachers of hate but of death for how can it be a sin to destroy a creature who plots against you and is born evil \? already the jeffries supporters are moving to dominate the college with their placards and elbows still i hope that other city college students of all pigmentations will renounce this man , by boycotting him and his classes i hope his peers will not accept him any longer as a department head , and that specialists in african studies will realize he is marching the whole field straight into intellectual contempt , an inch from oblivion professor jeffries will continue to preach hate but now let a great college speak in its own voice and turn its back on this person , this ugly echo
a very thin line the irancontra affairs by theodore draper illustrated 690 pp new york hill wang 2795 how was it possible that during ronald reagan s administration members of his national security staff were able secretly to raise millions of dollars to replace funds that congress had explicitly refused to appropriate for the nicaraguan freedom fighters \? how could a marine colonel and a navy admiral arrange government arms sales to iran as a planned exchange for the release of american hostages , despite the administration s pledges not to pay ransom to terrorists and despite its demands that other nations not supply arms to iran \? how could those same officials lieut col oliver l north and adm john m poindexter then almost unknown to the public , divert surplus funds from these secret arms sales to the illegal support of the contras \? these questions , answered in magisterial detail by theodore draper in a very thin line , lead inexorably to others that in mr draper s view lie at the heart of a deep and dangerous disorder in the american body politic is the president a free agent with complete power over american foreign policy \? do the other branches of government , especially congress , have any part to play in it \? does the constitution draw a fundamental distinction between the conduct of foreign and domestic affairs \? do we have an authoritarian president in foreign but a democratic president in domestic policy \? mr draper , the author of several volumes on history and contemporary affairs , clearly does not believe and he adduces the support of legal and historical authorities that the constitution provides for such a presidency but in his view a long process of presidential aggrandizement , congressional fecklessness , and judicial connivance has put the constitution in danger by encouraging the idea of nearabsolute presidential dominance of foreign policy as proponents of that idea , mr poindexter and mr north were strategically placed as , respectively , president reagan s national security adviser and a virtually autonomous member of the national security staff fatally , they shared an interpretation of the constitution which they thought gave them a license to carry on their secret operations in the name of the president , in defiance of the law and without the knowledge of any other branch of the government mr north a zealous fantasist and fabricator who envisioned himself as surrounded by at best dupes and at worst traitors in congress and the press insisted during later congressional hearings i deeply believe that the president of the united states by the constitution , as i understand it is the person charged with making and carrying out the foreign policy of this country mr poindexter declared that congress s constitutionally specified power to appropriate funds should not be used to restrict what the president can do in foreign policy so strongly did he hold this extraordinary view that he was willing , in the case of the contras , to use money solicited from other countries \( saudi arabia , taiwan \) and from conservative private contributors to do indirectly what congress had refused to allow the reagan administration to do directly mr north and mr poindexter s view that congress had no right or power to restrict the president s control of foreign policy enabled them , without qualm , to spurn and deceive congress , override the secretaries of state and defense , supplant the central intelligence agency in the conduct of covert operations and effectively take control of united states policy concerning iran and central america all , they believed , with president reagan s implicit or explicit approval did they have that approval \? mr draper , a formidable researcher and analyst , argues persuasively that they did on the main questions at least , if not in every detail his conclusions are underpinned by his study of 27 volumes of depositions by some who testified and some who did not \( and never expected their words to be made public \) in the congressional hearings that seized the nation s attention in the summer of 1987 these volumes were not published by the government until long after the hearings , nor were three other volumes of documents , totaling nearly 5 , 000 pages , nor the lengthy transcripts of the north and poindexter criminal trials , nor the 2 , 500 pages of mr north s personal notebooks all these , mined in rich detail , make mr draper s study the most exhaustive examination of what he properly calls the irancontra affairs they were two different enterprises linked by the fund diversion but also by their illicit provenance , and the overlap of those who perpetrated them president reagan , as the world knows , was not a detail man , but as mr draper cuttingly observes , when the president complained that he had not been told 'everything , ' it hardly meant that he had been told nothing even the one crucial fact that mr poindexter admitted withholding from mr reagan the diversion of iranian funds to the contras was an act that the national security adviser believed had the president s implied approval in fact , mr poindexter said in congressional hearings that he withheld knowledge of the diversion , not because he feared mr reagan would disapprove , but because he knew it might someday become a political embarrassment for the president
kinshasa , zaire , nov 3 for an illustration of life in zaire these days , consider camp kokolo for a token entry fee , shoppers can chose from a seemingly inexhaustible variety of goods hundreds of television sets , video recorders , computers , telephones , stationary bicycles , rowing machines and even latemodel land cruisers and mercedes autos the prices are low because the goods are stolen all the vendors are soldiers camp kokolo stands in a quiet neighborhood of opulent residences as a symbol of economic chaos as well as the corruption and lawlessness of the armed forces , which have helped sweep this nation into a spiral of crises set off in september by soldiers unhappy that they had not been paid in several months fear of the ranks camp kokolo is proof not only that the military is completely out of control , but that the senior officers are afraid of their own soldiers , said albert moleka , an adviser to a former prime minister , mulumba lukoji , and now a senior member of the young republicans , an opposition party meanwhile , vast segments of the economy have shut down in the stalls of the street markets , the price of a sack of manioc , zaire s staple food , has risen fivefold in less than a month at hospitals , supplies are depleted , and doctors are admitting only emergency cases at the city s largest hospital , mama yemo , named after the president s mother , the hospital director issued a desperate call on friday for blood donors zaire s current crisis , which has posed the most serious threat to the government of president mobutu sese seko in decades , began in late september when the soldiers went on a rampage , looting homes and shops and setting off a wave of violence that left dozens dead belgium , the former colonial ruler of zaire , and france sent in troops to help evacuate westerners and maintain order the french troops left on thursday , and the belgians say they expect to leave by monday night , bringing a wave of apprehension to zaire s 40 million residents final collapse of economy business at camp kokolo is thriving not just because of the low prices but also because many zairians fear it may be their last chance to buy before the nation s economy collapses camp kokolo has become such an integral part of kinshasa s increasingly unbalanced economy that the conscience , a kinshasa daily , carried an article last week on the market of military thieves , listing current prices by contrast , elsewhere along this city of wide boulevards , which were once studded with european luxury boutiques , street after street of stores , banks and restaurants either have their shutters drawn , or are empty and roofless or gutted by fire the spectacle of camp kokolo is numbing in that it exposes the immense scale of the pillaging mostly by soldiers that has occurred in recent weeks in the capital in outlying provinces , there are reports of soldiers attacking food convoys on the road from matadi , zaire s main port , and the capital in one instance last wednesday , a western diplomat said , a trucker was shot at pointblank range and killed because he refused to pay a 10 bribe at one of the makeshift checkpoints that are spouting on nearly every main thoroughfare diplomats are targets diplomats also say that they themselves have increasingly become targets of military lawlessness because they are believed to live lavishly behind their highwalled compounds among the vehicles reportedly stolen during the first wave of pillaging late last month was that of the sudanese ambassador , which was use to cart stolen goods before it was stripped and discarded several diplomatic residences have since been looted the imminent departure of the european troops has stirred a wave of panic among many here who now fear that the armed forces , already increasingly beyond the control of the government , will complete disintegrate etienne tshisekedi , who was named prime minister and then dismissed by president mobutu , has sent urgent pleas to the french , belgian and american governments urging them to keep a military presence here , warning that opposition figures and their sympathizers could face a massacre african and western analysts here say the opposition has good reason to be worried for one thing , as the market at camp kokolo suggests , sanctions against soldiers who violate the most basic rules of military conduct are virtually nonexistent warnings against 'vandalism' this appears so , despite the fact that the army s chief of staff broadcast a warning last week that acts of vandalism must stop so far , said a western official with close contacts in the military , not a single soldier at the heart of the uprising has been punished for now , the streets of kinshasa are still crowded in the morning with cars and pedestrians but the appearance of normalcy is deceptive a western diplomat who has closely monitored the situation said that diesel fuel supplies are perilously low , perhaps enough to last only a few days the outlook for gasoline is similar , with only a week s supply left in the capital technicians are gone
beethoven s ninth symphony , brahms s german requiem , schubert s winterreise these are only the most obvious examples of music that has benefited from the uninterrupted playing time of the cd format a series of recent recordings argue the case for adding grieg s incidental music for ibsen s peer gynt to the list it s not simply that jeffrey tate \( with the berlin philharmonic angel emi 7 54119 2 cd \) and herbert blomstedt \( with the san francisco symphony london 425 4482 cd and cassette \) offer some 20 to 25 more minutes of grieg s score than the standard lp editions more important , the added music goes beyond standalone mood portraits to dramatically more specific musical settings as well as extended scenes with music most notably peer s harrowing night scene in act v , with its echoes of the ghostly wolf s glen scene of weber s freischutz kurt masur \( with the leipzig ge wandhaus orchestra philips 422 3432 cd \) takes a more direct approach to finding how grieg lent support to ibsen s stupendous and outrageous dramatic poem musical selections similar to mr tate s and mr blomstedt s are here incorporated into a concert version , with bits of narration and compressed dramatic scenes leading into and growing out of musical numbers and somewhere in the process of exploring this music in the context of peer gynt s globehopping \( or stumbling \) adventures , mr masur and mr tate in particular have found sources for more pointed performances of even the most familiar numbers one result may be to send the listener back to ibsen s exhilarating and unstageable play \( it was n't , after all , written for stage performance \) with some strategies for a doityourself peer gynt these conductors , of course , are n't the first to venture beyond the eight movements of the composer s two peer gynt suites , those quintessential popsconcert confections but the lp editions , handsomely performed though they may have been , might best be described as suites plus for the most part , they merely painted pretty mood pictures on a somewhat larger scale true , in the lp editions the suite movements were performed in the order in which they occur in the play and vocal parts generally omitted in the suites were usually restored the bloodthirsty chorus of trolls in in the hall of the mountain king the celebratory chorus \( the prophet is come ! \) and mezzosoprano solo in the arabian dance the song in solveig s song , of which grieg made a purely orchestral arrangement for the second suite yet the suites plus listener hardly got a fair impression of the peer gynt music in what might be called the emi edition the same 12number sequence that john barbi rolli , mr blomstedt \( with the dresden state orchestra \) and neville marriner recorded for emi only 15 minutes of music was added to the roughly 33 of the suites \( all told , grieg wrote about 90 minutes' worth \) and one of the four added numbers does n't even belong to peer gynt the norwegian bridal procession , which johan halvorsen orchestrated for act i from a grieg piano piece , sounds bland and trivial alongside the music actually composed for the play another added number , the brief dance of the mountain king s daughter , was a source of unending concern to the composer , who decided against including it in the second suite he always worried that its exaggerated norwegianness would n't be understood as a parody tone in fact was a constant problem in those earlier peer gynt recordings lacking any contextual guideline , conductors tended to overplay everything slightly the act i prelude , at the wedding , would be overblown , as if it were a fullfledged overture rather than the first of five act preludes the pastoral fragrance of morning mood was italicized and so on this contributed to the common impression that grieg s music is too restricted in range to serve the play , with its almost bewildering diversity of tone it s even possible to expand beyond the emi edition and still misrepresent the music , through misleading textual choices and imposition of a uniform tone esapekka salonen , in his 63minute edition \( with the oslo philharmonic cbs mk 44528 cd \) , passes up all the extended dramatic scenes involving peer gynt himself , concentrating almost exclusively on folkish material that dopey bridal procession and the two brief fiddle solos in act i both the orchestral and the vocal versions of solveig s song \( although grieg bitterly opposed using both in performances of the play \) the lovely whitsun hymn in act v , and so on but to these mildmannered choices he brings a pervasively dark foreboding that , while surprising , is impressive it s no substitute , though , for real exploration of grieg s incidental music and just as in the shorter editions , peer himself all but vanishes from sight one great virtue of the masur concert edition is that it establishes a dramatic context for all the music mr masur s coarranger , friedhelm eberle , does a persuasive dual job as narrator and peer
the second new york international festival of the arts lasted half as long as the first festival three years ago , cost 3 million less and had only a third as many events but judging by an informal sampling of festival administrators , presenters , performers and devoted albeit weary audience members , this year s version was more successful than the previous , mammoth undertaking , which drew almost as much criticism as applause particularly in a time when we 're doing so much belttightening , the festival was very much a success , said barbara j fife , deputy mayor for planning and development , who was the festival s liaison with mayor david n dinkins i think it was good for new york the timing was particularly good for us , because it was a clear statement that new york is a destination point for the arts the festival ended its 16day run on sunday night , although a few festival productions , like that of the state theater of lithuania , are continuing the festival organizers had originally predicted that total attendance would be 300 , 000 , and that 150 , 000 to 175 , 000 tickets would be sold to more than 60 performingarts events from 23 countries at 28 sites the individual producers of each event have not yet forwarded ticketsales statistics to the festival , but based on verbal reports , overall attendance goals were achieved , festival organizers said i think that the audiences for artists and programs which had never been heard of before , by most new yorkers , exceeded all of our expectations , said martin e segal , chairman of the festival among the soldout events , according to the festival , were cole porter s 100th birthday celebration , pongsan maskeddance drama , immigrant voices , miss julie , a doll s house , compagnie philippe saire , the reduced shakespeare company , olodum and friends , muestra espanola la fura dels baus , compagnie philippe genty and cricot 2 tribute to tadeusz kantor no events were canceled after the festival began we did n't have any catastrophes of any kind , and we wound up in the black , mr segal said he meant that the 569 million cost of mounting the festival was more than covered by contributions from private sources the festival did not share in the boxoffice receipts from the events , which went to the individual producers none of the money came from the federal , state or city governments the general tenor of critical opinion has been that the festival was more selective in its artistic choices than in 1988 , and that the productions , overall , were of higher artistic quality for example , reviewers unanimously acclaimed the three productions directed by ingmar bergman that appeared at the brooklyn academy of music the united states premieres of his miss julie , a doll s house and long day s journey into night in terms of audience demand , overall enthusiasm , and critical response , we 've seen nothing like it here for years , said peter b carzasty , a spokesman for the brooklyn academy of music , which presented the bergman imports immigrant voices , a critically praised theatrical and musical evocation of the immigrant experience , was sold out on both of the nights that a circle line sightseeing boat delivered 750 passengers to ellis island not every event sold out , though we 're a little disappointed , said bernard gersten , executive producer of lincoln center theater in association with the joyce theater in manhattan , it presented uncle vanya and the square , as performed by the state theater of lithuania we 're under our boxoffice projections , he said , but we hope to pick it up in the next couple of weeks we 're getting really good word of mouth the company is performing at the joyce until july 7 a sore point tickets most of the criticism of the current festival centered around the lack of availability of tickets to soughtafter performances this was especially true of the cole porter tribute , a onenightonly affair the ascap salute to cabaret at the hotel pierre , and the bergmandirected dramas , whose cast members were unable to stay longer because they had prior commitments there were things that went wrong , too for example , the opening night production of immigrant voices was delayed so that the audience in the grand registry hall missed the full harbor fireworks display celebrating the return of the troops from the middle east on june 10 but if ticket scalpers' prices are any rough gauge of a festival s worth , the extravaganza was at times a stratospheric success for example , the june 9 musical revue at carnegie hall celebrating the 100th anniversary of cole porter s birth , found scalpers selling 100 tickets for 250 tickets for miss julie and a doll s house went for as much as 150 from scalpers outside the door a boost to the economy tickets to other events were n't scalped , but were in great demand nevertheless we never expected that our entire run would sell out , said reed martin , one of the three members of the reduced shakespeare company comedy troupe and thanks to the festival , we 've got another booking in new york , and we 're coming back next year mr segal said preliminary estimates showed that the festival had a positive economic impact on the city we 're going to be completing analyses that will calculate the secondary financial effect on the city in regard to tourism , hotel occupancy , restaurants , things like that the original plan was to have a festival every two years , but mr segal let three years lapse after the last festival to take enough time to adequately appraise the first festival , he said another festival in two years is a possibility , mr segal added on sunday night , the festival had its wrapup party , attended by a polyglot gaggle of several hundred performers , producers and staff members who gathered at laura belle , the manhattan night club we thank you all for what the festival has been , and what it will be in the future , said mr segal what the festival organizers hope it will be , in the future , is a predictable feature of manhattan s cultural life the idea that this can be a recurring event is a really good one , said ms fife , the deputy mayor if we institutionalize it in alternate years , it will develop a following and audience and a presence in other countries , so that they will begin to plan on coming here
on the surface , it looked as if westchester had a bit of good news when the latest unemployment figures were made public late last month the county s unemployment rate for october was 53 percent , down from 57 percent the month before the newest figures , released by the state department of labor , compared favorably with the 64 percent unemployment rate for the nation as a whole and the 69 percent rate for the state in october but labor analysts , looking behind the figures , paint a less than rosy economic picture for the county and the ranks of unemployed , standing in line to sign up for unemployment compensation and 13 weeks of extended benefits approved by congress last month , confirmed what the analysts were reading from the statistics the fact is , the analysts reported , the employment picture countywide is not promising despite october s dip in the jobless rate the trend , over the past year , is disheartening , they say , because the county s jobless rate increased 19 percentage points from the yearago figure of 34 percent figures are deceiving you do n't find the dramatic changes in the monthtomonth figures , lucille marcus , an analyst for the state department of labor in brooklyn , said one month it goes up a little , another month down the yeartoyear numbers tell the real story moreover , just looking at the unemployment rate can be deceiving the rate may have dipped in october , but the number of employed in the county also declined in a month when seasonal hiring for the holidays traditionally begins to pick up , ms marcus said also , the total labor force a figure that represents the number of employed and unemployed shrank , jeff weissentein , another state labor analyst , said the unemployment rate is computed by dividing the number of unemployed by the total number in the labor force when you have a decline in both categories , it tells us that some county residents are no longer looking for work , mr weissenstein said in other words , some people are dropping out of the labor force workers have stopped looking or as ms marcus described it , there are more discouraged workers , people who looked for work for quite a while and are n't looking any more during the recession of 198182 , westchester held steady while many nearby counties lost jobs , ms marcus said the county s job market , which began to grow strongly in 1976 , peaked in 1988 with 410 , 300 jobs after that , ms marcus said , the tinsel started getting a little thin in 1989 , there were 408 , 800 jobs , and by october of 1991 , only 393 , 300 the hurting , ms marcus said , is mainly in the construction and retail trade areas at the unemployment insurance office of the state department of labor in white plains recently , the lines were long and the mood somber some people filing for extended benefits talked openly of their situations others would speak only if their names were not published none , though , were optimistic that the downward trend in the jobless rate would reverse itself soon and all held out little hope for becoming gainfully employed again in the near future ginny mccormick , a former flight attendant for eastern airlines who was laid off in january , shrugged her shoulders and said philosophically , this is life now this is what s happening you ca n't take it personally i liked the work that i was doing a lot , and i miss it , she added but for now i'm going back to school and majoring in education in new york , anyone who takes approved training is eligible to receive an additional 26 weeks of unemployment benefits 'i do n't know where to turn' one man , a former vice president of sales and marketing for a heating products company , said he was earning six figures a year ago the man , who would not allow his name to be published , said he had applied for more than 100 positions in the last 12 months but despite his persistent efforts and a rewriting of his resume , he still has not found work i 've lost my job i 've lost my house , and i do n't know where to turn , he said i came from a place where people were always trying to recruit me away to a place now where nobody wants to talk to me another man , who also spoke on the condition that his name not be used , said he had been a construction worker for many years before being laid off three months ago it s so painful when someone wants to work and they ca n't find anything , he said it s a horrible feeling a woman who worked as a salesclerk for one of the county s major department stores said she was not optimistic about finding work again soon i think the whole country is suffering , she said everyone you talk to is worried you ca n't even look forward to the holidays maybe things will get better someday , but i think it s going to be a long while i'm an older worker , the woman added , and i doubt whether i will be able to enter the work force again two variables are declining the total labor force in the county for october was 451 , 900 , down from 457 , 400 in the previous month and from 459 , 659 in october 1990 the number of county residents who were employed in october was 427 , 700 , down from 431 , 500 the month before and 443 , 900 a year ago in october , the ranks of the unemployed totaled 24 , 100 , down from 25 , 900 a month ago and up from 15 , 800 a year ago using the aggregate labor force numbers , the state does some sampling to determine why workers are no longer seeking employment normally , mr weissenstein said , a monthly decline in the unemployment rate is good news in this case , it is not good news in a sense , it s a paradox but we have two variables declining the employed and the unemployed and those figures tell us a different story than just looking at ups or downs in the unemployment rate edward t walsh , an employment security manager in the white plains unemployment office , said that his office was seeing more outofwork whitecollar workers than in previous downturns things are very solemn these days , he said , especially among the whitecollar workers that group of workers is feeling a whole gamut of emotions , from anger , fear especially if they have children to support and depression , mr walsh said for them , their world has collapsed , because for many it s the first time , or at least the first time in many years , that they are out of a job four offices in the county there are four unemployment insurance offices in the county they are at 3 prospect street in yonkers , 5 prospect avenue in white plains , 145 north fifth avenue in mount vernon and 14 bank street in peekskill anyone who has worked fewer than four days in a week and earned no more than 280 before taxes in that week is eligible for benefits new applicants should take their social security card and another form of identification with them they should also take pay stubs from all employers they have worked for in the last 52 weeks mr walsh said that new applicants should avoid the early part of the week when lines are long applicanats will be able to get more personalized help from benefits workers when the earlyweek crowds thin out the amount they receive will be the same since benefits are paid retroactively phones ringing off the hook because of the increased numbers seeking unemployment benefits , the white plains office has had to hire additional staff members to handle the volume , and workers at the office report that the phones have been ringing off the hook it s been hectic since the recession started , mr walsh said at times , things get tense tempers are short we 're overworked since the emergency unemployment compensation act took effect last month , the white plains office has processed more than 1 , 000 claims , mr walsh said the labor department also provides counseling and referral services and will help applicants develop worksearch plans and write resumes photos people waiting in line at the unemployment office in white plains although the county s unemployment rate for october dropped below the september figure , labor analysts say the employment picture is not promising \( pg 1 \) edward t walsh , at white plains

in a case that medical ethicists and legal experts say is apparently a first , a minneapolis hospital plans to go to court for permission to turn off a patient s life support system against her family s wishes for eight months , 87yearold helga wanglie has lain in hennepin county medical center in a world created by modern medicine dependent on a ventilator for oxygen and a feeding tube for nutrition , unaware of and unresponsive to her surroundings her doctors say she will never recover and they do not want to give medical care that they describe as futile any life over death but mrs wanglie s husband and two children describe her as an extremely religious woman who would prefer even this life to death this is the opposite of cruzan , said arthur caplan , director of the center for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota , referring to nancy cruzan , the missouri woman whose family fought for years to remove her from the feeding tube that was keeping her alive over the objections of the state hospital where miss cruzan lived in a vegetative coma , the tube was removed and she died last month we 've all worked long and hard for the patient s right to say stop , said susan m wolf , an associate for law at the hastings center , a research center for biomedical ethics in briarcliff , ny that leaves the lurking question of whether it s a symmetrical issue and they also have the right to say do everything indefinitely , even when the doctors believe it s futile it is a rare terminationofcare case of any kind that reaches the courtroom decisions to withdraw medical technology are made daily around the country the american hospital association estimates that 70 percent of hospital deaths are preceded by a decision to stop some form of care yet dr caplan said he knew of no more than 40 state court opinions about ending care it is even rarer that a dispute finds the doctors arguing for withdrawal of life support against the wishes of the patient s family none of those 40 address that situation , he said if there is such a case , it s the exception ms wolf agreed maybe one other case has been reported where this kind of role reversal took place , she said , but she added that she was not familar with one the reason there are few court cases of this type , experts say , is because doctors are reluctant to publicly advocate the death of a patient dr eugene boisaubin , an emergency room doctor who is head of the biomedical ethics consultation service at the methodist hospital in houston , said circumstances similar to those of the wanglie family arose regularly he estimates that 95 percent of the disagreements can be resolved with talking and time in the other 5 percent of cases , he said , we do what the family wants , even though it goes against our medical judgment we do know that the patient will die , but not until weeks or months later until this , no one had the guts to go to court he said that he had heard of hospitals choosing to override the family and disconnect life support without a court order , he said but that his hospital had never chosen to do so it began with fractured hip the case that hennepin county medical center plans to take to court began on dec 14 , 1989 , when mrs wanglie tripped on a scatter rug in her hallway and fractured her right hip she was taken to a private hospital near her home where she underwent surgery the next month she developed breathing problems and was transferred to the hennepin county medical center , where she was placed on a respirator she stayed there for five months , fully conscious and alert , writing notes to her doctors and her husband , oliver , since the breathing tube down her throat prevented her from speaking in may she was weaned from her respirator and transferred to a longterm care institution across the river in st paul she had been in the institution for less than a week when her heartbeat and breathing stopped suddenly by the time she could be resuscitated she had suffered severe brain damage and was transferred back to hennepin county medical center in a vegetative state she does n't know anybody or anything , said mr wanglie , 86 , a retired minneapolis lawyer he and his children , ruth , 48 , and david , 45 , visit two or three times a week , he said they stay about a half an hour and talk to the nurses about mrs wanglie s condition , but they do not talk to his wife , he said , because she would n't even know we were there mr wanglie said the doctors caring for his wife first raised the question of turning off her ventilator in late may at a meeting in a hospital conference room , he said , the family vehemently objected he told the doctors that his wife of 53 years would have wanted to live mrs wanglie , a retired school teacher , is the daughter of a lutheran minister and she has strong religious convictions , her husband said in an interview we talked about this a year ago if anything happened to her , she said , she wants everything done she told me , 'only he who gave life has the right to take life , ' mr wanglie said of a discussion he had with his wife before her fall he said she had never put those thoughts into writing it seems to me they 're trying to play god , mr wanglie said who are they to determine who s to die and who s to live \? i take the position that as long as her heart is beating there s life there
the next six weeks of christmas shopping will be critical to the sales of many retailers , but none more so than mailorder catalogue merchants while department stores generate up to 50 percent of their profits in the final two months of the year , many cataloguers count on the same period for 60 percent to 75 percent of their earnings the holiday season is going to mean the difference between profit and loss for most of the cataloguers this year , said robert f delay , an expert on the mailorder business this year is terribly important because things have been so flat hoping to put shoppers in the buying mood , spiegel and some other mailorder companies sent out their christmas catalogue weeks earlier than usual experts say some companies are also likely to resend their catalogues , with new covers , after thanksgiving cataloguers are also emphasizing their discounted merchandise and promising to deliver products in time for christmas , even if orders are placed in late december for much of the 1980 s , mailorder sales grew by about 15 percent a year that was triple the growth rate of most department stores and other retailers that depend on facetoface sales but the bleak economy and rising costs have caught up with many catalogue companies the good news , at least for consumers , is lower prices from a few companies and a reduction in the 12 billion or so catalogues stuffed annually into the nation s mailboxes mailorder experts say that weaker companies are starting to be weeded out some merging with larger ones , others folding altogether most survivors will have to cope with permanently lower profit margins , analysts and industry executives say as if the tough retailing climate were not enough , the catalogue companies have also been hit by a confluence of cost increases imposed by the united states postal service , which delivers the catalogues , and by shippers like united parcel service that deliver the goods even harder blows may yet land the industry is feeling pressure from courts and state legislatures on issues that range from sales taxes to proposed privacy laws that would make it hard to send catalogues to people who did not request them most catalogue companies do not charge sales tax to customers who live outside the state or states where the company has offices but revenuehungry states are trying to change that the various rising costs could have some impact on the basic economics of the industry , said richard c anderson , chief executive of lands' end inc , a mailorder retailer based in dodgeville , wis with these fierce price increases , it becomes rather difficult to survive if you are a smaller company 'a question of size' the recent casualties include royal silk ltd , which had offered popular moderately priced silk apparel through its catalogue the company went out of business this summer after a costly expansion into retail stores sensing opportunity in the industry s plight , montgomery ward company said last month that it planned to reenter the mailorder business with a line of speciality catalogues company executives said the pressures on weaker players made it perfect timing to start the new business in this business , it s very much a question of size , said sharon e rappaport , an analyst with morgan stanley company it s all dependent on volume , she said the larger you are , the better you are able to take advantage of discounts , in postal rates and buying merchandise mining the niches but size is not everything two of the nation s largest cataloguers , sears , roebuck company and the j c penney company are struggling to breathe life into their big book catalogues , which try to be many things to many people several companies , however , are doing a brisk business in more narrowly focused areas a freshflower catalogue , calyx corolla , for example , is attracting a lot of attention and customers with its offerings of orchids , anthuriams and birds of paradise children s clothing is another hot area hanna andersson , a portland , ore , cataloguer that specializes in cotton clothing made in sweden , is attracting legions of parents not all successful catalogues are aimed at the affluent fingerhut companies , based in minnetonka , minn , is growing quickly by selling a wide range of goods on credit , primarily to lowerincome families analysts said there is no true catalogue equivalent of the discount stores , which have revolutionized retailing by offering namebrand merchandise at lower prices than are found in department stores but the new ward venture , analysts said , may be taking aim at that market and other mailorder merchants , including lands' end , have been placing added emphasis on their lowerpriced offerings and beefing up sections that feature discounted goods the current cost pressures are forcing companies to alter their basic approach to the business in april , after much agonizing , l l bean inc reversed a 79year tradition of free shipping and began charging its catalogue customers a 350 fee for each order
hundreds of thousands of apartment dwellers in new york city and on long island awoke yesterday to life without doormen , security guards , porters , elevator operators and concierges , as 30 , 000 building services workers went on strike residents of about 2 , 500 buildings more than half of them in manhattan scrambled to cope with the loss of those who tote garbage from chutes to sidewalks , screen visitors , keep an eye on elderly tenants and ferry people between floors , while the striking workers carried red and white picket signs in a steady rain the workers , members of local 32b32j of the service employees international union , provide services at rental , cooperative and condominium apartment buildings the president of the local , gus benova , announced the walkout shortly after midnight as the threeyear contract with building owners expired and after talks stalled , mainly over wage increases service employees last went on strike in 1979 , for a week police report no incidents the strike does not affect commercial buildings or housing projects operated by the new york city housing authority the police department said the first day of the strike went without incident there were no reports of security problems or vandalism and no emergency calls from elderly residents , said detective joseph k mcconville , a police spokesman some tenants expressed sympathy with the strikers , but others were frustrated as they began to change their daily routines to cope with the strike the physical maintenance of the building will be the biggest trouble , said alfred kahn , a 30yearold resident and coop board member at 771 west end avenue , a 77unit building between 97th and 98th streets he said that residents who had volunteered were watching the front entrance and opening the door as people arrived , but that no one was helping to hail cabs up the block at 801 west end avenue , john corcoran , the superintendent of the 93unit coop , was concerned about what he was going to do when the mail began arriving this morning that s going to be the biggest problem , he said although residents have volunteered to sort the mail , they will not have the time to make doortodoor deliveries as the building employees did , mr corcoran said mr benova , the union chief , said the parties were unable to reach an agreement after representatives of the building owners offered what he called a wage increase of 2 percent a year over three years and no improvements in other areas of the contract its a damn shame that the workers who do such a great job for apartment house residents have to resort to a strike to get a fair shake , mr benova said the owners' representatives , the realty advisory board on labor relations , said last night that no new talks had been held and that none were scheduled they declined to discuss details of their proposal wages and benefits 'gut issues' a spokesman for the realty advisory board , jim grossman , said , the gut issues are wages and benefits he said the union had also demanded a reduced workweek and an increase in holidays and vacation time according to the realty advisory board , the doormen , elevator operators , porters and other service employees receive 46273 a week under the contract that took effect in 1988 handymen make 503 a week neither side has discussed its own contract issues in any detail but mr grossman said the union , in an effort to break the solidarity of the realty group , was offering to sign separate agreements with individual owners , in which the workers would receive wage and benefit increases totaling 6 1 2 percent a year , plus an additional holiday he said the separate offers called for a wage increase of 23 in the first year , 22 in the second and 26 in the third most buildings have budgeted for an average incease of 5 percent a year for service employees , an official close to the realty board said anger and concern from pickets several hundred other apartment buildings are covered by a separate contract with the union due to expire on june 20 any settlement reached in the current dispute would be expected to set the basis for any later agreements the union represents workers in parts of nassau and suffolk counties and in all the boroughs but the bronx , which is represented by another union the picketing workers expressed anger yesterday at the owners , but also concern for the tenants and fear that they faced a long strike the tenants are behind us , but the landlords want us to make ridiculous concessions that we just ca n't make , said richard vrana , a doorman on strike in front of 315 west 57th street , between eighth and ninth avenues i think it s going to be a long one the tenants are going to have to worry about their security with no security guard , anyone can get in i hope they are very careful security , but less service many of the buildings had arranged for private security guards in the event of a strike but unlike many union employees who provide services for tenants like helping with packages and taking messages , private guards do not toni knox , who moved into 322 west 57th street , a 50story rental building , two weeks ago , said she did not know what to do with her garbage the people in the building said they were going to give us garbage bags , but when i went and asked for one , they did n't have any , she said i think we 're supposed to carry the garbage out to the street she said the incinerator rooms in the building had notices posted on the doors saying , temporarily closed four strikers wearing red and white union sandwich boards stood hunched against the rain under the entrance canopy at 211 west 56th street , talking with david espent , a resident of the building if this strike lasts for a day or two , it will have a minimal effect on me , mr espent said but if it lasts for a long period of time , it could hurt these guys control access to the building anyone can get in without them on duty they also clean up all over the place the garbage , the halls , the lobby it could get to be a mess at the columbia , a 302unit condominium at 275 west 96th street , at broadway , residents prepared yesterday for a longer strike residents volunteer as guards volunteers had set up a table in the lobby and were handing out identification cards that tenants will have to use to enter the building they were also signing up residents for shifts as security guards it s going to be very , very inconvenient , said cathy liu , as she added her access card to the collection of identification cards in her wallet i'm sure everybody will agree to help because we want to make the bulding safe but it s going to take a while to notify everyone she signed up for lobby duty on wednesday outside the columbia , which opened in 1983 , striking workers stood in the rain and discussed their own concerns they want to take away the concierge , the maintenance people , all of us , said peter m marrera , a 35yearold senior concierge who has worked at the building for seven years he said the building s management planned to eliminate the jobs of two of its 16 workers and to reduce several other fulltime jobs to part time it does n't look good , said john gonzalez , the doorman at the columbia i'm willing to sit this out as long as possible , and i expect to be here for a while photos

workers volunteers at the columbia , a condominium on west 96th street , set up a table to distribute cards to be used by tenants entering the building and to sign up residents for shifts as security

the riddle of power presidential leadership from truman to bush by robert shogan 352 pages dutton 2195 since franklin d roosevelt , whom most historians rank among the handful of greats in the history of the republic , the united states has had nine presidents truman , eisenhower , kennedy , johnson , nixon , ford , carter , reagan and bush have any of them approached roosevelt in stature and public affection or attained similar success in both foreign and domestic affairs \? the sad conclusion of robert shogan in the riddle of power is no the author , a veteran political correspondent in washington for the los angeles times , writes our recent presidents , of both parties , have led us down a road pitted with broken promises and misguided endeavors their combined performances have forced us to wonder what it takes to achieve success in the white house and how we should go about choosing a chief executive to lead the nation through the twilight years of this century and prepare it for the next millennium mr shogan withholds judgment on george bush s presidency he finds it too soon to call even though politicians and pollsters immediately linked the successful war in the persian gulf to mr bush s chance for reelection in 1992 he does , however , comment on the last presidential election as the election of george bush in 1988 demonstrated only too well , presidential campaigns have become a vicious , empty competition , dominated by mudslinging , evasion and deceit the substantive value of that election can be judged by what is best remembered now from the republican side , bush s mindless and ultimately hollow injunction to read his lips , and from the democratic side , lloyd bentsen s disparaging suggestion to j danforth quayle that he was not john kennedy mr shogan writes that regardless of the outcome of the war in the middle east \( his book went to press before desert shield turned into desert storm \) , the success or failure of the 41st president will still depend on how he responds to two major challenges at home , he will need to reinvigorate the country s economy abroad , he will have to define a new role for the country in a changing world in both instances , the author says , if bush is to rally public support he must establish a strong identity for himself and a clear direction for his presidency , so that he can govern by actions , not reactions the author makes it easy for the reader to follow his standards of success or failure for each of the presidencies by setting up three criteria ideology , values and character none of the presidents since roosevelt get top grades on all three tests americans who retain a memory of several or all of them , probably base their views on which lever they pulled in the voting booth the author passes around praise where due , but also notes that some of the nine did nothing significant domestically , that others did too much militarily , and that at least one \( richard nixon , because of watergate \) came close to impeachment and another \( ronald reagan , because of irancontra \) became vulnerable to it the riddle of power is filled with presidential anecdotes , many involving exchanges with the author himself during his three decades of political coverage once during the nixon presidency , as former president truman sat around with a group of correspondents , he was asked to evaluate richard nixon truman demurred , saying , there is a lady present mr shogan asked him if he could clean up his answer truman replied no every time anything is said about him now it just means another headline for him it gives him a chance to get out on the front page during the nixonkennedy race in 1960 , mr shogan was working for the miami news many voters found the idea of kennedy as president difficult to accept because his credentials were slim and because his age , 43 , made him seem callow and opportunistic , the author says when it finally became clear that kennedy had indeed eked out a narrow victory , he writes , the news editor at the paper suggested a headline that would have summed up the widespread doubts about his candidacy and presidency 'it s a boy ! ' one of the merits of this book is that it turns our minds to a chunk of time in this century , 19451990 , when the postwar dream and the cold war terror collided and fused as one goes down the list of presidents who succeeded roosevelt , it s interesting to note that almost every one of the nine was entangled in small or large military conflicts some inherited , some of their own making these include korea , lebanon , cuba , vietnam , grenada , panama and the persian gulf , not to mention covert and proxy wars like irancontra during the reagan administration in a preface to a revised edition of his classic study of the modern presidency , presidential power , richard e neustadt wrote that presidential weakness was the underlying theme of his book one of the points mr shogan makes is that the presidency has become so complex a job that even if a president is n't weak when he enters the white house , he discovers that he cannot simply give orders to a chief of staff or try to do the job himself and expect that results will follow growth has made it harder to control the federal bureaucracy and a president must still answer to congress as a respected newspaperman , mr shogan tries not to abandon his objectivity , but he admits that he allows his opinions to come out in this book on the evidence presented here and elsewhere , most of these presidents were far too ordinary to perform brilliantly in an extraordinary job on balance , the riddle of power is a lively and straightforward primer on leadership , but it still leaves open the question why potentially great presidents cannot be discovered , nominated and elected that s still a riddle photo robert shogan \( al stephenson dutton \)
nbc was still the no 1 network last week when the chief architect of its six years of primetime leadership , brandon tartikoff , announced that he was leaving network television to run a movie studio eleven years earlier , when mr tartikoff began running the nbc entertainment division , the network was in a shambles a distant , hopeless third in the ratings , the joke of the television industry the punchline is that nbc s ratings in the 197980 television season were 40 percent higher than what the network scored when it won the ratings race this season no television executive has ever enjoyed the reputation that mr tartikoff fashioned for himself in pulling nbc out of the ratings cellar in the early 1980 s and none is likely to have it ever again , several industry executives said after mr tartikoff s appointment as the new chairman of paramount pictures although that lofty assessment of mr tartikoff s abilities is widely held in hollywood , nbc has seen its ratings plunge in the last two seasons even as mr tartikoff was continuing to choose the programs brandon is a brilliant guy , said one senior nbc executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity , but we 've been going down the past two years with the same guy flying the plane still , the television business especially the power and position of the broadcast networks has so fundamentally changed that most executives believe no network programmer can ever again have as much longterm impact as mr tartikoff had indeed , although mr tartikoff said last week that someone with vision could still have impact , he added that they would have to have the resources and support i got when mr tartikoff took charge of nbc s programming in january 1980 , the only limits on his prospects were his own creative abilities now , mr tartikoff said , the job is defined by its limits these include limited ratings expectations because of all the new channels competing for viewers limited margin for error because of the diminished network reach limited patience from new corporate managers with no broadcasting background , and limited profits , leading to limited budgets no longer a shock think about this , mr tartikoff said in a telephone interview from his nbc office in burbank , calif in my first year as president of entertainment , nbc had only 48 million in profits that was considered shocking , that a network could be that close to breaking even now it is commonplace to think that two networks could get through a year and not make any money indeed , cbs lost money last year and expects to post a loss for the current television year the changes have mainly to do with two factors , mr tartikoff said the power shift away from the networks and the overall economics of the business the television landscape has been reconfigured in the last decade , he said in 1980 , cable had not hit criticial mass neither had vcr s there was no fox network the last decade saw the emergence of cable stations like the espn sports channel and turner network television as the percentage of households with cable television roughly tripled to about 60 percent in addition , syndicated programs proliferated on independent broadcast stations 'last colossus of programming' even in the lesscrowded television arena of 1980 , mr tartikoff was not an overnight success tartikoff was the last colossus of programming , a senior industry executive said that s gone forever there s no patience left in the business brandon had two and a half rough years nobody could afford to be that patient with a program executive now indeed , nbc s slide in the ratings grew so steep between mr tartikoff s first season and 1983 that managers for nbc s affiliated stations pressed for him to be discharged but grant tinker , then nbc s chairman , had complete faith in mr tartikoff s talent and complete patience with the difficult situation he was then facing mr tinker shrugged off the complaints of the affiliates mr tartikoff said , i had grant tinker supporting me and fred silverman teaching me mr silverman had been the original giant of network programming , having pushed first cbs and then abc to the top of the ratings before he became corporate president of nbc but that quality of talent is not evident at the networks today instead , mr tartikoff said , the networks have all these numberscrunchers considering how to save money by cutting back on the network service in prime time he added , that was unheard of 10 years ago so was putting on programs purely because they are cheap to produce , as the networks do now with the spate of socalled reality shows moving into prime time does the world really need 'true detective' and 'american detective' in the same season \? mr tartikoff asked with programs now costing so much more to produce , some formats are all but closed to programmers , he said nobody makes 'the ateam' anymore , mr tartikoff said nobody makes actionadventure anymore because it costs too much and it does n't sell in syndication producers do n't want to do an hour show for you anymore the diversity is not what it used to be best writers and producers mr tartikoff revived nbc s fortunes in the 1980 s by recruiting the best writing and producing talent , and giving them good time periods and plenty of time to make a program work that strategy is commonplace now , too , mr tartikoff said and it has helped drive the costs up the best writerproducers like steven bochco \( hill street blues , la law \) and james brooks \( the simpsons \) now make longterm expensive deals , which include commitments for shows to get on the air people get commitments for three or five series on the air , mr tartikoff said he noted that linda bloodworth , the writer of designing women , received five commitments from cbs she s good , but that means she s crowding out somebody else , he said maybe she s going to crowd out the next steven bochco from getting an opportunity on your schedule abc has made a lot of these commitments they are almost in the position we found ourselves in at nbc when we had all this heavyhitting talent lined up you start locking yourself in , and then you start cutting loose other talented people new economic realities later this month , mr tartikoff will give a speech that lays out his strategy for dealing with the new economic realities facing television programmers we ca n't keep doing business the way we did 10 years ago , he said instead of letting the corporate beancounters come up with ideas like cutting the budget for developing series by 20 percent , we have to start asking ourselves if we can do the same programming job with 10 people instead of 30 mr tartikoff said he would have moved nbc in that direction if he had stayed last year , he said he hoped that before he left the network , he would have restored nbc to dominance in the 1990 s as he had in the 1980 s , retiring undefeated i guess i'm not quite going out like sandy koufax , he said last week this is more like koufax going out with a 1514 season graph the tartikoff era at nbc shows changes in networka ratings 11year season during tartikoff s reign as president of nbc entertainment from '79 '90 \( source ac nielsen company \) \( pg d10 \)
there is an old saw in the magazine industry that the death of every great magazine is preceded by a redesign a less wellarticulated saying , however , is that many a magazine might still be around if someone had redesigned it before the death throes set in with that in mind , time magazine is embarking on a big redesign although no one is suggesting that the 68yearold publication is in danger of its life but in the fiercely competitive world of news , the players keep increasing , the level of play keeps getting better and standing still is tantamount to losing ground you have to figure out what it is that news magazines have to offer that is going to make them interesting and full of energy and full of all of the reasons that people buy magazines , a time editor said the redesign project , which was started last fall , is being conducted in secrecy by a small team under the direction of the managing editor , henry muller , and the art director , rudolph c hoglund about two months ago , the team of editors and graphic artists came up with a very tentative prototype of a redesigned magazine , which was shown to some top editors it s really been kind of exploratory all we were doing was showing a very imperfect version to each other , said a senior executive who spoke on the condition that he not be indentified none of us is satisfied yet , and it s not ready to show others it s undoubtedly going back to the drawing board the executive said the redesigned magazine would probably not appear for six months to a year last week , the time inc magazine company announced drastic staff reductions for six of its big magazines , including time , which is expected to lose 44 editorial employees reginald k brack jr , the chairman , president and chief executive of time warner publishing , said the redesign of time was in no way related to the layoffs , a point repeated emphatically by many other people at the magazine still , the new time magazine will obviously be designed so it can be produced by a smaller staff walter bernard , a former art director at time who oversaw the last redesign of the magazine in 1977 , said he and his partner , milton glaser , had been called in as advisers to mr hoglund and his team on the current redesign mr bernard said discussions about revitalizing the magazine had been under way ever since mr muller became time s managing editor four years ago what henry muller instituted is ongoing to begin thinking with rudy and others what time should be in the 1990 s , mr bernard said the designers did not just go off and redesign time what henry and rudy did was have a group effort with editors and designers and talk about how to improve the magazine mr bernard described the prototype that had been shown to top editors as not even a dummy just a direction and a proposal a loose grouping of the pages , more like a work in progress no one who has seen the prototype will talk about it as a result , rumors about it have been flying throughout the magazine the general agreement seems to be that the new design will bring a great deal of energy and flexibility to the magazine a certain nimbleness , as one editor put it here is an unverified version of what some people at time are saying the magazine will be divided into three parts the first would include news summaries short pieces that would chronicle the week s news someone had heard that the section might be entitled last week these would basically be reverting to the original time magazine of many years ago , an editor said the third part of the magazine would include movie , television and theater reviews it is unclear whether they would be the same length as the news summaries or a combination of short and long articles it is the second or middle part of the magazine that is still being debated fiercely , a number of people said it will include substantial articles and presumably have a certain amount of flexibility that would allow for some longer pieces and some shorter ones some very opinionated pieces and some harder news pieces for instance , the coup in the soviet union might be reported in a long , analytical piece in this section one of mr muller s innovations is letting writers speak in their own voice in other words , some articles tell the reader how a writer thinks about a subject many time employees assume that such opinion pieces will continued to be encouraged henry is adamant about not having rehash , an editor said you have to bring voice , attitude , opinion i do n't think the redesign would diverge very much from the kind of thing we run now on the other hand , the senior executive who has seen the work in progress warned against assuming that the middle section of the magazine would be essayish the 1977 redesign involved mostly graphic changes , which brought a torrent of letters from readers who simply did not like it the current redesign will have much more to do with the content and core of the magazine in any case , the redesign of a magazine is a process fraught with peril but the only thing more dangerous than redesigning a magazine may well be not redesigning it it s like walking a thin line , another editor said it s absolutely crucial that you not destroy this magazine s identity at the same time that it refreshes itself drawing
to the editor in the forced evictions of new york city s homeless from tompkins square park and now from the shantytowns on three cityowned lots of the lower east side called dinkinsville \( news article , oct 16 \) , the city is pushing people from their homes , instead of providing homes for the poorest of our people there are enough empty cityowned housing units to house every homeless person in the city let us provide people with homes , instead of wasting money on militarystyle evictions when i was in south africa last year , i saw much the same tactics used against squatters in soweto and other townships to close tompkins square park and squatter camps without providing adequate homes for those who have none is immoral the leadership of the city s churches has over and over asked mayor david n dinkins and his predecessor , edward i koch , to provide our homeless with real homes , instead of shelters , jail and forced evictions it is bad enough that city budget cuts favor the rich and slash social services and selfempowerment programs now the mayor is driving the poorest of the poor into the streets , with no plan for permanent housing \( rev \) michael s kendall archdeacon of new york city ny diocese of the episcopal church new york , oct 21 , 1991
it is the quiet trends that sneak up on markets , noticed by too many analysts only when it is too late the trend of the 1990 s , it appears , may be the return of the individual investor the reason for that return the disappointment over plunging interest rates is obvious , but longterm trends often get washed out by the excitement of the moment only now is it becoming clear just how pervasive the trend became in 1991 we 've just had a terrific year , said leslie quick 3d , president of quick reilly , the no 2 discount broker even when the market dipped in the early fall , our new account numbers were still up what s more , mr quick estimates , 60 percent of individual stock orders this year have been buys , compared with a 5050 split in 1990 the excitement has even reached a group of small investors long forgotten on wall street , the oddlotters who trade less than 100 shares at a time they used to be carefully watched for a clue as to what the public was doing but with the end of fixed commissions , trading an odd lot became very expensive , and purchases dried up for years , the oddlotters were heavy net sellers as they unloaded shares received from dividends , employee plans and aunt mabel s will in an era of institutional investing , the oddlotters were ignored but laszlo birinyi , whose birinyi associates tracks all manner of market indicators , has spotted a big change there have been 88 trading sessions in 1991 in which the oddlotters were net buyers , compared with none as recently as 1986 the oddlotters are not , of course , the main impetus stock mutual funds have pulled in record amounts of cash from investors , and as the year ends , the news is getting even better christmas week is supposed to be quiet , but mutual funds made it extraordinarily active there were rumors that fidelity investments , the largest of the mutual fund companies , was buying everything in sight , as one trader put it fidelity wo n't admit to such a lack of discrimination , but it does n't deny the thrust of the rumor the flow of money coming in in the last week or two has more than tripled the pace of earlier this month , said george vanderheiden , who oversees fidelity s 30 billion in growth stock funds added to that has been a flow of cash from fund managers , who now see no reason to keep big cash reserves the bull stampede last week pushed the dow jones industrial average up 16704 points , or 57 percent , to a record 3 , 10192 it was the market s best week ever in points , and the largest percentage gain since midjanuary cynics will recall that back in january the market also thought it saw an economic recovery to contrarians , all that sounds scary but mr birinyi , seeing a longterm trend , remains bullish fidelity , which hopes he is right , got gallup to ask americans if they had taken investment action to deal with lower interest rates only one in five said they had so far
congress has written new laws to insure that some of the lowerpriced homes seized in the savings and loan debacle are sold to lowincome families calling it the silver lining of the savings and loan foreclosures , congress set up a program to accomplish this in 1989 but so far many of the properties have gone instead to buyers with higher incomes , large corporations like the general electric company , or rich real estate developers in some cases , condos in resort towns , not college towns , have gone to college students whose parents put up the money but it is not at all clear that the program will work under the new laws any better than they did under the old the resolution trust corporationremains torn between the same conflicting desires to help the poor but also to earn as much money as possible for the government housing advocates say the agency still has enormous discretion to act as it sees fit and that its inclination has generally been to make it much more difficult for poorer buyers than for developers or private corporations to acquire the available houses or apartment complexes a lot will depend on the rtc s willingness , said barbara thompson , director of government affairs of the council of state housing agencies and their track record has n't been strong last month as congress debated the changes , the housing advocates point out , property sold at a wellpublicized resolution trust auction in texas went to rich developers while nonprofit housing corporations walked away emptyhanded for its part , resolution trust acknowledges that problems have existed in carrying out the affordablehousing program as congress intended but pledges to do better stephen s allen , the program s director , insists , we have a lot of new latitude and we will be aggressive if resolution trust does not act with greater concern for lowincome families , representative barney frank , the massachusetts democrat who pushed the new affordablehousing provisions last month , says he will ask congress to mandate what provisions to leave to the agency s discretion among other things , the new provisions permit , but do not require , the agency to negotiate directly with nonprofit buyers rather than have them bid against private developers to help prevent real estate speculation , buyers who sell their homes within a year will have to return 75 percent of any profits to resolution trust the changes require buyers of apartment complexes to set aside more units for the poor , bring into the program thousands of additional properties seized from failed banks as well , make financing easier for buyers , empower resolution trust to negotiate directly with nonprofit groups and permit it to donate houses and apartment complexes directly to state housing agencies this year , the agency has sold 6 , 300 of the 21 , 000 homes in its inventory and more are coming in every day , but critics are still skeptical that lowincome families will get many of them housing subsidies for the middle class i do n't believe a substantial number of homes are going to end up being occupied by lowerincome families , said john j henneberger , head of the texas low income housing information service the rtc is basically operating a middleincome housing subsidy program here for instance , housing advocates point to 8 , 000 properties for sale in texas , where college students have been buying condos , sometimes for as little as 12 , 000 in resort towns at a recent auction of 1 , 000 texas properties , nearly half were bought by oneperson households resolution trust is debating whether to allow this situation to continue but , barry wides , the agency s financing coordinator , said in a recent interview that the regulations never state we can exclude students they fall within our income limits houses in the program are limited to those with an appraised value below 67 , 500 and are reserved for buyers whose household income falls below 115 percent of the area s median income these houses are reserved for qualified households for a 90day period 180 days under the new law and , if not sold , are offered on the open market wellheeled buyers qualify easily but determined buyers who hardly appear poor can slip through for instance , in rockport , tex , a gulf coast town , l e casterline , a director of the first national bank of rockport and a partner in a real estate firm that does business with resolution trust , was able to qualify as a lowincome buyer and submit the winning bid for a condo adjacent to the country club of which he is a founding member mr casterline , who lives with his wife in a house they own , reports an income of only 21 , 000 he said resolution trust never looked into his assets besides , he said his wife and sons , who have taken over his shrimping business , had assets , but he did not i went in , and the rtc qualified me , so i bid , mr casterline said i had n't made any money and my tax returns show that teresa mcusick , a spokeswoman for resolution trust , said the agency was investigating mr casterline s eligibility and added that up to 5 percent of the bids in that auction might have been ineligible she conceded , however , that the agency did not look at a person s net worth , only income , and that it had no enforcement powers , only the ability to stop a sale
six children died early yesterday morning after a fire tore through their twostory home in upstate new york a 14yearold boy who was babysitting them was the only one to escape alive the boy , who was sleeping when the fire broke out , tried to run upstairs to rescue the children but was forced back by the flames , said les congdon , a firefighterparamedic who helped fight the blaze in little falls , ny firefighters in little falls were called to the home at 1 30 am , by the boy , who had run to a neighbor s house , mr congdon said the children s mother , 30yearold sheila mcleod , was out of town during the fire , said sgt tom rathbun of the little falls police the children had different fathers , both of whom were also away , sergeant rathbun said sergeant rathbun said investigators have pretty much ruled out arson he said , it appears to be accidental in nature some of the children , aged 1 to 10 , were still in their beds when firefighters wearing air packs entered the brownshingled , woodframe house other children were found in the hallways , apparently having tried to escape before smoke overwhelmed them , mr congdon said none were breathing , and they were pronounced dead about an hour later at the little falls hospital little falls is a city of 6 , 000 about 20 miles east of utica , in herkimer county none of the 30 firefighters who fought the blaze was injured , said mr congdon but he added , mentally , nobody s doing well
los angeles , nov 9 at the mere mention of the rose bowl , the players from the university of washington seemed to shudder collectively today but their coach , don james , smiled broadly and knowingly it s always been my dream , ever since i came into this league 17 years ago , to go to the rose bowl and be 110 when we got there , said james we 're a little closer to it now close was how the huskies played southern cal at the los angeles coliseum they scored twice in the first half , then did n't score again and beat the trojans , 143 , extending their record to 90 and 60 in the pacific10 conference washington , ranked no 1 by the new york times computer , still has two games to play against oregon state and washington state but is n't likely to lose before jan 1 and its expected rose bowl date against the big ten champion even so , none of james s players wanted to think about it we 're just thinking game by game , said tailback beno bryant , who ran for 158 yards in 26 carries and scored both touchdowns you can ask me that question again in a couple of weeks the loss left southern california with a 36 record , assuring the trojans of only their second losing season in the last 30 years but in some ways , they played well , forcing three turnovers on defense and gaining 305 yards on offense if we played like that all year on defense , coach larry smith said , there s no question we 'd have won six games or so by now fourth straight loss instead , southern cal lost its fourth in a row , its longest losing streak since 1975 , and now cannot go to a bowl game its only hope was to upset washington and win its last three games , but there was little chance against a huskies defense that has now held six of its nine opponents to seven or fewer points the huskies had one interception and five sacks that totaled 37 yards reggie perry , the trojans' starting quarterback , was continually rushed into passes and usually threw long attempting to avoid a crush of tacklers by the third quarter , smith brought in freshman rob johnson to replace perry i think they showed a lot of respect for us and for steve emtman by trying to take their runs to the outside , said washington linebacker dave hoffman big men on defense emtman , the huskies' defensive tackle and a preseason allamerican , had 5 tackles , but hoffman had 10 , including 6 that were unassisted he also added 2 sacks for 20 yards they have great athletes , great quickness , and they keep coming at you , said smith they bent today , but they did n't break in one sense , southern cal must have felt fortunate to be behind by only 14 points at halftime in another , perhaps the trojans believed they should have been a lot closer their first drive of the day ended with a failed fieldgoal attempt their last drive of the half ended with an interception , perry throwing into the arms of washington safety shane pahukoa in the end zone instead of his intended receiver , curtis conway taking long drives in between , the huskies , who ended a fourgame losing streak at the coliseum to southern cal , marched easily down the field their two scoring drives , one in each quarter , consumed 80 and 70 yards another fell short when stephon pace intercepted a pass from billy joe hobert at the trojan 11 but washington still had an early lead when bryant , who attended dorsey high school just five miles from here , broke off a 55yard touchdown run through the southern cal defense in the second quarter , the huskies consumed 6 minutes and 12 plays , scoring when bryant ran the last 7 yards the drive was kept alive with the help of a fake punt on a fourth down at the trojans' 38 fullback matt jones took the snap and ran around the right side for a first down , and six plays later , bryant was in afterward , bryant said that southern cal attempted to recruit him to play wide receiver when he told them that he was a running back , he said , they never called again washington did and i'm glad i came here , he said
the current recession may be the first in memory that can be attributed to a case of nerves and now that confidence has come roaring back , signs are that an economic recovery is not far behind but will the recovery be nearly as strong as the dramatic lift in consumer spirits \? while other recessions since world war ii resulted from knockout blows to income , like the 1973 arab oil embargo , or overexuberant business and consumer spending , or blundering economic policy makers , this one seems to have started when the persian gulf crisis last august shook americans' confidence in prospects for business and jobs consumers responded by cutting back sharply on bigticket purchases , like cars and appliances businesses slashed inventories and laid off workers business is optimistic success in the gulf has dispelled the gloom investors have been bidding stocks and the dollar sharply higher the dow jones industrial average soared yesterday by 6386 points , to 2 , 94505 , just 54 points from its record high several broader indexes , however , set records page d1 business executives are optimistic about future sales more important , consumers' expectations about future economic conditions have soared one sign of that renewed faith consumers flocked back into the housing market in february none of this means that the economy will bounce back as smartly as confidence has in fact , economists are expecting a modest recovery in line with a recession that many thought would be shorter and shallower than average what s more , the recovery will have to wait until business stops slashing jobs and starts hiring again that is not likely to happen before the summer , said lawrence kudlow , chief economist at bear , stearns company , he expects friday s unemployment report to show that employers are still retrenching pinning hopes of an economic revival on the recovery of nerve makes sense for the great many who believe that when the economy stumbled , psychology was the main culprit to be sure , the nation s eightyear economic expansion had already turned sluggish a year or so before iraqi tanks rolled into kuwait the economy was thus more vulnerable to sudden swings in mood but in retrospect , many economists say the recession was not inevitable it was n't necessary to have a recession , said martin s feldstein , president of the national bureau of economic research and former chairman of the council of economic advisers under president ronald reagan inventories were lean inflation was not speeding up none of the usual financial predecessors of recession have appeared to this day , said robert e hall , an economist at stanford university the gap between the yields on safe investments like treasury bonds and riskier ones like commercial paper , which typically double or triple before downturns , never did widen much , for example until august , most private forecasters expected the economic expansion to continue and it was december before the bush administration , the federal reserve and the international monetary fund concluded that the economy could not avoid a recession had we not run into the sharp contraction in consumer confidence , the odds were a good deal better than 5050 that we would have skirted a recession , alan greenspan , the chairman of the federal reserve , told congress in february a traditional , shorthand definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of zero economic growth during the summer , the economy expanded the gnp rose at a 14 percent annual rate in the third quarter industrial production was up at a 36 percent rate private payrolls did not peak until august and consumer income and spending kept climbing until october but faced with soaring oil prices after the kuwait invasion , as well as the prospects of war , consumer confidence plunged to the lowest level in a decade between august and october as one administration official put it the last two oilsupply disruptions the iranian revolution and the arabisraeli war led to rapid inflation and skyhigh interest rates so people thought , erroneously as it turned out , 'uh oh , here we go again' roger brinner , director of research at dri mcgrawhill , said , if consumers had n't panicked there would n't have been a recession inventories and jobs cut business panicked , too , helping make the slump a selffulfilling prophecy companies slashed their inventories at the steepest rate in years manufacturers and service establishments alike laid off workers sooner than usual , which contributed to consumers' fears and also squeezed incomes in the view of many economists , neither higher oil prices nor the administration s or the federal reserve s economic policies toppled the economy last fall if anything , the federal reserve s efforts to keep a lid on inflation before the gulf crisis contributed to what most economists insist is the relatively shallow and short nature of this recession

los angeles , march 30 the day after the police beating of a black motorist , mayor tom bradley huddled in his office with deputy mayor mark d fabiani and a few top aides to watch the videotape of the incident in the darkened room , they concentrated on the blurry image until it ended then there was a long silence it was just beyond belief to me to see these officers , mr bradley recalled this week , to see them come in like a pack of wolves , hitting , kicking , mauling that man lying on the ground and not resisting i felt a sense of outrage i 've never felt before the aides could only guess at the thoughts of the taciturn 73yearold mayor , who was a los angeles policeman for 21 years as a black officer in the 1940 s and 1950 s , he could not walk a beat or ride on patrol with white officers because the department was segregated now , after 17 years as mayor , he prides himself above all for the racial peace he has helped to maintain here for most of the 26 years since the watts riots his greatest crisis \? the march 3 beating threatened to upset all that , spawning what mr fabiani termed mr bradley s greatest crisis as mayor through it , the mayor , who has seldom been known to enter a political battle he could not win , has steered a delicate course there in the first days was his familiar image on television , calling for calm , for the restoration of credibility and integrity to the police department yet he has remained at least outwardly aloof from the fray over chief daryl f gates he has refused to call directly for the chief s resignation , which his aides say he would accept but which he cannot require under a city charter that makes him about the weakest bigcity mayor in america his admirers say this has been the finest moment in mr bradley s career , which seemed near its end less than two years ago , when he was struggling through a scandal over his personal finances there has been none of the bombast that might have come from other city halls under such circumstances , and there has been no racial upheaval since the black man , rodney g king , was savagely beaten by white officers while a witness across the street videotaped the pummeling 'an evolutionary approach' you are witnessing him at his best , said michael j gage , a former deputy mayor he has maintained in this polyglot city a sensitivity to multiple nationalities he has taken an evolutionary approach , not reacting in a kneejerk way to the demands of any particular community indeed , mr bradley has found his harshest critics among los angeles s blacks , torn between pride in his success and widespread feelings that he has been slow to confront what they say are years of racism and abuse by the police under chief gates i'm for gates s removal , but i'm also for bradley s removal , said booker griffin , who has a talk show on radio station kgsj on the program , which appeals mainly to black audiences , callers have denounced mayor bradley for not publicly demanding chief gates s resignation in response , the mayor said there is a lack of understanding of my approach to problems if i do not have the authority , i do not go through an exercise in futility instead , i try to exhaust every legal means possible to resolve the problem when that appears impossible , i reserve the right to express the view he should resign i am not going to preempt that just to get an emotional response a response to corruption the episode has underscored the extraordinary impotence of los angeles mayors under the city charter , passed in 1937 after the reign of mayor frank shaw , whose administration was riddled with police corruption the mayor of los angeles cannot select department heads they are chosen by commissions he appoints once selected , they have civil service status , meaning they cannot be dimissed except for cause , narrowly interpreted to mean things like moral turpitude , theft or other illegal acts one of the things i hear most often is , 'why are you not able to fire department heads \? ' mr bradley said i cannot conceive of a city like los angeles where the mayor does not have the power to appoint or dismiss department heads it s a terrible system a catalyst for change \? the king episode may have provided the climate for change the mayor has proposed a charter amendment , as he has without success three times in 10 years , to allow the mayor to change top appointments every five years the city council is expected to put it on the november ballot , but it cannot apply to incumbents like chief gates thus , the mayor has been reduced to using indirect pressure on the chief , with whom he has clashed repeatedly in the 12 years since mr gates was installed the mayor has appointed new members to the fivemember police commission , which oversees the department , and has announced that he would appoint a panel of citizens to study problems in the department the mayor s goal is to keep the city together while keeping his options open , mr fabiani said mr bradley conceded that it might not be possible to remove the 64yearold chief , whose sarcastic and scrappy style could hardly contrast more sharply with the mayor s

washington , nov 25 last thursday s agreement by the seven leading industrialized democracies to grant debt assistance to the soviet union could mean american banks will have to wait longer to receive loan repayments , a senior treasury official said today , but the amount involved is small to the irritation of international bankers , the agreement that deferred principal payments owed through the end of next year on loans from the seven governments , known as the group of seven , also encouraged the soviet republics to seek comparable treatment from commercial banks , corporations and other governments the amount actually affected i would suppose is quite small for american banks , the senior treasury official said there are two reasons for that low level american banks have lent less than 300 million , mostly to the soviet central bank and the agreement covers only those principal payments that fall due in the next 13 months on medium and longterm loans made before the beginning of this year the soviet debt deferral explicitly covers only the 36 billion in principal payments falling due on medium and longterm loans made by the governments of the group of seven nations before this year because the united states government began lending money to the soviet union only this year , none of its loans are affected , the official said the seven leading industrialized democracies are britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states an international banking expert who insisted on anonymity estimated today that the deferral of private debts could apply to another 36 billion in principal payments to commercial banks and 500 million in payments to companies that supply goods to the soviet union american negotiators in effect brokered a deal that provides debt relief for the soviet union at the expense of the international banking community and governments , mostly of western european nations , while costing american taxpayers nothing , the international banking expert said the united states is standing up in front saying , 'we 've got to have an agreement , ' and then winds up putting up nothing but words , he added creditworthiness a worry treasury officials today and in recent weeks have tried to draw a distinction between a deferral of principal payments and a debt rescheduling , which typically also includes interest payments and stretches over many years a soviet debt rescheduling , western officials have contended , would damage soviet creditworthiness but some international banking experts say that the principal deferral deal may do almost as much damage as a rescheduling because banks appear to be losing control over when private debts are repaid but the senior treasury official presented a more optimistic view of commercial bank responses i think they are greatly relieved by the appearance of this agreement with regard to their existing exposures , he said , and i think that how this problem is dealt with will have a very important impact on their attitude towards the provision of new credit , now or later , and the continued provision of shortterm credit
q we wallpapered our bathroom with a solid vinyl , and the edges are now peeling the walls are plaster , which we covered with wallpaper lining and then primed we overlapped the vinyl wallpaper strips by about oneeighth inch , and these edges are curling back i tried several adhesives , but none held up for long some places will not stick down at all any suggestions \? a there are a couple of things you did wrong first , you should never use a wallpaper lining under a vinyl wallcovering , for the vinyl will pull the paper lining away from the wall second , you should not paint or prime a wallpaper or lining this makes it very difficult to remove later third , never overlap the edges of vinyl , for it will not stick over itself in most cases your only solution is to strip everything off the wall and then start over q the dry well in my yard is backing up and is apparently clogged i have no idea how long the well has been in use assuming it is leaves , is there any product i can pour in to get rid of them without harming the lawn , or must i rebuild the well \? a i know of nothing you can pour in the well that will solve your problem the only cure is to either uncover the well and clean it out , or to dig a new well and connect your gutters to it to prevent this happening again , i suggest you cover the gutters with mesh guards so as to keep out leaves
where robbery is rife the radisson hotel in islandia did not have an armed robbery last week that needs to be stated because the radisson was the site of an armedrobbery conference rather than put up signs saying hauppauge rotary in salon a and armed robbery in salon b , the hotel decided to list the robbery conference by its initials it seemed the best way , said the general manager , james barracca still robbery was the topic of discussion in meeting rooms , hallways and elevators the eastern armed robbery conference was attended by 180 police detectives from the eastern seaboard it was a chance for robbery squads to get together and share information , said sgt kevin fallon of the suffolk county police although the suffolk force was the host of the twoday conference , it was not financed by the county , detective phil lissenden of the suffolk robbery section wanted it known armed robbery pays its own way it s a nonprofit organization , he said the conference was not limited to police officials we also had bank guards , sergeant fallon said , and some personnel from domino s pizza they 're concerned about security , too attendees learned the latest in robbery developments one seminar featured the federal bureau of investigation fbi agents offered recent trends in bank robbery , detective lissenden said , like new wording in demand notes we had seminars on bankrobbery prevention , on taxicab robberies , on asian street gangs and on robbery prevention in the subways , which was broadened to include robberies on trains and buses in deference to the islandia site the grand finale was a seminar on the latest in assault weapons for many of the detectives , the highlight came from asking help in solving open cases at the atlanta conference , said bob mcdaniel , a detective from maryland and president of the conference , a detective from alabama stood up and started telling about one of his cases when a detective from south carolina stood up and said , 'i was going to discuss the same kind of case' they wound up solving it for the hotel staff , the highlight was being surrounded by so many officers we feel very well protected , mr barracca said i think they 're having the bomb squad here this afternoon nitespot without alcohol the bartenders at steps nightclub in island park have an interesting technique they do n't use shot glasses when pouring a drink we just fill it to the rim , said linda gordon tending bar in an adult alcoholfree nightclub , ms gordon has learned that how a drink looks is as important as what s in it we use a lot of straws and garnishes , she said steps serves no alcohol we do n't even have a liquor license , said tara bradley , the manager nada coladas take the place of pina coladas but otherwise , the club , one of the first adult alcoholfree clubs on long island , appears the same as other dance clubs for the 21andover crowd the music was blasting and the dance floor packed as men and women boogeyed the night

spring as a labor of love , he said friends of mine were in recovery , he said , and needed a place to go so i said , 'let s give it a shot' recovering alcoholics seem a majority at steps , but anyone who does n't want an alcoholflowing atmosphere can enjoy the club we have a gentler crowd , ms bradley said everyone seems downright civilized other places someone steps on a foot you get a dirty look , ms diaz said here you get a smile it s important to know life does n't end if you do n't have a drink , mr leone said boy still can meet girl only now they can remember doing so , he added another alcoholfree club for adults is scheduled to open in massapequa this month but running a club without liquor is not a license to print money , mr leone advised people do n't spend as much , he said they do n't have that free flow they do where liquor is served there s no 'buy everybody a round mentality' steps is open only on friday and saturday nights , and patrons pay a 10 cover charge you can only charge so much for lemonade , mr leone said juices are 2 at the club , international sparkling waters from france , italy and island park sell for 250 , and blended drinks like the notsobloodymary cost 3 coffee , tea and cookies are complimentary so is the buffet at midnight like patrons at other bars , customers pace themselves with their drinking but at steps , it is the caffeine and calories that are watched i drink coffee and then i switch to seltzer , ms gose said joe devine of valley stream alternates between diet coke and coke
despite a defeat that would turn out to be boxing s biggest story in 1990 , mike tyson did not fade from the public consciousness as has many a vanquished champion although tyson suffered the first loss of his career , last february when james \( buster \) douglas knocked him silly in tokyo , he remained a beguiling figure not only to those who follow the sport , but also to many with only a casual interest while douglas , evander holyfield and george foreman were conspicuous among heavyweights in 1990 , the hulking figure of tyson shadowed them his comings and goings still preoccupied reporters , even gossip columnists whether it was the birth of his son , damato , in may , or his profane denunciation of douglas and holyfield right before their oct 25 match , or the 500 , 000 specially modified ferrari testarossa spider he reportedly bought recently in beverly hills , calif , every development became news tyson s quirkiness , by his own admission , also encouraged more than a few odd sorts to reach out to him earlier this year , tyson spoke about the strange people who manage to obtain his unlisted phone number when he stays at the home in which he was raised from the age of 14 by cus d'amato camille ewald s place in catskill , ny they call and we talk to them we 're bored , tyson said girls call nuts call to say , 'we 're related from another world' there was this one girl who called she tells camille she needs money for an operation she s been in a bad accident and is paralyzed she sends pictures showing she s crippled i look at them and tell camille , she s not crippled' and you know what \? i end up seeing this woman on the tv show about america s most wanted criminals turns out she s a con it was in that spirit of tysonbizarre that a yearend hoax involving the fighter unfolded last week on thursday , rumors circulated that the former heavyweight champion had been arrested at kennedy international airport in queens for possession of two kilos of cocaine but when port authority police were asked to corroborate the report , they found no such arrest had been made tracking the allegations further led them to this discovery a disgruntled newsagencyemployee had decided to send out the bogus tyson tale payperview growing another development in 1990 was the announcement of separate monthly payperview boxing series by time warner s tvko and viacom s showtime event television both networks will debut early this year set with tyson versus razor ruddock in march and tvko in april with holyfield against foreman that regular payperview fights will be delivered to the 15 million addressable homes in this country is no shock where closedcircuit outlets like theaters and clubs once generated most of the revenues for premium live boxing telecasts , in recent years that has changed payperview has surpassed closedcircuit as a moneymaker , and nobody has benefited more than today s superstar fighters in june 1988 , tyson earned 20 million for knocking out michael spinks in 91 seconds , the most any fighter has made for a single night s work a little over half of the tv revenues on that fight were payperview , said bill cayton , tyson s estranged manager up to then , i believe that was the first time that payperview exceeded closedcircuit when douglas lost to holyfield at the mirage in las vegas , nev , he made just under 20 million according to alan feldman , a spokesman for the mirage , which controlled the payperview and closedcircuit telecasts for douglasholyfield we netted just over 20 million payperview and just under 2 million in closedcircuit while rival promoters like bob arum insist the mirage s figures are inflated , they do not dispute the fact that payperview revenues far exceeded closedcircuit income for douglasholyfield it remains to be seen whether all that means a boom market for tvko and set mike trainer , who was a consultant to the douglasholyfield promotion , sees a bottleneck ahead when the promoters of tysonruddock and holyfieldforeman try to make their payperview deals with the nation s multisystem operators why in the past were n't there two big fights scheduled close together , the way these are \? trainer asked because it s handing the cable industry a bullet in other words , the multisystem operators can cut better deals by playing one event against the other the bottom line , trainer said , is that both fights will get hurt and if 20 percent of the payperview universe opts not to carry both fights , that s 3 million homes which is significant , believe me a soviet contender \? the last year marked the first appearance of professional soviet fighters here the five who signed on with lou falcigno , the new yorkbased promoter , are now down to three and none of the survivors is undefeated any longer but falcigno is especially high on one of the remaining combatants , sergei artemiev , a lightweight i believe he 'll be fighting for a world title in 12 monthsplus , falcigno said

the economny congress finds it s easier to criticize on savings and loan bailout last week , when treasury secretary nicholas f brady asked congress for 80 billion more for the savings and loan bailout , he could n't have played to a worse crowd first he was criticized about administration estimates of the bailout s cost too optimistic , congress said then he was accused of playing politics with the taxpayers money and when he made a proposal of his own to remove the federal deposit insurance corporation from daytoday management of the bailout congress was receptive , but only soso members of congress are starting to feel some heat over the bailout , said norman ornstein , an analyst at the american enterprise institute in washington though brady is not disliked , he is n't generating any deep respect while congress may be feeling heat , no members have taken the risk of devising their own plan congress is still trying to roil the waters it wants to focus attention on what s gone wrong , he said honda , north of the border the honda motor company builds some of america s bestselling cars in canada the trouble is , says the customs service , honda might not be building enough of each car there to qualify for dutyfree status one car in particular is a problem the civic for it to escape a 25 percent tariff , at least 50 percent of its parts must be made in the united states or canada the customs service contends that japan supplies more than half of the civic s parts honda may owe as much as 20 million in back payments not so , says honda the company has dispatched its lawyers to washington , parts invoices in hand now congress has jumped into the dispute some members are asking for tougher rules of origin in the negotiations over with mexico over a freetrade pact making it easier for tv stations if you think tough times for broadcast television are already here , you have n't seen anything yet that was the message released last week in a report from the federal communications commission the fcc predicts cable and other forms of pay tv will leave broadcast stations with a smaller , poorer , less desirable market the networks which had 93 percent of primetime viewers in 1975 and only 64 percent now will fare the worst commission chairman alfred c sikes is likely to use the report to try to relax rules governing how many broadcast stations a company can own the cable owners did not like what they heard they fear consolidation among the broadcast channels the slowest recovery the economy ran in reverse in the first quarter of the year the gross national product contracted by a sharp 28 percent , according to the commerce department that was worse than most economists expected that all but defuses the short and shallow theory short perhaps , but probably not shallow and corporate profits also took a tumble down 63 percent we hit bottom in april , said ed yardeni , chief economist at c j lawrence in new york and this will be one of the slowest recoveries on record why so slow \? the labor force is not growing neither is productivity , he said demographically there are not as many yuppies and americans bought 100 million cars in the 1980 s optimistic indicators the hope is that the nation s leading economic indicators really do point the way according to the commerce department , the indicators rose by 08 percent in may , the fourth advance in a row the indicators forecast economic events six to nine months in advance but the numbers still do n't tell us the shape of the recovery , said mickey d levy , chief economist at crt government securities unimpressed markets orders for durable goods moved up a sprightly 38 percent in may that was the second consecutive monthly gain and the biggest jump in more than a year , the commerce department said last week so why were n't the markets smiling \? the figures say the upturn that has now started will be very slow , said lawrence chimerine , senior adviser to dri inc , an economic advising firm and some industries , like computers and machine tools , are still doing poorly , he said though an upturn is in sight , profits will still take time to recover consumers learn to spend again consumers are spending again go get the confetti consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of all economic activity surged 11 percent in may , according to the commerce department these statistics , coming after others that showed further increases in consumer confidence , were enough to get the white house to officially proclaim the end of the recession unless something that we have n't forecast happens , it does look like the recession on a national basis has ended , said michael boskin , chairman of the white house council of economic advisers international swiss stock up on jet fighters switzerland is ringed with jagged mountains and has n't fought a war in 200 years but you never know so last week the government s federal council said it would recommend purchase of 34 f a18 jet fighters to be produced by the mcdonnell douglas corporation in the united states and in switzerland the contract , which is expected to get parliament s approval , is worth about 225 billion with postcold war cutbacks affecting every weapons maker , this sale is a very big deal welcoming gorbachev , sort of president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union will be meeting in london next month with the leaders of the world s richest nations the g7 when he does , they will be handing him half an invitation the soviet union can join the international monetary fund , they plan to say , but only as an associate associate status was dreamed up last week in london when the g7 s finance ministers met an associate , they explained , is entitled to the fund s advice , but none of its money to get the money the soviet union has to come up with a credible plan for creating a market economy something moscow has been working on since 1985 nomura s set of rules yoshihisa tabuchi , president and chief executive of the nomura securities company in tokyo , resigned last week nomura is the world s largest securities house nomura admitted that it had paid its best customers 120 million to compensate for losses it also admitted it had provided 100 million in financing to susumu ishii , a wellknown organized crime figure in japan the extent of the scandal , which involves three other firms , has observers wondering if japan s markets operate by a different set of rules it also has them wondering about nomura s culture , which values dealmaking above everything else while mr tabuchi is stepping aside , he is not stepping down he will become vice chairman companies
the new queens district attorney is expected to announce today that he will seek the dismissal of the most serious charges against four of the five police officers indicted in the killing of a cartheft suspect in february , lawenforcement officials said yesterday the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , also said that district attorney richard a brown wanted the murder charge against the fifth officer reduced to manslaughter or assault mr brown has scheduled a news conference for this morning , but his spokesman said only that mr brown planned to use the occasion to talk about the hotly disputed case the request to drop the murder charges would reverse the last major action by mr brown s predecessor , john j santucci , who resigned on june 1 after 14 years as one of the state s most powerful prosecutors mr santucci convened the grand jury that indicted the officers in march after the city medical examiner s office ruled the death of the 21yearold suspect , federico pereira , a homicide followed los angeles case the incident began when two of the officers , on patrol in forest hills , found mr pereira a cook in a fastfood restaurant who had once lived in the neighborhood dozing in what they said was a stolen car early on the morning of feb 5 the police said he became agitated and then violent as the officers tried to get him out of the car a preliminary police investigation found that the officers had followed proper procedures and had not used a chokehold , which department policy prohibits but the medical examiner s office concluded later that mr pereira had choked to death after severe pressure was applied to his neck or chest the indictments came only a week after a beating in los angeles in which police officers were videotaped showering blows on a motorist they said they had stopped for speeding that grainy tape , played over and over on television news programs , raised new fears of police brutality the queens case rocked the police department and commissioner lee p brown , who has been trying to present a new image of communitybased crimefighting but unlike the los angeles incident , there was no videotape in queens , and discrepancies soon clouded almost every aspect of the case , from what witnesses saw to when mr pereira died mr santucci announced the indictments at a news conference jammed with television cameras and lights then he retired , and mr brown began reorganizing the district attorney s office and reviewing the cases he had inherited the first indication that mr brown was reexamining the pereira case came when he appeared on the wnbctv program news forum on sunday as district attorney , he cannot change the language of grandjury indictments but he can modify the charges by filing a motion in court to amend them all five officers were indicted on charges of first and seconddegree murder and negligent homicide the indictments did not say which officer applied the fatal pressure but people close to the investigation have identified him as anthony paparella , 27 ever since mr pereira s death , the police have said that he had a history of arrests for drug sales and car thefts they also say that they found a gun in the car and that he was carrying a used crack pipe and marijuana officials of the patrolmen s benevolent association speculated that mr pereira had died of a crack overdose , not any injuries from his struggle with the officers the autopsy report found needle track marks on mr pereira s arm , 01 milligrams per liter of cocaine in his blood and 05 milligrams of cocaine per kilogram in his brain yesterday james j lysaght , an attorney for the pba and for officer paparella , said he had not been told what action the district attorney planned to take he maintained that none of the officers were guilty of any infraction and added , the appropriate action would be a dismissal of charges against all officers and a commendation for police work well performed thomas stickel , the lawyer for laura and tito nieves , mr pereira s mother and stepfather , accused mr brown of caving in to the pba pressure something stinks , mr stickel said referring to the los angeles motorist , he said now that it s no longer politically popular , now that people have started to forget about rodney king , the da does n't become unpopular for failing to prosecute bad cops the grand jury heard it all once now they 're being overruled by a district attorney with no guts even mr stickel suggested that the prosecution would have trouble proving murder charges against officer thomas loeffel , 25 , and sgt barry goldblatt , 48 there were indications , he said , that they had been calling for medical assistance at the time of the assault officers john o'connell , 24 , and james mcmorrow , 28 , were also charged
to the editor the insurance industry is about as popular as the grim reaper and the irs while not many would rush to defend it , that does n't necessarily justify supporting unwarranted federal intervention as advocated in your may 4 editorial nobody likes a cartel , but it is difficult to see how you can conclude that the insurance industry is one , given the fact that it consists of more than 5 , 000 companies competing for business in both price and product back in 1982 , the government concluded that competition was just the thing the equally unpopular banking industry needed now we are living with the tragic consequences of that decision in the form of the s l debacle unlike the banking industry , the insurance industry is closely regulated by the states as to the form of its product and its rates where a state fails to regulate , the antitrust laws do , in fact , apply as a new yorker , i am convinced that the regulation we have under a state system , unimpeded by federal intervention , is of a higher quality than the federal government could provide every day we read how the federal government has failed in its responsibilities to deal adequately with problems under its jurisdiction aside from the banking industry , catastrophe may be lurking with fanny mae , freddie mac and pension systems under erisa , to name but a few failings yet you express preference for the outright repeal of the mccarranferguson act , which would eliminate the legal basis for state regulation of the insurance industry none of this is to say that state legislators or anyone else should be complacent about the current state of affairs we are constantly seeking ways to strengthen the state regulatory system it is ironic that the brooks bill might very well impede those efforts by expanding a dual jurisdiction which would interfere with the state s ability to act unfortunately , the legal questions involved are complex and technical and cannot be adequately dealt with in this forum that is why it is particularly frustrating to those of us who wish to deal with real insurance problems to be relegated to debating the issue within 30second sound bites or their equivalent what is needed is more time to fully consider the implications of the brooks bill , so that years from now we wo n't be suffering from a proposal that sounded good at the time but created problems far greater than the ones it intended to resolve \( senator \) donald m halperin albany , may 13 , 1991 the writer , a member of the new york state senate insurance committee , heads the national conference of insurance legislators' state federal relations committee
amid the almost daily evidence of the continued deterioration of the american economy , there are beginning to be signs of improvement the encouraging reports are popping up in such diverse areas as construction , electronics and automobiles executives and economists warn against interpreting these straws in the wind as a turnaround in the economy , but they might provide the beginnings of one later on much of the good news comes with caveats american express , for example , reports a slight uptick lately in the use of its 26 million credit cards , but not enough to declare that people are spending more the automotive industry notes that car and truck sales have risen since january , but only to levels that are not yet respectable even for a recession and sears , roebuck company says women are buying more clothes , but for the job , not for leisure we have managed doubledigit sales increases in women s clothing because most of our inventory is in career wear , said dorrit bern , sears s merchandising manager for women s clothing but casual wear is n't selling the instantgratification purchase is n't present in this recession the situation is tough the appearance of good economic news in the midst of a recession is not unusual it has happened in past recessions , which have then often continued without abating , says albert t sommers , a senior economist at the conference board he calls these episodes intuitive leaps forward that anticipate the end of a recession , sometimes prematurely the stock market , with its sharply rising prices since early january , reflects such an anticipatory leap on the part of investors , mr sommers argues many weak numbers the good news , in fact , comes in the midst of plenty of bad news in the last 10 days , government reports showed that unemployment rose sharply in february while the industrial production index plunged , and inventories grew in january , for the third consecutive month that means production outstripped demand and the unsold surplus went into warehouses if the trend was to continue , production would be cut another notch and more workers idled for the moment , however , robert a mosbacher , the secretary of commerce , and others in the bush administration , are making the most of the positive reports , suggesting that they signal that the recession s hardest months might be over nevertheless , mr mosbacher acknowledges that the good news is still too fragmentary to serve as the basis of a trustworthy forecast that the recession is entering its final phase when you hear these things , you assume that in a month or two we will get some data that will show an upturn in some areas , he said , and maybe by the end of the summer , we 'll see more up signs than down signs some of the good news might indeed contain the seeds of an upturn many realtors , for example , report rising sales of existing singlefamily houses changing home ownership cannot by itself reverse a recession that takes new construction , with all the jobs it creates , not only to build a home , but also to supply lumber , steel , appliances and other items when sales rise , however , home prices stabilize and the new demand eventually encourages builders to start new projects that might be happening now nationwide construction data for february , made available this week by the f w dodge division of mcgrawhill , shows that the value of newly started homes , commercial buildings and government projects has been stable for three consecutive months , after having fallen since september 1989 home construction , rather than new office and apartment projects , appears to be stabilizing the construction figures that is certainly the case for frank wimer , president of the wimer construction company of pittsburgh last july , he had five homes under construction in the suburb of forest chapel and none of them sold , an unnerving experience for a builder who usually sells his houses before they are finished he vowed not to build another house until buyers were found for the homes already sitting empty , and this he accomplished by the end of the year , selling the homes , he says , for nearly the halfmillion or so he had originally asked i changed real estate agents and threw in more landscaping at my expense , he said 'taking a chance' now he has five more homes under construction , in the 300 , 000 to 600 , 000 range i'm taking a chance , but there is n't a big inventory of unsold singlefamily homes in the pittsburgh area anymore , he said beyond construction , which accounts for roughly 10 percent of the nation s economic activity , some of the positive reports are more impressionistic when i talk to my peers , what i hear is that manufacturing activity is abysmally low , but people nevertheless feel better , said stephen r hardis , vice chairman of the eaton corporation , a huge clevelandbased manufacturer of machinery and parts for autos , appliances and electronic products the mindset is that with the gulf war behind us all the conditions are in place for a recovery that we do n't see yet the conditions mr hardis refers to are these with the war over , spending might increase as consumer confidence revives factories , in turn , would increase production to meet the new demand laidoff workers would be recalled , not only at factories but also at the numerous companies that service a prospering economy the new jobs mean rising income from wages , which makes possible more spending and still more job creation ending the recession confidence did , in fact , turn up in early march , according to the university of michigan s survey research center but richard t curtin , the center s director , offers a caveat people are saying that they expect some improvement in the economy , and if they see it , they 'll step up their spending , but until they see it , they 'll be cautious , he said for eaton , the only improvement so far is a rise in orders for switches that go into computers and hand tools mr hardis says the order pickup might not last you want to see several months of upturn to decide it is a trend , he said retail sales up retail sales are also hard to read the commerce department reported on wednesday that retail sales rose in february , for the first time in four months but the 148 billion in total sales was less than in any month since last summer except january similarly , the semiconductor industry association , representing companies that make chips for electronics products , reported that in february orders for new chips exceeded shipments for the first time since last july but one month s improvement does not constitute a trend , said andrew a procassini , president of the association auto and truck manufacturers are also skeptical sales of americanmade vehicles rose in february and early march to 124 million , at an annual rate , from 112 million in january this is below the 135 million that would be a more normal recession level , says donald hilty , chief economist at the chrysler corporation but it is more vehicles than the industry is manufacturing presumably , production will soon have to rise to keep up with the demand , and workers on layoff will have to be recalled there is some hope in what is happening , mr hilty said , but so far it is a straw in the wind , not a trend the industry will draw down inventories and wait until march ends before deciding what to do photo frank wimer , a pittsburgh home builder , vowed not to build any new houses until the ones he had already built were bought he disposed of those by the end of 1990 and now , encouraged by the marketplace and improved interest rates on his financing , he is building five new houses \( associated press for the new york times \)
if a declarer goes down in an apparently easy contract , the most common explanation is that he has played badly but now and again , as in the diagramed deal , he has been the victim of some very clever defense the west player was a young norwegian , geir helgemo , who was playing in a tournament in his home country in yokohama , japan , last month , his effort earned him the international bridge press association s precision award for the best defense of 199091 south s bidding suggested that he was trying for a slam , so west knew that his chances of defeating four hearts were poor since east had not raised spades , it was likely that south had a few spades as well as length in the red suits west therefore rejected the obvious leads , the singleton diamond hoping for a ruff , the spade ace hoping to give partner a ruff , or a safe trump none of these would have given the declarer any trouble instead west made an imaginative choice by underleading his club ace , believing that south had a club void and that his move could do no harm south won with the ten in dummy and led a heart to the king , collecting the ten from west now the declarer wanted to lead another trump from the dummy , so he led the spade king in the hope of creating an entry west held up his ace for one round , and when he took the ace led his club ace , deliberately establishing dummy s clubs south ruffed and thought it over clearly west was trying hard to prevent him from reaching the dummy to play another heart not unnaturally he drew the inference that west held no more hearts and that another lead from the dummy was essential he was willing to lose a diamond trick as well as the heart ace , so he led a low diamond he expected to force an entry to the dummy , but was shaken to see east win with the king and give west a diamond ruff imaginative defense had sunk an unbeatable contract diagram
sedalia , mo until the strike came , the silver and blue greyhound americruisers rumbled in from st louis and kansas city and helped keep this shrinking city of 19 , 800 connected to the world outside about 50 people a month boarded the bus at the tworoom brick station that jim and rita fairfax built four years ago today , the bus station is a laundromat mary f pummill , a widow who is legally blind , once could walk to the station and get a bus any day of the week now she has to rely on a twiceamonth shuttle bus primarily for elderly people when she wants to see her doctors in columbia , about 60 miles away charlotte williams , who retired to sedalia from chicago three years ago , said she now gets rides from friends to bus and train stations 30 miles away or more or pays high taxi fares if you 're here and you do n't have somebody to take you somewhere , you 're here , said mrs fairfax , whose husband has moved a bail bond business into the building sedalia , home of the missouri state fair and reputed birthplace of scott joplin s ragtime rhythms , was a stop on a 110mile route across missouri that greyhound abandoned on march 2 , 1990 , the day its drivers went on strike for higher wages overnight five small cities lost all service , probably for good , and the state capital of jefferson city , which is also on the route , has next to none rural america hardest hit the strike , which immediately wiped out a dozen or so similar routes linking small american cities and towns , continues to this day nonunion drivers handle the trips that greyhound still makes the bus company estimates that 95 percent of the passengers it served when the strike started still take the bus but most of those passengers live on the east and west coasts industry analysts say the company has abandoned about 400 of the 3 , 800 places that it regularly used to serve small independent operators have taken over some routes , but service to others has been lost some bus routes were bound for extinction anyway , and the strike simply hastened the inevitable where it s declined is in rural america , said robin diamond , spokeswoman for the american bus association , and the reason is that the population just is n't there to support the bus even those communities that were directly affected by the strike have not been crippled by it rather , the greyhound walkout simply joins the array of other social and economic forces that have turned the downtowns and courthouse squares of these little places into somnolent artifacts long gone in sedalia are the goodpaying jobs along the nowdesolate railroad sidings here so are other jobs on increasingly mechanized farms most passengers on the sedalia route were transients , college students , the poor and elderly , amish farm families , inmates on leave from prisons or servicemen on leave from whiteman air force base they could not drive or did not have cars now they can take taxis or hitch rides to a station in boonville , 40 miles away , but the bus that stops there ca n't take them to their friends and relatives who live along the old route through here an amtrak train stops here , but it goes to none of the other abandoned towns on the route , and it usually costs more mayor steven j dust of sedalia has heard little alarm perhaps , he speculated , because people who need the bus do not know how to make themselves heard politically or perhaps , he said , they had come to accept the writing on the wall , with the erosion of interstate bus service over many years until the early 1980 s four buses , two going east along highway 50 and two west , went through sedalia then the service was halved and months before 6 , 300 amalgamated transit union drivers walked out , missouri granted greyhound approval to end its service here in late 1989 on the ground that it was a chronic money loser number of routes halved the company will not say how many american communities have been stranded but as examples of other deserted routes it mentions a 90mile stretch of route 40 in indiana a 100mile run in wisconsin from ashland to minocqua and one in alabama running 75 miles south on route 43 from eutaw , southwest of tuscaloosa , to thomasville along each line , typically , five or six towns lost the bus these recent closings are just the latest by the bus industry that have reduced the number of sites where buses stop from 20 , 000 two decades ago , to 15 , 000 in 1983 , to around 9 , 000 now , according to industry estimates the old missouri route started about 75 miles west of st louis , along interstate 70 , turning south on highway 54 , with a stop in fulton , the first of the abandoned cities but still close to the interstate the toll of the loss starts to build where the bus turned west at jefferson city onto highway 50 there , at the station greyhound abandoned , an independent company provides two buses a day , one heading north and one south , but nothing goes east and west on the old greyhound route forgotten villages from the capital this time of year , the bus would roll west past prairie hills and farms past fields now dotted with fourfoothigh rolls of freshly

of all the teams competing this weekend at the national hot rod association s summernationals in englishtown , nj , none is more representative of the struggle to overcome adversity than darrell gwynn s gwynn , 29 years old , was one of drag racing s young stars in its most glamorous class , top fuel at more than 25 feet in length , a top fuel dragster looks like a giant harpoon , and when it gets a 3 , 000horsepower thrust down a quartermile dragstrip , it literally disappears from the starting line in the blink of an eye all that power enough to melt pistons in an average run or even detonate a motor like a bomb comes from a supercharger perched atop the engine and fuel that is as much as 98 percent nitromethane it takes about 12 gallons of it for a top fueler to complete one quartermile run if you are brave or foolish enough to stand alongside the starting line for the launch of two top fuelers , your eyes will sting from the exhaust , your skin will have a fine layer of rubber dust , and your hearing if unprotected will be less than what it was before on march 3 , 1990 , gwynn set an nhra record with a quartermile run in 4909 seconds \( since lowered to 4881 by gary ormsby \) injured in dragstrip in england but a few weeks later , on april 15 , gwynn was paralyzed from the chest down in an accident at a dragstrip in england drag racing , and many other segments of motor racing , responded with numerous fundraising events a softball game in reading , pa , last september between the nhra s and nascar s top drivers drew the biggest crowd in the history of that city s minor league stadium and raised more than 175 , 000 for gwynn now , as gwynn faces the daily struggle of living , it is eased by the fact that he owned his team and has been able to stay active and involved in his sport if i was just a hired driver , let s say , and i did n't own my own team , i 'd probably be in a different position right now , gwynn said last wednesday from his manhattan hotel room but being able to come back and still having the same goals in mind , wanting to win races , it s kind of kept my mind occupied the team , which is managed by gwynn s father , jerry , hired frank hawley , a canadian who runs a dragracing school in gainesville , fla , as its driver , and hawley won the top fuel title at two events last season , including an emotional victory in the team s first race after gwynn s accident in each of the eight events before the summernationals this season , the team has qualified among the top 16 , meaning they moved on to the final headtohead elimination rounds the farthest hawley has taken the car is the semifinal round three times and he is fourth in the championship standing , although he will have to start winning some titles to catch up to don prudhomme and kenny bernstein , the top two drivers so far 2 team members killed in mishap but to do that , the team must overcome another tragedy on may 17 , two of gwynn s three fulltime crew members , gary clark and nick floch , were killed in a boating accident those were the same two guys who , after my accident , were cutting the grass and feeding the dog and doing all the things at my parents' house when everybody was gone in england for five weeks , gwynn said and they did n't know that they were going to get a paycheck from one week to the next recent reports about a possible breakthrough in getting spinalcord tissue to regenerate were obviously heartening to gwynn and if one day he is a beneficiary of a cure for spinalcord injuries , there will be poetic justice in that four months before his accident , gwynn and his main sponsor , the coors brewing company , announced in gwynn s hometown of miami that they were going to make donations to the miami project to cure paralysis my new goal is somehow for my grandkids to read that i was a big part in not necessarily finding a cure for paralysis but putting it up front and finding the funds that made the cure possible , gwynn said the summernationals conclude today with final eliminations in each of 11 classes starting at 11 am general admission is 28 , with pit passes costing 8 reserved seats , which include a pit pass , are 42 each to reach the track , take exit 9 off the new jersey turnpike onto route 18 eastbound to the englishtown exit follow route 527 south to the track for information , call 9084466370
washington , july 26 the train derailment and chemical spill that poisoned 45 miles of the sacramento river in northern california also exposed gaping weaknesses in the railroad industry s safety program and is causing the government to consider an array of new rules for hauling hazardous materials experts with the national transportation safety board , congress , and the federal railroad administration say the accident on july 14 illustrated the almost complete absence of regulations for shipping agricultural weed and insect poisons and raised questions about the safety of that type of tank car and the operating procedures of the railroad of the more than 1 , 200 primary chemicals used to manufacture 22 , 000 of these farm pesticides in the united states , only 80 are subject to the strict rules for labeling , packaging and transport that the department of transportation requires for hazardous materials the pesticide that turned the accident into one of the most environmentally destructive in the history of american railroads was being hauled in a tank car that the national transportation safety board has repeatedly said is too flimsy to haul hazardous materials most of the 15 million carloads of hazardous materials shipped by rail each year are carried in identical cars , known as the model 111a and the federal railroad administration is investigating why the southern pacific transporation company decided not to put a fifth locomotive at the rear of the train to help push the long and heavy load through steep and twisting canyons preliminary reports by the government show that the train was under extraordinary strain when the accident occurred calls for action perhaps not since 1974 , when a butane leak from a tank car caused an explosion that killed 10 people in a switching yard in decatur , ill , has a single rail accident stirred so many calls for new safety rules this is the type of accident that opens up a whole new area of exploration , said gilbert e carmichael , the federal railroad administrator here was a tank that was penetrated while carrying a substance that was n't classified as hazardous how many chemicals are out there that can do what this one did that we are n't regulating \? we may have to modify our whole approach to adjust guidelines and regulations but carol perkins , a spokeswoman in washington for the association of american railroads , the industry s leading trade group , said the california accident was an anomaly of the 466 accidents recorded by the industry that involved hazardous materials last year , 35 involved a spill or leak , and nobody was killed , the groups s research found considering there are over one million shipments a year of hazardous materials , this data clearly shows shipping by rail is the safest way we 've got , ms perkins said a study made public this week by citizen action , a national environmental group , took issue with the rail industry s safety claims citing federal figures , the study said the number of rail incidents involving hazardous materials climbed to more than 1 , 200 in 1990 , a record in addition , rail accidents that cause widespread environmental damage are becoming more common , the study found in april 1990 , for example , a derailment near craigsville , pa , dumped 100 , 000 gallons of crude oil and 10 , 000 gallons of caustic sodium hydroxide into a creek that was the drinkingwater source for several communities near pittsburgh but that accident was not nearly as destructive as the derailment on july 14 preliminary reports by the federal railroad administration give this account southern pacific train no 9693 was climbing through the narrow canyons of northern california on its way from west colton , near los angeles , to eugene , ore as the 97car train crossed a bridge two and a half miles south of mount shasta city at 9 40 pm on sunday , the train jerked for reasons that are still not known and the last of its four locomotives was lifted completely off the tracks and flipped over , taking with it the next six cars mr carmichael said the track was virtually unmarked , indicating that the derailment was not caused by an obstruction one of the six cars was a tanker that pitched off the bridge onto sharp rocks that penetrated the steel tank , releasing into the river 19 , 000 gallons of metam sodium , a powerful pesticide that kills unwanted plant and animal life in farm fields hundreds of thousands of fish were wiped out in a 45mile stretch of river , virtually all plant life was killed and workers have been busy ever since pumping air into one end of shasta lake , into which the river empties , in hopes of reducing the contamination experts with the california department of fish and game say it will take years for the river to recover the accident is under investigation by the federal railroad administration , the national transportation safety board , several california agencies and southern pacific , a subsidiary of the anschutz corporation of denver mr carmichael said that enough had been learned about the accident and its aftermath to serve as an alert to the government and the railroad industry gap in rules is exposed
from the studio artists in residence , 198990 is a good example of why the studio museum in harlem is so consistently a pleasure to visit the emerging artists in this handsome show raul acero , paul gardere and jerome b meadows are exceptionally gifted their work is independent it is also refined \( even when , in mr gardere s case , it is raw \) , intense , essentially figurative , handcrafted and wide ranging in its artistic and cultural references all three artists use a variety of materials even when their work has the airy fluidity of a dream , it has multiple parts and it suggests a view that human beings are not one essence but a shifting composite of different and often conflicting cultures , experiences and feelings all the artists , including mr gardere , whose work has a strong political dimension , believe in spirituality and magic each artist is concerned with identity in mr meadows s wood and stone sculptures , each earthbound , serpentine male force and each sinuous and agile female force seems capable of wildly diverse reactions mr acero builds fragile yet strangely inviolable stick figures of earth and wood , and he uses ceramic techniques from different cultures \( including roman and arab \) and times \( from antiquity to the present \) in his mixedmedia works , some of them including balls of mud that suggest black globes , black bombs , or clumps of uprooted black earth , mr gardere appears to be defiantly sure of who he is and yet at the same time to be constantly asking , who am i really \? mr gardere is 36 years old he was born in haiti and moved to the united states at the age of 14 his immediate , highly physical mixedmedia works , many of them incorporating black mud and thick rope winding in and around black faces , raise the question of how to live with pride and purpose in a condition of permanent exile and alienation the exile in mr gardere s works may be political \( there are references to haiti s troubled recent history \) it may also be artistic \( if cubist collages appropriated african art and i make collages , he seems to be saying , then does that mean i see african art through cubist eyes \? \) and it may be personal in one work , the mud figure of a black man is surrounded by easy and sometimes witty biographical drawings that the artist did years ago and that have little relation in style and tone to his art now in another work , mr gardere surrounds the mud figure of a black man with drawings by his son , whose cultural heroes including batman and superman are clearly not the heroes of his childhood in haiti just about everything in mr gardere s work has an edge for example , the mud heads and figures can be passive \( shadowy , anonymous and sullen \) , but they are also energetically modeled , as solid as baked earth , and bristling many of the works , among them tempest in the mind \( with mud framing a watercolor portrait of a young man \) , include rope , which suggests imprisonment and lynching but the thick sisal rope mr gardere uses comes from haiti , where rope is identified with bonding and even with religious revelation nature and the spiritual traditions of his native country hold mr gardere s work together nature and the spiritual traditions of the caribbean also hold together the work of mr acero , who is 30 , a native of colombia and currently a new york resident according to dorothy desirdavis , the head of the studio museum s artistsinresidence program , which awarded each of these three artists studio space and a stipend of 13 , 000 last year , mr acero s wood and ceramic freestanding figures are inspired by the boriquean santos or wooden figures of saints used as devotional objects the ceramic heads may include small images of birds and fish that refer to spiritual beings of the santeria religion mr acero s imaginary creatures are so tautly and fervently conceived that they seem functional and alive figure with head of clouds is about seven feet tall the arms of its static , stickshaped body are in dancing positions its big white plaster fishshaped head has faces on two sides the body is coated with colored ceramic shards that give the figure a mosaic glimmer but there is also a sense of trial and tribulation here mr acero s figures are pieced together with disjunctive parts , and the ceramic or plaster heads almost seem impaled on their wood bodies the sharp pieces of ceramic create a sense of cutting and mutilation although mr acero s works are extremely gentle and delicate , there is violence in them and a sense that spiritual ecstasy and physical suffering are inseparable the sculptures of mr meadows , who is 39 and lives in washington , are the most whimsical works in the show , but they , too , have an edge ms desirdavis writes that his harlem ladder series was inspired by dreams of armageddon in which thousands of ladders in an enormous crater were possessed with different personalities in each of the four works in this series , a ladder with the shapely outline of a female body stands on one leg at its feet , a snake or scorpionlike cluster creature hisses , worships and taunts as you move around the sculptures , the ladder appears to dance , run , tease and kick , and both ladder and snake become part of a courtship that seems eternal
they are not jim palmer , dave mcnally , mike cuellar and pat dobson , who were 20game winners for the baltimore orioles in 1971 , but they are an interesting quartet of pitchers in their own right kirk dressendorfer , joe slusarski , dana allison and steve chitren are rookie members of an american league pitching staff their team is not rebuilding but has played in the world series the last three years these oakland athletic pitchers , though , are not routine rookies collectively , they have only seven seasons of professional experience and , entering this season , had pitched only 20 games above the class aa level of the minor leagues they are among 62 rookies on major league rosters 35 in the american league , 27 in the national and dressendorfer is the only one who has made the mammoth leap to the majors from the class a level of the minor leagues nine of the other rookies have reached the majors with no experience above class aa three of those players are starting jeff bagwell at first base for the houston astros , chuck knoblauch at second for the minnesota twins and gary scott at third for the chicago cubs two other rookies are starting after having played some september games last season after promotion from aa they are luis gonzalez , the astros' left fielder , and steve decker of san francisco , whose appearance behind the plate wednesday night gave the giants a battery of black and decker in all , entering yesterday s games , 13 rookies , including 3 pitchers , had started in the al and 8 rookies , including one pitcher , had started in the nl the astros have the most rookies in their starting lineup , with karl rhodes , their right fielder , joining bagwell and gonzalez the cleveland indians have the most rookies on their roster , seven while los angeles and pittsburgh are the only teams with none slusarski , who did n't start the season on the athletics' roster , started their third game of the season , after dave stewart and bob welch , a tough duet to follow the 24yearold righthander , stepping in for the ailing eric show , won the game , shutting out minnesota for seven innings in his previous two years as a professional , slusarski pitched nine games above aa , all for tacoma of the pacific coast league last year dressendorfer , who was one of three rookie pitchers scheduled to start yesterday , has the least experience of any player in the majors selected in the draft last june as compensation for the loss of free agent dave parker , the righthander , who had his 22d birthday on opening day , pitched in seven games for the southern oregon a s of the class a northwest league keep in mind , sandy alderson , the general manager of the a s , said , dressendorfer is starting ahead of some people who have started for us in the past we 're not plugging a hole with him he beat out the competition chitren , a 23yearold reliever , has the most experience of the four in his second professional season last year , he pitched in one aaa game , then spent the last month with oakland , working in eight games his 102 earned run average with the athletics was no accident in 71 minor league games , he compiled a 154 era allison , the only lefthander in the group , is in the majors after relieving for five different teams in oakland s organization in two years the 24yearold , however , appeared in only two aaa games for a total of one and onethird innings he compiled a 199 era and averaged 12 walks per nine innings a team like the white sox last year used a lot of young pitching and did well , alderson said we 're confident some of our people are of that caliber we 're excited about it we 're starting to see some younger people move into the rotation it s an interesting development for a team not noted for developing pitching the long road dressendorfer makes the majors after seven games in the minors jose escobar makes it after 12 years in the minors a 30yearold rookie from venezuela , escobar said he had been in the minors a long time because he was n't given an opportunity he said he had done well at syracuse last season and after a good report from the manager expected to be called up in september he was n't , and he said he was never told why escobar , who began playing in 1979 , thus playing in the minors in three different decades , won a job this spring as a utility infielder with the indians , who signed him as a free agent in november he had spent a fruitless 11 years in the toronto organization , a stretch broken by a year in the philadelphia system forgotten heroes the mets won a game against philadelphia last week because rick cerone hit a home run in the 9th inning , tying the game , and hubie brooks hit a home run in the 10th teammates and fans appreciated both home runs , but brooks was saluted much more lavishly than cerone that s the way it always goes when a player drives in the winning run in an extra inning after another player has tied it in the ninth , but the emphasis is backward no doubt the gamewinning hit is critical , but the hitter who gets it would not have been in position to do so if the other hitter had not tied the game in the ninth the mets would have had no 10th inning if cerone had not hit his home run in the 9th the game would have been over gruesome sequel the yankees had just scored three runs in the second inning against the kansas city royals on friday night , and gene michael , the yankees' general manager , felt pretty good give me a 30 lead every time and i 'll take my chances , michael said , watching the game on television but did n't you have a lead like this last night \? his caller asked , mindful that the yankees had blown a big lead and lost to detroit yeah , he replied , but that was 40 maybe 30 will work within minutes , however , the royals scored three runs , and the next inning they scored four more , showing the yankees and michael that 30 would n't work either
proposed a law permitting you to send letters to your federal senator or representative without a stamp on the envelope that s right a people s frank after all , the theory of the congressional frank is that it promotes public dialogue , that a more informed electorate is better able to govern itself as thomas jefferson wrote on behalf of the frank , communications between elected officials and their constituents should be free , full and unowned by any this , jefferson said , would give the will of the people the influence it ought to have why should the frank work only one way \? why not extend it to citizens who want to let their representatives know what s in their hearts and on their minds , as canada does \? the frank could be an antidote to citizen apathy and alienation too many incumbents send out too many newsletters too close to election day they would be less inclined to propagandize this way if they knew that tomorrow s mail might bring a deluge of objections to such misuse of the frank much has been written about how politicalaction committees and previous campaign finance reforms such as spending limits have inadvertently functioned as a sort of incumbency insurance but little has been said , except by challengers , about how the congressional frank preserves the status quo the only serious argument against a people s frank is that it would cost too much the postmaster in the house of representatives has testified that in 1989 the house received more than 260 million pieces of mail from the public , at a cost of about 80 million even if the cost of a free mailing privilege were twice that , a country that spends 183 million on the voice of america ca n't afford not to invest in the people s right to be heard by their own representatives the beauty part of the people s frank is that a limited test would n't cost the taxpayer a nickel all congress has to do is declare that onehalf of each representative s current franking budget for mass mailings be allocated for citizens' replies for starters , the law could require congress to enclose franked return envelopes or postcards in every mass mailing that would temporarily cut oneway massfranked mail in half , and seems a reasonable way to launch the experiment such a reform is no more a panacea for democracy s malaise than are campaign finance reform , universal voter registration , free television time for all candidates , a none of the above option on every ballot and lowering the barriers to third parties but like these other overdue reforms , a twoway frank , while not a substitute for committed , contentbased political activity , can only add zest to the democratic brew
sometime between now and november , the fortunes of the owens family will take a dramatic turn for the better eugene william \( billy \) owens , the youngest of marsha and william s five children , is expected to be the first player selected in the national basketball association draft on june 26 the nba will hold the lottery this afternoon to determine which team has that first pick , and the versatile , 6foot9inch owens , who has been compared to magic johnson , dropped out of syracuse with a year of eligibility remaining hoping to win the honor although some experts feel that larry johnson , a 69 forward from the university of nevadalas vegas or kenny anderson , the mercurial sophomore guard from georgia tech could go first , each can expect to sign multiyear contracts that will pay them millions of dollars a season this is a dream that s going to come true for me if everything goes well , owens said last week from las vegas , nev , where he was visiting johnson larry and i have been good friends for a couple of years we joke about the lottery he says he s going to be no 1 , i say i'm going to be no 1 what it basically comes down to is that we do n't really care who goes first we just tell each other 'go for what you can get' impending windfall , modest plans but for all of the excitement of owens s imminent windfall , neither he nor his parents are particularly moved by the prospect of an accelerated life style mrs owens she hoped that one day the family would move into a new home in a better neighborhood , but that was about it owens s father coaches football at carlisle \( pa \) high school and has worked three jobs for about as long as he can remember to support three sons and two daughters he said that he s had to do so much with so little that he becomes offended by suggestions that he can now coast sure , at some point in your life you just want that comfort zone to be able to enjoy life , he said but i could have survived whether billy made it to the pros or not obviously , it was a struggle to raise five children because i 've worked two and three jobs at a time i 've worked all my life and i 've survived that s the way i am that s the way i was brought up as a player and a person , billy owens , who turned 22 on may 1 , is practically a mirror image of his father he has cultivated the same solid work habits , the matteroffact lease on life and a suspicion of spending money or taking a shot that s not there asked about his goals in professional athletics , owens said they are fairly simple i 'd like to have some fun , make wise decisions off the court , make my mother happy and put some money away for my son 3yearold lavail demetrius and be partowner of my own business it s definitely a goal , to get my parents off north street reality will hit asked how he felt about becoming a millionaire , owens said that with the draft and contract negotiations still to come , the idea of having that much money was too abstract to consider i do n't have any money in my pocket right now , he said i guess when the time comes when i sign that contract maybe then it 'll hit me but right now , it s the same ol' billy about the only thing he knows for sure is where and with whom he 'd like to play , but since none of the teams he 'd like to play for are participating in the lottery , it s out of his hands the lakers are my team , he said if i could play in a big city like chicago , los angeles or new york , it would be great i just want to play with a big man like ewing in new york or olajawon in houston building a management team playing with anybody in the nba is still a long way off there is an ocean of negotiations and business decisions between today s lottery , next month s draft and owens s first professional jump shot for the last two months , owens , with the help of his father and family friends , has been assembling a management team that will negotiate contracts , secure endorsements and otherwise market the player it has been an eyeopening experience for all , though not a particularly pleasant one the business part of all this is crazy , owens said for some reason , i thought the money would just come to you and you did n't have to worry about it you 're meeting people who you do n't know from jack , and all of a sudden they 're handling your money it gets long and frustrating trying to find someone to manage your money and look out for your best interest 'everyone wants a part of it' the thing that s tough about this is that i never knew these people in my life and all of a sudden they 're coming , owens s father added my son s going to be rich and everyone wants a part of it i never heard of those people before and i do n't know if i would have ever met them if billy had n't have been in this position i know that comes with the turf everybody s looking to do a job , everybody s looking to make money but i still have a problem with it owens has narrowed the search for an agent to negotiate his contract , and has already selected a los angelesbased marketing firm to handle his endorsements \( they tell me you make more money off the court than you do on the court \) and has hired sonny vaccaro as his manager vaccaro works for nike and has long been involved in virtually every aspect of the game , from conducting summer camps to promoting allstar tournaments ultimately , owens s family may wind up handling most of his business his father has already formed a corporation called billy ball inc , which is made up of family and friends despite the hassles of assembling his business team , owens said that he had n't thought twice about leaving syracuse after i had my press conference to announce my decision , i went back to my room and i was thinking 'did i do the right thing \? ' he recalled but i'm over that now

as bastionfalling goes , this is some fall forced to choose between bonesmen who are women and no bonesmen at all , the alumni of yale university s skull and bones which fancies itself the nation s most influential fraternity have voted to admit women behind the thick stone walls of their windowless fortress in new haven , separated from the hoi polloi by a padlocked iron door , a supersecret allmale committee of this supersecret allmale society will decide in the next few weeks how to switch to coeducation sidney lovett , the secretary of the association that runs skull and bones , said yesterday that a timetable would probably be worked out by the time the new school year starts in the fall will they be bonespersons \? and so women will go where none has ever gone before , if all the old skull and bones stories are to be believed whether people tapped for membership who are widely rumored to go through such initiation rituals as lying in a coffin and recounting their sexual pasts will henceforth be known as bonespersons , mr lovett would not say nor would he say whether the eight men and seven women who were tapped by the senior class in the spring would be admitted after all , or whether bones would choose a different group of undergraduates but he indicated that there would not be separate initiation rituals for the women my assumption is that those major traditions will not be altered , he said it seems to me that this is what we voted about after the 15 seniors in the 1991 club defied their elders and tapped the women for the 1992 contingent , the alumni board locked the students out of the tomblike headquarters and announced that they would not recognize the new group yesterday several bonesmen who , in keeping with the society s tradition of secrecy , refused to be identified talked about the referendum on admitting women the alumni board , reversing the course it had so confidently charted only a few weeks before , recommended this several weeks ago , subject to ratification by the members a fairly close vote some bonesmen said the outcome was not exactly lopsided , with the referendum passing by only about 40 votes some said that older members had remained opposed to admitting women , while younger ones seemed favored the idea mr lovett , insisting that he had not seen the final figures on the referendum , said the 40vote margin was correct he said the tally was done by a certified public accountant in new york i 've forgotten which one , but we did n't wish it to be in our own hands , he said the ballots were not sent to the 800 or so living bonesmen by firstclass mail or anything so down to earth , but by registered mail mr lovett said 686 bonesmen returned the forms at the white house , the home of a bonesman from 1948 \( who was sworn in as president by one from 1937 , associate justice potter stewart \) , a spokeswoman was asked if president bush would comment on the decision to admit women no , he wo n't , said the spokeswoman , who , acting like a bonesperson , even refused to give her name
the results of 9 of the 38 city council primaries held on thursday were so close that their final outcomes probably will remain in doubt until sept 25 , after absentee ballots are tabulated and votes are meticulously recounted even then , several elections may be challenged in court , raising the possibility that judges may order new races in districts where there is evidence of impropriety or fraud that would provide a fittingly chaotic conclusion to the decadelong process of restructuring the city s government , which began with a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the board of estimate some candidates in close races wasted little time making claims about voting irregularities perpetrated by their opponents several said they were certain to challenge the results in court acting as if they won there are many irregularities that took place , said adam clayton powell 4th , who trailed william del toro by 27 votes in the eighth district in upper manhattan we have plenty of witnesses , plenty of evidence it s a fight , but we 're confident we 're going to win like many of the secondplace finishers in tight races , mr powell waged psychological warfare by assuming the stance of the victor he spent yesterday afternoon traveling east harlem in his campaign car , thanking voters through a rooftop loudspeaker while recounts and court challenges are unlikely to drastically alter the ethnic or ideological composition of the council , they could determine which newcomers become power brokers at city hall and whether two longtime incumbents survive in the second district on manhattan s lower east side , miriam friedlander , an 18year veteran of the council , was trailing antonio pagan by 121 votes in the 44th district in brooklyn , noach dear , a nineyear veteran , was losing to robert j miller by 16 votes splitting small baskets of votes the combination of an unusual thursday election , the absence of a topoftheticket race , a confusing array of newly drawn districts and a recessiondriven malaise contributed to extremely low turnout none of the races generated a turnout of more than 26 percent and nine districts had turnouts of 15 percent or less large fields of opportunistic candidates found themselves splitting small baskets of votes as a result , nine races were decided by a total of 669 votes the closest race was in the 31st district in queens , where unofficial results showed juanita e watkins defeating malcolm a smith by 15 votes naomi r bernstein , a spokeswoman for the board of elections , said that the nine races with margins of fewer than 170 votes were too close to call i do n't ever remember an election that had this many close races , said the council speaker , peter f vallone 9tenths of 1 percent although the expansion of the council to 51 seats from 35 was intended to make city politics more democratic , some of the results suggest that the city s brand of democracy was hardly participatory five democratic candidates won primaries with fewer than 2 , 000 votes one of them , howard weiss , won the 10candidate race in the 19th district in queens with 1 , 346 votes , or 17 percent of the ballots cast of the 143 , 943 people who live in the 19th district , according to the 1990 census , 81 percent are of voting age of those , 68 , 965 , or 59 percent of the voting age population , are registered voters of those , 37 , 151 , or 54 percent of the registered voters , are enrolled democrats of those , 8 , 100 , or 22 percent of the enrolled democrats , went to the polls and of those , 1 , 346 , or 17 percent of the voters , cast ballots for mr weiss thus , mr weiss won the democratic primary , which is tantamount to election in his democratic district , by capturing the votes of ninetenths of 1 percent of his district s residents leveling the playing field it s certainly something that can remind us that every vote counts , said representative thomas j manton , who also serves as the queens county democratic leader it s the one who gets out the votes who wins , and in our plurality system you do n't always need a lot of votes to win at first glance , the elections seem a successful proving ground for the city s new system of public campaign financing , which was first used in 1989 of the 38 leaders , according to the unofficial results , 27 chose to participate in the program in the 19 races without incumbents , 16 were won by publicly financed candidates there were a couple of races where it really leveled the playing field , mr vallone said other contests

seward , alaska , may 7 there are as many ways to catch fish as there are lies to tell about them , but none are stranger , more frenetic or less safe than the annual alaska halibut derby , the oklahoma land rush of commercial fishing at the stroke of noon today , about 4 , 000 commercial fishermen lowered enough baited hook lines into the water to circle the globe in one of the most intense foodgathering rituals in north america , they have , according to current regulations , only 24 hours to catch as much halibut as human endurance , or greed , will allow to some crew members , who fly here from chicago , fish for a day , and return home with 20 , 000 , the derby is a vestige of pure american capitalism to others , who labor without sleep or balance on a boat that may come back emptyhanded , the derby is a marathon of misery today may be one of the last maddash openers next month , the international officials who govern halibut fishing will probably vote on a recommendation to make the season more like other kinds of fishing , in which a limited number of boats spend months to get their catch eliminating the derby would not be mourned by consumers and restaurant owners who used to get fresh halibut through much of the year but now can buy it on only a few days even fishermen are complaining that the derby is out of control nonetheless , those who now have halibut licenses could get rich the proposal would limit new licenses and would allow current license to be resold scars and bad weather as it is , commercial halibut fishing is open to anyone with a few hundred dollars for a license and a boat that can withstand the torture of a spring day in the gulf of alaska because many fishermen expect that the licensing will soon be closed , providing a windfall to current license holders , the seas have gotten more crowded every year you 've got absolute madness out there , said bob alverson , who represents a group of boat owners it used to be really professional , something everybody had a lot of pride in but now , god help us here in seward , a port surrounded by glaciershedding mountains 120 miles south of anchorage , the opener began today in typical fashion a wind chill of 19 degrees , 10foot swells in open water , 40knot winds and several thousand boats jostling for position this is nice weather compared to some years , said kris schonberg , as he piloted the lady anne out of seward unless there s a hurricane , i always go out but i do n't really care what it s like i love this opener mr schonberg showed a scar on his finger from a hook that caught him two years ago see , he said , you 're only going to get hooked once every seven years this happened two years ago , so i'm safe for at least another five mr schonberg s crew of five baited a 25milelong line of hooks with bloody shanks of herring , one hook every eight feet at precisely noon , the line is dropped to the bottom , several hundred feet down the crew members have been trying to stay away from coffee , sugar and alcohol , because the next 24 hours of battle will drain them of strength instead they are eating vitamins common sense , they say , fades with fatigue the pacific halibut , somewhat similar to atlantic flounder , is a huge , smalleyed , ugly fish some of which weigh up to 400 pounds fresh from water , it tastes better than lobster to many palates the halibut were fished during world war ii to provide vitamin a to help pilots improve their night vision prized by west coast restaurants , the catch will bring fishermen up to 2 a pound , far more than most species of salmon will bring hooks and blood everywhere but a 250pound halibut flopping around on a small deck in high seas is not a thing of sport or great taste it is like a prizefighter gone mad in a crowded elevator your adrenalin gets going , and fish and hooks and blood are everywhere , said tracy smith , a crew member on mr schonberg s boat i would n't wish this on anyone a wall of electronic guidance systems everything from a weather satellite fax machine , sophisticated snar , autopilot steering system and a computer that tells where the fishing lines have been dropped is helping the lady anne with its fishing when the halibut are pulled in , they are snared with a big gaffing hook , bonked on the nose , gutted and placed on ice deep in the hull mr schonberg is hoping to catch 70 , 000 pounds of halibut by noon tomorrow , an amount well above the entire american catch of atlantic halibut last year nearly 30 million pounds of pacific halibut will be taken in this opener , and if biologists decide that the spring catch has not seriously depleted the north pacific , they could allow another 24hour halibut opener in the fall crew members get a percentage of the catch , which varies according to experience and boat a seasoned hand on mr schonberg s boat could make more than 20 , 000 if the boat hits its target or the crew could tangle with the lines of other fishermen and a member would take in less than 1 , 000 the huge haul will actually help stabilize his boat , mr schonberg said in past years , some boats have loaded beyond their limit to float , capsizing crew and fish into the chill waters tired and careless since 1982 , there has been a 300 percent increase in injuries during the halibut opener everything from broken ribs to hands slashed by knives what happens is , people get tired , and then careless , mr alverson said , but they feel they have to keep pushing on as the injuries mount and consumers complain about being able to get fresh halibut only once or twice a year , as against 160 days of 10 years ago , the officials who managed halibut say change is imminent i do n't think the present system benefits anyone , said dr donald mccaughran , who is a member of the two groups that govern the season at its meeting in june , one of the groups , the north pacific management council , is scheduled to take up a proposal to limit the number of boats allowed to fish , thereby opening the season beyond one or two days , ms mccaughran said a quota system could potentially be based on each boat rather than on the total catch if halibut fishing , like salmon fishing , is limited , then anyone now holding a license could make money selling it to those who do not have one some salmon licenses here , for example , now sell for as much as 250 , 000 mr schonberg said that any government meddling would take away from the excitement of the opener since he was 3 years old , he said , he wanted to be a fisherman now , at 36 , he has a 57foot boat and he is chasing halibut on the open range of the last frontier if he is lucky , he will make up to 50 , 000 on the opener if not , he will have more debt either way , he said , he will never give it up why do you think my nickname is craze , mr schonberg said , smiling in the drizzle photo at noon off alaska yesterday , some 4 , 000 commercial fishermen were allowed to lower their hook lines and catch as many halibut as possible in 24 hours they began the derby in 40knot winds with a wind chill of 19 degrees crew members of the alta prepared their fishing boat in seward for the event \( ron kuczck jr \) \( pg a21 \)
a bushel of questions and intrigue surrounds today s 56th national football league draft with the 28 teams hoping that the menu offers more treats than tricks the puzzle begins with the no 1 pick and with former notre dame receiver raghib \( rocket \) ismail ismail s agents and the dallas cowboys were negotiating on a contract late yesterday afternoon dallas which gained the no 1 pick from new england in a trade on friday has said it will not select ismail if it is unable to sign him before the draft ismail was scheduled yesterday to fly to los angeles for another meeting with bruce mcnall , the owner of the toronto argonauts of the canadian football league mcnall , who also owns the national hockey league s los angeles kings , has reportedly offered options that would include a 20 million , fouryear package ismail seeks a 14 million , fiveyear package from dallas , according to a person close to the negotiations his talks with the patriots reportedly began with ismail asking for 15 million over five years , which would have made him the secondhighestpaid player in the nfl behind san francisco quarterback joe montana , who makes almost 4 million a season new england was offering ismail 8 million over five years we received their offer , and it was not very satisfactory , the cowboys' majority owner , jerry jones , said yesterday we are very far apart he said the cowboys had made a counteroffer , but had n't heard back from ismail s advisers we traded for the no 1 pick , not an individual , jones said we will be very happy with our first pick jones said that the cowboys had talked to representatives of several other players with the idea they could become our no 1 pick on sunday once dallas makes its final offer , ismail must make this decision less money and more exposure and the competition of the nfl , or more money but none of the fringe benefits of playing in a more powerful league if ismail remains unsigned before the draft gets under way at noon and then is selected as the top choice , it would be the first time that a no 1 pick has been chosen unsigned since tampa bay selected bo jackson in 1986 as in the beginning , as always , said ed abram , one of ismail s agents , the decision will be totally his atlanta and denver have expressed an interest in ismail if dallas looks to make a trade the broncos have the fourth choice in the draft and the falcons own the third pick over all , scouts and general managers agree that this is one of the weakest drafts in recent years , with carl peterson , general manager of the kansas city chiefs , calling it the worst draft of all time but some say it is a draft that has few glamour players in the first round but is stronger than most in the second through fourth rounds and possibly even through six rounds that means that there are several closely rated players in the first rounds and that teams feel even more pressure to choose wisely it also means that unlike in other years , a firstround bust can be more easily followed by a lowerround sensation thus , is there more margin for error \? few club executives in today s draft room at the marriott marquis hotel in manhattan would go that far for them , luck means as much as calculations all 12 rounds of the draft will be completed today and tomorrow no round will begin after 9 tonight during the first two rounds , each team will have 15 minutes to make a selection teams are allowed five minutes for each selection in rounds 3 through 12 top seven players wide receivers and defensive backs are the draft s strengths , defensive linemen its weakness at the nfl scouting combine last february in indianapolis , 27 wide receivers and 26 cornerbacks were listed among the top 246 players the draft s topsevenrated players , according to the national scouting combine , are ismail notre dame cornerback todd lyght , virginia receiver herman moore , miami receiver randall hill , tennessee offensive linemen antone davis and charles mcrae photo raghib \( rocket \) ismail of notre dame \( associated press \) charts order of selection 1 dallas 2 cleveland 3 atlanta 4 denver 5 la rams 6 phoenix 7 tampa bay 8 green bay 9 san diego 10 detroit 11 new england 12 dallas 13 atlanta 14 dallas 15 pittsburgh 16 seattle 17 new england 18 cincinnati 19 philadelphia 20 washington 21 kansas city 22 chicago 23 miami 24 la raiders 25 s francisco 26 buffalo 27 ny giants ny jets do not have a first round pick first round projections this is how timothy w smith and thomas george , who cover the national football league , think the first round of today s draft might go 1 dallas raghib \( rocket \) ismail , wr , notre dame , 510 , 175 lbs wherever he winds up , ismail will be an impact player debate closed 2 cleveland todd lyght , cb , notre dame , 60 , 186 notre dame makes it two in a row and shows why irish eyes have been gleaming so brightly 3 atlanta mike croel , lb , nebraska , 62 , 231 fluid , explosive and their best pick in years 4 denver antone davis , ot , tennessee , 64 , 327 immediate help for elway and humphries 5 rams russell maryland , dt , miami , 61 , 274 the outland trophy winner , his height , 61 , is a concern but his determination against the run and in rushing the passer is not 6 phoenix charles mcrae , ot , tennessee , 67 290 several scouts rank teammates davis and mcrae 1 , 2 among offensive linemen , but mcrae is the choice to grow more rapidly in stature and maybe in output 7 tampa bay eric turner , s , ucla , 61 206 a solid hardhitter who adds bite to a toothless secondary 8 green bay nick bell , rb , iowa , 62 252 a big back who is a former defensive lineman especially fluid for his size , a better runner inside than outside 9 san diego brett favre , qb , so mississippi , 62 , 220 a fouryear starter expected to flourish 10 detroit herman moore , wr , virginia , 63 , 205 the lions bolster the shoot in their erratic runandshoot offense 11 new england dan mcgwire , qb , san diego state , 68 243 could win the job from any patriots quarterback and at 6 feet 8 inches , he becomes the league s tallest passer 12 dallas huey richardson , de , florida , 64 238 dallas draft defense and richardson projects as a roaming linebacker , more fluid than strong 13 atlanta reggie barrett , wr , texasel paso , 63 , 215 a complement for andre rison , barrett has a large frame and bursts easily off the line 14 dallas eric swann , de , no college , 64 , 311 swann , from the minor league , and now defunct , bay state titans , is no ugly duckling 15 pittsburgh alvin harper , wr , tennessee , 63 , 206 explosive , acrobatic , he gives louis lipps a lift 16 seattle pat harlow , ot , southern cal , 66 288 a former defensive lineman who moved to offense in his junior season , a solid run blocker 17 new england bobby wilson , ng , michigan state , 62 276 he plugs a huge hole for the patriots with muscle , agility and balance 18 cincinnati ted washington , de , louisville , 64 303 raw power for a limp defense 19 philadelphia aaron carver , rb , fresno state , 511 , 214 hits holes quickly and might finally be the eagles back who outrushes randall cunningham 20 washington kelvin pritchett , dt , mississippi , 63 281 powerful , physical , intense and solid in oneonone situations 21 kansas city randall hill , wr , miami , 510 , 177 a blazer with charisma and style with success written all over him 22 chicago chris zorich , ng , notre dame , 60 , 267 built like a fireplug in bear tradition 23 miami wesley carroll , wr , miami , 60 , 176 he slipped during scouting workouts but is smooth and has all the tools for an allpro career 24 raiders todd marinovich , qb , southern cal , 64 , 210 raiders can handle shaky background and marinovich can sparkle surrounded by so many skilled offensive weapons 25 san francisco stanley richard , s , texas , 61 , 199 no ronnie lott \( who is \?

following are key sections of the session of the supreme soviet yesterday , including a speech by president mikhail s gorbachev and speeches by other supreme soviet members the speech by nursultan a nazarbayev was transcribed and translated by the new york times and the bbc monitoring service all others were translated by cnn and transcribed by reuters gorbachev s speech distinguished members of the supreme soviet first of all , i would like to support the decision adopted by the supreme soviet to convene an emergency session of the congress of people s deputies , because the problem itself and everything we have gone through over the last days and the decisions that are necessary are all the prerogatives of the congress and this is the first thing i wanted to say and then i would like to suggest the following thing that is to invite members of the russian parliament and members of other parliaments to attend the session of the congress in the period remaining , i would request that the people s deputies working in commissions and committees in different chambers and groups of deputies to discuss and analyze everything that has happened and the reason for that and to draw appropriate conclusions what is needed is not just philosophizing but specific and concrete decisions and actions , which must be based on accurate and uncompromising analysis of everything we have gone through naturally enough , in the buildup to the congress , we will not remain idle in fact , we have begun our work and we have raised the matter of nonconfidence in respect of the cabinet of ministers the cabinet of ministers did not live up to the challenge and actually participated in the coup the decree on the departicization of troops and the kgb has been adopted people have been removed from the key positions in the army i mean those who sided with the plotters new people have been put in key positions the office of the procurator general of the ussr and the russian federation is currently conducting a criminal investigation into the coup you are familiar with the declaration i made earlier i resigned from the post of the general secretary of the communist party and i suggested that the central committee of the communist party should disband itself similar measures and these specific measures are necessary to defuse tensions in the country and we will unswervingly pursue this policy in the future signs of impending coup in this statement that i am making this is not a report , this is just a statement because a report would need much more preparation and we need to consult with each other before i make a report but for the time being , i would like to dwell on the most important issues distinguished deputies , the coup was not entirely unexpected it was not a bolt from the blue it was prepared by the provocative statements of certain generals and people in key positions and certain statements made in the supreme soviet , and there were attempts to undermine the decisions and the coup was impending and appropriate steps were necessary to protect the constitutional order in the country however , that had not been done , although we did draw appropriate conclusions and we rebuffed those attempts in the supreme soviet , in the press and elsewhere however , instead of decisive actions , there was lack of determination , and i am also responsible for that lack of determination but this is one conclusion that must be drawn from that situation there is another cause for the attempt to push the country toward totalitarianism and that is lack of decision in the implementation of democratic reforms , particularly in those structures that spearheaded the coup and this is not only my responsibility but the responsibility of the supreme soviet , the party and the government our good intentions and plans were not implemented because the old mechanism and the old structure of power had not been changed and i mean primarily the state apparatus , which was totally in agreement with the policy of the party and there were people in key positions who remained loyal to the stalinist doctrine we vacillated for a long time and even at this moment , we have not embarked on the road of decisive transformation this has affected the sociopolitical situation in the country in fact , the plotters wanted to take advantage of the difficulties in the country and it is true that the people of the country are facing a very difficult situation there s a slump in living standards the criminality is on the rise and the overall situation is deteriorating there s another reason for the coup and that is there was lack of coordination between the forces of perestroika , between different groups of democratic forces we were divided and both in the session of the congress and at plenary meetings , i used to say again and again that if we are committed to democracy and democratic movement , it would be a major mistake if we get involved in a political struggle
five children and their grandfather were killed last night in a fire that roared within seconds through the ground floor of a twostory frame house in south ozone park , queens , fire officials and witnesses said a 12yearold boy who had escaped the blaze but ran back inside to rescue his brothers and sisters was among those who died , said tom kelly , the fire department deputy commissioner for public information the whole place went up within seconds , said jose torres , the owner of a small grocery store just down the block from the nearly gutted house at 13133 140th street sixteen people the grandparents , their three daughters , a son and 10 children lived in the 20by40foot house commissioner kelly said the dead were marvin weaver , 67 years old , and five of his grandchildren elaine simmons , 1 kalif simmons , 4 lannie simmons , 12 kasheeka woodson , 8 , and keith woodson , 10 cause under investigation we understand from neighbors that 12yearold lannie came out with his grandmother , out the back door , mr kelly said then lannie , he reentered the building to try to save the brothers and sisters but he later died the cause of the fire was under investigation early this morning cans of kerosene and a kerosene heater were found in the house , but it was not known whether either caused the blaze a fire marshal said no evidence of arson had been found mr torres said he was standing outside his bodega just a few minutes before 7 pm , talking with one of the mothers of the children , before the fire i was looking that way , because the lady who lives in the house was with me , he said the rain started to fall , so she started to run to the house , mr torres said there was no fire then but by the time she got to the house , the whole porch was in flames so spontaneous ! not 15 seconds ! i do n't think these people had any chance he said the woman tried to get in , but it was impossible , the fire was so intense she was crying and hollering , 'i want to go in ! ' i had to hold her by the time the first firefighters arrived , within five minutes of the 6 59 pm alarm , the fire was showing out all the firstfloor windows , said chief martin diviney , the commander at the scene the victims were found on the second floor , the chief said the fire was mostly on the first floor , he said , but the heavy heat and smoke went right up the open stairs they were all found in the bedrooms on the second floor you ca n't live in that kind of atmosphere the six were taken to jamaica hospital , mary immaculate hospital and queens hospital center , where they were either declared dead on arrival or died soon after the grandmother , louise weaver , was the only person to escape the fire chief diviney said the other members of the family were not at home commissioner kelly said 50 firefighters from five engine companies , four ladder companies and one rescue company were called to the scene three firefighters were injured , mr kelly said one suffered heat exhaustion , one an eye injury and one a leg injury but none was in serious condition the southeastern queens neighborhood of one and twofamily homes has one of the highest rates of firerelated deaths in the city the clapboard houses , fire union officials say , often lack smoke detectors and fire extinguishers , and the wood is so dry and brittle it acts as kindling many of the homes are overcrowded , occupied by extended families aretha rutledge , who lives three houses from the weaver home and has known the family for 24 years , said there were four bedrooms on the second floor , two in the attic and two in the basement mr weaver , he worked at the courthouse on queens boulevard , she said one of the daughters , verlane simmons , worked at the airport as a security guard , and another daughter , mary woodson , works at the airport in the employment office mrs rutledge and another neighbor said ms simmons and ms woodson were actually foster children of the weavers , who were legal guardians of the youngsters my son went over to the house when the fire was going , mrs rutledge said he went there because he s very close to them and when he saw the firemen take those kids out the window he went into shock pamela hopkins , whose mother lives across the street , said they were very close everywhere the grandfather went in his car , he always took the kids they had cookouts in the backyard every weekend , big birthday parties for each child , where all the neighborhood kids were invited mr torres said the children from the weaver family came to his store 200 times a day all my little friends are gone , he said photo five children and their grandfather died in a fire that swept a frame house in south ozone park , queens a police officer comforted a relative \( steve berman for the new york times \) \( pg 27 \) map of queens indicating site of fire \( pg 27 \)
although they only occasionally grab headlines , and then only when used in their most exotic applications , such as breast implants or the orings of the space shuttle , silicone compounds have become bluecollar mainstays of the chemical world silicone compounds are so widely used in construction , industrial applications , textile production and service sector support businesses like printing and labeling that the earnings growth of the dow corning corporation \( negative in 1982 , slipping since 1987 \) , the largest silicone producer , can be used as an indicator for the health of the economy few worldwide markets the size of silicone s some estimates run as high as 6 billion are made up of so many niches dow corning estimates that it sells more than 5 , 000 silicone products to 105 different segments of industry , none accounting for more than 3 percent of the company s total sales of silicone products the general electric company , the no 2 producer , figures it has more than 4 , 000 silicone products silicones are polymers , or chains of repeating molecules , with spines made up of oxygen alternating with silicon , an element best known today as the most common building block for semiconductors a variety of resins , gels , foams , liquids , pastes and rubberlike materials are made by attaching other chemicals to the polymer backbone or forming crosslinks between polymers silicon is the main constituent of sand and quartz rock and one of the most common elements on earth it has been used for thousands of years in ceramics and has long been known for the easy and stable bonds it forms with oxygen but silicone chemistry did not develop until researchers began to systematically explore the effects of binding silicon to organic compounds early in this century although the basic components are inexpensive , the series of chemical reactions needed to synthesize useful quantities of silicones is anything but there s still a lot of art and a lot of unexplored chemistry , said donald perkins , general manager of general electric s silicone business the players dow corning leads and ge is no 2 dow corning was created in 1943 and quickly introduced the first important silicone product , a superior insulating grease for electrical machinery used to help allied aircraft fly at high altitudes and in low temperatures during world war ii the company was set up by the corning glass works , which in 1938 developed the first silicone product , for insulating fiber glass , and the dow chemical company dow corning , based in midland , mich , last year netted 171 million on sales of 172 billion more than half of its sales of silicone products come from overseas operations the company spends about 8 percent of revenues on research , an unusually high figure in the chemical business general electric , which bases its silicone operations in waterford , ny , entered the business shortly after dow corning with a more efficient manufacturing process that is still used today for many silicone products the company is currently attempting to focus its product line more narrowly , mr perkins said ge , like the other major companies other than dow corning , does not report any figures detailing the extent or profitability of its silicone business a third major american player is the union carbide company after plans to sell its silicone business to ge in 1988 were opposed by the federal trade commission , carbide moved further into the field by purchasing british petroleum s silicone operations in europe the united states is the leading market for the newest applications of silicones , but industry executives here say that europe is catching up fast although no one collects or reports industrywide figures , sales revenues in europe and the far east are thought to be similar to those in the united states major foreign producers include huls , wakker and bayer of germany rhone poulenc in france , and shenetsu in japan medical uses from implants to burn therapy silicone has long been recognized as a useful material for medical equipment , medicines and consumer products like deoderants , shampoos and cosmetics because it can be made in forms that are unusually chemically compatible with the human body in each application , other silicone characteristics also come into play silicones that act as a foamcontrol agent are an active ingredient in many antiacids others are used to lubricate needles a rubbery silicone is used in balloons injected under the skin to stretch it , thus creating more skin for plastic surgeons to work with in reconstructive surgery for burn victims another has supplanted natural rubber in baby bottle nipples one new use of silicones is to chemically encapsulate other compounds in drugs and cosmetics to regulate the release of active ingredients the highestprofile medical silicones recently have been those used in breast implants more than 2 million american women have had silicone implants over the past 30 years , either to enlarge small breasts or restore breasts lost to cancer the implants consist of a hard silicone around a silicone gel in recent years , critics have said that there is evidence linking the operations to a number of diseases
what was the most ironical obstacle in finding the perfect cast for mad forest , the critically praised new play by caryl churchill \? that would be the fitness gap so many actors we saw were in such peak condition , said mark wingdavey , the director of the play presented by the new york theater workshop they looked as if they were just out of the gym which was not exactly the look we needed for a work about the crisis in romania so you chose only the wastrels , did you \? asked mary shultz , who plays five different characters in mad forest she raised a laugh from mr wingdavey and two of her acting colleagues they had gathered on the silent stage of the perry street theater in manhattan on a recent afternoon to talk about the play that has had its run extended to jan 25 we did n't want allamerican men and women , the director said we were looking for actors who had a very particular look and who had very considerable abilities the play by miss churchill , the english playwright , shows how two bucharest families endured life under totalitarian communism , traces their actions during the december 1989 downfall of the ceausescus and follows the families in the social chaos that replaced the old order to populate this sweeping drama , the 11 actors in mad forest take the parts of more than 60 characters \( 2 actors play 10 different parts \) and make 50 frenzied costume changes at one point , at the beginning of the second act , the entire cast must make a complete change of costume in under a minute and a half during the play , characters suffer the oppression of the dread securitate , the state police , endure the endless tedium of meat lines and are afflicted with random power blackouts that necessitate the use of 20 candles onstage every night and during the play s frenetic fiveminute finale , a drunken family walpurgisnacht , mr wingdavey s precise choreography drives the actors through the overlapping dialogue and interlocking movements of five simultaneous interrelated conversations , which erupt in the play s stunning conclusion notes on an answering machine tim nelson , whose four roles include an engineer and a student , described mr wingdavey as an extremely exacting , critical , meticulous director who cajoled us in a remarkably constructive and collegial way this is the only time i 've ever come home from a performance to hear four minutes of notes from mark on my answering machine , after the play had already opened , mr nelson said it was the 43yearold mr wingdavey who first suggested to miss churchill that they go to bucharest to create a romanian drama workshop in january 1990 , shortly after the fall of the ceausescus two months later , miss churchill and mr wingdavey , then the artistic director of the london central school of speech and drama , took 10 of his acting students to bucharest , and after returning to london the group mounted a drama based on the experience the american production comes more than a year after mad forest opened at the royal court theater in london unlike the original english actors , the american cast did not experience romania firsthand and while the play is studded with romanian dialogue , none of the american actors speak the language , or have been to romania 'we could take them to queens' the american actors had to work toward a passionate involvement in a different way , miss churchill , the author of serious money , cloud 9 , top girls and fen , said in a telephone interview from her home in london that way was an immersion in a local romanian universe we could n't take the actors to bucharest , but we could take them to queens , mr wingdavey said the production s set and costume designer , marina draghici , took the cast to romanian restaurants , clubs , churches and social gatherings actors were assigned to interview romanians in the neighborhood and to create theatrical characters based upon them , just as the original cast had done in bucharest although the americans' characters were n't used in the play , they involved the actors deeply in the drama the play s dialogue begins and ends in romanian , and there are romanian phrases and songs in mad forest ms draghici and others coached the cast in mastering stage romanian and in speaking english with a variety of romanian intonations , including voa english , the curious dialect exhibited by those whose english was learned by listening to the voice of america miss churchill and mr wingdavey have known each other for 15 years as members of the joint stock theater company , a sort of socialist theater group , i think you 'd call it , said the director he had previously directed productions of serious money and cloud 9 behind the stage and on it mr wingdavey was the artistic director at the london school from 1988 to 1990 , and is perhaps best known in america as an actor in transplanted bbc series he played the role of zaphod beeblebrox in the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy and mike clode in the glittering prizes in mad forest , his directorial effort was aimed at choreographing the onlookers along with the actors the play is really a dialogue with the audience , he said miss churchill said , things are terribly tentative for those in the audience , as they might be in romania for example , in the initial scenes , long silences and pauses make the audience fidget , as if trapped with the characters in a police state where silence itself is a weapon and when the downtrodden residents of bucharest wait in meat lines , the audience waits with them in addition , scenes and characters are often partly obscured from the audience behind the set s partitions it parallels our own experience of romania when we were there , mr wingdavey said we would see glimpses of things , and we did n't always understand what we were able to see consistent in inconsistency to add to the aura of strangeness , members of the audience are seated on a curious collection of padded seats , wooden chairs , folding chairs , sling seats and benches not all the house lights come on in the same way whenever they 're turned up and although there are eight bulbs in the chandelier that hangs over the stage , only five of them light , approximating gloomy romanian hotel lobbies where working bulbs were never a sure thing , said mr wingdavey aside from the unexpected doubling of roles , another thing that helps enhance the sense of unpredictability for audience members is the profusion of smells , including incense and the pungent odor of the turkish cigarettes smoked by the cast as it faithfully portrays the romanian penchant for nicotine tim and i are nonsmokers , said rob campbell , who plays 10 characters including a mute orphan , an angel , a ghost and a waiter but we found ourselves puffing away during performances like everyone else neither actor has become addicted to nicotine , they said , but the strong cigarettes still make mr nelson dizzy we do n't make it easy for anyone , the actors or the audience , said mr wingdavey but we do make it rewarding photo mark wingdavey , the director of the play mad forest , with cast members at

officials of the solomon r guggenheim museum , which in the past several years has been hatching plans to expand from soho to salzburg , austria , are meeting in manhattan this week with representatives of bilbao , the fourth largest city in spain , to work out the final details on yet another branch the guggenheim museum bilbao a design for the new museum a sprawling , riverside structure of sandblasted steel and concrete by the american architect frank gehry has already been approved juan ignacio vidarte , the director of finance for the region of biscay , which includes bilbao , said in a telephone interview the other day that the project was expected to cost 100 million , and was part of a redevelopment plan for the city that calls for an investment of more than a billion dollars over the next 25 years thomas krens , the director of the guggenheim museum , was not willing to discuss current negotiations , but said that his museum would provide exhibitions , our collection , expertise and administration , but none of the costs there will be no drain on the guggenheim foundation in terms of capital or costs of operation , he continued you can be sure that the 28 members of our board will want to be satisfied on that before we go forward meanwhile , the peripatetic mr krens is overseeing the 24 million renovation and expansion of the spiral museum designed by frank lloyd wright at fifth avenue and 89th street supervising the creation of a 55 million branch museum in soho presiding over temporary offices in midtown manhattan directing the peggy guggenheim museum in venice lobbying for the lastminute reprieve of massachusetts state seed money for the proposed 875 million massachusetts museum of contemporary art \( known as mass moca \) in north adams , mass , which the guggenheim has offered to operate , and concluding a deal with the city of salzburg for the construction of a 90 million guggenheim museum in that city how is he managing all of this when the country is still in the grip of a major recession \? it comes to having faith in the art , faith in the architects , faith in the cities and faith in the internationalization of the art world , said mr krens in an interview last week at the gutted building at 575 broadway , at prince street , that is soon to house the guggenheim soho museum he paused , and added with a subtle narrowing of his large eyes , maybe there s also a modest act of defiance here it was the salzburg project , which has received wide publicity in europe since it was announced in 1989 , mr krens said , that attracted the proposal from bilbao what made him take the proposal seriously was learning that bilbao , an old steel town on the bay of biscay , plans over the next 25 years to transform itself into a modern financial center so one day last april , mr krens found himself circling bilbao in a helicopter scouting a possible location for the new musuem he chose one on the banks of the nervion river , which bisects the city mr gehry , speaking from his office in los angeles , said , the space has enormous sculptural appeal , in a river valley with surrounding hills and the city the museum is to open in september 1995 even before the bilbao museum was announced , mr krens was criticized for stretching himself , his staff and resources too thin the metropolitan museum does 80 million a year in their merchandise operation and nobody says that distracts them , he said when the criticism was mentioned it all depends on whether you 're running a holding action or looking forward as for wear and tear on the collection that is intended to rotate from one guggenheim museum to another , mr krens said that in the past about 97 percent of it had to be kept in storage the art is only effective if it can be seen , he said we want to balance access with security , care and conservation , and we can do all of that most effectively with multiple sites under the supervision of a single staff photo a model of frank gehry s design for the guggenheim museum bilbao \( frank c dougherty for the new york times \)
moscow , june 15 president mikhail s gorbachev today accelerated efforts to convince the western world that this time , he really means it when he says the soviet union wants to move swiftly to a market economy , though on his own terms in an interview broadcast on soviet television tonight , after leading a meeting of soviet officials and scientists on privatization , he said he had accepted an invitation to address the leaders of seven industrialized democracies in london next month after their summit meeting july 1517 some say gorbachev is going to london as a blackmailer , others say he s going as a supplicant , he said , playing down to his soviet audience the idea that the soviet union would get largescale western aid only by giving in to western demands all this is not serious , it s superficial and irresponsible nobody s going to to put anyone on his knees , nobody s going to dictate to anyone jacques attali , president of the european bank for reconstruction and development , said after meeting with mr gorbachev this morning that he thought the soviet leader was fully committed to a market economy but mr gorbachev , who faces strong resistance from communist e hardliners at home , is clearly eager to be seen here as speeding reforms for his own reasons , and not as a capitulation to the west by the same token , some western leaders are bending over backward to avoid putting mr gorbachev into an uncomfortable position mr attali said today that he would like to have the authority to invest more than the 702 million his bank now can apply to projects in the soviet union he said mr gorbachev had also accepted an invitation to talk with officials of the bank during his visit to london next month they 're going in the right direction , but there is a need to clarify a certain number of things the relationship between the center and the republics , the stabilization of the money supply , taxes , and precise laws on privatization , separating the state from capital , mr attali said at a news conference it ca n't be done overnight pressure on gorbachev some of the answers might come if mr gorbachev and boris n yeltsin , the newly elected president of the russian republic , can agree on elements of a new sevenyear plan to integrate the soviet union into the world economic system that was worked out by soviet and american economists in cambridge , mass , earlier this week the main soviet architect of the plan , grigory a yavlinsky , an economist with ties to mr gorbachev and mr yeltsin , will show it to mr gorbachev at the beginning of the week , according to his associates here the american version of the still largely secret plan will be presented to president bush at about the same time , mr yavlinsky told the soviet newspaper izvestia on friday the election of mr yeltsin , who supports radical economic change in the country s largest republic , will increase pressure on mr gorbachev and his government to agree to the new plan , mr yeltsin s supporters say , but there are still questions here about how the authorities intend to proceed mr attali seemed to hint after seeing mr gorbachev in the kremlin today that a currency revision that would replace or sharply devalue the ruble could be in the offing the ruble is now nearly worthless as a means of acquiring goods and services russians want to buy they pay 30 to 35 rubles apiece for united states dollars instead mr attali , reporting that he and mr gorbachev had discussed the importance of achieving internal convertibility of the ruble as a first step in getting soviet inflation under control , was asked what that term meant other soviet officials have used it frequently as well i ca n't comment , the french banker said it is a very sensitive matter but valentin s pavlov , the soviet prime minister , said in an interview with the government newspaper izvestia today that the withdrawal from circulation of 50 and 100ruble notes last winter had not achieved its purpose of drastically reducing the stock of illicitly obtained money in circulation the run on already scarce consumer goods has continued even after prices on bread and most other household products were raised last spring , leaving store shelves largely empty , he said instead of tens of billions of rubles , he said , we got ten people and companies that could prove they had acquired the large notes by legal means were able to exchange them for smaller ones the overall money supply , which has been growing as fast as the government can print bills , remains too high , having grown 20 percent a year for the last two years exchanging the notes was not currency reform , mr pavlov said what the soviet union needs before a market economy can even begin to get going here , even some soviet communist party members agree , are three things clarity in national and republic laws about the nature of private ownership of business or property , goods that people want to buy , and money that has the confidence of buyers and sellers none of those conditions exists now , and from all accounts it will take years to put them all in place
washington , oct 11 president bush today vetoed a 65 billion bill that would have provided as many as 20 additional weeks of unemployment benefits for 3 million people who have been out of work more than half a year the president said the measure would damage the economic recovery by abandoning budget discipline mr bush s 23d veto was accompanied by a message intended to blunt the political issue the democrats have made out of his opposition to this bill and a similar measure that he killed in august he said his administration was deeply concerned about the needs of the unemployed and their families mr bush added that if a responsible bill were passed that did not violate last year s budget agreement , he would sign it immediately but he did not seek to draw attention to his action today the veto , which was threatened before congress passed the bill last week , was announced while much of the nation s attention was concentrated on televised hearings concerning judge clarence thomas s nomination to the supreme court the president had until oct 19 to act little hope for override none of mr bush s vetoes haves been overridden the democrats who pushed this bill are not optimistic about overriding this one , for they would have to persuade two of the 35 senate republicans who opposed it last week to change their votes to do so the 65to35 vote there was short of the twothirds majority required under the constitution to override , although the 300to118 margin in the house exceeded it comfortably the senate will take an override vote next week , said senator george j mitchell of maine , the majority leader , who complained that with the veto , president bush has once again demonstrated that he is more willing to assist those abroad than americans here at home as evidence of that attitude , he cited mr bush s willingness to issue emergency declarations under last year s budget act in order to help kurds , turks and israelis this measure would be financed by declaring an emergency and increasing the deficit by its cost mr bush was able to kill a similar measure in august without a veto because it was drafted in a way that allowed him to sign it first and then refuse to declare the emergency the bill he vetoed today already included a declaration of emergency , so he had to veto it to kill it the democrats' interest in making a political issue out of unemployment was reflected not only in mr mitchell s language , but also in the announcement by representative vic fazio of california , chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee , that his organization was running radio and television advertisements in the districts of house republicans who opposed the bill mr fazio said it was cynical for the veto to be issued during the thomas hearing but senator bob dole of kansas , the senate minority leader , said the veto would force the democrats to choose between real extended benefits for the jobless or just political benefits at the expense of unemployed americans he said the democrats could choose between two cheaper measures , with shorter periods of extended benefits , which mr bush would sign one is his own and the other is offered by senator dave durenberger , republican of minnesota both would be paid for by extending a tax law procedure for using the internal revenue service to collect defaulted student loans and by auctioning off unused radio frequencies costs of 2 alternatives the durenberger bill would cost 39 billion and provide as many as 15 weeks of extended benefits for workers whose regular 26 weeks have run out the dole bill would cost 33 billion and provide as many as 10 weeks of benefits in the states with the highest levels of unemployment plus special provisions to be made by the secretary of labor in pockets of very high unemployment democrats in both houses have been reluctant to move ahead with the plan of auctioning the radio frequencies , and some broadcasters have opposed the idea in complaining about the veto today , mr mitchell and other democrats said there was about 8 billion in a federal trust fund set up to pay extended benefits of as many as 13 weeks but , although national unemployment was 67 percent in september and about 300 , 000 workers exhaust their benefits each month , the rules for paying benefits out of this fund are drawn so tightly that workers in no state are now eligible the bill vetoed today by mr bush would provide 20 weeks of additional benefits in states where the total unemployment rate over the previous six months averaged 8 percent or more , 13 weeks in states where the rate is 7 percent or more , and 7 weeks in all other states the president complained about several elements of the democratic bill today he complained that its three tiers of extended benefit levels amounted to a complex , cumbersome system he said it could slow reemployment and would result in benefit delays , payment inaccuracies and escalating administrative costs he also complained that the democratic bill , unlike existing law or the dole or durenberger measures , used a state s total unemployment as a standard current law and the republican bills use the rate of unemployment among insured workers , who are about half of those employed the administration contends that the rate based on the insured is more accurately calculated and thus a more precise tool the democrats maintain that it does not reflect real conditions in a recession labor market , when a large number is unemployed , insured or not , makes it hard to find a job but mr bush s heaviest emphasis was on the budget argument he said that enacting the bill would signal the failure of budget discipline , which would have a negative effect on financial markets that could threaten economic recovery and lead to increased unemployment

dear ms quindlen , the other day at the mall a little boy passing by my throne said that if he did n't find game boy under the tree somebody was going to be in big trouble , adding a word that in my day was spelled ! ! ! what happened to the nice little boys and girls of yesteryear \? are there any left \? be good for goodness' sake , santa claus dear mr claus , yes , santa claus , there is a virginia and despite everything you 've seen on television and read in magazines , the amazing thing about her is how little she s changed since she asked for an orange in her stocking so many years ago the boy you mention is exactly the sort who once would have said , your mother wears army boots he would not have said it in front of you , however , because he believed that you knew who was naughty and nice the world they live in has changed plenty master mall probably learned that word at home a lot of us moms are more loose in our language than in the days when my mother once said oh , hell ! she probably had just broken her toe at the time and then clapped her hand over her mouth our children s speech is anatomically correct , which seems like a good idea until the moment , in a crowded restaurant , when a 2yearold announces stereophonically , grandmom , i have a penis ! they inhabit a far harsher place than the world in which i waited for you each year five million of them under the age of 6 are living in poverty , which means that their toys may come via some church collection program rather than the traditional chimney route fifty years ago , teachers said their top discipline problems were talking , chewing gum , making noise and running in the halls the current list , by contrast , sounds like a cross between a rap sheet and the seven deadly sins drug abuse , absenteeism , alcohol abuse , vandalism , assault , teenage pregnancy , suicide , gang warfare , rape and arson but let s not fall prey to goodolddaysism let s not pretend that none of the children you visited 50 years ago had abusive parents or empty stomachs let s not pretend that the world of bedford falls was perfect i grew up safe , secure and insulated in a suburb in which a protestant was a rarity and a black family an impossibility at this holiday season , my kids consider it one of my great shortcomings that i am ignorant of how to spin a dreidel this is a good thing they grow up faster , santa too many of the virginias of the world have babies when they are still babies themselves too many of them equate maturity with cynicism , and hope with disappointment but there is a part of many of them , even some of the most superficially sophisticated or the most deeply scarred , that accounts for the continuing existence of you in a world that seems at odds with everything you stand for it is that sense of infinite possibility , the genuine wow ! it is that sense that the blinds are not yet drawn between the windows of their eyes and the houses of their hearts the preternatural maturity we see in so many of them comes from us adults it is our response to raising them in a world in which people die from sex and kill for pennies it is to protect ourselves , to trade their innocence for street smarts for our own sake the virginias of the world will tell you they want a madonna cordless microphone and a pair of hoop earrings but it is amazing how many of them still sleep with a tattered fur thing , part bear , part bunny you may be conscious of how many of them no longer believe i marvel at how many of them do i marvel at the pain it causes even the toughest customers to see beneath your beard and discover you are only a man in costume it will be many , many years before some of them understand that you are a standin for what is best within themselves those are the virginias who grow wise but never weary my new year s resolution is to try to be one of them may your days be merry and bright , anna quindlen !
toronto either baseball owners and general managers are the greatest optimists since pollyanna , or they are the greatest dopes since goofy they have had a long and gory history of firing their managers in order , of course , to hire new ones who , in almost every case , are fired , later if not sooner not only does the brass think that the next guy in a dugout has to be better than the guy they 've got , but then they also obviously can never figure out who the best next guy is and he s told to pack his pajamas and hit the road , too during the regular work week last week , four managers were fired and a fifth , jim essian of the cubs , understood that the end was near , after less than a full season as the captain of the ship , the lieutenant of the platoon , the head lemming as it stood , 12 managers of the 26 teams have been dismissed since opening day for being ignoramuses , dolts , nincompoops in other words , they did n't win any division championship lately one , joe morgan of the red sox , won two division titles in the previous three years another , jim lefebvre of seattle , managed his team to its best record in club history , and also saw attendance records set in that dank and dismal cave known as the kingdome both are unemployed , as of last week never before have so many been dismissed in such a compact time frame why \? are the new owners often from the corporate world and rarely like some of the oldtime bosses whose sole income was derived from baseball dumb about how to build a baseball team , seeking a quick fix , buckling to public pressure or simply trying to sell more luxury boxes \? or does it matter \? is a baseball manager important in actual terms , or is the job overrated , and its significance just a figment of john mcgraw s imagination \? it must be pretty important , said cito gaston , the manager of the toronto blue jays , who were down to the minnesota twins by a twogamestoone margin in the american league playoff going into last night s game here because are managers the ones who get the blame for not winning \? it s true that a manager ca n't hit or pitch or catch for his players , he added , but maybe you can motivate them a little you think , 'how would you like to be treated \? ' and treat them that way anything else \? let 'em play and get out of the way the other three managers in the playoffs tom kelly of the twins , bobby cox of the atlanta braves and jim leyland of the pittsburgh pirates were asked the same question , how important is a manager \? each paused and then said the same thing , i do n't know each , though , went on to deplore the rash of recent firings if they fired joe morgan , leyland said when he heard that news , then none of us are safe then each touched on what he believes is the most trenchant part of their jobs leyland , whose springtraining confrontation with one of his stars , barry bonds , seemed to gain the respect of the players , said he actually tries not to be intrusive i keep one eye closed and one ear closed , and pull a pitcher once in a while , and turn 'em loose , he said while some managers have been fired for being too tough , some have been fired for being too easy like now , said leyland , the players are in the clubhouse playing cards and playing a dunk basketball game should i tell them to cut it out and read ted williams s hitting book \? cox said i establish the rules try to be honest with 'em , and then say , 'go get 'em' are these managers being overmodest , or oversimplistic \? what about strategy \? are n't they supposed to be the einsteins , the napoleons , the solomons of the diamond \? how , for example , did the twins jump from last place to first in just one season \? better pitching , said kelly was he responsible for the better pitching \? well , the ownership showed patience with the younger pitchers , and that helped me , he said he added that the acquisitions of jack morris , carl willis and steve bedrosian also improved his mind otherwise , he said , i just ask them to be prepared , help them a little with it , and tell them to run out everything and play hard no half speed certainly , as in other occupations , some baseball managers are better suited for the job than others and dealing with people \( including the press \) appears today to be an even more vital requirement than knowing when to hitandrun after all , the players will take care of the execution or they will not and as soon as they do n't , they will , with ever greater frequency , watch as old skip waves goodbye to them from the back of the fading caboose
if he is wise , an angler will not try to duplicate an unusually rewarding fishing adventure and will use the memory of it not as a goal but as sustenance through the winter and the winter of his years being unwise , i spent 17 evenings from late may through the third week in june striving vainly to recreate a night of flyfishing for striped bass during which i caught and released more than 30 of those fish that banner evening occurred in early june of last year at lobsterville beach on the island of martha s vineyard the fish i caught averaged 24 inches in length , and one , which i kept , was just over the legal 36 inches they were so abundant and cooperative during the latter half of the evening that unless my memory does me a disservice i hooked 12 fish on 12 consecutive casts there were other nights in 1990 during which i caught half a dozen bass or more , but none came close to that ultimate evening during which the water was seething with feeding stripers , some drenching me as they slashed at shoals of terrified sand eels this year i had all my striper flies most of them blueandwhite streamertype creations patterned after the late joe brooks s blonde series tied before the first week in may , and because the spring was unusually warm i began fishing for bass near the end of that month my first two sorties produced nothing , although terns were diving over breaking bass until the light failed the third night , occasional bass began erupting just at dusk and after half an hour of casting i had a solid hit from a fish that took me 15 minutes to land it was over 40 inches long , but weighed only 30 pounds , being lean and racy i scaled it with a garden hoe that night , gutted it and cut off its head and tail so that it would fit in a big icefilled cooler i saved the head for chowder , of course convinced that the 30pounder presaged more and larger bass , i angled longer and harder in the three evenings that followed , but had only one hit , a heavy fish that remained hooked for about 10 seconds the next night , after hearing reports that both fly and spin anglers were doing well in the area long after midnight , i remained on the beach until 3 am and caught nothing two nights later , still consumed with the desire to catch stripers , i went fishless from 8 to 11 pm and was in my truck getting ready to depart when cooper gilkes , a seemingly indefatigable vineyard fly fisherman , pulled alongside you are leaving when you should be arriving , cap , said cooper we had a ball with them last night around midnight and thereafter i'm fished out , coop , i said i have to quit coop went down to the beach i started the truck s engine , then turned it off and joined him we fished side by side for a couple of hours without a single hit , sometimes backing out of the water to talk with shadowy figures , most of them fly fishers who were moving up and down the shore i separated from coop and walked a half mile to the east a nearly full moon emerged from the clouds , enabling me to see an occasional breaking bass sometime around 3 am , scores of stripers were feeding only a few feet from shore i offered them a dozen different flies , but they were intent on the real thing , tiny sand eels frustrated and weary , i called it a night , going to bed to the predawn caroling of a thrush several days passed before i returned to lobsterville and during that period small bluefish , most under five pounds , had moved in evening after evening , i caught three , four or five of them before full darkness arrived on one night , i also caught and released one 32inch bass and lost a truly large striper that went deep into my backing before the knot linking fly to leader failed i 'd tied that knot carelessly , being harassed by mosquitoes and gnats in the nights that followed , i met leon bailey , a vacationing fly fisherman from longmeadow , mass , on the beach we fished side by side for several evenings , landing bluefish and an occasional sublegal striper on my 17th sortie , a night with light fog and no wind , i hooked my first bass of the evening , an 18inch fish , at 10 30 in the next hour , i caught three more between 24 and 30 inches , then was fast to something more substantial beached , it was smaller than i thought it would be , but with leon holding a light i found that it was exactly 36 inches long i kept that fish in my next six casts , i hooked and lost three bass , headshakers that thrashed about on the surface i was beginning to believe that another incredible night was under way , but the action ended as abruptly as it had begun cutting that 36incher into steaks the following morning , i realized that my unseemly lust for bass had subsided since then , i have visited lobsterville at sunset occasionally , spending less than two hours each time this has produced plenty of bluefish for friends and family , and sometime between now and november i may beach a goodsized striper or two it could happen tonight drawing
africa explores 20thcentury african art may not seem like a radical exhibition , but it is a lot in it seems familiar there are realistic sculptures , objects following tribal traditions , large paintings with touches of velazquez and jasper johns and small paintings that combine words and images in ways suggesting conceptual art but if you ride out the impression of familiarity and any disappointment about the absence of work that is intended to turn african art on its head , you are likely to find this exhibition eyeopening with its challenging and farreaching 300page catalogue , it manages either to question just about every prevailing assumption about african art or else blow it to pieces this pioneering twomuseum exhibition , at the center for african art on the upper east side and at the new museum of contemporary art in soho , was organized by susan vogel , the executive director of the center it bears the stamp of her sevenyearold institution whose exhibitions have consistently given the public the freedom to respond as it wishes while encouraging it to pay attention and take nothing for granted the center s focus , like the focus of this exhibition , is subsaharan africa the installations at the two museums do not so much complement as mirror each other at both locations , the exhibition begins the same way , with the commemorative realistic sculptures of sunday jack akpan \( from nigeria \) and the plant , hen , onion or mercedesbenzshaped coffins of kane kwei \( from ghana \) , which combine all sorts of influences and information in an easy , freewheeling manner from the beginning , the exhibition as a whole says , wait before you interpret for example , if mr kwei s mercedesbenz coffin , complete with satin and lace interior , seems to be a critique of consumerism , it is in fact a total embrace of it in a continent where this car is , ms vogel writes , the preeminent african symbol of wealth , status , and respect and however much these objects seem to be easily definable as sculptures , they do not speak to art and they were not made for galleries or museums their purpose is functional at both locations , the installation includes kiosklike columns plastered with quotes and information about the artists and their work both museums include work in five categories conceived by ms vogel international art is made by artists who are academically trained , live in cities and often exhibit in galleries and museums traditional art is villagebased and made by artists working with a minimum of invention for their own ethnic groups new functional art is not usually identified with single ethnic groups and often is made on commission in villages and towns extinct art is traditional art that is no longer made and urban art is an immediate , extroverted , often selfpromotional art , totally concerned with the present the more coherent installation is at the center for african art , where the rooms have an intimacy that suits the work , and the categories within the show are clear the space at the new museum is sprawling and the installation there loses some of its particularity by devoting the largest area to the kind of art that would be very much at home in western galleries and museums the place to begin is uptown the title , africa explores , suggests part of ms vogel s agenda this is a clear attempt to present african artists as active explorers and exploiters rather than passive specimens being explored and exploited by other cultures from the title it is also clear that the exhibition is part of a continuing process it follows the magicians of the earth in paris in 1989 , which brought together contemporary art from all over the world , and contemporary african artists changing tradition , at the studio museum in harlem last year , which brought to new york nine painters and sculptors from six countries , many with modernist roots three artists in africa explores mr akpan , mr kwei and the moralizing , quickwitted and highspirited cheri samba \( from zaire \) were in the magicians of the earth all three are far more coherent in the context of this show none of the artists here were in the studio museum show , although this exhibition does include institutionally supported african artists and artists influenced by modernism , notably iba n 'diaye , a senegalese painter whose insistence that african artists can be whatever they want to be has carried considerable historical weight one of the distinguishing features of this exhibition is that it does not , in principle , exclude anything the 133 works from 15 countries in africa explores are extremely diverse they include photographs of africans in which a longing to be recorded by the camera seems , at times , almost a physical part of the print clean , idolshaped pots by magdelene odundo , a kenyan living in london , and neoexpressioniststyle paintings praising or parodying african fetishes and myths by ouattara , a painter from the ivory coast now living in new york
i can easily tell you what thrilled me most about the crucible , the inaugural production of the national actors theater seeing 21 actors lined up in a semicircle on the stage of the belasco theater for the curtain call that s what it takes to put on arthur miller s play , 21 actors of varying ages , shapes and dispositions of course , we never get them all at once in the course of the evening they come and go , as the drama dictates , driven by the winds of hysteria blowing through salem , mass , in 1692 the only time they do come together is after the hysteria has taken its toll the young girls , who have been spotting witches in the floorboards and the treetops , have finally been discredited , although not before mr miller s hero , john proctor , has chosen death on the gallows and his good name over life and a politically expedient confession then , there they are , side by side , 21 actors holding hands , bowing and smiling with the particular blend of pride and sheepishness that you often find in people when they 're being publicly congratulated a cast that size is all but unheard of on broadway these days , unless you 're dealing with a musical the chorus line of the will rogers follies may go on and on and on \( actually , there are 16 new ziegfeld girls on tap i just checked \) and at times , it looks as if les miserables has chosen to put to work all the ablebodied inhabitants of a parisian arrondissement but plays are another matter they 're subject to stricter and stricter population control consider some recent broadway entries shadowlands had a cast of 10 i hate hamlet , 6 the speed of darkness , 5 lost in yonkers carries on with 7 , although when she was still starring in it , irene worth was forceful enough to count for 2 if the smallcast play has become more or less the rule on broadway , it is very much the exception in the history of the theater so there s a reason for the bodies on the stage of the belasco that goes beyond the immediate demands of mr miller s play you ca n't have a repertory company devoted to the classics without lots of actors the national actors theater , which hopes to be that company , is not starting out big it is starting out realistic it is also , regrettably , starting out dull only fritz weaver manages to rise above the deadly earnestness that the israeli director yossi yzraely has brought to the production as deputygovernor danforth , mr weaver is in charge of the witch hunt , and if fanaticism makes him dangerous , egotism makes him formidable draped in billowing burgundy robes , the hollows of his face set off by a powderwhite beard , he could be an old testament prophet announcing glad tidings but his nose , large and sharp , suggests the beak of a rapacious bird , and his eyes burn with a feverish righteousness when he speaks , it is with a deceptive resonance that enfolds the accused in understanding reason will prevail , it seems to promise , in these difficult times then his patience snaps , a blazing fury grips him , adding to his already imposing stature , and the resonance that was so reassuring is suddenly like an ominous roll of thunder with each striding entrance , mr weaver rouses the production to life , and each time he exits , it tumbles back into a leaden gravity the crucible was written partly as a rebuke of the house unamerican activities committee , which in the early 1950 s had the nation momentarily believing in a red menace by flushing communists out of nooks and crannies , where , more often than not , there were none for all the rightness of its moral stance , though , the play emits an air of sanctimony which , if not checked , can lead to the bloat of selfimportance mr yzraely , checking nothing , goes for momentousness it is a fatal miscalculation no sooner has the curtain gone up on david jenkins s set a clearing in the woods than the ending is a foregone conclusion there s no foliage anywhere , just huge tree trunks , rising up like so many gnarled prison bars and filtering out any light that might dispel the hobgoblins this is n't salem , it s some kingdom of gloom the death sentence has already been signed and sealed and remains only to be delivered pleading will be for naught protests futile from a theatrical standpoint , that s going at it backward the way you make the crucible work , it seems to me , is to insist first on its homeliness the zealotry can fend for itself with no encouragement but if we have no sense of ordinary lives to begin with , the horror of ordinary lives destroyed is greatly minimized at the center of this production , where john proctor usually stands strong , decent , plain speaking there s a void as martin sheen plays him or does n't play him the character emerges as a pastywhite , vaguely porcine nobody , with a whiny voice that is forever giving out midsentence hardly the salt of the puritan earth maryann plunkett is properly cold and sullen as his wife , but should n't we feel the stubborn tug of a buried love there \? michael york , on the other hand , seems to have stepped out of a three musketeers film he s all flourish and grandiloquence as the rev john hale , who starts out clamoring for hangings but comes to see the folly of his demands mr york s idea of repentance is to indulge in a round of good oldfashioned breastbeating as for madeleine potter , briefly proctor s mistress , she is not so much a young girl scorned as a greek fury unchained far too many performances are out of sync for me not to think that mr yzraely is at fault he obviously intends for this production to make a big statement but he ignores the minutiae , out of which big statements are necessarily built

los angeles early in july , warren littlefield took one of the few breaks he has allowed himself since he assumed the title of president of nbc entertainment last summer he went on vacation with his family to italy one morning he and his brotherinlaw decided to drive into florence arriving at a toll booth , they saw a figure in jeans and black jacket leap out and thrust a gun into the window of the car in front of them fearing a terrorist attack , mr littlefield threw his car into reverse the man with the gun turned and fired directly through mr littlefield s windshield in a moment the car was surrounded by police sitting among the shards of glass , mr littlefield realized quickly that it was a case of mistaken identity the police said they were looking for two thugs who had robbed a bank after the situation had been fully explained , mr littlefield turned to his brotherinlaw , philip foti , and said the day was still young there was still time to explore florence mr foti opted for the nearest bar instead back in california , mr littlefield told this story as one in a long series of wild , crazy , rollercoaster experiences he said have marked his life but the metaphor was inescapable mr littlefield has a talent for dodging bullets it may come in handy few hollywood executives are more under the gun than the 39yearold mr littlefield , who , with his ruddy complexion , welltrimmed beard and occasionally remarkable ties , might remind television viewers of elliot weston of thirty something if elliot exhibited a bit more selfcontrol and corporate correctness mr littlefield goes into the fall television season facing the dual challenge of resuscitating nbc s gasping program lineup at the same time that he tries to assume the starring role at nbc entertainment , a role held for the 11 previous years by the widely celebrated brandon tartikoff mr tartikoff whose incisive instincts led nbc to the most consistent primetime success in television history finally moved on july 1 to the job of chairman of paramount pictures but the episode in florence confirmed one widely held opinion about mr littlefield he does n't panic under fire jeff sagansky , now president of cbs entertainment , worked with mr littlefield and mr tartikoff at nbc in the early 1980 s the pressure is enormous , said mr sagansky but warren does n't rattle he s very even mr littlefield certainly has reason to feel a bit unsteady the state of nbc is hardly encouraging though the network has finished first in the primetime ratings for six straight years , it has been in steep decline the past two since the end of last season , nbc has been through employee layoffs and buyouts , furthering the impression of a company in the throes of a painful hangover after years of celebrating its success mr littlefield is actually entering his second season as president of nbc entertainment , but this is his first unaccompanied by the looming figure of mr tartikoff , who was bumped up to the new title of chairman of the division last summer still with authority over mr littlefield last year was so difficult emotionally , mr littlefield said i was president but brandon and i had n't worked out all the relationship issues then advertising went zoom down our fall shows were n't as well received as we hoped the next thing we know brandon is in the accident mr tartikoff was in an automobile accident on new year s day in which his pelvis was broken his 8yearold daughter calla suffered a far more serious head injury at that point i worried about his life and we all worried about calla s , mr littlefield said it throws everything into chaos you question your own value systems mr tartikoff pulled through quickly and his daughter is now much improved then we had the war , mr littlefield said so i was dizzy i was depressed not suicidal , but i did ask myself , why did i want this job \? then i dug my feet in i thought , let s go make some shows i'm feeling pretty excited right now about the shows for the fall mr littlefield believes some of the series nbc will unveil in september have a chance not only to be hits , but also to restore nbc s image as the network that takes risks one series , eerie indiana , is a kind of teenage twilight zone , played much more for laughs two new dramas i 'll fly away , set in the 1950 s south , and reasonable doubts , a crime drama that will focus on the relationship between a police officer and a deaf prosecutor have encouraged mr littlefield to think nbc can reclaim the mantle of the network that specializes in drama he hopes to take advantage of the disappointment viewers felt with abc for canceling such critically acclaimed series as thirtysomething and china beach indeed , mr littlefield has several other aggressive programming moves in mind , which he ca n't yet disclose , that he says will both make news and distinguish his programming taste from his predecessor s still , cbs executives , led by mr sagansky , think nbc s fortunes will not be reversed this fall they have openly predicted that they will dethrone nbc by their calculation , nbc will plunge to third place
bonnie raitt in love if bonnie raitt s new album , luck of the draw \( capitol \) , sounds a lot like her 1989 album , nick of time , which sold two million copies and which won three grammys , that s because it was made with the same producer , don was , and has a similar blend of sparsely arranged blues , soul and rock songs emotionally , however , the tone of the new record is subtly different in 'nick of time , ' i was telling myself what kind of love i wanted and what kind of abuse i was n't going to put up with anymore , ms raitt said in a recent telephone conversation from los angeles this album examines what it s like to be in a relationship all at once , one of four original songs on the album , tells the firstperson story of a divorced mother who fights bitterly with her teenage daughter and carries on a frustrating relationship with a married man who will never leave his wife the narrator observes wearily they say women we 're the stronger somehow we always make it through hell , that ai n't how i feel right now i do n't even think it s true with this song , one of the most powerful ms raitt has composed in her sporadic songwriting career , all at once , finds her continuing fruitfully along the adultpop path that produced the title song for nick of time i wrote some of these songs even before i won the grammys , she said i went away to see if i could write something , so that if i did win , i would n't think that 'nick of time' was the only thing i could come up with i'm not interested in writing pop songs about how you look or about partying and dancing all night i want to be a strong role model for real women with real issues adult issues these are hard times for a lot of people emotionally two of the album s other original songs , tangled and dark and one part be my lover , a collaboration with her husband , michael o'keefe , an actor , deal with the fear of intimacy in a relationship one part be my lover , an adaptation of an original poem by mr o'keefe , describes a man and woman who are drawn to each other , but because of unhappy relationships in the past , they find it hard to make a commitment the lyric goes he s like a boxer who had to retire after winning but killing a man he s got all of the moves and none of the courage afraid to throw a punch that might land michael wrote the poem when we were about a month into our relationship , ms raitt said it described something that both of us were feeling at the time and that needed to be said , and he really nailed it down i wrote a melody for it and said it was going on the record ms raitt and mr o'keefe were married on april 28 in tarrytown , ny , in a ceremony at which they were serenaded by the bride s father , the singer john raitt i had done everything else in my life except this , and it was as romantic as i had hoped , ms raitt said of marriage i wore a traditional ivory silk gown , which is something you get to do if you 're a firsttime bride my father sang a wonderful song called 'my heart s darlin' ' that michael and i picked from a show he did in 1952 called 'three wishes for jamie' marriage is a very challenging commitment to make , she added mischievously it s probably the last scary thing you can do in your life and still live contemplating the direction of her career , the 41yearold ms raitt said her role models were soul and blues singers like sippie wallace , who , encouraged by ms raitt , returned to giving live performances in the 1970 s and 80 s and who died five years ago i'm hoping i can be around till i'm 90 singing and playing and reaching people because i'm treating meaningful subject matter , ms raitt said the great jazz and rhythmandblues performers do n't get less adept as they get older even if they do n't keep their voices , that can actually make it more poignant i preferred sippie wallace at 86 to the way she sang when she was in her 20 s nwa hits no 1 this week , the los angeles rap group nwa s album

the view through a window at the thames landing restaurant in new london harbor shows a bronze statue of the young eugene o'neill sitting on a rock with a pen and a sketch pad in his hand the monument , based on the playwright s favorite photograph of himself , is one of the first things passengers see when they arrive at the city s train station the man responsible for placing the statue , george c white , president of the eugene o'neill theater center in nearby waterford , sat recently in a quiet corner of the restaurant , away from the view and the rustle of the lunch crowd , savoring a bowl of fish chowder and reminiscing twentyeight years ago , mr white , who grew up in waterford and graduated from the yale school of drama , set out to honor the memory of the dramatist , he said , by creating a center where theater professionals and students could hone their craft without commerial interference what has evolved since then , he said , has far exceeded his expectations since it held the first national playwrights conference in 1966 featuring arthur miller and edward albee , who discussed the impoverished state of american theater the o'neill center has served as the model for several others in the country and abroad , mr white said most notably , it has helped to launch the careers of dozens of awardwinning playwrights , including john guare , august wilson , wendy wasserstein , christopher durang and wole soyinka window on the psyche its ongoing exchange programs with the soviet union have led to collaborative productions in moscow , hartford and los angeles renovations to preserve mr o'neill s boyhood home , monte cristo cottage in new london , are halfcompleted and an arts program that includes plays intended to help children cope with peer pressure , substance abuse and family issues serves 80 schools in connecticut the o'neill center has always looked at theater as a way to gauge and evaluate our evershifting national and international psyche , said mr white , a winner of the american theater association s lifetime achievement award and a special tony award for the o'neill center and given the times we live in , the theater is more important than ever the center s home , the former edward hammond estate on long island sound in waterford , also served as one of the settings for an o'neill drama , a moon for the misbegotten the mansion now houses the center s administration offices , where the walls are painted bright blue and dotted with theater awards and mementos scattered across the 90 acres of lawn and woods are a cottage and farmhouse for guests , two theaters , workshops and a victorian house now under renovation the center s bestknown creation is its playwrights conference , directed by lloyd richards , the dean of the yale school of drama each fall , a committee of theater professionals critiques some 1 , 500 manuscripts that are narrowed to a handful by late spring , then revised by the playwrights and staged during july in august , composers , lyricists and playwrights meet to develop works for the musical theater the national music conference , established in 1976 , has developed more than 24 musicals , including the tony awardwinning nine between september and may , the center holds its national theater institute , a 14week program for college students , accredited by connecticut college under the direction of ernest shier , a playwright , and richard digby day , a director , participants study acting , directing , play writing , costume and set design and movement , taught by professionals from the united states and abroad this semester , 32 students are attending from colleges in the united states , switzerland and germany pamela stover , who directs the center s creative arts and education program , said that artists from the o'neill center visited some 15 , 000 students last year in elementary and middle schools , staging performances and workshops in writing , drama and movement , music and puppetry a program called sos a call for help , that addresses adolescent issues , is one of the most popular describing a recent performance at a middle school , ms stover said the actors created what they called a cocaine roller coaster as the wheels turned , some of the riders could not get off , even at the urging of their friends after the performance , the actors discussed it with the youngsters we try to help children look at the situations and decide what is best for them , said ms stover , without being preachy a cornerstone of the theater center is the nearby monte cristo cottage in new london , which it bought in 1974 the grayandwhite victorian structure rests on a hill facing the thames river and was named by james o'neill , eugene s father , who had earned fame by playing the count of monte cristo on and off for 25 years owned by the family from 1880 to 1909 , the house inspired the setting for a long day s journey into night and ah , wilderness the living room closely resembles o'neill s set directions for long day s journey a round oak table in the center is surrounded by three wicker chairs and a rocker a foursocketed chandelier hangs overhead bookcases are filled with the classics and histories of ireland playwrights attending the summer conferences often stay there , and readings of o'neill s plays are held several times a year sally pavetti , the curator of the cottage , and lois mcdonald , associate curator , know many of the plays by heart and share with visitors numerous anecdotes about the o'neill family sensitive young man' mrs pavetti said she began building the o'neill museum and library collection in the early 1960 s by first interviewing the playwright s boyhood friends , like art mcginley , a sportswriter for the hartford times , and beatrice ashe , a socialite who was a recipient of mr o'neill s love poems all of his friends had great affection for him , said mrs pavetti he was a sensitive young man , a passionate reader , not a rabble rouser but when long day s journey was published posthumously in 1958 , sentiments toward o'neill shifted , she said the pulitzer prizewinning play , which the author called autobiographical , exposed several of his family s inadequacies , including his mother s drug addiction those that knew the family were all horrified that o'neill would write this , said mrs pavetti none of them had a clue that his mother was a morphine addict it was a carefully kept family secret , and everyone felt it should have remained that way in 1988 , mr white commissioned norman legaffie , a connecticut sculptor , to create a bronze statue of eugene o'neill inspired by a photograph that shows a boy sketching ships on the new london waterfront , the statue , larger than life size , was donated to the citizens of new london on oct 16 , 1988 , to commemorate the centennial of o'neill s birth limitededition copies of the statue are being sold to help raise money to preserve monte cristo cottage and its museum and library mr white and mrs pavetti said that if o'neill were alive , he would most likely shy away from all the attention he was a painfully reserved man who did n't care much for people , said mrs pavetti , though he may have given the idea half a smile photos george c white , top left , president of the eugene o'neill theater center in waterford ,

washington , nov 21 prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel and secretary of state james a baker 3d discussed today where to hold the next round of direct talks between israel and its arab neighbors , with washington the almost certain site since the madrid talks broke up two and half weeks ago , israel , syria , lebanon , jordan and the palestinians have not been able to agree on when and where to meet again mr baker said that if they could not agree within two weeks , the cosponsors , the united states and soviet union , would choose a compromise site and invite the parties there administration officials say washington is almost certainly the compromise site , because it is the least objectionable to all the parties this is because none of the parties view washington as perfect either the palestinians want the united states to resume its dialogue with the palestine liberation organization before they come to washington , so that plo officials will be able to sit on the sidelines for the talks the syrians want to be taken off the state department list of countries supporting terrorism before they send their diplomats to washington the israelis want to have the talks in the middle east , to underscore their acceptance by the other arab countries , but they would have a hard time vetoing washington no one is wildly enthusiastic about washington , but no one has a better idea that everyone else might agree on , an administration official said baker reports progress speaking to reporters after the twohour meeting with mr shamir , mr baker said they discussed the site question and made progress , but he did not elaborate asked if the site might be announced on friday after mr shamir meets with president bush , mr baker said , perhaps when mr shamir was asked if israel was now ready to come to washington to continue the talks , he would only say , we have discussed this question of venue together with other questions and we have not yet decided israeli officials said that one thing that mr shamir was trying to establish in his talks today with mr baker and on friday with president bush is the general american approach to these negotiations israeli officials are saying that mr shamir is serious about engaging in negotiations with the palestinians , but before he really goes down that road he wants to make certain that the united states is ready to be a true honest broker , and not the protector of palestinian interests one of the tests for mr shamir to make that determination is whether the bush administration is prepared to grant israel unconditionally the 10 billion in housing loan guarantees that it is seeking a decision on that has been postponed by washington until late january the bush administration , by contrast , is prepared to look sympathetically on the israeli loan request although probably not at the level of 10 billion provided it feels mr shamir is serious about pursuing real negotiations with the palestinians bush test for israel for mr bush , the test of israel s seriousness is whether mr shamir is willing to accept conditions to the 10 billion that would insure that none of the money is spent on new settlements in the west bank and gaza strip preferably by freezing building there altogether since september , when the administration persuaded congress to postpone debate on this housing loan question , the ground has shifted on the issue the increasing turmoil in the soviet union has spurred more jewish immigration to israel , making mr shamir that much more desperate for the housing loans at the same time , though , the political environment in washington has also changed both democratic and republican supporters of israel have been quietly telling the israelis that given the current recession , and the general reluctance of the american taxpayer to spend money abroad now that the cold war is over , they will have a very hard time justify voting 10 billion in housing loan guarantees for israel in an election year i would say that this is going to be the first year in american history when foreign aid support for israel is going to be more dangerous than opposition to it , said representative david r obey , the wisconsin democrat who chairs the house subcommittee on foreign operations the only way that a majority of congress can justify a vote is if it can be cast as a vote for peace , congressional officials say , and the only way that can happen is if it has the administration s full backing the only way it is going to get that is if mr shamir agrees to freeze settlements photo prime minister yitzhak shamir , top , who met with secretary of state james a baker 3d yesterday about the middle east peace talks , listened to introductions before addressing jewish leaders in baltimore in tel aviv , shimon peres , the labor party leader , voted at the party s convention , where a more dovish middle east policy was adopted to help distinguish the party more clearly from mr shamir s likud party \( photographs by agence francepresse \)
chicago , may 4 the rented limousines carrying young men in tuxedoes and young women in taffeta began arriving at a gold coast hotel shortly after dusk on friday it was the official brother rice high school prom , and it was virtually all white three miles away at a south side hotel , about 30 of their classmates tuxedoed young men in kinte cloth cummerbunds and their dates dressed in satin alighted from cadillacs and bmw s borrowed from relatives for the school s first allblack prom it was a turning point that has torn at the heart of the predominantly white catholic school for boys here and , sociologists say , is a telling allegory of race relations in this country 20 years after the civil rights movement brought an end to legalized segregation defining integration for 20 years we have had a kind of token integration , said dr aldon morris , an associate professor of sociology at northwestern university now what we 're getting is a real debate what does integration mean and when has it really occurred \? it is one of the most fundamental questions facing america right now sociologists say that as society is forced to redefine integration and the forms it may take it has become apparent that putting the races under the same roof does not guarantee integration across the country , college campuses that have been desegregated for decades are witnessing growing racial tension and a disenchantment among blacks who have sought out separate cafeterias and dormitories the situation at brother rice appears to be little different the college preparatory school is in a virtually allwhite , middleclass neighborhood on chicago s southwest side and has 1 , 330 students , 12 percent of them black , and no black teachers and while blacks and whites participate in classes and clubs and sports together and many consider each other great friends , they sit at separate tables at lunch time and go their separate ways after school is over on a subtler level , black students express a resentment that their culture does not get the attention that white culture does they say that while some english classes may include a couple of black writers like ralph ellison and richard wright , most of the school year is spent learning about the contributions of whites black culture , they complain , is relegated to a few seconds each morning during black history month when a student reads over a loudspeaker a brief sketch about a black inventor or abolitionist music as metaphor we 've been experiencing their culture for four years , said edward jones , a black senior but they do n't seem ready to experience ours the prom , with all its ritual and mythic significance , appeared to unmask an underlying tension the trouble began when the prom committee , virtually all white , hired a rock band and a disc jockey and announced that the play list for the music at the prom would be based on the suggestions of the senior class the committee devised what it saw as an objective means of gauging what the class wanted to hear each student would list three songs , and the songs mentioned most would be the ones played black seniors began to complain that their preferences would be effectively shut out , that marvin gaye would be squeezed out by bon jovi for every vote we had , there were eight votes for what they wanted , said hosea hill , a black senior if you 're paying tuition to the school , you should have some input but with us being in the minority , we 're always outvoted it s as if we do n't count music became a metaphor for culture and race , and black students considered the gap too wide to close they want that hardrocking , bangyourheadagainstthe wall kind of stuff , said sean young , a black senior and others said that even if they could choose half the songs , which they thought was unlikely , they would probably still be unhappy we would have sat down during their songs and they would have sat down during ours , mr jones said so the black students decided to put together their own prom , with their own site , menu , theme and decorations when school administrators heard of the plans , they called a prom committee meeting to discuss grievances , but black students , figuring they would be outvoted , did not show up james casey , admissions director for the school , said the administration forbade the black students from planning their prom on campus or using the brother rice name the students , he said , were told they could be suspended or expelled if they did so the concerned black students were given a chance to change things , mr casey said , adding , if they felt compelled to go out in their own style , then i would have preferred they would have gone to the prom with the class they have been part of for four years and have their own party at a different time undeterred , the black students went ahead with their alternative prom and so while about 200 white couples and six black couples danced to rock music in two adjoining ballrooms at the marriott hotel , about 30 black couples listened to the isley brothers and roy ayers , danced the electric slide and crowned their own prom king and queen , james warren and devona rogers , in ballroom 15 at the mccormick hotel several hours into the evening there were bursts of applause as several of the black couples who had gone to the main prom to spend time with their white friends showed up at the mccormick the organizers for the black prom said white students were welcome but by midnight , none had shown up white students' sorrow and anger many of the white students have taken the situation personally some said they were hurt and felt rejected others were angry and bitter now you find out what they really think of you , said jerry ficaro , a white student you 're in the same class so you sort of feel like this is against us he said the black students should have gone along with the majority the majority makes a decision , he said that s the way it works mike kane , another white student , said i think the whole thing got out of hand they should have found some way to compromise we might as well have separate graduations some said they just missed their friends and felt the class was not whole without the black students it s too bad , said jack scott , another white senior , because it s our senior year , and we should be together mr casey said today that while the school was not actively investigating the students' activities , it would take action if it found violations if we find that there were favors printed up , something indicating a brother rice function , then someone may be in line for possible suspension , he said dr morris , the sociologist , said the situation is symbolic of the misunderstanding that can occur between a majority and minority culture what integration has meant for many whites is that blacks had to interact with them on their terms , he said it is a kind of cultural arrogance not only do many not want to participate in other cultures , but they feel theirs is the culture , that theirs is very much american and what america is for many of the black students , a black prom became something of a crusade , a chance to show that they could do something on their own , that they did not have to rely on whites and so edward jones , an honor student and one of the main organizers , was beaming as he looked across the small ballroom at his impeccably clad black classmates , helping their dates with their chairs or fetching punch or practicing dance steps to black music i have n't felt this way for four years , mr jones said we love being black this makes me proud to be black if at our 20th year reunion , the white students want to sit and point fingers at us , that s ok we know we did something meaningful photo when black students at brother rice high school felt they were being shut out of planning for the senior prom , they decided to set

an audit released yesterday by new york state comptroller edward v regan lists a variety of large and small instances in which new york university medical center failed to comply with the terms of its 37 million contract to provide doctors to bellevue hospital the audit is yet another addition to the growing stack of paper exploring and criticizing the relationship between new york city s public hospitals and the private institutions paid to staff them the report finds fault not only with nyu but also with the new york city health and hospitals corporation , which oversees the city s 11 municipal hospitals the corporation , the report says , failed to do adequate monitoring and oversight of this bellevue contract impact on patient care although the audit does not cite any direct effects of the noncompliance , mr regan said in a statement that the lack of monitoring could severely impact patient care at bellevue these are some of the problems listed in the audit nyu never provided bellevue with a list of doctors who would be working at the hospital during the fiscal year 1991 so that neither bellevue or hhc knows who is treating bellevue patients or whether they have the proper qualifications or experience the contract requires nyu to appoint a fulltime medical director at bellevue despite the fact that 153 , 000 in medicaid funds have been provided to fill the position since last year , it has remained vacant the corporation has said that a medical director will begin work on jan 1 the chiefs of several departments were serving part time and had no specific work schedules the contract , the report says , specifies that these positions are to be filled full time if they are not , nyu is required to explain it in writing in none of these cases , the report says , was such an explanation given the stated procedure for reading xrays is not being followed , the report says policy at bellevue requires that all emergency room xrays read initially by a resident must be read again by a supervising radiologist within 24 hours the audit found that of 23 rereads , onethird were done after more than 24 hours the delays ranged from one to three days the report notes that 1 to 2 percent of rereads result in a change in diagnosis under the contract with bellevue , nyu is required to keep records proving that the 550 doctors and 147 support staff it provides to bellevue are actually working when and where they are being paid to work the report said that quarterly spot checks done by bellevue to make sure doctors are actually arriving for work found that of 170 doctors , seven were not found at their scheduled locations john deats , a spokesman for the nyu medical center , said those preparing the report went at it as an auditor would he said , they went strictly by a recordkeeping apparatus which has holes in it mr deats said , for example , that doctors' credentials , qualifications and times available had existed at bellevue the hospital and the hospitals corporation knew where the materials were , he said the only one who did n't know it were the auditors steven j matthews , a spokesman for the hospitals corporation , commented the comptroller is commendably concerned about the quality of patient care he should be pleased , therefore , that his auditors did not find any cases at bellevue where patient care was lacking in fact , bellevue is in full compliance with the most important standards of quality patient care those imposed by regulatory authorities in a related event , the board of directors of the hospitals corporation voted yesterday to extend until march 31 the contracts with the private affiliates that provide doctors to city hospitals the contracts were to have expired on dec 31
jerry vanisi , vice president of football operations for the world league of american football , does n't want to see the day when the wlaf holds open tryouts for high school football players but that day may not be too far off as colleges struggle over questions of academic integrity in their athletic departments , more football players may be forced to forgo higher education for a paycheck and vanisi said there s no way he , or the wlaf , can stand in their way with the new ncaa rules , a lot of players will be left out , vanisi said you have to afford them the opportunity to work if they ca n't go to school and they have the ability to play at this level , then i do n't know how we could keep them out wlaf players can earn up to 100 , 000 a season with incentives and they can move to the national football league via the free agent route at the moment , vanisi said , players who have n't finished their college eligibility and want to be included in the wlaf draft must petition the league president , mike lynn each case will be judged on its own merit , vanisi said obviously , a high school player would have to have the talent but the problem would be the maturity and his ability to handle the pressure that goes with playing in the league if a high school player wants to skip college and go right to the wlaf , he will have to prove he has no chance of getting into college , vanisi said charles neinas , the college football association s executive director , said cfa member schools are n't concerned about high school athletes who ca n't qualify for college and want to petition the wlaf for admission our concern is that the wlaf may make incursions into the college ranks , neinas said we 've worked out an agreement with the nfl to protect seniors who are in their last semester and need to work toward graduation we do n't have any agreements with the wlaf neinas said he did n't think there was any need to be concerned about the wlaf s draining the pool of talent that s available for college football teams he said a cfa study conducted this spring , involving 3 , 000 college athletes , showed that 96 percent of the athletes responding said that receiving a college degree was important to them 88 percent said their primary reason for attending college was to get an education 835 percent would have tried to go to college even if they had the chance to play football , and 8 percent said that they chose college as a means to prepare for pro football why the nfl shifted plans the nfl s plan to add two teams in 1994 and realign the league was moved back from 1993 to coincide with the expiration of the present television contract and the completion of several stadium projects in cities that hope to lure expansion teams under our present television contracts , we ca n't do any interconference moves without permission of the television networks , said joe browne , nfl vice president of communications and development with the additional two teams , the nfl , already the largest pro sports league in america , will have to get a larger television contract or find creative ways to spread the wealth so that none of the franchises feel a financial pinch from expansion 'a humbling experience' it s fairly safe to say that those who gathered at gallagher s on 52d street in manhattan last week for the premiere of the jets' 1990 film stayed around to see how 23 minutes of highlights could be pieced together from a 610 season dennis byrd , the jet defensive tackle , who had seen some of the early rushes from the jets' film , had called them a humbling experience , but he turned out to be one of the stars with his 13 quarterback sacks , the most by a jet since mark gastineau had 135 in 1985 in an opening shot , coach bruce coslet put on his best mount rushmore face for the camera but the best of the little vignettes showed al toon making spectacular leaping catch after leaping catch freeman mcneil bobbing and weaving and bouncing through heavy traffic just like he did as a rookie troy taylor passing to rob moore , then calling his own number and running in the first touchdown by a jets quarterback in 10 years a couple of camera angles were used for the biggest single play of the season , by darrell davis the rookie out of texas christian sacked houston quarterback warren moon , forcing a fumble , then fell on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown in an upset over the oilers what made the jets' film just a little different from other nfl highlight films were the blemishes they included a brilliant interception by erik mcmillan at indianapolis , but also left in his boneheaded decision to try a lateral on the same play and coslet s edict the next day that there will be no more laterals the funniest line was delivered after terance mathis fielded a punt over his shoulder on his own 2yard line and turned it into a 98yard touchdown , tying an nfl record held by four other players quarterback coach chip myers was seen hugging and chiding mathis at the same time saying , do n't touch the ball inside the 10
scott sanderson does not throw as hard as roger clemens hardly anyone does last night at yankee stadium , sanderson tossed some pitches that could have been thrown by roger rabbit they floated , they sank , they danced and they dazzled , and the red sox did little with them sanderson pulled a clemens out of his own bag of tricks by toying with boston for seven innings and sparking the yankees to a 70 victory some home run magic shot off the bats of jesse barfield , kevin maas and steve sax and lit up the bronx in a scene that is becoming more and more common lately the chief reasons the yankees won for the sixth time in their last seven games were the four quick runs they scored in the first inning and the solid outing by sanderson sanderson struck out two , walked none , limited the red sox to four singles and allowed only one runner to reach second before giving way to steve farr in the eighth , he threw an economical 75 pitches and retired the last 13 batters he faced sanderson said he could have pitched the full nine rebound to take series this team is hot right now , said sanderson \( 62 \) , who won for the fifth time in his last six decisions it s great to pitch for a team that is hot the triumph was special because the yankees displayed the ability to rebound from a humbling loss to clemens and take the threegame series from a team that is sitting in first place this was the biggest win of the year for us , said barfield , who slugged a threerun homer in the first we kept saying we got to keep the momentum going and we did and what would a little magic at the stadium be without fireworks \? dennis lamp provided some in the seventh when he nailed mel hall in the foot with a pitch after sax had belted a tworun homer home plate umpire greg kosc immediately tossed lamp out of the game and ejected boston manager joe morgan moments later when he argued the call hall said nothing to lamp , a surprise in itself , and simply shook his head as he walked to first base lamp said he did not throw at the batter and hall laughed it off and joked that the slider did not hurt anyway maybe these yankees are kinder and gentler , but they are also having fun and making it a bit easier for fans to watch them struggle through growing pains we went out there and took it to them , said manager stump merrill we showed we had some character this was key for us sanderson has made it easy for his teammates to watch him in his last two starts by pitching 12 straight scoreless innings and allowing a mere four hits he left his last start against baltimore with a fiveinning nohitter because of mild stiffness in his right shoulder and he resumed his effectiveness last night boston had two singles in the first , but sanderson escaped without damage and two double plays helped him out of the second and third innings from the fourth to the seventh , no red sox batter reached base we did n't do anything with sanderson , conceded morgan his starter , tom bolton , struggled through his third straight outing before bolton registered two outs , he was staring at a 40 deficit hall knocked in one run with a groundout and barfield smashed his threerun shot to the opposite field maas added a basesempty blast in the third to make it 50 barfield and maas lead the team with nine homers each the yankees had eight homers in the three games against the red sox and inched their way toward gaining respect from the league they also continued breaking a nasty habit that drives barfield crazy losing stinks , barfield said there is no other way to put it it s not a lot of fun we 're starting to get a taste of what it can be like when you win inside pitch don mattingly sat out his second straight game because of a jammed right pinky and will probably not play until this weekend
commemorations have many purposes linking the present to the past , they help create collective memories , enshrine traditional values and situate us in time all over the world their importance is reflected in the many holidays honoring historical and heroic figures and events wars , revolutions , presidential birthdays and the like in the belief that awareness of them fosters national identity , patriotism and civic pride yet these celebrations and the messages they convey are by no means univocal commemorations invariably mean different things to different people , providing many views of the past , some of them diametrically opposed so it is with the quincentenary celebration of columbus s momentous voyage of 1492 by general consensus in the united states and elsewhere , the quincentenary is to commemorate not , as previous celebrations did , the discovery of a new world , but the encounter of two worlds , a theme to be struck in an endless round of speeches , conferences , exhibitions and expositions at the same time , the quincentennial also promises to serve other interests , as various groups , both here and abroad , use the occasion to explain and understand their particular relationship to columbus and the encounter so while spaniards connect the observance to their country s emergence as a modern , democratic state , for mexicans it is bound to serve as a reminder of a remarkable indian past in the united states , the number of quincentennials seemingly multiplies by the week many italianamericans take the opportunity to continue promoting columbus s genoese roots , while many africanamericans , all but excluded from previous celebrations of the events of 1492 , tend to regard the quincentennial as a marker of the transatlantic slave trade and centuries of servitude and oppression many american indians also take an equally dim view of the arrival of columbus , initiating , as it did , the loss of land , language and culture , and the death of millions from the lethal effect of european disease the hispanic quincentennial is yet something else , not only signaling the origins of a newly emerged ethnic group but offering americans of hispanic background an opportunity to make the richness and the diversity of their culture better known for jews the quincentennial has less to do with columbus than with the expulsion of jews from spain the year columbus sailed muslims will have a similar view and remember 1492 as the year in which the christians conquered granada , thus ending seven centuries of islamic rule in the iberian peninsula yet whether one regards columbus as the harbinger of good or of evil , the important feature is that the 1992 commemoration of 1492 has awakened a new interest in history what other event , 500 years in the past , can command such attention \? and what other event actually produces history itself as diverse groups forge images of columbus to support their particular concerns \? this is mirrored in the books being published to coincide with the quincentennial not surprisingly , the figure of columbus looms large in these offerings , but the other topics now widely discussed the destruction of american indian civilization , the genesis of the flat earth error , food exchanges between the old world and the new readily attest to the pluralistic character , and the attendant disputes , of the commemoration undeniably , some of these books are simply opportunistic crass efforts to cash in on columbomania but most represent serious attempts to make sense of the complex issues raised by the quincentennial as such , they reveal the extent to which the world of the late 20th century is heir to the intertwined processes of conquest , commerce and colonialization set into motion by columbus and his crew the probable point of embarkation for readers interested in these complex issues is likely to be columbus himself three new biographies have been published in recent weeks , with more due soon among those now available , the most traditional is that of the italian politician paolo emilio taviani , the vice president of the italian senate and a noted columbus scholar who also happens to be genoese his columbus the great adventure \( 273 pp , orion crown , 20 \) is a romanticized biography that renders columbus larger than life the addition of a few new factual details notwithstanding , the book s tone and style are reminiscent of the triumphalist biographies of columbus published a century ago , but mr taviani makes no apologies for his admiration of columbus both as a man and a mariner he regards columbus s 1492 voyage as nothing less than an expression of the creative genius of the renaissance , or as he puts it , striking a nationalistic note christopher columbus symbolizes the creative genius of italy shaping the beginning of the modern world it follows that mr taviani avoids discussion of those facets of columbus for instance , his religious visions and millenarian beliefs that appear a bit too medieval he concentrates instead on the explorer s maritime skills and the hardheaded pragmatism that made him , as mr taviani believes he was , psychologically a modern man
seoul , south korea , friday , dec 13 leaders of north and south korea signed a treaty of reconciliation and nonaggression this morning , renouncing armed force against each other and saying that they would formally bring the korean war to an end 38 years after the fighting ceased the agreement would also reestablish some measure of regular communication between the two countries , including telephone lines , mail , some economic exchanges and the reunion of some families who have been separated since war broke out in 1950 it would also commit the countries to rebuilding railway and road links across the heavily guarded border , known as the demilitarized zone , which has been the symbol of the armed division of the country for almost four decades officials on both sides described the accord as the first step toward what they term the inevitable reunification of the korean peninsula , but they conceded that it failed to deal with some of the most potentially dangerous issues dividing north and south , including pyongyang s race to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons 'milestone and an evolution' at a briefing for reporters thursday night at a hotel on the outskirts of seoul , where the two sides have been meeting since tuesday in their fifth set of highlevel talks in 15 months , lee dong bok , south korea s chief spokesman , termed the agreement a historical milestone and an evolution in interkorean relations in the accord , the two sides agreed to forswear all acts of terrorism or any efforts to overthrow the government of the other they stopped short , however , of calling the agreement a peace treaty , saying that the armistice agreement signed in 1953 between the americanled united nations forces and the army of north korean president kim il sung would remain in effect until it can be transformed into a formal peace for the united states , which lost 54 , 000 men and suffered 103 , 000 casualties before signing the truce with north korea on july 27 , 1953 , the new reconciliation and nonaggression pact raises a host of new questions the most critical is whether the new northsouth relationship will undercut the rationale for keeping 40 , 000 american troops stationed here , formally serving under the united nations command that directed combat operations during the war in recent years , the united states has slowly been turning command of those forces over to south koreans , but last month american troop reductions here were halted by secretary of defense dick cheney until north korea allows international inspection of its nuclear complexes and dismantles a fuel reprocessing plant that could produce weaponsgrade plutonium north and south korea announced later today that they would conduct a separate set of negotiations over nuclear issues later this month , but north korea did not indicate how it would respond to a proposal for mutual inspection of suspected nuclear sites on both sides of the border , including american military bases in recent weeks the united states has been removing the nuclear weapons it has stored here for decades to deter a north korean attack in washington on thursday , a spokesman for the state department , bob hall , said that the united states had not yet received a copy of the accord in terms of what it means for our posture in korea , he said , i think it s at this point premature to say caution despite toasts this morning , as negotiators for the two sides began to read aloud their accord in a meeting that was broadcast throughout south korea , both sides said they would exchange radio and television broadcasts , newspapers and other publications , breaking their nearly fourdecade wall of silence but there were no guarantees that north korea would allow that news to be disseminated in its tightly controlled society two days ago , at the start of the talks , north korea s prime minister , yon hyung muk , said he had to protect his clean society against pollution by stinking , corrupt cultures while prime ministeryon and his south korean counterpart , chung won shik , toasted a new era of reconciliation at an elaborate koreanstyle banquet thursday night , others were far more cautious about whether the treaty would have much practical effect in reducing tensions past communiques and agreements though none as sweeping as this one have often collapsed amid charges of duplicity , treachery and provocation on both sides it will not put most of the problems between the north and the south to rest , an american diplomat here said on thursday but it might make people feel better and it is something that they can point to as progress , after a year of serious talks seoul was alive with speculation thursday night about why north korea suddenly seemed so eager for a peace agreement many speculated that it signaled the increasing desperation of north korea s government , which is facing shortages of food and fuel , a disastrous harvest , an economy on the brink of collapse , virtual abandonment by its soviet allies , and increasing international pressure to abandon its nuclear plans

johannesburg , july 26 the south african police secretly poured more than 500 , 000 into an ostensibly independent labor union loyal to the zulubased political movement inkatha without knowing where the money went , according to the latest disclosure today in the scandal that has developed over the government s covert aid to inkatha law and order minister adriaan vlok has acknowledged that 15 million rand , now about 525 , 000 , was paid to the united workers union of south africa over six years but mr vlok , in a television interview on sunday , said the spending of each and every cent had been accounted for i am quite happy that taxpayers' money has not been wasted at all , mr vlok said the weekly mail , the newspaper that first exposed pretoria s secret financing of inkatha a week ago , today published a top secret police document that said mr vlok had no idea where the money had gone and feared that the financial chaos would compromise the police involvement a subsequent investigation found that the union had not kept any books but payments to the inkatha union continued up to this month other activities suspected the police tolerance of such waste , critics of the government say , suggest a far larger covert budget was available for other more sinister activities , including orchestration of the ongoing political violence foreign minister roelof f botha insisted on thursday that none of the money given to inkatha went to foment violence mr vlok said on sunday that the police subsidized the union to counter intimidation , illegal action and related violence in organized labor but the timing suggests that inkatha s union was created in 1986 to block the congress of south african trade unions , a labor federation allied with the african national congress at the time , the federation had begun to organize workers in natal the secret police document leaked to the weekly mail referred to mr vlok s concern over how a project under the control of the south african police was allowed to develop in such a way while the police kept supplying money , the afrikaanslanguage document said , at no stage did the police have financial or other control over how it was spent for all the money it received , the labor union built up a huge debt burden , the document said another top secret memo suggested that the police colluded in helping reserve a stadium in durban for the inkatha union on feb 25 , 1990 , to prevent the african national congress and its allies from holding a political rally there on the same day the procongress rally , which featured nelson mandela two weeks after his release from prison , was held outside the stadium , which inkatha s union did not use paper said to break promise capt craig kotze , a police spokesman for mr vlok , said today that the minister s office no longer felt obliged to comment on the weekly mail s assertions because the newspaper had broken an agreement captain kotze later told a johannesburg radio station that the weekly mail had promised to give his department an advance copy of the article to allow time for a proper response but had not done so the united workers' union of south africa claimed 150 , 000 members two years ago but has not released membership figures this year by comparison , the congress of south african trade unions now claims 1 , 252 , 000 paid members supporters of the rival federations have clashed sporadically in the workplace since 1986 the weekly mail has accused the government of profligacy and subterfuge in secretly financing inkatha and its labor union while professing not to favor any political party foreign minister botha has acknowledged that his department gave inkatha 250 , 000 rand , now about 87 , 000 , for political rallies to promulgate the organization s opposition to sanctions a police document published by the weekly mail last week said the money had been requested to bolster inkatha as a rival to the african national confress
san francisco , nov 3 mayor art agnos ca n't wait until wednesday , the day after an election that was supposed to be easy but has instead turned into a fight for his political life swept into office in a landslide four years ago , mr agnos now holds the slimmest of leads going into tuesday s nonpartisan election , which will be followed by a runoff in december if none of the five major candidates wins a majority of votes weeks ago , the mayor adopted a waituntilthenext round strategy his blustery boasts about his administration gave way to confessions that he had made his share of mistakes , and he smiled a lot during debates while his opponents attacked him the mayor has found this harsh campaign exhausting psychologically and physically , said scott shafer , a spokesman , and decided to protect himself as best as he can , get through it and hope for better in the runoff the trouble in paradise political analysts and poll takers here anticipate a tight finish that will probably send mr agnos into a runoff with either frank jordan , who stepped down as police chief last year , or angela alioto , a firstterm supervisor and the daughter of joseph l alioto , an esteemed former mayor of san francisco the first round of voting , these experts say , is likely to reflect a deep malaise among residents who consider their hometown paradise and blame the mayor for an array of urban problems they will ask themselves , 'do you like agnos or not \? ' and the answer will be heavily no , said mervin field , director of the california poll , which does not survey local elections but in the next round , mr field and others say , voters will give closer scrutiny to the alternative and could find ms alioto too inexperienced and mr jordan too conservative for their tastes the most recent poll , by the san francisco chronicle , shows mr agnos with 25 percent of the 600 voters surveyed , mr jordan and ms alioto with 20 percent each and the other candidates , tom hsieh , a member of the board of supervisors , and richard hongisto , the city assessor , trailing far behind the poll , in late october , had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points questions about a challenger mr agnos s reelection campaign quickly turned into a referendum on the state of the city , with the moderate mayor taking heat from both the left and the right peddling nostalgia in starkly different ways , both ms alioto , one of the most liberal members of the board of supervisors , and mr jordan , a career police officer , harked back to the good old days and promised that they could clear the streets of panhandlers and litter , as the mayor had not while the campaign was driven by attacks on mr agnos , it had a few other elements as well questions were raised about ms alioto s qualifications and temperament , with critics charging that she is a spoiled rich girl trading on her father s name and is too intemperate and scatterbrained to be mayor frequently , ms alioto quarreled with mr agnos s positions on an issue only to be reminded that she had voted the same way in addition , charges have been made about ms alioto s finances she is said to have accepted 254 , 000 in questionable fees from her father s law firm and to have taken out injudicious loans against the value of her home to finance her 1988 race for supervisor her response was a breezy do n't worry about me and a countercharge that her critics were sexist perils of a tough image mr jordan , for his part , found both strength and weakness by harping on law and order themes mr jordan , whose tenure as chief was marred by incidents of harsh treatment of demonstrators , accused mr agnos of being too lenient with the protesters who clog san francisco s streets more than 200 times a year early in the campaign , he cited the huge antiwar protests here during the persian gulf conflict , when the rest of america was decked in yellow ribbons those rallies were the beginning of anarchy , mr jordan said , asserting that mr agnos handcuffed the police department , a charge the mayor and the current chief deny such protests make san francisco an inhospitable place for business interests , mr jordan added mr jordan later tried to soften his image as a hardline cop by joining a gay rights protest in september after gov pete wilson enraged homosexuals throughout california by vetoing an antidiscrimination bill mr jordan was chased through the streets by a mob and finally fled , bloody and without his size 10 black shoes the wild september night ended with protestors breaking windows at a downtown government building , with the police taking a handsoff approach and with mr jordan again charging that mr agnos had allowed special interest groups to run amok while conventional wisdom has it that mr agnos is sure to win a spot in the runoff , a spokeswoman for the jordan campaign is not so sure what if art does n't make it because everybody votes to send him a message \? asked dee dee myers , press secretary to mr jordan it s that attitude that makes this so slippery and what a hoot that would be it would turn this town upside down

to the editor this morning , i heard an advertisement for aid and resettlement of ethiopian jews on a radio news station this was followed by a news item involving the removal of the homeless and squatters from tompkins square park that had none of the sympathetic tone of the preceding commercial a disabled person myself , i have little tolerance for prejudicial abuse of any kind but i find it puzzling that we as americans do not begin our charity at home what is to become of the homeless \? the broadcast did n't say what about medical care \? it was not mentioned what about their resettlement into society and the possibility of finding them jobs \? the report did not seem concerned with this i am not saying that tompkins square park be given over to the homeless these people need help and teaching more than a campsite nor am i saying that the plight of the ethiopian jews be ignored i am questioning , however , where our benevolence begins among the thousands of disabled citizens of new york , i am one of the fortunate i have education , a supportive family , an insurance plan , a job and a home those without any of the above live lives of waiting , waiting for nothing but hopelessness they are right here in our parks , on our sidewalks and in our subways i suggest that we help our own they may one day be able to help us with others cora snyder new york , june 3 , 1991
washington , nov 11 despite optimistic predictions by proponents of conservation and renewable fuels that major new energy legislation would be on the senate floor by thanksgiving , congressional officials say it may be impossible to pass anything more than a limited alternative for months ten days ago , liberal democrats and an unlikely coalition of environmental groups , small utilities and the automobile industry derailed the bush administration s energy bill building a coalition for a substitute will be much more difficult it s going to be a tall order to come up with a new energy bill , said senator frank h murkowski , an alaska republican who is a member of the committee on energy and natural resources the birth pains that came with the last one were extensive the old energy bill , which was backed by the white house and the oil industry , tried to stitch together a grab bag of provisions that addressed offshore and arctic oil drilling , conservation , incentives to promote greater efficiency in buildings and appliances , deregulation of the utility industry and alternative energy sources like nuclear and hydroelectric power without the impetus of a crisis , like the iraqi invasion of kuwait last year , which gave the old energy bill a push , congress is likely to change its approach and deal with such issues individually , in a fashion that will fail to establish a coordinated strategy , analysts say it s out of sight , out of mind , said senator j bennett johnston of louisiana , a democrat who is the chairman of the committee on energy and natural resources he had sponsored the defeated legislation the price of gasoline is ok now , so there must not be a problem , he said a gallup poll shows that nearly a majority of the american people do n't know that we import any oil nearly half the oil consumed in the united states is imported several bills under way a few alternative bills are now in play , but none appears to have a chance of passage until late next year , at least one , sponsored by senator richard h bryan , a nevada democrat , would mandate an increase in automobile fuel efficiency from the current 275 miles a gallon to 40 over the next decade the senate commerce committee passed the measure , which environmentalists say would conserve 25 million barrels of oil a day , but lobbying by the auto industry has so far helped impede action by the full senate the auto industry helped defeat the original energy package because executives feared liberals would add amendments on the floor to mandate fuel efficiency with the industry reeling from decreased sales , several senators who helped mr bryan sink the original bill are now opposing his efforts to raise mileage standards representative john d dingell , the michigan democrat who heads the house committee on energy and commerce and is one of the strongest advocates of the auto industry in congress , is working to keep anything similar to the bryan measure from being considered in the house daniel becker , a lobbyist for the sierra club and a primary strategist for the environmental movement on energy legislation , said mr dingell could stop his committee from considering the bryan bill , but he would be unable stop the full house from adding it as an amendment to a house energy bill next year but a number of house staff members who monitor energy policy are not as confident dingell is a very formidable adversary , mr bryan said but even if both congressional chambers do pass the bill , the white house has threatened to veto any legislation that includes stricter fueleconomy standards , arguing that the country cannot afford to burden the industry with more costs alaska drilling measure the house merchant marine committee is considering legislation that would allow oil drilling in the alaskan national wildlife refuge it was the strong opposition by environmental groups to opening up one of the country s last virgin preserves that sank the old energy bill , and the house measure is not considered any more passable representative philip r sharp , an indiana democrat who is chairman of the energy and power subcommittee , is sponsoring legislation that would promote the construction of natural gas pipelines , seek reductions of carbondioxide emissions that cause global warming and encourage the development of renewable energy sources like wind , solar and geothermal power mr sharp s panel overwhelmingly approved his measure , but not before it carved out several of his most ambitious proposals
if you think you 'd like to make acquaintance with george bernard shaw s getting married , i recommend that you trot off to the library , check out volume iv of the collected plays and prefaces , and settle into a comfortable armchair for a couple of hours you could also drop by the circle in the square , where this talkative 1908 work its author called it a conversation is being performed but i do n't know that you 'd be much further ahead of the game while i am not one of those who feel that shaw is usually better read than said , this fitful production is awfully tedious in the long run and it s tedious because the characters never seem to be speaking their own minds they 're all speaking shaw s in this case , the topic on which the grand man wished to hold forth was \( obviously \) marriage , an institution he found seriously wanting , as he did most institutions but since he could n't help playing devil s advocate , he also found it necessary , ridiculous , desirous , iniquitous , outdated and enduring that s where getting married s 13 characters come in whatever their sex , age and station in life , their primary function is to allow shaw to argue with himself they show up in the kitchen of archbishop and mrs bridgenorth \( lee richardson and elizabeth franz \) , when he needs their point of view to stoke the continuing debate when he does n't , they 're rather summarily dismissed shaw s ideas can be bracingly modern here he is , for example , proposing the notion of prenuptial contracts some seven decades before the trumps , and claiming , well in advance of the women s movement , that keeping a house is legitimate work , worthy of remuneration , and not just a wifely duty but a modern idea here and there does not justify the play s prolixity \( am i alone in thinking discussions of what makes a proper english gentleman no more fascinating than inquiries into what constitutes a good yorkshire pudding \? \) this much is sure your tolerance for getting married will depend largely on the resilience of your anglophilia the play takes place on the morning the archbishop s sixth daughter , edith , is to be wed to a pleasant little worrywart named cecil the guests are already ensconced in the church and the organist is running dangerously low on music , when the bride and groom announce their intention to call the whole thing off he is leery of her outspokenness , because british law will hold him financially responsible for her libelous tongue she has just been reading a dire pamphlet , do you know what you are going to do \? by a woman who has done it , and consequently can imagine only matrimony s perils shaw must have felt that reconciling them to their fate was too simple a task , though , for it is by far a lesser concern of the play the rest of his characters pose greater challenges and allow him to ponder more complex marital arrangements lesbia , the liberated woman \( victoria tennant \) , has no use for a husband , let alone the general \( nicolas coster \) who has just proposed to her for the 10th time in 20 years she can , however , envision a scenario whereby he might sire her child , if he 'd clear out promptly after the birth for giddy leo \( madeleine potter \) , who can see good points about both men in her life , some form of polyandry would appear to be the only solution the greengrocer \( patrick tull \) favors muddling through marriage as it is , while the archbishop s chaplain \( walter bobbie \) proselytizes vigorously for celibacy , which is either taking the high road or avoiding the issue entirely shaw even elevates the play momentarily into the realm of the mystical by having the mayoress \( linda thorson \) go into a trance and speak the reproachful verities of womankind all this begets , under the arid direction of stephen porter , great streams of nattering and a single stageworthy scene , in which the principals sit down at the long kitchen table and attempt to draw up the first english partnership deed , only to discover that they cannot agree on the slightest provision otherwise , there is an excessive amount of shouting and the kind of stiffbacked posturing that is meant to pass for high style for a play about the sundry ways men and women try to legitimize what is presumably biology s call , getting married is surprisingly sexless no one seems to be remotely under the thrall of carnal desire not even hotchkiss \( scott wentworth \) , gentleman and snob , who claims to be devoured by an uncontrollable passion for the mayoress and therefore not responsible for his actions but there s little chance he 'll be carried away by ardor not as long as he has something to say about it first which is the problem in a nutshell the characters are talking heads , dead from the neck down the trick in playing shaw , it seems to me , is getting the body back into it you could say , to borrow a phrase from the bible , that the word has to be made flesh , or at least it has to galvanize the flesh the british actress eileen atkins understood the necessity perfectly when she appeared earlier this year as virginia woolf in a room of one s own the oneperson play , fashioned from two lectures on the subject of women and literature that woolf herself delivered in cambridge in 1928 , illustrated the range and alertness of the author s mind ms atkins , however , brought to it a concentrated intensity and a passionate commitment that stemmed from the gut as a result , intellectual issues became living issues
when people suffer cardiac arrest and are not revived by rescue workers , they are virtually doomed to die and it is a waste of time and money to take them to a hospital , a study has found even if they are revived in the emergency room , the odds that they will live to leave the hospital are virtually nil , the researchers said as a result , they said , it would be better to declare these patients dead at the scene rather than subject them to dehumanizing , costly and ultimately futile treatment at a hospital they said the findings also showed the importance of increasing the number of rescue workers trained to offer advanced life support to people with cardiac arrest since the only real opportunity to rescue such patients appears to be in the field 'a very important article' the researchers , dr william a gray and his colleagues at brown university , described their findings in today s issue of the new england journal of medicine their report , and an accompanying editorial , challenge standard practice at most american hospitals this is a very important article , said dr richard kerber , who heads the american heart association s emergency cardiac care committee dr kerber said the study strongly suggested that there is not much point in bringing a patient to the hospital who s had an adequate and full attempt at resuscitation in the field the further efforts in the hospital accomplish no good , are dehumanizing for the patient and the family and are costly , he said every year , 350 , 000 americans suffer cardiac arrests , usually because they have severe heart disease their hearts begin beating irregularly or may start quivering instead , making it impossible for the heart to pump blood throughout the body twothirds of these cardiac arrests take place away from the hospital the vast majority of these patients cannot be revived at the scene and are rushed to hospitals as rescue workers continue their efforts the new 19month study involved all 185 patients who arrived at the emergency room at rhode island hospital in providence , in such cases although resuscitation efforts begun by rescue workers were continued at the hospital , only 16 patients were revived and none lived to leave the hospital most died within a few days , but one man hung on , in a coma , for four months the cost for each patient ranged from 1 , 984 to 95 , 144 the researchers said the total cost for the 16 patients was 180 , 908 in addition , they said , 100 , 000 to 150 , 000 was spent in the emergency room on the unsuccessful efforts to revive the other 169 patients cardiologists said the study was important because doctors who care for patients in cardiac arrest in the emergency room rarely learn if the patients eventually recover doctors who care for them in the emergency room do not follow them through the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where instruments are threaded through veins to examine the heart , and those who perform the catheterization do not not care for them later in the intensive care unit we see patients in windows of time , said dr jeffrey isner , a cardiologist at tufts university school of medicine in boston dr isner said he would hate to give up on patients because , occasionally , someone survives although he said he could not remember such a case without looking at his hospital s records , a colleague , dr douglas losordo of st elizabeth s hosptial in boston , said he knew of one man who was revived in the hospital after an emergency team had failed to resuscitate him and who lived to leave the hospital in his editorial , dr w douglas weaver of the university of washington in seattle said the study showed that when resuscitation outside the hospital is unsuccessful , further inhospital procedures are useless and should be abandoned except in unusual cases like drowning , hypothermia or when the heart has intermittently started and stopped in an interview , he said the study should jog the medical community into looking at where we put our resources in some cities , they transport every single patient to the hospital , he said , no matter how unlikely it is that the person can be revived this practice is encouraged by laws in many states that require that a doctor officially pronounce a patient dead , dr kerber said once these patients arrive at a hospital , however , doctors usually try to revive them the study and the editorial both suggest that guidelines be established to allow rescue workers who perform advanced life support efforts to abandon them at the scene , after communicating with a doctor , if prolonged efforts have been unsuccessful reluctance by doctor in addition , the researchers wrote , members of the emergency department team should temper their efforts for patients who have not been revived after prolonged , advanced efforts in the field but dr isner said he , for one , would be reluctant to give paramedics the power to declare patients dead dr kerber and dr weaver stressed that many ambulances did not have the equipment for heart resuscitation and many people who happened to observe a cardiac arrest did not know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation , or cpr , in which the chest is pounded to keep blood flowing and breathing into the victim s mouth provides oxygen time is of the essence in resuscitation efforts , they added , since the brain starts to die within four minutes after the heart stops pumping in cities like seattle , where many citizens learned cpr and where ambulance teams are models of training and equipment , as many as 30 percent of patients with cardiac arrests are revived at the scene of their collapse , dr kerber said yet , he added , seattle is the exception less than half of all ambulances in the united states carry defibrillators , machines that can send an electric shock to the heart and often startle it into beating regularly again in dr gray s study , only a third of the patients had had defibrillation but no matter what efforts were made , patients who could not be revived at the scene died , the study found dr kerber said that without defibrillators , a patient s chance of being revived plummeted
east rutherford , nj , feb 10 fear of dropping out of a playoff spot for the first time this season , and a search for redemption for losing to the worst team in the league a day earlier , provided enough incentive for the devils this evening washington s victory over philadelphia earlier in the day dropped the devils out of a playoff spot , but they regained fourth place in the patrick division with a 20 triumph over the vancouver canucks the victory before a sellout crowd at byrne meadowlands arena provided the first shutout in the national hockey league for chris terreri , the devil goalie , and the first for the devils since march 5 , 1989 terreri has been terrific indeed for the devils in recent games , allowing just nine goals in his last seven appearances of 398 minutes of action , putting him among the league s top four goaltenders with a goalsagainst average of 267 relief help despite terreri s success , coach john cunniff of the devils still refused to put terreri in a different position than sean burke , the team s other goalie , who has one victory in new jersey s last 19 games and that with relief help from terreri chris is going pretty well , and we 're going to look at it , cunniff said when asked whether terreri , who made his third consecutive start , would be given priority over burke from now on i'm not concerned about things like that , terreri said about the team s goaltending situation all i worry about is the team winning terreri has 17 of the team s 24 victories he also has 5 of the team s 10 ties in the 36 games he has played for the devils \( 242310 \) scoring first was the first priority for the devils today and they accomplished it when jon morris 79 seconds into the game john maclean scored the other goal for the devils needless to say that scoring the first goal , especially at home , is always important in hockey it has been a key to the devils 19 of their 24 victories have come in games in which they scored first teammates and coaches have always encouraged morris , a crafty puckhandler , to shoot more , but the young rookie forward favors the role of the playmaker , the player who makes the pass for the goal rather than the one who shoots to score ever since i was 4 years old i 've played for the pass , said morris , who has 31 shots in the 40 games he has played this year has been the worst when it comes to shooting i'm learning that i have to shoot more attack and score morris , who did n't have any of the devils' 32 shots in their 31 humiliating loss to the nordiques in quebec on saturday , took a shot in his first venture into the attacking zone and the result was his fifth goal of the season he did have help with the goal the puck went in off the left skate of the goaltender , kirk mclean , but , as hockey players like to say , they do n't ask how , they ask how many john maclean s answer to that is now 32 the leading goalscorer for the devils got his 32d of the season with 2 29 left before the first intermission for the only other score in the game vancouver \( 20345 \) has only two victories in its last 15 games and gave plenty of evidence why it s the league s fourth worst team late in the middle period igor larionov and greg adams broke in alone on terreri with 1 15 left in the period larionov had the puck on the right side of the slot , but he chose to pass to adams a few feet to his left adams failed to control it and as a result the sellout crowd witnessed a rare twoonnone break with no shot on goal photo devils' john maclean , left , scoring a goal past kirk mclean , the canucks' goalie , in the first period yesterday watching the goal were canucks' adrien plavsic and devils' brendan shanahan \( michelle v agins the new york times \)

atlanta , oct 3 by the time the atlanta braves returned home from cincinnati and a perfect sixgame road trip early today , they had moved into a tie with the los angeles dodgers for the national league west lead with only three games to play were they going to dwell on their new status and ponder what could happen this weekend in the final series of the regular season \? not if greg olson was typical i'm going deer hunting tomorrow i do n't care about friday s game , olson , the braves' catcher , said after the braves completed their road sweep i hope i see a big old buck i hope to put an arrow through him i wo n't even think about the pennant race then when friday comes , i 'll think about it again that s how this team thinks maybe all of the braves planned to go deer hunting or house hunting or mow their lawns or clean their swimming pools for the last time this year or go grocery shopping or take their kids to the zoo maybe none of them planned to think about the division championship for 24 hours as they took a respite from the rigors of the race he s not kidding there s no need to be concerned with it tomorrow , olson insisted wednesday night it s an off day tomorrow it wo n't be important tomorrow is for family , fun maybe you think i'm just throwing words out , but that s how i feel on the three previous days sunday through tuesday the braves won their games , only to have the dodgers later win theirs and retain their onegame advantage this time , though , the dodgers' half of the trick did not work after the braves beat cincinnati , 63 , wednesday night , the dodgers lost to san diego , 94 , before a barrage of bizarre bunt hits and other infield singles , and the teams suddenly had the same record 92 victories and 67 defeats each has three games left , the braves here with the lastplace houston astros , the dodgers in san francisco with the fifthplace giants if they emerge with the same record after the weekend encounters , they will play monday night in los angeles for the championship however it is done , the winner will meet the pirates beginning next wednesday in pittsburgh for the national league pennant the pendulum swings although the consensus in recent weeks had given the dodgers the edge because of their racehardened experience , the braves suddenly must be viewed as the team with an advantage they are playing at home the dodgers are playing on the road they are playing the astros , a scrappy team without a single everpresent threat the dodgers are playing the giants , a disappointing team with an injured kevin mitchell but with a revived will clark and matt williams and a chance to leapfrog past the defending champion reds into fourth place the braves also have an overwhelming edge in pitching , at least for the first two games of their series steve avery , a 17game winner , who held the dodgers to one run in 18 innings in two successive starts last month , will pitch friday night against jeff juden , a rookie with major league experience totaling two starts and one relief appearance , not to mention a 623 earned run average john smoltz , who has an 112 record since the allstar break , will pitch saturday against mark portugal , a veteran with a 1011 record , who was skipped in his last two turns while juden and brian williams , another rookie , started sunday could be dicey the thorniest problem for the braves could come sunday , if the race is still alive they will use charlie leibrandt , who has 15 victories but none in his last four starts \( the reds scored six runs off him in the first inning tuesday night \) the astros are scheduled to start pete harnisch , their best pitcher with 11 victories and a 264 earned run average , the league s fifth lowest but he has had a sore shoulder and there is a chance he will not pitch but the braves were not pondering those matchups today they were hunting deer and doing all of those other fun things for the dodgers , though , it was a different matter candlestick park is where the dodgers lost the 1982 division championship , which the braves won on the last day they 've got to be thinking about '82 , said olson , who today was n't thinking about '91 especially if it comes down to the last game even though probably none of them were there , except tommy lasorda and maybe a couple coaches
suddenly the mets seem to be in the market for the kind of manager the yankees always sought under george steinbrenner a man who not only can manage but who also is a personality , someone who could attract the attention of the fans , whose numbers dwindled at shea stadium this season who is that man \? the club s braintrust itself apparently does n't know at this point , although the mets are prepared to depart from past practice and go outside the organization for the man they hope can restore them to contending status al harazin , the new general manager , whose first task will be to name bud harrelson s successor , said yesterday that he preferred someone with major league managing experience , and plenty of those people exist all having been fired from previous jobs dallas may be too hot the man most widely mentioned in recent weeks has been dallas green , who has a dynamic personality and managerial experience with the yankees and the philadelphia phillies but the mets' onthespot executives , harazin and gerry hunsicker , would have to feel they had no other viable candidate before talking to green i think al would be a little nervous about dallas , an executive of another club said yesterday , pinpointing the problem green , who also is a former general manager and club president , likes to have authority beyond his role as manager harazin and hunsicker , being new to their jobs , could feel threatened by green s presence twentyone coaches on major league teams have been major league managers most attractive among them , from a purely baseball standpoint , could be rene lachemann of oakland and hal lanier of philadelphia , although they are not noted for stirring up excitement exmanagers with credentials six former managers are unemployed after having been fired earlier this season another fired manager , buck rodgers , would have been a primary candidate for the mets , but he was hired by the california angels five weeks ago should the mets have acted more quickly in their dismissal of harrelson and snatched rodgers , who had been available since montreal fired him june 3 \? probably , but they apparently knew that rodgers preferred working in california other former managers lurk elsewhere , some in front offices , some in scouting positions , some in the minor leagues frank robinson , in baltimore s front office since the orioles removed him as their manager in may , would make an attractive candidate he is knowledgeable , he can be tough \( which harrelson was n't when he needed to be \) , and he is a personality but frank cashen , the departing general manager , finds him abrasive , and he will have input into the decision the mets could find their manager in the minors , where bill virdon works as a roving outfeld instructor for pittsburgh virdon has 13 years of major league managing experience , though none since 1984 he managed the pirates , the yankees , houston and montreal , and has always commanded his players' respect he s tough , the kind of guy the mets need , said an official of another club virdon , 60 years old , displayed his toughness last spring it was his confrontation with barry bonds that led to a shouting encounter between bonds and jim leyland , the pirates' manager pittsburgh s thirdbase coach , gene lamont , has been mentioned as a candidate for the florida marlins' managing job and could also be considered by the mets lamont managed in the minors for eight years if the mets do n't find an experienced manager they like , they could consider major league coaches two who stand out are don baylor of milwaukee and davey lopes of texas they also could check the broadcasting booth that s where the st louis cardinals found joe torre last year , and look at how the cardinals did this season photo mike cubbage , with mel stottlemyre , in first game as interim manager \( ruby washington the new york times \)
united nations , july 30 the head of a special united nations commission overseeing the elimination of iraq s chemical and nuclear arsenals told the security council today that his inspectors had found iraqi chemical weapons in quantities more than four times greater than baghdad had acknowledged the official , rolf ekeus , said that where iraq had reported having from 10 , 000 to 11 , 000 chemical shells and warheads , the inspectors had found 46 , 000 instead of the 650 tons of raw material for such weapons iraq had reported , he said the inspectors found 3 , 000 tons mr ekeus said a large number of the chemical weapons declared by the iraqis or discovered by the inspection team had turned out to contain relatively harmless tear gas but he emphasized that they were military weapons , to be used in combat , rather than riotcontrol weapons normally used by the police he said some of the chemical warheads were armed with sarin , a powerful nerve gas , and that some of the warheads were fitted on scud missiles scuds armed with conventional explosives were fired at saudi arabia and israel during the war search for biological arms the new disclosures led mr ekeus to reemphasize his complaint that iraq continues to obstruct efforts to find and destroy all its weapons of mass destruction we still lack sufficient cooperation from the iraqis , mr ekeus said and we hope it will be forthcoming he said a special team of inspectors would be going into iraq on saturday exclusively to look for biological weapons , even though iraq has stated unequivocally that it has none they will be looking at nondeclared sites , he said the fourth agency inspection team began work in iraq saturday and will remain for two weeks , mr ekeus said he said that beginning in september , some 70 weapons and munitions experts would spend six to eight weeks at a declared chemicalweapons site near the city of samarra , which was first visited by united nations teams in june 6 inspection missions the 25squaremile site , which contains 70 buildings , is heavily contaminated and has unexploded ordnance , he said two other teams are to visit other chemicalwarfare sites in august , at times and place to be announced later in all , 6 inspection missions have been carried out in iraq by the special commission and 10 more are in the active planning stage , mr ekeus said speaking to reporters after the security council meeting , the british representative , sir david hannay , agreed that there is real doubt whether disclosures are the full and complete disclosures we are looking for he also noted that the effort to force iraq to adhere to the security council resolutions was rolling forward and was yielding fruit , slowly but surely he said he expected inspections to continue into october mr ekeus announced that 62 iraqi ballistic missiles had been destroyed along with an unspecified number of launchers and missile decoys a search is under way , he said , to make sure no more ballistic missiles exist in iraq hans blix , head of the international atomic energy agency and the official in charge of eliminating iraq s nuclear weapons program , took part in today s consultations and said afterward that despite the efforts of three teams of inspectors , important components of iraq s uraniumenrichment program were still missing concealing a major program some information has been given , he said but there is still much to be wished for in his remarks to the council , mr blix defended the international atomic energy agency s condemnation of iraq s attempts to hide the size and nature of its nuclear materials production program iraq had responded to the condemnation by saying the amount of undecleared material was insignificant and argued that now that the amount was known , it was no longer in noncompliance the failure of iraq to report had regard not just to a technical matter involving small quantities of nuclear material , mr blix said , but amounted to an attempt to conceal a major program for the enrichment of uranium part of the nuclear agency s mandate under security council resolution 687 , which set conditions for a ceasefire in the persian gulf war , is to set up a program for longterm monitoring and verifying iraq s adherence to the resolution s provisions for iraqi disarmanent inspections to continue an interim program continuing the present program of onsite inspections will continue but , mr blix said , regrettably , we do not yet have an inventory of all nuclear material in iraq he continued , it would be premature to submit any final proposal for future ongoing monitoring and verification mr blix said that while it was too early to draw lessons from the current inspections , the fact that from the early 1980 s until now iraq was able to conduct its uranium enrichment program undetected cast doubts on the agency s verification program we need more teeth in it , he said mr blix noted that the iraqi nuclear program was particularly difficult to uncover because it was indigenous he said the usual way to verify nuclear program is through declarations from the country involved and from its suppliers in this case , it was n't enough , he said fortunately , we had intelligence from outside in the future , he said , inspectors must have access to all information , including satellite data , they must have the right to go everywhere and they must have the backing of the security council if that right is denied
millburn if audiences crave excess and frivolity when the economy is in crisis , then the paper mill playhouse production of the merry widow is just the flaming antidote for a current malaise that has been described as fiscal anemia in a new 14 million production that substitutes broadway pizazz and generic vulgarism for oldstyle viennese charm , franz lehar s infinitely melodious confection , circa 1905 , survives a shamelessly campy and outrageously ornate goingover it does so as heartily as it has outlived innumerable variations , from the ballet stage to the ice skating rink , not to mention several screen versions and none of those were sparked by the ineffable judy kaye in the title role she plays the wealthy widow who is being wooed by every frenchman in sight but marsovia , the mythical frenchruled kingdom where she lives , is in hock , and if her millions are spent in paris , that s it for marsovia so the powers of marsovia must be on the lookout for a local lover for the widow , and , for a touch of decadence , their wives divert the outsiders in robert johanson s adaptation , marsovia , as in other english retellings , remains the name for the original pontevedrinia , but the widow , hanna , usually renamed sonia , is still hanna no matter cafe maxim s and the girls , girls , girls , girls , girls are , as ever , lolo , cloclo , froufrou , dodo and joujou though they are unidentified in the paper mill program as adapter and director , mr johanson takes an approach that uses a little from here , a little from there , but brings no originality or distinctiveness to any of it a duet composed for a pair of secondary lovers \( the unfaithful valencienne and de rosillion \) has been transferred , most sensibly , to the primary ones \( hanna and count danilo , played by richard white \) a couple of vintage lehar arias \( from giuditta and the land of smiles \) infiltrate the score , most agreeably , but then so does offenbach in an allout thirdact cancan if mr johanson s innovative powers were in line with the paper mill budget , what a fresh , entrancing , not just expensive merry widow this might have been instead , the crusty cliches of oldstyle operetta are supplanted by the cliches of oldhat musical comedy , with crass socalled comic relief thrown in for nonstop gaiety , every scene is a soiree with cherubs , tassels and blue velvet curtains enframing the proscenium , michael anania s settings range from sumptuous to garish witness an elegant firstact embassy , with its revolving staircase a gorgeous secondact villa , with a flowerfilled garden and a revolving bridge , and a scarlet maxim s in the third act , flanked by sequined lamps and backed by a gargantuan stained glass art nouveau disk that moves upward , landing overhead , as dancers in their swings descend in an enormous cast , those clandestine lovers , rapturously played and sung by hallie neill and mark janicello , have a more romantic thing going than the stars presumably because of an indisposition that caused him to miss several shows two weeks ago , richard white s resplendent baritone sounded restrained more mellow than usual but unfailingly pleasing at the performance attended his understudy , joseph mahowald , is scheduled to go on in all remaining matinees as danilo , mr white is at his most ardent when he is dancing across the stage by himself the count , once in love with hanna , is supposed to be resistant this time around , but here s a danilo who appears so deliriously accustomed to his face that one imagines he is searching for its reflection when he gazes into hanna s eyes a clownish turn near the finale , when he blurts out the passion he has been holding in , hardly supports a performance so steeped in selfadulation it remains for ms kaye s dramatic conviction to make us believe that mr white cares besides , she s a grand diva and a funny lady it s hard to envision a more insouciant widow the line i'm just a simple country girl who married well could have been written with ms kaye s downtoearth comic manner in mind although the theater s overly zealous sound engineers may be imparting an unnecessary edge to the soprano s high register , her musicianship and phrasing are impeccable , and her rich middle voice and dark chest tones produce a heady effect if only the audience would refrain from applauding in the middle of her astonishing last note a meticulously shaded pianissimo that swells and softens sublimely in vilia , her secondact display pieces the aria is n't over until it s over , folks when , finally , ms kaye joins the dancers and negotiates a series of splits , each on a high c , in the cancan , you know that the search for a more complete musical performer is pointless for all the vagaries of an overloaded production , it is ms kaye who keeps the show rolling along , with her own sly perspective , and very merrily indeed the merry widow at the paper mill playhouse , brookside drive in millburn performances are wednesday through sunday at 8 pm , thursday at 2 pm and saturday and sunday at 3 pm , through may 12 box office \( 201 \) 3764343 photo hallie

kupovatoye , ussr here in the forbidden zone so close to the entombed remains of the deadly chernobyl nuclear accident , less and less seems to be forbidden for one thing , hundreds of peasants have been quietly coming home to unofficially reopen ghost villages , opting for the risk of poisonous radiation here over another noisome day in the crowded refugee apartments of kiev for another , government officials have concocted a new tourist scheme that borders on the necromantic , planning to offer vacation trips through the contaminated areas of the chernobyl radiation zone officials ever brainstorming for a way to earn fresh foreign currency believe they can attract adventurers at a pace they foresee as closer to a quick , safe whisk than a lingering , lifechanging experience see the dead city of chernobyl see the sarcophagus of the meltdown , tight as tut s tomb is there a place where people do not die sooner or later \? asked olga chikolovits , waxing carefree as a living tourist poster herself after emerging from her handsome little house here into the evening cold she hid shyly at first , but the chimney smoke from her birthplace was a giveaway of life where there was supposed to be none , under the laws of the kremlin and radiology the government said too much radiation here , but none over there , she said , gesturing peevishly toward the neighboring village over the hill , no less inviting in its simple bucolic way then they found radiation over there , too , last year and closed it what can you believe \? so i came home the only suggestion of death during a visit here was in the far corner of the front yard of the little house across the way , the reclaimed home of maria ilchenka , mrs chikolovits s colleague in breaking the ban on habitation miss ilchenka was chasing a feisty , multihued rooster he was caught on the semifly , squawking , and in an instant his head was on the chopping block , detached that rooster got too lively for his own good , said miss ilchenka , a durable woman wiping her hands on her coat she offered a moonfaced grin along with fresh dried pumpkin seeds and bootleg potato vodka , homegrown treats from her reclaimed corner of this ukrainian hamlet between chernobyl and kiev , in the forbidden zone after the explosion at the nuclear plant that alarmed the world in april 1986 , the government closed down scores of villages , buried their contents , slew the farm animals and shipped out everyone s kith and kin the official death toll in the blast is given as 31 , but officials have conceded that scores may have died as a result of the accident sorry that they fled only parting , tearful glances at heirloom photographs were allowed during the exodus , and people who now dare to sneak back in are sorry they ever fled from the deadly cloud the government can measure as much as it wants , but it lies , said miss ilchenka the day they ordered us to get out they took the pigs and the cows and said it would be for three days after three years , i decided to come back government officials burdened with the immense job of trying to police the contamination zone , with its 20mile diameter , concede that lately they have been looking the other way when some of the oldtime residents of this rugged farm country come back to their humble old homesteads , exhausted by the crammed urban existence of ecological refugees freelance guides have been accompanying rublepaying soviet visitors to this area for some time the prices of the new chernobyl tours have not been specified by excursion sponsors in kiev , but they are expected to be aimed more at hardcurrency visitors press mocks the idea the idea of tourism is mocked in the soviet press as another halfbaked attempt at entrepreneurial invention in a land lost in the economic wasteland of communism even at that , the notion has the virtue of dark candor , of daring to think the outside world might like to at least leer , if not memorialize , a historic outrage upon one of the earth s humbler landscapes against the glow of a winter sunset , radiation is as invisible here as the charm is palpable in scores of lifelorn , shutdown hamlets , scattered at tumbledown turns in the road the sight and sound of miss ilchenka s barking dog was like noah s dove in the all too quiet countryside then the hidden life emerged , friendly and fatalistic have a drink , miss ilchenka implored , saying her roughedged homemade hooch was like no other excursion officials say they also are planning a stop at slavutich , a radiation workers' town where the slogan is life is good , but too short 'where can you hide \? ' radiation is certainly something to be afraid of , said mrs chikolovits , husky and beaming as she displayed the warm fire in her home but where can you hide from it around here \? when the government finds that safe place where no one ever dies , i will leave here , she said , grinning and hungrily crunching on the postmeltdown pumpkin seeds the tourist trips are envisioned as allinclusive that means that dosimetrics the monitoring of radiation dosages will be at hand , casual as a venice gondola , to see that nothing more pernicious than chernobyl memories is burned into visitors maps of the soviet union showing location of chernobyl \( pg a3 \)
in 1961 , married and with a new baby , i came close to buying a jaguar roadster it was faded blue and lacked a roof the engine also had some sort of lifethreatening cough , but that was not why i bowed to my wife s wishes and begged off the asking price was a hardtoresist 500 , but even i recognized that a twoseat roadster was not the most practical of cars that is still true , but jaguar has come a long way in the last three decades , and today s ragtop has been a success despite the hurdles the company has gone through a confusing array of names , being known variously as british leyland , bl , jaguarrovertriumph , jrt and , more recently , simply jaguar it has surmounted a wellentrenched reputation for the bad quality of its lucas electrical system and for its constant need for repair there is even the joke that nudges jaguar in the ribs by asking why the british persist in drinking warm beer the answer \? they have lucas refrigerators for all its troubles , though , jaguar has remained a classic , and ford revered it sufficiently to pay 25 billion for the company in november 1989 , creating yet another corporate entity since then , ford has pushed the quality issue , implementing among other things its own system of checks throughout the assembly process we are evaluating production quality on a point system , said mike cook , jaguar s spokesman the higher the score , the poorer the car , and we do this all the way along the line initially , the scores were high , but we 've brought them down , and that s resulting in betterbuilt cars the lineup comprises three series of sedans , xj6 , sovereign and vanden plas , and the xjs coupe and convertible last year , the factory at coventry , england , produced almost 42 , 000 cars , and the united states took the biggest share , with 3 , 000 of them convertibles the company , hurting like the rest of the industry , is making no predictions for '91 , and sales may be depressed further by the weakening of the dollar according to cook , the exchange rate forced price increases at the beginning of the year and again on april 1 that means , he said , that the least expensive xj6 is now 43 , 000 , and the convertible with its v12 engine is 63 , 600 , a price that includes a 3 , 000 gasguzzler tax but does not include the new federal luxury tax on anything over 30 , 000 for a long time , the xjs was one of the better buys among pricier machinery , but it has in some respects been left behind by other cars that is not surprising , of course , given that the sportiest jag was introduced as a 1976 model and has changed little since what is surprising is that the design still seems so fresh there is the long , sloping hood , the roomy trunk , the combination of chrome and blackout trim , and the generally aggressive look the test car was arrestme red with a black convertible roof and polished alloy wheels shod with 15inch pirellis a brass plaque on the trunk proclaimed it a collection classic , and that translates into this year s update , chiefly noticeable in the use of light interior colors the creamy leather interior and glossy elm trim bespoke bags of luxury , and the jag could hardly be described as anything other than a veddy nice car but i do have problems with a 60 , 000plus vehicle that leaves out or misplaces items that have come to be accepted in far less expensive products where , for instance , is the automatic down switch for the driver s window \? or the inside release for the trunk \? and , most annoying , why are there no power controls to tailor the position of the driver s seat \? driving position , in fact , leaves a lot to be desired fore and aft travel is limited , and a person of average height has a hard time getting far enough away from the wheel what is needed , obviously , is a telescoping column of course , none of that matters when you are on the road , or preening as a proud occupant forget that the car averages only about 15 miles per gallon of premium unleaded it is sleek , big , hushed , heavy and fast its beautiful 53liter engine puts out 263 horsepower , and the 12 cylinders purr as they should the jag exudes prestige , and there are good little things , too the leatherwrapped wheel houses an air bag the power steering has just the right amount of stiffness , and the car is easy to drive there are antilock brakes , a trip computer and a spectacular alpine sound system with 80 watts of power the top , lined in soft cloth , fits perfectly it goes up and down at the touch of a button , and the car is quiet even in its sunshine mode for a roadster , too , storage is more than ample come to think of it , if that blue car had been this practical back in 1961 , i would have bought it it would n't have mattered about the roof photos for 1991 , the xjs convertible rides on cast alloy wheels , has an air bag for the driver , offers heated sideview mirrors and adds fog lamps to its halogen lighting system \( jaguar cars inc \)
five years ago , michael blake was living in his car in southern california , spending nights in friends' houses and writing a novel about a united states army officer in the civil war who is sent to a fort on the western frontier and deserts his post to become a member of an indian tribe tonight the 45yearold mr blake will be sitting in a theater in southern california waiting to find out if he has won the academy award for best screenplay adaptation for the hugely successful movie he wrote based on that novel , dances with wolves i want to win , mr blake said recently , sitting in the office of newmarket press , which is publishing a hardcover edition of the novel yeah , man i want to win if there is an edge to mr blake s tone of voice , it seems justified at first practically nobody wanted his book , which was originally published only in paperback and when , more than two years later , it became the no 1 paperback bestseller , it was because of the movie , which practically nobody thought should be made two of mr blake s friends jim wilson , the film s coproducer , and kevin costner , its star , director and coproducer thought it should be made , however , despite feelings in the industry that it would be too difficult to film and to market they fought for it and won , and now dances with wolves has received 12 oscar nominations , including best picture , best actor and best director last week , mr blake won the writers guild award for his screenplay hope for the country some critics have said that the movie oversimplifies , especially in portraying virtually all the sioux characters as noble savages and all the white men with the exception of the hero , lieutenant dunbar as ruthless and cruel but that apparently has n't bothered moviegoers dances with wolves has sold more than 128 million worth of tickets in the united states and canada , variety reports mr blake said he was concerned that audiences might not accept the film s basic premise i was afraid , he said , that sooner or later someone would say 'you 've got a movie where the hero s a traitor to his country you ca n't have a movie like that' but it never happened that to me is the most satisfying thing about the film it s the idea that 'my country right or wrong' does n't necessarily wash 'my country right or wrong' is a concept that holds our country back i think the movie makes a strong statement against that concept and the fact that people are willing to sit still for that statement gives me a lot of hope for america something else that pleases him is the acceptance of the use of lakota , the sioux language , for the movie s indian dialogue and the use of subtitles , even though american audiences have in the past been notorious for their unwillingness to accept subtitles i think kevin and i both realized that we could n't make this movie right without having these people speak their own language , mr blake said we 're a very isolationist country , and a lot of time americans do n't acknowledge that there are other people living in the world this is a step in making that acknowledgement one reason for the success of dances with wolves , mr blake believes , is what he perceives as an immense amount of hidden guilt in america it is a guilt about the way we 've treated our country , he said the people who used to live here , the land itself and the animals that live here yet and in a certain way , 'dances with wolves' is a very contemporary movie because we are still treating certain people as if they 're just in the way how it all started mr blake met mr wilson in 1977 in film school at the university of california at berkeley he met mr costner in 1981 while writing a movie about gamblers called stacy s knights it was directed by mr wilson and starred mr costner in his first leading role it was mr blake s first film , and it was not followed quickly by a second after it was made he moved into a loft in downtown los angeles and hired himself out to write lowbudget screenplays , none of which became movies but during this time he was hatching another idea , which grew out of his long interest in american indian history and his reading of bury my heart at wounded knee , dee brown s classic chronicle of the genocide committed against the indians soon a central image formed during the civil war , a teamster went out to resupply one of these godforsaken little forts on the frontier , mr blake said and when the teamster arrived , there was nobody there that early scene in the book and the movie actually happened and it all came from there , and it just started to roll one night at mr costner s house he described his idea i said , 'would n't that make a great movie \? ' and kevin said , 'do n't you dare write another movie' because i 'd written probably 15 screenplays by that time he said 'write a book you have a much better chance of reaching somebody with a book' he was adamant he was even shaking his finger at me as i left the house that night so a couple of weeks later i started writing it it was 1986 mr blake could n't afford the apartment where he was living , so he gave it up he lived in his car and most of the time slept at friends' houses , borrowing money when he needed it nine months later the book was finished and nobody wanted it 2 offers on the same day i had no agent , no publisher , no contacts , he said kevin costner was not going to get my book published for me i felt i could n't face my friends anymore i borrowed 1 , 000 from a producer and drove out to a little town in arizona called bisbee i thought i was a failure at writing i thought , 'i'm going to give up this idea that i could ever make a living from it' in the meantime , he said , mr wilson was pestering the william morris agency , where someone finally read the novel and agreed to represent mr blake for the next year the manuscript was submitted to publishers practically every hardcover house turned it down , mr blake said finally we got two offers on the same day , one from crown and one from fawcett fawcett was responsive when we asked for more money , so we went with them he was paid 6 , 500 for the novel , which came out in 1988 mr blake was still living in bisbee , working as a dishwasher at a chinese restaurant , when he got a call from mr costner asking him to return and write the screenplay now mr blake has other projects in the works they include two screenplays an adaptation of poodle springs , the novel by raymond chandler and robert parker , and an original work called mustang , based on a true story about a united states park ranger he is working on a book called helmet , which deals with hollywood and his second novel , airman mortensen , is to be published this year it s about an 18yearold in the air force who , while awaiting courtmartial , meets and falls in love with the base commander s 17yearold daughter will it become a movie \? mr blake smiled who knows \? he said anything can happen photo michael blake has been nominated for an academy award for his screenplay for dances with wolves , which is based on his novel \( keith meyers the new york times \)
riyadh , saudi arabia , feb 16 if it comes to slugging it out on the ground , as seems ever more likely , will the saudi army fight \? american officials and others have been asking that question for months now , and they are asking it with increasing frequency as a land offensive seems to be drawing closer its importance is not so much military as political the performance of the far more numerous american , british , french and egyptian troops will count for more on the battlefield , but how the saudis do in pushing hostile forces back from their borders will constitute an important test of national will the saudi air force is solid , said a western diplomat , who asked that he not be quoted by name the first pilot to shoot down two enemy planes was a saudi , and that did n't come as much of a surprise here being a pilot is a princely sort of thing to do it attracts welleducated , capable people but the land forces , no they 'll be visible in the battle , but we 're certainly not counting on them much , not even after khafji saudi performance at khafji in the battle at khafji , which produced the only sustained ground fighting of the war to date , saudi forces , with heavy backing from qatari armored vehicles and united states marine corps reconnaissance , artillery , close air support planes and antitank helicopters , drove the iraqis back the saudis have about 65 , 000 personnel on active duty 'our people can fight' wherever you turn in the gulf you find confidence that our people can fight , said ghazi algosaibi , a prominent saudi diplomat and writer , in a typical postbattle comment he argued that the war was proving the toughness of the thinly populated kingdoms and emirates in the gulf , showing that these are not just sheiks getting their legitimacy through oil but interviews with marines who took part in the fight at khafji and others who serve with them near the kuwait border are less sanguine they took their time getting in there , said a marine officer they were they always are extremely cautious about engaging , although individual soldiers showed a considerable amount of bravery for several nights they did n't even show up , said a marine sergeant whose squad was assigned , along with a saudi unit , to man a vital highway checkpoint when they did show up , they just sat in the tent and waved people through to our position now we have made them stand on the road , but they are n't as vigilant as we want them to be they leave their posts a lot in the middle of the night turn around , they 're gone marksmen they are not a sergeant who has worked intensively with saudi infantrymen on the firing range said none came close to hitting a bull seye they had trouble hitting the target , he said all around saudi encampments in the desert are parked rows of new toyotas and fullsized american cars they belong to the soldiers , who hop into them whenever they can and head into town , shedding their uniforms officers spend much of their time attending to business interests in the rear , said western military attaches who know the saudi army well the problem has been around since the saudi army s inception as fiercely independent individuals who survived on the desert for centuries with nothing but their own wits and fortitude , wrote sandra mackey in the saudis , speaking of peacetime troops , the saudis are not about to submit to the discipline of the army family and tribe remain the center of any saudi s existence , and for this reason it is difficult to keep the military recruits the country does have at their posts some units better than others maj gen paul schwartz , now on his second tour of duty in saudi arabia , this time as the officer charged with coordinating coalition forces , spoke guardedly about the saudi army , emphasizing that some units are better than others , referring to some attitudinal and psychological problems and insisting that it was unfair to compare saudi troops to american troops they are trained and up and ready to fight , he said by regional standards , they are qualified and able to defeat this enemy nonetheless , anecdotal evidence of difficulties abounds one problem , in the view of some american military officials , is a certain saudi languor a request from the united states army for clearance for a visitor to a saudi headquarters this week , for example , was submitted on an urgent basis on tuesday and was held up until friday then there is the maintenance crisis most saudis love to drive vehicles but do not like to do repair work on them , so tanks and jeeps and other expensive gear fall apart rapidly in the punishing climate david lamb asserts in his book the arabs that saudi arabia s greatest liability is that no one has learned to turn the nuts or tighten the screws , and it is a special problem in the army , where foreign mechanics are often not available to do the work , as they are in the air force and civil life royal commanders the saudi army is split into two units , the national guard , which is based along tribal lines , and the regular forces , which are not , in an effort to guarantee security from internal trouble rather than external enemies the national guard is commanded by crown prince abdullah , king fahd s half brother , who is a conservative in saudi terms , and the defense ministry , which controls the army , is headed by prince sultan , the king s full brother , who is more liberal and is often described as prince abdullah s chief rival the result is inefficency , some experts say actually , it is hard to see how the nation s slim population base about eight million , at latest estimate could produce armed forces large enough to protect this vast nation , as big as india and mostly barren , from a concerted attack by outsiders the only solution was to buy hightech weapons , use foreigners for support jobs in the military as they are used in civil life , and develop allies who would send help when it was needed that is what saudi arabia has done in the last 15 years or so since the war began , the kingdom has done what it could to improve morale king fahd decreed the 18 soldiers killed at khafji to be martyrs , and officials said their families would continue to receive their full salaries and a very large , very substantial monetary offering of support but there have been signs that the royal family has intruded upon the war effort a nonroyal ministry official said in an interview this week that some minor princelings , had made windfall profits from contracts to supply food , water and other supplies to the allied forces but there appears to be no prospect that the islamic holy month of ramadan , beginning in midmarch , when observant muslims fast during daylight hours , will deter the saudis from fighting not only will they be given special dispensation , but they will have before them the example of their revered forebear , the prophet mohammed , who frequently led his religious armies into battle during ramadan accused by some of desecrating a holy month , he replied , dissension is more wicked than killing
the knicks arrived in chicago yesterday as decided underdogs in the threeoffivegame series with the bulls that begins tonight underdogs because chicago won 22 more regularseason games decided because chicago has michael jordan on its side while the bulls have steadily improved as a team , jordan s impact remains omnipresent after all , he won his fifth consecutive national basketball association scoring title this season none of his teammates were named allstars and when the bulls are in trouble , they still want the ball in jordan s hands yet the bulls are no longer the onedimensional team they were a few years ago onedimensional teams do n't win 61 of 82 games the bulls play outstanding team defense , they rebound well , and they are rich in playoff experience , having reached the eastern conference final for three consecutive seasons jordan is driven to win an nba championship , and this is the best chance he has ever had here is how the teams match up starters forget about stopping jordan the knicks' main goal is to eliminate the 5 to 12minute stretches when jordan can dominate a game and decide the outcome trent tucker gets the starting assignment of defending jordan when tucker goes out , gerald wilkins will take his chances wilkins usually does a respectable job against jordan , but a sprained ankle has kept him sidelined since march 28 , and his game is surely rusty new york will doubleteam jordan a lot , but everyone does the basic book is to force him left , keep him off the baseline , and make him shoot jump shots that may keep him under 30 points on a bad shooting night jordan averaged 31 points against new york during the regular season , but he could have scored more the knicks would settle for that scoring average during the playoffs but new york , which often struggles to reach 100 points , would have trouble withstanding a 40 or 50point game from jordan also a superb defensive player , jordan loves to roam on defense looking for steals look for tucker to attempt to make jordan pay by making jump shots whenever he is left alone two veterans will square off at point guard maurice cheeks and john paxson at age 34 , cheeks had a soso season by his standards , but he is still quicker than paxson , and he has a history of raising his game in the playoffs the knicks want cheeks to look more for his shot because they need scoring from him defensively , cheeks must be careful when he leaves paxson to doubleteam jordan because paxson is an outstanding jump shooter if new york is to upset chicago , patrick ewing must dominate bill cartwright at center ewing averaged 266 points this season , but just 203 points against chicago cartwright uses his strength to muscle ewing away from the low post ewing s challenge is to keep his composure , to avoid foul trouble , and to play like who he is one of the game s top centers and when ewing is doubleteamed , he must pass well and avoid taking bad shots for the knicks' halfcourt offense to be effective scottie pippen has developed into one of the league s best small forwards at 6 feet 8 inches , pippen \( 177 points \) is most dangerous in the open court he runs the floor exceptionally well , filling the lane for fastbreak dunks his jumper has greatly improved he has learned to avoid foul trouble and he handles the ball well enough to lead the fast break no longer afraid to take clutch shots , pippen s only weakness is a propensity for turnovers but he is also an excellent passer kiki vandeweghe , who practiced yesterday despite having the flu , ca n't expect to stop pippen so vandeweghe s job is to match pippen s offensive production that will not be easy vandeweghe \( 167 points \) had a steady season , but he is no longer the explosive player he was several years ago he did not score 30 points in any game this season unless vandeweghe holds his own against pippen in points , new york is in severe trouble the powerforward matchup between charles oakley and horace grant is critical both are physical players who lead their team in rebounding and both players raise their level of play during the playoffs grant is a much better lowpost scorer than oakley he shot 60 percent from the field against new york this season grant s priority is to keep oakley away from the offensive boards , where he is most dangerous oakley averaged 145 rebounds against chicago bench this is still a weakness for the bulls backup point guard b j armstrong hurt the knicks this season , but will perdue , craig hodges , stacey king and cliff levingston were nonfactors a 10point game from any substitute is a major bonus for chicago the knicks' bench , other than wilkins , is a question mark mark jackson will back cheeks , but jackson will only play a lot of he plays well right away brian quinnett must prove he can shoot well under playoff pressure coach john macleod has demoted john starks to fifth guard , after starks played regularly much of the season i'm going with experience , macleod said kenny walker had a decent final month , but a disappointng regular season eddie lee wilkins will play only when ewing is tired or in foul trouble jerrod mustaf is not expected to play much at all coaches macleod has much more playoff experience than phil jackson , but macleod has never coached the knicks in the playoffs jackson coached the bulls steadily during last year s playoffs , and there is no reason to expect that to change macleod is also coaching with his job on the line whether that changes his decisions remains to be seen conclusion it would be a major upset if new york wins no eighthseeded team has ever beaten a firstseeded team in the nba playoffs do this year s knicks strike you as a team ready to make history \?

from his circus series in both , the gowns dovima wore one white , the other black were designed by yves st laurent for christian dior unlike the photograph of dovima in black , which was printed many times , mr avedon said that the image of dovima in white was printed only once and the negative no longer exists it disappeared mysteriously , he said when asked why he thinks the dovima in black is the favorite , mr avedon said it s the fate of the image like people , some are chosen , some ignored now , because of its rarity , the photograph of dovima in white is estimated by sotheby s to bring 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 , far more than prints of dovima in black sell for at auction mr avedon did a modern edition of dovima in black in the 1970 s , said beth gateswarren , who heads sotheby s photography sales in new york he did silver prints in 2 sizes , 10 inches by 8 inches and 23 inches by 18 inches both sizes were auctioned in new york in 1988 , the smaller version at christie s for 1

although less than the 154 , 000 record at auction for a work by this photographer , paid in april for palm tree , cuernavaca , from 1925 , at christie s in new york sotheby s estimates that weston s clouds from 1924 will bring 120 , 000 to 125 , 000 and tina modotti and her mother , from 1922 , 40 , 000 to 60 , 000 the work of modotti , a littleknown italian photographer who learned the craft

well as four images from other sellers none of the owners are identified the most important of these photographs is a 1926 study of a worker s hands holding a shovel , an image that foreshadowed her

auction record for a single photograph at christie s photography sale on thursday at 10 am and 2 pm , weston is once again represented with a horizonless photograph of a palm tree , palma , cuernavaca i , from 1924 , described in the catalogue as a platinum or palladium print in sharp contrast to the 1925 image that christie s auctioned in april , which shows the trunk of a tree against a cloudless sky , this 1924 study is of the trunk and the fronds against a partly cloudy sky it s the same tree photographed on different trips , said monika half , a photography specialist at christie s when asked why the presale estimate is 60 , 000 to 80 , 000 , well below the 154 , 000 paid in april , ms half said we clearly expect it to do better than the estimate there are probably no more than three images of this photograph another rarity in the christie s sale is man ray s coat stand , from 1920 , a witty image of a mannequinlike coat stand with a woman s head , arms and shoulders , behind which stands a naked woman wearing a black stocking on one leg the seller , gerard levy , a paris art dealer , knew man ray ms half said this print might be the only one with a white spot on the abdomen apparently , she said , that spot was later touched out of the negative the presale estimate is 60 , 000 to 80 , 000 the 1927 portrait of eugene atget by berenice abbott is rare on several counts abbott was one of the few photographers permitted to make a portrait of atget , and the side view of the aging french photographer in a dark coat peering forward is the best of the three images she did of him , abbott wrote later he really dressed up for this , ms half said normally , atget wore casual clothes before abbott was able to get a print to him , she discovered he had died the 1930

last fall the news media were momentarily fascinated by the notion that the oldest parts of the bible the foundation stones of judaism , christianity , islam and much of western civilization were written by a woman those passages have long been labeled with the letter j because they referred to god as yahweh , or jahve , according to the german scholars who did the textual spadework sometime around 500 bc , the distinctive j material was knitted with at least three other later strands known as e \( in which god was named elohim \) , d \( the book of deuteronomy \) and p \( priestly material focused on ritual and law \) the result was the first five books of the bible , the torah or pentateuch in its final form all that is standardissue biblical scholarship , to which orthodox jews and some conservative christians take exception but not standard to anyone was the proposal of harold bloom , the literary critic and professor at yale university , who wrote the book of j , published by grove weidenfeld according to mr bloom , the j texts were composed by a sophisticated woman of royal blood , writing in the unhappy reign of king solomon s lackluster successor , rehoboam moreover , j was not a lover or fearer of yahweh she was a worldly skeptic , a storyteller whose gift for ironic , sublime comedy makes her the literary peer of homer , dante , chaucer , shakespeare and kafka what mr bloom calls the riveting literary character that j molded from oral traditions about yahweh current in her time helped give birth to three religions and western culture but it also makes her , mr bloom wrote , the most blasphemous writer that ever lived is there any higher tribute that the very model of a modern intellectual could pay to a writer about religion \? ms moses , time magazine promptly crowned j the woman who invented god , said newsweek , adding that the other scholars were yet to be heard from several months later , some of the scholarly returns are coming in they make clear why some of the 70 , 000 people who bought the book of j may have been disappointed with it those are the people , believers and nonbelievers , who approach religion in search of a smoking gun , convinced that faith may turn on whether a chunk of noah s ark is found near mount ararat or exactly how the red sea parted for the children of israel mr bloom is not interested in that kind of historical detective work having toyed with the idea of a female j , cheerfully calling it a fiction when pressed , and having reaped the consequent publicity , he expressed regret for ever making so much of the writer s sex in fact , his theory rests almost entirely on the circumstantial evidence that j treats female biblical personages so empathetically the same logic would lead us to conclude that the author of 'madame bovary' was a woman , said david stern in a review in the feb 4 issue of the new republic earlier , jack miles , the book editor of the los angeles times who has published studies of the books of job and jonah , argued in commonweal that mr bloom suffered a failure of nerve when he failed to see where his own description of j led by mr bloom s own criteria , j could be none other than the elderly bathsheba , the once beautiful occasion for david s sin , now a dowager queen who had outlived her son solomon ! mr miles s and mr stern s reviews were among several that have recently addressed not just the female j hypothesis but also the central point of the book of j , that the yahwist texts deserve the honors usually accorded the established bible , described elsewhere by mr bloom as a botch at the heart of the book of j is a triangle first there is j then there is j s blasphemous yahweh an irascible , capricious , volatile deity , mischievous at best and downright murderous at worst , not to be conceived as holiness or righteousness but as vitality , mr bloom said and finally there is the normative tradition , all the orthodoxies of later biblical , jewish , christian or scholarly interpretations it has covered up j s god with moralizing revising , censoring and mutilating j , reducing her yahweh to a gaseous vapor or a kind of retired university president in the sky her original vision can be regained only by scrubbing away the varnish deposited by the other biblical strands the rabbis , the church fathers , the philosophers and even bible scholars mr bloom s reviewers vary in their impatience at his conjecturing and his rather free and easy way with modern findings about j and the pentateuch writing in the jan 30 issue of the christian century , christopher r seitz , an associate professor of old testament at yale , recalled the boxing trainer who began a news conference by announcing , i do n't want to tell you any halftruths unless they are completely accurate but where these three reviewers converge is in challenging mr bloom s conviction that all the biblical layers in which j is embedded are so much normative varnish with j , mr miles wrote , bloom wants history to stop mr miles found it a strange position for a critic celebrated for insights about the ways in which creativity involves the struggle of later writers to transform through misreading the achievements of their predecessors mr bloom s concept of the normative is pretty much a chimera , a straw man , wrote mr stern , a platitudinous , authoritarian image that may have been born of endless afternoons passed unhappily in hebrew school once j and j s yahweh are isolated from the rest of the pentateuch , are they simply not another chapter , however skillful , in the mythology of boisterous gods inhabiting places like olympus except that mr bloom s j and her yahweh seem a lot like blownup versions of a skeptical college professor and his nietzschean daydreams of vitality rampant \? take away the bible s enduring religious claims that exert a tug even on nonbelievers , and what is left of the boldness that mr bloom considers j s blasphemy \? blasphemy depends upon belief , said the early 20thcentury english writer g k chesterton if anyone doubts this , let him sit down seriously and try to think blasphemous thoughts about thor is n't it precisely the bible s normative framework that gives j s portrait of an unruly , energetic god its power to astonish and awe \? of course , there is an entirely different way of reading the book of j why not take seriously the author s hints at my fiction \? why not move this bestseller from the nonfiction to the fiction list and recognize it as a novel \? when the book of j is read as a novel , j and yahweh become subsidiary characters the real protagonist , as in so much modern fiction , is the narrator , the i who sets forth his commentary and reveals himself as the intellectual still in rebellion against a childhood orthodoxy , the senior academic pining for zorbalike vitalism , the literary critic striving to transcend his profession by conjuring into existence a sublime writer , the equal of shakespeare and the creator of god as a novel , the book of j is no literary rival to the bible , but it is intriguing and poignant too bad that it did n't make use of bathsheba wheatland \( grove weidenfeld \)
galileo jean cocteau repertory bouwerie lane theater manhattan through feb 14 by bertolt brecht english version by charles laughton direction and lighting by eve adamson set by john brown costumes by jonathan bixby music by hanns eisler production manager , patrick heydenburg presented by the jean cocteau repertory theater , robert hupp , artistic director with harris berlinsky , jeanne demers , ian duckett , robert ierardi , corinne julie kendall , joseph menino , william charles mitchell , grant neale , kate sherry , craig smith , elise stone , tony stone , angela vitale and mark waterman throughout history , every major advance in mankind s halting march toward knowledge has been accompanied by a crisis of faith but with the possible exception of darwin s voyage on the beagle , none were more critical than at the dawn of the age of reason when galileo cobbled together a telescope , trained it on the heavens and expanded our universe brecht s witty and incisive play on the life of galileo is timeless , even if it is politicians rather than scientists who are now moving the world into uncharted territory \( and it is the marxists who are facing a crisis of faith \) eve adamson has mounted a firstrate revival of galileo for the jean cocteau repertory , a staging that focuses on the real drama galileo s own struggle with his recantation brecht first wrote galileo in the dark days of nazi germany just before world war ii after hiroshima , which brecht said placed the conflict of galileo in a new light , he rewrote it in collaboration with charles laughton as a vehicle for the actor , and continued to tinker with it the rest of his life ms adamson has used the laughton version for the cocteau , adding some of the later emendations it is the most human portrait of a man who cannot say no to an old wine or a new thought and who knows that truth is the daughter of time , not authority the play begins with galileo s discovery of four of jupiter s satellites , observations that raise the first disturbing questions as his friend sagredo fearfully asks him , where is god \? to which galileo answers , within ourselves it was the sort of response for which giordano bruno was burned at the stake by the time galileo offers his proof that the earth circles the sun , and not the other way round , the holy office is hot on his case he cannot be tortured , the pope admonishes the inquisitor at most you can show him the instruments but as the inquisitor observes that s all it will take galileo understands machines ms adamson moves her fine cast at a steady narrative pace that takes the time to develop the conflict yet never dawdles harris berlinsky delivers a wry and convincing galileo whether conniving to get a few extra scudi from the venetian nobles or relishing a gift goose , mr berlinsky s galileo is jubilant drawing universes in chalk on the floor and distraught over his recantation most of the rest of the cast members double in various roles mark waterman is especially good in the difficult task of switching his zeal between the roles of galileo s prize pupil , andrea sarti , and the inquisitor craig smith is credible as both sagredo and pope urban viii and william charles mitchell is noteworthy as galileo s assistant , federzoni , and as cardinal bellarmin jonathan bixby s excellent costumes deserve special mention , switching fashions between the courts of venice and florence
the living room is a bedroom for debra baldwin and her five , soon to be six , children instead of a sofa and chairs , two double beds are the only furniture one sees when entering the family s temporary quarters in hempstead two more beds fill another tiny room no house plants , pictures or personal mementos adorn the premises for the homeless , a bed is the most cherished possession a person with no permanent address can eat , drink and even be merry during the day out on the streets but come nightfall , the lack of a safe place to sleep , with clean sheets and privacy , strangles the spirit members of the christian victory center know what a bed means to someone who does n't have one that is why they have turned a hempstead storefront into a 15cot emergency shelter for homeless men , and why they have renovated a 24unit apartment building into housing for homeless families mrs baldwin and her children live in one of those units the beds they sleep on were donated by members of the victory center many of the clothes they wear come from a clothing bank run by members of the victory center like missionaries to a foreign land , a malverne church congregation has come to hempstead the christian victory center is made up of 600 members of st thomas episcopal church , formerly of malverne two years ago we decided our mission would be working with the poor , said the rev craig bates , pastor of st thomas and chief executive of the christian victory center since there are n't any poor in malverne , or none that we know of , we decided on hempstead renovating an old theater the congregation bought the old rivoli theater , along with an apartment building , seven storefronts and a small office building for 17 million the theater , now renovated , is used for sunday services a middleclass congregation prays one block from the notorious terrace avenue , where drug dealing is as common as boardedup buildings i guess we are unique , father bates said normally you have suburbia helping the inner city by sending money we 're a suburban congregation that moved into the inner city hempstead s inner city exists a few miles from the stylish shops of roosevelt field , the tulipladen walks of hofstra university and the plush seats of the nassau veterans memorial coliseum , where clowns and elephants make children giggle children giggle in the inner city , too in a disinfectantsmelling stairwell james earl baldwin 2d , 6 years old , and his younger brother , emmanuel , 5 , squealed with delight as they slid down banisters three stories up the children s dangerous play was watched by no one their mother had other children to contend with , and another due on july 4 poverty breeds apathy combating the apathy of hempstead s homeless is the victory center s aim we are trying to transform people s lives , said father bates having a primarily white congregation from malverne try to change the lives of the primarily black population of hempstead could produce a racial backlash , but it has n't yet , center officials say we 're perceived as part of the neighborhood now , said dave klampert , the center s director we ca n't meet all their needs , he said but whatever we can do to help , we do whatever is handed out , the community finds out about one day i gave someone some bus tokens the next day there was a line of 30 people , all asking for bus tokens the same thing happened with pampers we have respect for the community , father bates said they are part of us that s what we are trying to accomplish the center stays open 24 hours a day we see it as a m a s h unit , the pastor said in nassau county it s a distance to go to the medical center or to social services we 're the front line and we 're receptive you do n't have to take a number and fill out an information sheet to get help with us the person who comes to us drunk tonight may get drunk again tomorrow , but he still needs to be loved the fact that we give him a name and touch him is what s important people do n't touch the homeless we try to give them dignity these are people who wash up on our shores the beachhead established by the victory center juts into one of the poorest sections of nassau it is an area overtaken by crack dealers and prostitutes but there was fran culliney of lynbrook walking past boardedup buildings recently , having just delivered her baked ziti to the men s shelter mrs culliney travels the hempstead streets often , she said , because she works in the clothing bank she is not concerned about the violence , often a part of the neighborhood i'm not the least bit nervous , she said the lord is going to protect us we are trying to connect people with people , father bates said that s something an agency ca n't do we connect a homeless mother with a mother from our congregation volunteering to work with the homeless has changed the members of his congregation take jean , for example , the pastor said she was a real yuppie , commuting to the city in sneakers and fox fur well , she started to work at one of our churches in the city after a few weeks she came upon a homeless person in grand central and suddenly she realized that s not just a homeless person , that s a man who had a mother and father and a history the next day she brought him a sandwich she did that every day i do n't know what the impact was on the man , but i know what it was on jean she will never be the same again
driven by war fears , recession and the weather , the nation s petroleum consumption fell in 1990 , the first yeartoyear drop in seven years , the american petroleum institute said yesterday although the government has called for conservation , the institute said other factors were responsible this year domestic oil production , meanwhile , fell to 72 million barrels a day the lowest level since 1961 that is down 389 , 000 barrels a day , or 51 percent , from 1989 since 1985 , production is down 173 million barrels a day victor a burk , an oil expert at arthur anderson company in houston , said that decline was equivalent to the prewar production of kuwait , and its effect on the world oil market was almost as if all the production from some of the opec countries had gone away both use and domestic output are expected to fall further this year consumption because of the weak economy and high prices , and production because american reserves are being pumped dry the most attractive drilling prospects are now abroad us output encouraged the yearend report by the institute , the industry s main trade association , comes as the energy department is in the midst of an ambitious program to keep american production high because of the crisis in the persian gulf washington s efforts , and higher domestic prices , may in fact have had a small effect while the decline in domestic crude production last year was large , it was not as steep as in the previous year , when the drop was 527 , 000 barrels a day despite the figures , analysts say that from an investor s point of view , this is not an industry in decline the drop in domestic deliveries , the industry s main measure of consumption , was 21 percent , to 1696 million barrels a day , or about 28 percent of world production george friesen , an analyst at deutsche bank group , said i do n't think declines of that magnitude are going to have a significant impact on profitability in refining and marketing refinery utilization is still tight he predicted a further decline in 1991 , of about 12 percent overseas exploration the decline in domestic production may not be bad news for the oil industry , said michael l mayer , an analyst at wertheim schroder the industry has to maximize profits and cash flows , he said if greater flows can be generated by exploring for and developing resources outside of the united states , then that s where they ought to go companies used to give development prospects in this country the benefit of the doubt in comparison with those in foreign countries , because even if the geologic prospects were questionable , the political risk was low but , mr mayer said , it s just not true any longer what s the risk of a point arguello \? he said chevron invested 2 billion there , and has produced zip production at the point arguello field , off the southern california coast near santa barbara , has been held up by fear of oil spills the decline in american output will probably be smaller in 1991 , experts said , because of higher crude prices and other factors richard nehring , president of nrg associates , in colorado springs , said the decline would probably be 2 or 3 percent to spur production , the recent budget agreement included tax breaks for oil and gas drillers , but the industry has asked for more concessions , including access to offshore and arctic areas closed for environmental reasons the national energy strategy , prepared mostly by the energy department and under consideration by the white house , is expected to call for more concessions , but critics have argued that a supply side policy , which would reduce consumption in transportation and other fields by improving efficiency , would cut imports more import share at 469 the 20 percent loss in output in recent years , plus growth in demand , has been made up by imports in 1990 , however , imports were more or less flat the import share of domestic deliveries was 469 percent last year , up from 462 percent in 1989 deliveries of all leading oil products declined , except for jet fuel , which rose about 36 percent for the year because commercial miles flown increased by about 5 percent , the institute said this was not good news for airlines , however , because they added flights more quickly in 1990 than they added passengers , according to the institute s report deliveries of gasoline , the biggest single petroleum product , fell 17 percent prices rose 30 cents a gallon between august and october , contributing to a fourthquarter decline in consumption of about 3 percent , compared with the last quarter of 1989 , the institute said gasoline consumption has been moderated in the past by the gradual turnover in the nation s auto fleet , as newer cars , which get better fuel economy , replace older ones but in the fourth quarter , the drop was large enough to suggest that americans had driven less warmer weather a factor the drop in use of other forms of oil was partly weatherrelated last winter and the early part of this winter were mild , sharply lowering requirements for heating but even if the weather had been normal , the institute said , deliveries would have fallen 1 percent and two other factors in the decline , the persian gulf crisis and the economic slowdown , were felt most strongly in the fourth quarter , when deliveries were running 54 percent below the quarter a year earlier at the department of energy s oak ridge national laboratory , eric hirst , a research scientist , took note of the explanations offered by the industry for the decline , and said it s interesting that none of them have to do with improving efficiency there is the beginning of a trend away from improving energy efficiency mr hirst noted that new cars , on average , get lower gas mileage than those built two years ago , although still better than the cars of the 1970 s and early 80 s accounting for most of those being replaced graphs a drop in us oil production , tracks domestic oil production of crude oil , 19601990 \( source american petroleum institute \) consuming less , tracks american consumption of refined oil products , 19801990 \( source american petroleum institute \)
when he was 10 years old , richard chelimo would run back and forth to school every day from his home in the rift valley of western kenya , the region that has produced many of the world s greatest distance runners he had to run there are no school buses in the rural hills of kenya carrying his books , chelimo \( chuhleemo \) covered eight miles , and as he ran he dreamed of emulating renowned countrymen like kip keino and henry rono whenever he arrived late to class , the teacher whacked his legs with a cane this prompted chelimo to quicken his pace i was chasing the time , he said now 17 years old , and a competitive runner , chelimo is still chasing time jewel of new generation as the jewel in a new generation of kenyan talent , chelimo inherits a tradition that began with keino s victory in the 1 , 500 meters over jim ryun of the united states in the 1968 olympic games in mexico city the national dynasty is now led by douglas wakiihuri , the reigning new york marathon champion , who is favored to win the 95th running of the boston marathon on monday , and ibrahim hussein , another new york and boston titleholder and for the first time , a kenyan woman , florence wangechi , is among the leading entrants at boston chelimo is poised to ascend to such international stature three weeks ago at the world crosscountry championships in antwerp , belgium , he turned in a breathtaking performance the youngest athlete ever selected to the kenyan senior men s team , he placed fourth in the event , the third best of nine kenyans in the field , and helped his country capture its sixth straight team title kenya also won the women s title and the two junior events for a record sweep midway in the 73mile run , chelimo , surrounded by four older kenyans and the defending champion , khalid skah of morocco , had the audacity to take the lead he held it for two miles , a boy among men whether out of great naivete or unbridled confidence , all kenyan runners think they can win , said fred hardy , an american coach who has brought many kenyans to united states colleges and who coaches a kenyan , paul ereng , who is the 1988 olympic 800meter champion from the university of virginia if you said to chelimo , 'you 're only 17 , ' he would n't know what you were talking about kenya is a poor farming country of 24 million people coaching is scarce , and there are only two allweather tracks in the entire nation \( the first was not built until 1983 \) most young runners grow up running barefoot on grass tracks but what kenya has are tribal traditions of running prowess and a tolerance for stress , a strengthening , highaltitude environment and an enforced mobility in the young as soon as a kenyan boy is 4 years old , he chases cows , said hardy soon after , like chelimo , he may be running to school all these cultural factors coalesce most strikingly in a small section on the western rim of the rift valley , the home of the nandi , one of kenya s 42 tribes nandi runners have won 14 olympic medals and set eight world records in the last 25 years this is where keino grew up and still lives , godfather to the new generation it is where chelimo lives with five brothers and two sisters his family farms potatoes and maize just out of secondary school , he trains twice a day he does not know how far he runs he chases time 40 minutes in the morning and 50 minutes in the evening most likely , it works out to about 15 miles a day chelimo , who will turn 18 next week , said in antwerp that he began formal training in 1989 and that his mentor was john ngugi , the fourtime world crosscountry champion and 1988 olympic gold medalist in the 5 , 000 meters when we run together , he tells me to train hard , to have discipline , chelimo said no smoking or alcohol last summer in plovdiv , bulgaria , chelimo captured the 10 , 000 meters in the world junior track and field championships in a time of 28 minutes 1857 seconds , a meet record by 24 seconds his 15yearold brother , ismael kirui , placed second the only american in the field , a college freshman , took eighth and was lapped chelimo s baptism as a runner worthy of senior status came in march at the kenyan training camp in embu on the slopes of mount kenya there , 17 men competed for the nine positions on the senior squad to compete in antwerp they trained three times a day , up to 35 miles as rigorous as that was , the kenyan victors in antwerp were mostly secondstringers ngugi competed but dropped out with an injury none of kenya s other 1988 olympic gold medalists ereng , 1 , 500 runner peter rono or steeplechaser julius kariuki were even recruited to try out for the team nor was 1 , 500meter phenomenon wilfred kirochi kirochi is another standout of the next generation in 1989 , at age 19 , kirochi ran 1 , 500 meters at 3 3257 , the equivalent of a 3 49 mile , and was ranked third in the world in the event another name to remember is joseph kibur , who , at 17 , placed fifth in the 10 , 000 meters at the 1990 british commonwealth games and then there s moses kiptanui , who at 18 won the world junior 1 , 500 last year in 3 3832 , the same level of precocity that jim ryun showed at that age ultimately , the best of the lot may be martin keino , kip s son , a freshman at the university of arizona who attended high school in virginia he had college coaches drooling when he ran a 4 09 mile last year on a mere 25 miles a week of training kenyan women are also beginning to emerge susan sirma and jane ngotho placed onetwo in this year s inaugural 11race international crosscountry circuit , and were leading scorers for their team in antwerp it was kenya s first senior women s title in the junior women s race , lydia cheromei , who is 13 years old , ran away from the field and won by 175 yards one reason for this preponderance of talent in kenya is a more concerted effort to identify and develop runners at the primary school and district levels , said sam matu , a kenyan athletics official once runners are discovered , said matu , their teachers are notified and offered coaching courses so they can properly guide their students chelimo , a more natural talent than most , also appears to need little guidance when it comes to enthusiasm he was so excited after his performance at antwerp that he continued running beyond the finish to a nearby field , where he thrust his arm up and said softly , i'm climbing to the top photo osoro ondoro , winner of '91 world crosscountry circuit richard chelimo , at 17 , placed 4th in the '91 world crosscountry championships william tanmuli , world s topranked 800 runner of 1990 \( steve sutton duomo \)
baghdad , iraq , june 6 at his tumbledown , fiveroom home on the banks of the tigris , falah fajer almahathidi received an unexpected guest the other day , and , when the stranger had departed , he found himself the richer by a house , a job and roughly 6 , 000 the benefactor who sat with him for two and a half hours , complimented his 9yearold daughter s doeeyed beauty and shared jokes and chocolates with him was none other than president saddam hussein the visit showed some of the ways in which the president is seeking to maintain power and persuade his people that he will survive in postwar iraq after putting down revolts in march among the shiite muslims of the south and the kurds of the north he is my brother and my father , mr mahathidi said , expressing adoration rather than claiming lineage he s very nice 'the fourth degree' the assessment is not shared by those who have been tortured in his jails and suffered loss from his policies , or by those in iran and kuwait who have witnessed his invading armies as they came , saw and were defeated moreover , conversations with many iraqis over the past 10 days have left the powerful impression that they feel vulnerable to repression and unsafe in a land whose human rights record is among the worst in the middle east there s something we call the fourth degree , said a middleranking civil servant who declined to give his name that means that if i do something wrong , they 'll punish my family , too , down to the fourth degree of cousins and so forth in kirkuk , a northern iraqi city where government forces battled kurdish separatist guerrillas in march , an arab man ran up to a reporter and whispered everyone hates saddam hussein very , very , very much another said there are no human rights in iraq asked in what sense there were no human rights , he replied in every sense despite the authorities' protestations that iraq is heading toward democratic reform , many seem cynically resigned to living under a government rooted in the coterie of clan , family and loyalists that surrounds the president and extends deep into local administration in kirkuk , the local governor is a cousin of the president , hashem hassan almajid the governor of basra in the south is latif hammoud , a loyalist general whose office is decorated with photographs of the president pinning medals on him on the highways in the north of the country , trucks towing artillery roll back from campaigns against kurdish rebels , laden with unkempt republican guards who have been accused by relief officials of terrorizing civilians the kurds did not flee for nothing , said a relief official familiar with conditions in the north despite baghdad s harsh tactics , government officials insist that the country is heading for a new political order information minister hamed yussef hamadi said in an interview that before the end of this year there will be a timetable for a referendum on a new constitution and legislation providing for press freedoms and multiple political parties an elected government would replace the supreme revolutionary command council , which would be abolished we are moving into a new phase , he said this matter is serious and is not done in the aftermath of the gulf war , he said , evoking the official argument that a process of political liberalization long predates iraq s invasion of kuwait and it is irreversible , he said we will not allow religious parties , he said the reason is that the religious parties will work against the unity of iraq under the promised new system , however , mr hamadi said he expected kurdish , iraqi nationalist and communist parties to participate , especially when communism has changed its ideology and face all parties would be obliged to name their members , and none would be permitted foreign funding , he said throughout the twohour conversation , the official seemed to suggest that the ruling baath party members regarded themselves as the custodians and controllers , as much as participants , in the putative reform process the baath party is not a small party and it has been in power for 23 years , he said so let us say in fact that , because it has been in the political arena for such a long time , it will have some weight in the public life you do n't expect that the baath party will shrink to a very small group this country needs a strong leadership , he said by some arguments , the promises of change by government officals are supposed to bolster , not weaken that strength they understand they must do something , and , looking at what happened in eastern europe and the soviet union and the revolts in their own country , they calculate that it is better to do it from above , when they have control , rather than risk more uprisings , said a diplomat here , speaking in return for anonymity but that does not mean saddam wants to relinquish power what they are talking about is a gradual , controlled process thriving personality cult the unheralded visit by the iraqi leader to mr mahathidi s home in baghdad s poor souk al jadid area seemed designed to defy western hopes , nurtured outside iraq , that the dictator has somehow been cowed by his misadventure in kuwait the iraqi leader seems intent on giving the impression that crippling economic sanctions and humiliating military defeat have left him unfazed there has been no change in the way he presents himself it s the same show , the baghdad diplomat said the war has , if anything , deepened the cult of personality around him the officially run newspapers invariably carry his photograph prominently on the front page , and the number of oversize portraits across iraq showing him confident and smiling , clad in anything from a field marshal s uniform to a boulevardier s white panama , actually seems to have grown for him , crisis is his life , a foreign specialist said since his childhood , he faced adversity but every time he found some way out , saving his face and prestige and maintaining his position it s his life he does not like to enjoy himself like some sheik , just sitting back without political adventures that seems part of the 54yearold president s political profile and personal psychology he came to power through the bloody , conspiratorial and secretive ways of the baath party a year after formally assuming the presidency in 1979 , he invaded iran when that war ended , in 1988 , he challenged syria s position in lebanon by arming its christian foes there in may 1990 , after threatening to burn half of israel if attacked , he sought the arab world s acknowledgement of his power at a conference of arab leaders here in august 1990 , he invaded kuwait he has never lived without a crisis to legitimize the way he rules , a londonbased iraq specialist , charles tripp , said during the last and most disastrous war president hussein s surprise visit last week week to mr mahathidi , moreover , seemed intended to show the iraqi leader as a man in touch with and responsive to his people s worries the president asked about the area , the families and the children he asked how the prices were at the market and i told him they were very high , and all the people are poor , mr mahathidi said the president said the government was studying how to lower the prices but the limits to the debate , not only in the modest courtyard by the tigris , were evident we did not talk about politics or the war , mr mahathidi said neither did president hussein seem to have eased the obsessive attention to his personal security that deepens the aura of inscrutability around him no one in mr mahathidi s neighborhood seemed to know that the president planned his apparently random visit and even during his stay , his anxiety to avoid risk seemed to prevail over the dictates of arab hospitality he ate the chocolate i offered , mrmahathidi said , but he would n't drink the water
as ray s pizzerias proliferated during the last two decades , new yorkers often wondered who ray was , but no one seemed to know the results of a new york times investigation in 1987 were summed up most poignantly by an employee at one ray s pizzeria who , after first saying that ray could n't come to the phone , finally broke down and confessed , there is no ray , really the situation was existentially disquieting , but also liberating it meant that ray s pizzerias could be opened by people of all nations and first names the only real obstacle was finding a block that did n't already have a famous ray s , world famous ray s , original ray s , famous original ray s , ray bari s , real ray s or one and only famous ray s recently , though , a shocking scene occurred at some of these pizzerias a black limousine appeared outside and a short man with a heavy italian accent emerged with a message yes , new york , there is a ray , and he s finally got himself a lawyer the war of the rays is under way lawyers are in the process of filing suits and it threatens to engulf dozens of pizzerias in new york , new jersey , georgia , arizona and probably other states it features three rival rays who have set aside their historical differences and formed a coalition to trademark the name , eliminate ray pretenders and deliver ray s newyorkstyle pizza around the world in keeping with tradition , none of these three men is officially named ray but one of them does seem to be the original ray , and the three are confident of victory over their opponents , who of course are not named ray either it has been a bitter fight , with dueling rays accusing one another of using cheap cheese and coming from the wrong part of sicily but amid the controversy it seems possible , at long last , to construct a history of a new york institution the story of ray s is the story of many rays , among them a ray named ralph documents gathered during the rays' legal battle show that there was no ray s pizza listed in the 1959 manhattan telephone book that was the year ralph cuomo , the 22yearold son of immigrants from southern italy , opened a pizzeria in little italy , using his mother s recipe it was at 27 prince street , between mott and elizabeth streets , on the first floor of a building that his family lived in and owned the next year s telephone book listed the name ray s pizza why not ralph s pizza \? ralph s might have sounded , i do n't know , maybe too feminine , mr cuomo explained last week besides , nobody ever called me ralph my family took the italian word for ralph raffaele and shortened it to rayfie or just ray all my life i was addressed that way mr cuomo still calls it just ray s pizza i never saw any reason to call it original or famous or anything and it remains his only pizzeria in the early 1960 s he briefly had another ray s pizza at 1073 first avenue near 59th street , but he sold that , and in 1964 it ended up in the hands of a ray named rosolino the expansionist era began with rosolino mangano , an immigrant from sicily , who used that first avenue ray s to found an empire which now includes a dozen famous original ray s pizzerias in manhattan , each adorned with a coat of arms featuring tomatoes , wheat and a cow during an interview at his flagship pizzeria , at 462 columbus avenue near 82d street , mr mangano insisted that he himself was the original ray he said ray was a shortened form of rosolino , and he produced a receipt made out to him simply as ray nobody knows rosolino , he said everybody knows me as ray i ca n't go no place ray , ray , ray nobody ever heard of ralph cuomo i was the one who made ray famous under further questioning , however , mr mangano conceded that he had not been called ray until he bought a ray s pizza and later , in a gathering of the rays at mr cuomo s pizzeria in little italy , he grudgingly pointed to mr cuomo when asked to name the original ray his conciliatory attitude was due to the efforts of a ray named gary in 1981 mr mangano sold a ray s pizzeria at second avenue and 51st street to gary esposito , who grew up in floral park , queens mr esposito opened five more original ray s pizzerias on long island and in new jersey , but he showed one remarkable bit of restraint i have never said that i am ray , he declared last week that s my claim to originality after opening his second original ray s , mr esposito got curious who was ray \? the mystery , the mystique was so built up that nobody knew anymore , he said he investigated , found mr cuomo in little italy , bought the right to the name and set up a joint company with him to franchise ray s but when they tried to get a federal trademark for the name , they ran into opposition from mr mangano , and the legal fight dragged on for five years , until mr mangano agreed to join their company last year this coalition prepared a common logo and recipe to be licensed to famous original ray s pizza shops , and mr mangano himself went around in a limousine several months ago to warn unlicensed rays
saddam hussein will lose the war and may turn out to be the world s most overrated commander meantime , he is doing a pretty good job as an editor of american television no use getting mad at him for trying to manipulate the media that comes naturally and before everybody denounces peter arnett and other reporters in baghdad , let s put responsibility for one troubling distortion where it belongs on a few news managers , in both american tv and the us government the way iraq is covered , or not covered , involves the whole american press but for most of the world now baghdad is cnn , so it s newsworthy to focus on that network for the moment day and night , over and over , cnn is our vision of what is going on in baghdad are we watching cnn \? is cnn watching us \? we feel an intimacy with cnn now , kind of as if we own it , it s around so much also , bernard shaw makes us feel we can trust him , no matter what , as walter cronkite still does when he is on the air we like the fact that mr arnett has all his wits but not all his hair , and that other cnn hands sometimes seem a little upset or sweaty , just like people cnn is good not only for ted turner s bank account , which i assume he is now lavishly spreading among newsgatherers , but for the major networks for whom it is an everlasting pain in the stimulus but cnn in the us can do better on handling the news from baghdad with full professional skill the job is to get it on the air but prevent saddam hussein from using the network too often too blatantly mr arnett is admired by journalists who know him i tried to hire him for the new york times when he was with the associated press at least i managed to scare the ap into giving him a nice raise but like the other reporters in iraq mr arnett has not been allowed by the iraqis to work in the country in order to get and give a full , fair accounting of life in baghdad hardly they were allowed in , and permitted to stay , to cover exactly one story civilian casualties and damage that is the vision we get from baghdad , just that first journalistic question knowing that your correspondent will be allowed to cover only one story , under censorship , would you send him in \? depends if the story is a pingpong match with china , as cuba once proposed to the times in your ear with the visa , fidel but if it is war and if a little behindthelines information is better than none , the answer is yes , at least for a while then editors , newspaper or tv , are supposed to earn their pitiful salaries the editor must decide day by day whether that one story meets decent news values or is simply propaganda repetition forced on the reporter every day , over and over , cnn puts its baghdad reporters on the air , talking about that one corner of the one story they are allowed to discuss on any good newspaper , after awhile that story would be short and inside tv is primarily a front page , so that one story is played out of relevance to new or balanced information constant repetition of old , official and insufficient information is a definition of propaganda , not news it might be helpful if a cnn editor would call mr arnett more often off the air , ask him if he had anything new and then make a mutual decision on whether to go on the air a good ap man knows the difference between news and a handout cnn s caveats badly need fleshing out tell the reader always that mr arnett is not just being monitored but prohibited from seeing or reporting the military damage needed to put the civilian story into any wartime perspective second question how long do you keep your reporter in place repeating the same censored onestory \? depends eventually the repetition of propaganda may become not only valueless but journalistically immoral right now , if cnn in the us pays more attention to news judgments , i would much rather have mr arnett in baghdad than back home sifting through the job offers waiting for him president bush is fed up with civilian damage stories from the iraqis good now he can order the us information people in saudi arabia and washington to disclose more of the military damage in baghdad already known to saddam hussein the reputation of the united states is involved , around the world there s no reason to leave that entirely in saddam hussein s editorial hands
new orleans , jan 4 the military units trained to handle the bodies of soldiers killed in combat are a lowkey group of men and women identifying and handling dead soldiers is an inevitability of war , they say and though it is their job , they prefer not to dwell on it but every war has people who handle bodies their companies are called graves registration units and as the united states gears up for possible combat in the middle east , these units are being activated throughout the country for the first time since the vietnam war it s a gruesome job , but somebody has to do it , just like somebody has to be the garbage man , said specialist 4 schaylite rudolph sibley , 23 years old a pharmacy student in civilian life , he and the other 40 members of his army reserve graves registration unit , the 630th quartermaster company , reported to a reserves center in new orleans on thursday all five such companies in the army , army reserve and national guard are now on active duty i try not to think about it , specialist sibley said my mother tells me to keep faith in god , and that s exactly what i'm going to do and where i leave off , my sense of humor takes over 'we 've all watched autopsies' capt johnathan riley , commander of the unit , said that it would move to fort polk , la , on sunday and that he expected it to be sent to the middle east eventually he said the company could handle up to 70 bodies a day overall , the mood of the 630th on thursday morning seemed to be stoicism and resignation the members said they were neither enthusiastic about the prospect of going to war nor particularly squeamish about their mission none of us has ever handled actual bodies before , said captain riley , a softspoken man who in civilian life is a merchandiser at a k mart but we 've all been well trained we 've all watched autopsies we 've heard the extreme stories about dealing with remains where rigor mortis has set in and you have to remove the top layer of skin to get a good fingerprint specialist 4 danny hutchinson , 27 , is a carpenter and engineer his assignment is to secure the perimeters of the bodycollecting sites with land mines and razor wire and , if necessary , to plot out a temporary cemetery in the desert this does n't depress me , he said this is important work somebody s got to bring the fellows back i would n't want to be stranded dead on somebody else s desert of the four other graves registration companies to be activated , two are from aguavilla , pr , one is from oakland , calif , and one is from fort lee , va the fort lee company has already been sent to saudi arabia , according to lieut col stuart wagner , a defense department spokesman he would not say whether the others were at mobilization sites like fort polk or in the middle east in the desert , temporary graves the companies' mission is to operate body collection points , to help identify the dead by means of clothing , dental work , fingerprints and so on , to store bodies in refrigerated containers and to ship remains back to the united states the collection of bodies on the battlefield would be performed by the combat units if bodies could not be shipped home , bodies would be buried three feet deep instead of the usual six feet after the war , they would be disinterred and sent home , captain riley said most members of the 630th are students who joined the army reserve to take advantage of its tuition reimbursement program , they said the rest hold an assortment of civilian jobs , as chefs , truck drivers , stock clerks , store managers and mail carriers their ages range from 18 to 46 all but one are black , reflecting the typical racial makeup of army reserve units in new orleans to be honest , i do n't want to go , said specialist 4 bianca johnson , 22 , who signed up to help pay her way through nursing school but i think i'm a damn good soldier what we have to do does n't scare me , because i used to work in a hospital i ca n't say that i 've seen bodies just totally deformed and blown apart , but i have encountered death at a lunch break on thursday , specialist 4 tommy robinson , 29 , sat down to a big plate of armyissue pork chops , red beans and rice like the others in his unit , he sounded confident whatever happens , he said , he knows he 'll be fine i have to be , he said that s the way it is asked about the most difficult thing he could imagine having to do in a war , he replied probably to have to id your own personnel that would be kind of rough then he corrected himself no , that would be the second worst the worst thing , mr robinson said , laughing and eating , would be to get id'ed photo the 630th quartermaster company is being activated to handle the remains of any soldiers killed in a gulf war capt johnathan riley , left , and members filled out papers after reporting for duty in new orleans \( matt anderson for the new york times \)

i never felt entirely at home at past st patrick s day parades as constituted by the ancient order of hibernians emphasis on the ancient they reminded me until recently of two perceptions of the irish as silverhaired civil servants redolent of old spice , and as intoxicated teenagers throwing up into the hedges of central park neither of those is me , and i am irish and proud of it but then , both of those are stereotypes , and stereotypes have their limits a woman was grand marshal of the parade not long ago , and the ranks are now filled with black and latino children who attend the city s parochial schools the parade has changed but not enough ethnic stereotypes are misshapen pearls , sometimes with a sandy grain of truth at their center it is true that my forebears were the folks for whom the paddy wagon was named , because of the number of them taken away drunk and disorderly on longago saturday nights the words tammany hall speak for themselves we are storytellers , accomplished mourners , devout catholics and we are none of these because all of them are stereotypes and now we are stereotyped as antediluvian bigots , because the ancient order of hibernians still ancient decided to deny the irish lesbian and gay organization permission to march in the parade first the organization was told there was no room , which is a familiar line to anyone who has read the christmas story then , after the mayor said that room could be made , the addition to the parade was judged impractical , which is familiar to anyone who has dealt with a bureaucracy and is a fancy way of saying we do n't want to finally , the gay group was told that its members could march if they melted into other groups and did not carry their banner , which is a familiar request to all who have ever been forced to deny what they are , closeted by the will of the majority ethnic stereotypes are sometimes based on observed behavior , but they ignore complexity , change and individuality my earliest perception of my countrymen was of people shaped by blighted potatoes and empty stomachs , people who held fast to what they had and so sometimes had a closed fist like many immigrant groups , they found contempt and hatred everywhere , and so they drew together , in neighborhoods , churches , fraternal organizations some characteristics of the irish i know and love have always seemed to me contradictory hail fellows well met , without being met at all the unknowable extroverts it is no accident that some have taken to professions that give the illusion of being among the people while remaining essentially separate newspapermen , who are of events but outside them politicos , who always stand apart in the crowd priests stereotypes , of course if you see it differently , i understand but understand that the stereotypes about gay people grow not from small knowledge inflated but from ignorance writ large no queers in the parade , people on staten island shouted at the mayor these are the cries of those who do n't know any gay people or , more accurately , do n't know they know any and so create the bogey man pederasts , drag queens , instead of the reality the man at the next desk , the girl you went to high school with ordinary people , who are gay and irish and proud i ca n't imagine why those people want to march after what has happened the aoh has made a mess of this when it barred gay people , there was the suspicion that it was reflecting the faith of its fathers , which considers homosexual acts sinful but when it also barred a group of kids in wheelchairs kids ! in wheelchairs ! it appeared that it had forgotten that faith entirely hope those guys never get a chance to run lourdes this is a parade that should belong to everyone but they turned it into something that belongs to none of us , or at least none of us who have been stung by stereotype , none of us who were raised on the memory of the signs that said no irish because all employers were sure the irish were lazy and unreliable the members of the ancient order of hibernians should remember those signs they tried to hang a variation on fifth avenue this year and in doing so they tarnished not the gay community but their own everything they 've done stinks of the stereotype , of the smallminded irishman for all of us who know that stereotypes exist to reduce understanding , not to enlarge it , i say they should be ashamed of themselves

london , dec 17 a main reason the board of the maxwell communication corporation took the unusual step of seeking bankruptcy protection from creditors in the united states was to try to avoid a piecemeal selloff of its businesses by its bankers , the company s leaders said today this helps explain why bankers are furious that the heavily indebted british publishing company filed in new york for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code on monday night the filing came after a meeting between maxwell communication and the eightmember steering committee of the banks on monday afternoon at that meeting , according to both sides , the company s executives did not mention the possibility that they might file for chapter 11 we are absolutely livid , an official at one bank on the steering committee said today , echoing what other bankers also said in interviews the bankers met all day today in an attempt to explore various options , which reportedly included legally challenging maxwell communication s right to file for bankruptcy protection in the united states as opposed to britain they apparently did not reach a final decision maxwell communication today applied to a british court to place the company in administration , which is the british equivalent of bankruptcy protection at a news conference today , peter laister , the company s chairman , and david shaffer , the managing director , stressed that the action in britain was taken to support the chapter 11 filing and make it more difficult for someone to legally challenge it in other words , the request that an administrator be appointed was not an alternative to chapter 11 and if maxwell communication s board gets what it wants , a courtappointed administrator would wield relatively little power over the company administrators in britain typically control the company in bankruptcy and have considerable freedom to close or sell businesses and make other important decisions but in the case of a maxwell communication operating in chapter 11 , the administrator would apparently only be able to express his position to the company s board and management , which they could ignore bankers want to choose one indication of how angry the bankers are is that they asked the british court to appoint an administrator of their choice someone from price waterhouse rather than the administrator from another accounting firm , touche ross company , which maxwell communication requested the judge took the petitions under advisement and issued a stay on the request for administration until friday as far as many of maxwell communication s 43 banks had been concerned , the issue before monday night was not whether or not to sell off maxwell communication s businesses one by one in an attempt to repay its debts the issue was whether they should liquidate the company now or wait perhaps two or three years when the economy in the united states improved and the businesses would fetch a higher price the company now estimates that its debts to banks and bondholders total somewhere from 13 billion to more than 14 billion \( 237 billion to 255 billion \) and mr shaffer said the company s liabilities probably exceed the value of its assets about 80 percent of the assets od maxwell communication are in north america its main businesses , which are based in the united states , include macmillan inc book publishers , official airline guides and half of macmillan mcgrawhill school publishing the company s leaders cited this fact as a justification for the chapter 11 filing , although none of the subsidiaries were included in the bankruptcy filing mr shaffer also said he feared that the confidence of creditors , customers , suppliers and employees of the operations in the united states would have been shaken if the company had sought only british administration that would have weakened the company and decreased its chances for emerging from bankruptcy largely intact and mr laister and mr shaffer both of whom have been in their jobs only two weeks insisted that they thought that all creditors and stakeholders would fare better in the end if most of the company were retained the objective of chapter 11 is in fact to see some reconstruction and come out at the far end , mr laister said the process of administration perhaps results in that less often according to mr laister and mr shaffer , the tone of the monday afternoon meeting with the bank steering committee , led by credit lyonnais and the barclays bank , played a major role in the decision to file for chapter 11 protection for about two weeks , the company had been seeking an agreement that would extend through march the time by which the banks would not take action on loans that would force the company into bankruptcy or receivership the banks had granted only an informal standstill , and that expires on friday , and a number of banks had not even been willing to commit themselves to that , mr laister said mr laister also confirmed today that the private maxwell companies had owned about 80 percent of maxwell communication s shares , much higher than the 68 percent stake previously disclosed investigators believe that one reason the shares were purchased was to help support the price of the stock which collateralized loans to other maxwell private companies

ms bergalis s emphasis on testing health care workers and patients has troubled , even angered , many other people with aids such testing would be vastly expensive , they say , a diversion of money that is badly needed for research into causes and treatment of the disease moreover , they say ms bergalis represents an idea they are working to counter that there are innocent victims of aids those who are not homosexual or intravenous drug users and presumably victims who are not so innocent in hallway interviews at the hearing today , many of these advocates for people with aids said that what ms bergalis represents to many is renewed fear as dr robert redfield , an aids researcher at the walter reed army research center , put it remember , most americans do n't feel they have a real risk from aids this case worries them , for the only real risk of getting aids is from their physician rightwing forces blamed jeffrey levi , policy director of the aids action council , an organization that represents many groups trying to help people with aids , said her case is being used by some of the rightwing forces to rekindle some of the fear that has always been lurking under the surface about aids mr levi said that in recent years people were becoming convinced that aids could be confined to marginal people like gays and drug users , and added but kimberly has reminded people that everyone could be at risk when newly confronted with something as frightening as this , people do n't always respond rationally in the subcommittee s first hearing , on sept 19 , representatives of the nation s leading medical organizations testified that making testing mandatory would be useless because it would assure no additional protection from the virus and would cost up to a billion dollars a year to carry out such a program dr c everett koop , the former surgeon general , said the risk of being infected from a doctor is so remote that it may never be measured he also said that testing could not give assurance that a doctor was free of the virus because the test can only respond to antibodies some months after a person is infected earlier testimony challenged medical experts testified at the hearing that if the testing is to be useful it would have to be done several times a year on tens to hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers
connecticut is getting a casino , like it or not interior secretary manuel lujan has approved the operation of a gambling hall on the mashantucket pequot indian reservation near new london two governors tried to stop it , but the pequots won in court casino gambling now has another foothold , setting a precedent for still more it may seem ugly to object just when indians are getting a crack at this lucrative business but the overriding issue is the spread of casino gambling that the issue is raised by indians is unfortunate happenstance casino promoters did n't really need the pequots' help states are turning to gambling for painless revenue iowa now has riverboat gambling on the mississippi four old colorado mining towns are opening modern mockups of wild west gambling dens this may be painless for politicians who shy from raising taxes , but it is hardly a wholesome social standard while native americans have as much right as anyone to take the casino plunge , it s a sad fact that they are driven by economic distress some tribes have a sound base in manufacturing , but it s easier to open gaming halls than factories gambling also offers quick profit for little investment the pequots got financing from malaysia after us lenders turned them down florida seminoles started gambling as a business in the 1970 s with highstakes bingo the state tried to crack down but lost in court , and the games quickly spread to other tribes in 1987 , the supreme court upheld the lower courts' essential point if state law prohibits an activity , reservations must respect the prohibition but they are not subject to regulation of activities the state permits connecticut bans casinos but lets charities and other worthy causes sponsor casinostyle las vegas nights to raise money balking at the pequots' casino plan , connecticut argued that onenight games and a fulltime gambling hall are distinguishable the courts said they 're not still , casinos are n't bingo they attract different crowds governors and state law enforcement authorities who resist casinos on reservations are rightly concerned with the unsavory elements that swarm to casinos the pequots share this concern and are cooperating with the state in planning for the casino s regulation but authorities also fear that the establishment of an indian casino creates pressure for casinos statewide roughly 125 tribes operate some 150 gaming establishments now estimates of their annual gross run as high as 700 million about half of these enterprises are for bingo one hightech mega bingo game links reservations in seven states by satellite and offers 500 , 000 jackpots a third are card rooms , and most of the rest are things like offtrack betting and video games some tribes , particularly some large ones , do n't want reservation gambling any more than connecticut governors do they do n't like intrusive outsiders a number have succeeded in mainstream businesses , largely through their own efforts blessed with natural resources , more than 30 tribes are in oil and gas others are in timber and mining the mississippi choctaws make parts for ford several tribes have pentagon contracts and the wisconsin winnebagos are starting a pharmaceutical company to make generic and nonprescription drugs the winnebagos are using profits from bingo , a widely accepted game with none of the social risk that comes with casinos the spread of casinos is unwelcome
