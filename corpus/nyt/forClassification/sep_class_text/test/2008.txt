can a television series created for diplomatic purposes work as entertainment \? the sundance channel is about to find out its series on the road in america , originally produced by a nonprofit group with the hope of showing arab viewers in the middle east a broader and more nuanced view of america than that seen in hollywood exports , has now come full circle back to the united states sundance will broadcast it wednesdays beginning this week the 12part series is a travelogue delivered through the eyes of four relatively westernized arabs three men and a woman with some outspoken political debate thrown in along the way one minute during their summer 2006 rv road trip , the travelers are ogling new york skyscrapers , the next they are arguing over the israelipalestinian conflict at the hamptons beach house of robert shaye , a cofounder of new line cinema as they cross the country the four are treated to a blues jam session with super chikan in mississippi , ride horseback through montana and mix a forum on middle eastunited states relations with massages at the esalen institute in big sur , calif some of the most intense debate comes from the spontaneous conversations between the lara abou saifan whose departure for washington from beirut , lebanon , was complicated when israeli bombing closed the airport there and one of the show s cameramen , guy livneh , an israeli , as it turned out the series had its genesis in the wake of sept 11 , 2001 , when layalina productions a nonpartisan washington nonprofit created to foster arabamerican understanding through television asked the institute for creative technologies at the university of southern california to encourage hollywood thinking about programming for the middle east , said the layalina vice president , leon shahabian , an executive producer of the series the idea for on the road ultimately came from jerome gary , another executive producer , who had produced the feature documentaries pumping iron and stripper , and was the institute s strategic director the series is produced by layalina in association with mr gary s company , visionaire media , and was financed partly by a grant from the foundation of richard fairbanks , a middle east peace negotiator for the reagan administration , who is layalina s founder and chairman the organization s advisory board includes a long list of former american diplomats and democratic and republican administration officials , as well as former president george h w bush some 500 young people in lebanon , dubai , jordan , egypt and morocco were auditioned , mr gary said none of the four in addition to ms abou saifan , they include the egyptian student ali amr , the saudi student sanad al kubaissi and a slightly older jordanian , mohamed aboughazal , who at the time of filming had completed medical studies is a particularly observant muslim some of the four drink alcohol , while mr aboughazal occasionally stays out all night mr gary called him a terrible subject for complicating the shooting schedule by sleeping during the day but noted that he also had the most expressive politics ms abou saifan was technically enlisted as mr gary s production assistant , because three guys and a girl traveling across america would be unacceptable to certain muslims in the middle east , mr gary said , adding , i just wanted a woman to be in the mix , so i would n't go to sleep the sundance version was tweaked to restore material that was trimmed to avoid offending some arab sensibilities mr gary , who directed nine episodes , said that he wanted to cast a very observant muslim , but that few auditioned the problem was , they were so threatened by america , he said , adding that he hopes to include more diverse religious views in a possible second season \( layalina is also looking for funds to take americans on a mideast trip , possibly for sundance \) about 45 million viewers tuned in for each episode when the series was shown in 2007 on the middle east broadcasting center , a saudiowned channel that broadcasts all over the arab world , mr shahabian said in an interview in new york ms abou saifan said she had n't encountered anyone in lebanon , other than friends and family , who had seen it even though americans were n't initially the intended audience , mr gary called his subjects our own little arab de tocquevilles , referring to the 19thcentury french author whose democracy in america helped the fledgling united states understand itself the series appealed to sundance because it challenges people to dig a little deeper in terms of understanding the issues , said laura michalchyshyn , the network s executive vice president for programming citing ms abou saifan s criticism of the quality of news reporting she sees in the united states , ms michalchyshyn said that the group of four provides a viewpoint of america that is refreshingly healthy for us to hear she added you realize that this is a journey that we 're going to be on with these young people , noting , we have no idea where they will end up in their opinions of the country
, the and president , insists he is still part of the team s future and still dedicated to winning in the present , although he would have a tough time proving either point to a skeptical audience all indications are that james l dolan , the madison square garden chairman , has begun a search for a new team president dolan has spoken with donnie walsh , the indiana pacers' chief executive , and almost certainly has reached out to other candidates the week was filled with reports regarding walsh , which were confirmed by people with ties to walsh , and thomas s daily news conferences were dominated by questions about his standing he has yet to concede anything i do n't talk about my job status and i do n't plan on talking about it tonight , thomas said before the knicks were routed , 120106 , by the memphis grizzlies on friday at the garden the speculation , he said , comes with the territory of losing among the oddities to emerge from this muddled situation is that thomas , who seemingly has no future with the team , is now coaching as if the future is all that matters on friday he benched zach randolph , the knicks' best big man , and said he planned to do the same on saturday in minnesota with the season a lost cause , thomas said it was time to evaluate prospects , in particular randolph morris , who started in place of randolph , and the rookie wilson chandler , who started his seventh straight game but the decision to turn over the lineup to youngsters could have another positive effect , intentionally or not , on the knicks' future by ensuring a worse record and better odds in the draft lottery curiously , thomas s decision to bench randolph coincides with games against memphis \( 1751 \) and minnesota \( 1751 \) , teams that are also jockeying for the top position in the nba s draft lottery thomas said randolph would return to the lineup for monday s game against the nets randolph was on the active roster friday but sat on the bench in a gray suit quentin richardson , another starter , also sat out the game morris played 26 minutes friday , finishing with 4 points , 3 rebounds and 4 fouls he went 1 for 8 from the field chandler had 17 points and 7 rebounds jamal crawford did not play in the fourth quarter and his fellow starter david lee played only five minutes as the grizzlies put the game away by outscoring the knicks , 2816 mike miller led the grizzlies with 34 points rudy gay added 24 points , and the grizzlies never trailed although center eddy curry is out for the season , freeing up 30plus minutes a game in the frontcourt , thomas said it was necessary to bench randolph to guarantee playing time for morris the knicks want to evaluate morris before deciding whether to resign him as a free agent in the summer , he said thomas said dolan and steve mills , the garden president , agreed with the decision to play the prospects , even if it meant losing it s safe to say we 're all on the same page , thomas said with young players you lose some experience , and they do get beat by savvy but at the same time they do some things that you may not be aware of the knicks \( 1949 \) , meanwhile , have lost 10 of their last 11 games as news outlets cycle through the list of possible thomas successors the latest name floated , in friday s editions of newsday , was jerry west , the former los angeles lakers executive but the odds of west s working for the knicks are slim and none , said a longtime friend of west s who speaks with him often west , who turns 70 in may , is happy in retirement , said the friend , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for west west had no interest in the knicks the last time he entertained job offers , in 2002 , when he joined the grizzlies rebounds for two months , isiah thomas has denied reports that he offered zach randolph to the milwaukee bucks that stance was contradicted this week when the bucks' owner , senator herb kohl , told the milwaukee journalsentinel that he had , in fact , vetoed a trade for randolph so who is lying \? no one , according to the explanation thomas offered friday maybe they had those talks internally , but we were n't a part of those talks , thomas said , implying that kohl had rejected the proposal before it reached the knicks but a western conference executive who spoke with bucks officials confirmed that a trade was indeed on the table and would have been consummated had kohl not intervened the knicks would have received charlie bell , bobby simmons and dan gadzuric in exchange for randolph and fred jones
it was no secret that the red wings leaned on their unflappable captain , defenseman nicklas lidstrom , in bouncing back from crushing defeats in these playoffs after taking big leads on nashville \( two games to none \) and dallas \( 30 \) , the wings kept making things interesting they had to put away the stars in a huge game 6 in dallas on wednesday , they had to face a rejuvenated penguins team that stole game 5 from the wings in their building when they were seconds from hoisting the cup but there they were , following lidstrom again into game 6 of the stanley cup final in pittsburgh they never flinched they took a 20 lead , played their lockdown defensive style and even held off the penguins lastditch attempt in the final seconds his fingerprints were all over the 32 game 6 victory and all over this cup , the red wings fourth in 11 years nicklas lidstrom , in my opinion , is a phenomenal leader and captain , said red wings coach mike babcock it was his poise and skill though winning his fourth stanley cup with detroit , lidstrom celebrated his first as its captain , having taken over that role when the legendary steve yzerman retired in 2006 he became the first player born and trained in europe to be a captain of a cup champion \( johnny gottselig , who was born in russia but trained in canada , was captain of the stanley cup champion chicago blackhawks in 1938 \) it s something i m very proud of , lidstrom said i ve been over here a long time i watched steve yzerman hoist it three times in the past and i m very proud of being the first european lidstrom finished second to forward henrik zetterberg in the voting for the conn smythe trophy as the playoffs most valuable player lidstrom was the first european to win that trophy too , in 2002 now he has a fellow swede to share the honor with zetterberg said he was particularly proud , though , of lidstrom it s great to see him lifting the cup and with the c on his chest , zetterberg said it means so much for the team and the organization he s bringing it every night he s probably our best player every night and i m really happy for him it was a little disappointing to hear boos from the penguins fans who stayed in mellon arena for the trophy presentations when zetterberg collected the conn smythe and when lidstrom hoisted the cup even in their disappointment over the penguins loss , they should have found some room for respect for the performance of those two history , at least , will remember them fondly

fifteen days before the election , serious gaps remain in the public s knowledge about the health of the presidential and vicepresidential nominees the limited information provided by the candidates is a striking departure from recent campaigns , in which many candidates and their doctors were more forthcoming in past elections , the decisions of some candidates for the nation s top elected offices to withhold health information turned out to have a significant impact after the information came to light this year , the health issue carries extraordinary significance because two of the four nominees have survived potentially fatal medical problems that could recur if elected , senator of arizona , 72 , the republican nominee , would be the oldest man to be sworn in to a first term as president and the first survivor to win the office the scars on his puffy left cheek are cosmetic reminders of the extensive surgery he underwent in 2000 to remove a malignant  last may , his campaign and his doctors released nearly 1 , 200 pages of medical information , far more than the three other nominees but the documents were released in a restricted way that leaves questions , even confusion , about his cancer a critical question concerns inconsistencies in medical opinions about the severity of his melanoma if the classification of his melanoma is more severe , it would increase the statistical likelihood of death from a recurrence of the cancer senator of delaware , 65 , the democratic vicepresidential nominee , had emergency surgery in 1988 for an in an artery in his brain and elective surgery for a second one his campaign released 49 pages of medical records to the new york times late last week showing that he was healthy , but the documents did not indicate whether he had had a test in recent years to detect any new aneurysm the two other nominees are younger and apparently in good health , but less is known about their medical history senator of illinois , 47 , the democratic presidential nominee , released a onepage , undated letter from his personal physician in may stating that he was in excellent health late last week , his campaign released the results of standard laboratory tests and electrocardiograms from his checkups in june 2001 , november 2004 and january 2007 the findings were normal gov of alaska , 44 , mr mccain s running mate , has released no medical information there may be no serious problems with the health of any of the nominees but absent fuller disclosure , there is no way for the electorate to know the health of the four nominees is a matter of concern because in the past a number of candidates , and in some cases their doctors and aides , have distorted , kept secret or spoken about the facts only at the last minute when medical events forced the issue examples include senator thomas f eagleton \( \) , senator paul e tsongas \( cancer \) , senator bill bradley \( heart rhythm abnormality \) and , as a vicepresidential nominee , dick cheney \( heart disease \) i am a physician who has covered the health of presidential candidates for 36 years since 1980 , the times has made it a practice to question nominees for president and other high political offices and , with their permission , their doctors about their health the times has requested such interviews with mr obama since last spring and with mr mccain and his doctors since march 2007 none were granted more recently , the times sent letters to all four nominees requesting interviews about their health with them and their doctors none agreed the candidates' health has drawn little attention for most of this long campaign season despite the importance of the issue but since mr mccain selected ms palin as his running mate in august , questions about his health have intensified in recent weeks , more than 2 , 700 physicians have signed a petition that ran as an advertisement demanding that mr mccain fully release his health records the petition is sponsored by brave new films , the company led by robert greenwald , a hollywood filmmaker who has contributed 2 , 250 to democratic candidates and has made a number of antimccain videos beyond the advertisement , mr mccain s health has become the subject of both speculation and distortion on the internet and other media the following is a summary of the publicly known medical information about all four nominees and the outstanding questions about each mr mccain s difficulty raising his arms and his sometimes awkward gait are remnants of severe , untreated injuries he suffered in vietnam mr mccain , a navy pilot , broke both arms and his right knee when his jet was shot down over north vietnam in 1967 he experienced additional wounds while being tortured during his five and a half years as a prisoner of war mr mccain may eventually need joint replacements , according to his doctor at the mayo clinic in scottsdale , ariz mr mccain has released more details about his health than the other three nominees , though he has done so in a phased way and has apparently not agreed to any extensive interviews about his health a handful of reporters were allowed to view his records during his bid for the 2000 republican presidential nomination another group of reporters were permitted to see newer records last may by not allowing reporters to interview him or his doctors extensively about his entire medical history , he has made it impossible to get a complete picture of his diagnoses and treatment in 1999 , early in his first run for the presidency , mr mccain allowed a small number of reporters , including me , to review an estimated 1 , 500 pages of his medical records without photocopying or recording the information in doing so , mr mccain gave the public its broadest look at the psychological profile of a presidential candidate he released psychological records about him that were amassed as part of a navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war assessments were based on standard psychological tests and what mr mccain told his doctors after his release the records mentioned that in 1968 , about eight months after his capture and after some particularly brutal beatings from his north vietnamese captors , mr mccain attempted , trying to hang himself with his shirt the records and his doctors , whom i interviewed with the senator s permission in 1999 , said he had never been given a diagnosis of a disorder or treated at the project s center for a mental health disorder the records also showed that a surgeon removed a melanoma from mr mccain s left shoulder in 1993 melanomas can be a far more deadly form of than the more common basal cell and other types in early august 2000 , just as mr mccain s rival george w bush was about to receive the republican presidential nomination , dr john f eisold , the attending physician at the united states capitol , detected two more melanomas , mr mccain s second and third one on mr mccain s left arm was determined to be the least risky type , in situ but the one on his left temple was dangerous a few days after detection of the melanomas , mr mccain sought care for them at the mayo clinic in scottsdale mr mccain s campaign said this year that the lefttemple melanoma was 22 millimeters at its thickest part and graded as stage iia on a scale in which stage iv is the worst stage ii meant that the melanoma had not spread into the lymph nodes the number of melanomas is less significant than the thickness measured in the pathology assessment of any one of them mr mccain underwent extensive surgery on his face and neck for the melanoma on aug 19 , 2000 surgeons removed more than 30 lymph nodes , and pathologists then determined that all of them were cancer free in march 2007 , as mr mccain was making his second bid for the republican nomination , the times began asking his campaign for permission to speak with the senator and his doctors , citing the history of such interviews on may 6 , 2008 , jill hazelbaker , a mccain spokeswoman , denied the requests , writing in an email message that the times was not at the top of the list and including a link to a times editorial that had criticized mr mccain for not disclosing health information and senator hillary rodham clinton of new york for not disclosing financial records on may 23 , mr mccain allowed a small pool of journalists , including three doctorreporters , though none from the times , to spend three hours reviewing a newer set of his mayo clinic records that set , 1 , 173 pages , included records from 2000 to 2008 but none of the records made available in 1999 again , the campaign did not allow the journalists to photocopy any documents mr mccain s mayo clinic doctors answered selected reporters' questions by telephone , but only for 45 minutes instead of the scheduled two hours the mccain campaign did not allow new york times reporters to ask questions in the teleconference the clinic doctors said that mr mccain was in good health and that no medical reason precluded him from fulfilling all the duties of president the doctors said that a fourth melanoma they detected on the left side of his nose in 2002 was also in situ , the least dangerous type all four melanomas that mr mccain experienced were primary , or new , and there was no evidence that any of them had spread , the doctors said however , the reporters' summary cited a report dated aug 9 , 2000 , from two pathologists at the armed forces institute of pathology in washington who examined a of the melanoma taken from mr mccain s left temple a few days earlier the armed forces pathologists suggested that the lefttemple melanoma had spread from another melanoma , known as a metastasis or satellite lesion the vertical orientation of this lesion , the report said , with only focal epidermal involvement above it is highly suggestive of a metastasis of malignant melanoma and may represent a satellite metastasis of s009572a , which is the skin , left temple , lateral biopsy the pool report was by nature unable to provide a complete portrait of mr mccain s recent medical history it left several questions , including about the number of biopsies and when they were done on aug 18 , 2000 , dr john d eckstein , mr mccain s personal physician at the mayo clinic in scottsdale , noted in mr mccain s records that there were two biopsies of the left temple dr eckstein s note did not say where and when the biopsies were performed the armed forces report cited one biopsy , so presumably a second was performed in scottsdale the armed forces pathologists said a melanoma had developed over a skin whose origin was unclear a , not one of the four melanomas , had been removed from mr mccain s left temple in 1996 and interpreted as being benign some experts have speculated that it might have been misdiagnosed , and thus the origin of the 2000 melanoma the armed forces pathologists did not speak in the teleconference in may 2008 , and questions raised by their report have remained unanswered the selected reporters did not ask about that report , and the mayo clinic doctors did not discuss it a complete mayo pathology report was apparently not included in the pool summary in interviews , several melanoma experts questioned why the mayo clinic doctors had performed such extensive surgery , because the operation was usually reserved for treatment of stage iii melanoma , not stage iia on aug 18 , 2000 , the day before mr mccain s operation , his surgeon , dr michael l hinni , wrote in the records that he planned to do the extensive operation because of the size and location of mr mccain s melanoma in the teleconference in may 2008 , dr hinni explained that because the melanoma was two centimeters across he had to make a 6by6centimeter island of skin , a fairly sizable wound to remove it it is not known whether the mayo clinic in scottsdale asked pathologists outside the mayo system for an independent review if mr mccain s 2000 lefttemple melanoma was a metastasis , as the armed forces pathologists' report suggested , it would be classified as stage iii the reclassification would change his statistical odds for survival at 10 years from about 60 percent to 36 percent , according to a published study the greatest risk of recurrence of melanoma is in the first few years after detection his age , his sex and the presence of the melanoma on his face increase the risk the fact that mr mccain has had no recurrence for eight years is in his favor but cancer experts see the 10th anniversary as an important statistical benchmark , and that would not occur until 2010 in may , his dermatologist at the mayo clinic , dr suzanne m connolly , said in the teleconference that though there was no way to predict with certainty mr mccain s chance of a recurrence , she judged it to be less than 10 percent but melanoma is known to be quirkier than most cancers doctors cite occasional cases in which melanomas come back after 15 or 20 years melanomas can spread to various areas in the body , including the skin and any internal organ in general , such spreading means the melanoma would not be curable treatment would depend in part on what organ or tissues are involved and could include additional surgery , , biologics , vaccines and radiation many such treatments can be debilitating and impair an individual s physical and mental stamina if the patient was the president , the location of a recurrence and its treatment could raise the need to invoke the 25th amendment , elevating the vice president to president , at least temporarily on the trail , mr mccain has played down concerns about his age by pointing to the vigor of his mother and her twin sister at age 96 mr mccain s father died in 1981 at age 70 after a  in the may teleconference , dr eckstein said that he had not detected any memory deficits in mr mccain and that the senator had not reported any dr eckstein did not report whether mr mccain had taken any baseline  mr mccain has and takes a statin for high but has no evidence of significant heart disease , his doctors said in making his medical information public , mr mccain released his confidentiality in the traditional patientdoctor relationship for its part , the mayo clinic says it agreed to yield control over all of mr mccain s medical information to his campaign and to refer all questions to the campaign pool reporters inspected the records at a hotel near the clinic , which sent the records there under security in the teleconference , the doctors answered questions by telephone at the clinic with no reporters present dr eckstein , mr mccain s doctor , said he understood that the campaign had released all the mccain records to the pool reporters but a spokeswoman at the mayo clinic in scottsdale , asked if the institution could verify that the campaign had released all the records to the reporters , said she did not know whether the doctors had checked to be sure last week , the times contacted the mccain campaign to fill in gaps in the medical records ms hazelbaker , the mccain spokeswoman , wrote in an email message as you know , we disclosed over 1 , 200 pages of senator mccain s medical history to dr altman s colleagues in the press earlier this year we also arranged a mayo clinic briefing with three of senator mccain s physicians that dr altman listened to by phone additionally , we released a detailed document outlining his most recent physical and lab test results it was an unprecedented level of disclosure , and dr altman can look at the public document on our web site if he wishes to do so it was certainly more significant than the onepage doctor s note obama released , though i have little hope the times will report it that way on may 29 , six days after the mccain campaign s disclosures about his recent health , mr obama s campaign released an undated , singlepage letter from his doctor in chicago attesting to mr obama s excellent health the sixparagraph letter from dr david l scheiner said mr obama had no known medical problems that would affect his ability to serve as president until the release of test results last week , the letter was the only information that mr obama had made public about his health dr scheiner s assessment was based on regularly examining mr obama since march 23 , 1987 mr obama s last checkup was on jan 15 , 2007 , a day before he created a presidential exploratory committee and more than a year before his campaign released the letter from dr scheiner , a general internist who practices at the university of chicago and the rush university medical center the letter was short , the obama campaign said , because mr obama had not had any serious health problems the campaign declined to make dr scheiner available for an interview mr obama has had a notable medical problem a difficulty in stopping it is not known how heavily he smoked dr scheiner wrote that mr obama began smoking at least two decades ago and had made several efforts to stop mr obama has used nicorette gum with success , dr scheiner wrote , without defining success nicorette , which contains smaller amounts of than do , is a replacement therapy intended to ease the craving for nicotine and other withdrawal effects of  dr scheiner did not say when mr obama had started using nicorette , how much he had used or for how long he had used it reporters have often observed him chewing it mr obama said he quit smoking in 2007 when he began his presidential campaign but he has bummed cigarettes since then , he has said also , dr scheiner did not provide a standard measure of smoking risk it is known as pack years the number of packs smoked a day multiplied by the number of years a person has smoked the packyear number is used to help determine a patient s risk of developing lung cancer , heart disease and other tobaccorelated ailments information about mr obama s smoking is relevant because studies show that the risk of cancer and other tobaccorelated serious diseases declines after an individual stops smoking , but not until then according to the newly released documents , in january 2007 mr obama had a level of 173 \( 68 and ldl 96 \) and of 44 those levels were normal nothing is known publicly about ms palin s medical history , aside from the muchdiscussed circumstances surrounding the birth of her fifth child last april ms palin has said that her water broke while she was at a conference in dallas and that she flew to alaska where she gave birth to her son trig hours after landing last week maria comella , a spokeswoman for ms palin , said the governor declined to be interviewed or provide any health records in 1988 , mr biden was working out on a shoulder press weight machine in the senate gym when a pain shot through his neck on the train home to wilmington , del , the returned more severely his head ached the right side of his body went numb a doctor later diagnosed a pinched nerve , and a pain clinic prescribed a neck brace shortly thereafter , on a trip to rochester , mr biden was alone in his hotel room when he felt a sharp stab in the back of his neck and a lightning flash in his head the rip of pain was like none he had ever experienced nothing mr biden did , including curling up in the fetal position , relieved the pain he lay unconscious on the floor for five hours , he wrote in his autobiography , promises to keep \( random house , 2007 \) the next morning , he felt somewhat better and flew home his wife , jill , summoned from the school where she taught , immediately took him to a hospital doctors determined he had a berryshaped bulge in an artery that was leaking blood into his brain such bulges , or aneurysms , can tear at any time ruptured aneurysms are fatal in about 50 percent of cases up to 20 percent of survivors remain severely disabled a roman catholic priest gave mr biden last rites after a harrowing ambulance trip to walter reed army medical center in washington , a team of neurosurgeons put a clip on the artery to stop the bleeding while recuperating , he suffered a major complication a blood clot lodged in his lung a few weeks later , surgeons operated on a second aneurysm on the opposite side of his brain though it had caused no symptoms , it still could have burst as the first one did mr biden returned to the senate after a sevenmonth absence now , a question arises has mr biden developed a new aneurysm over the last two decades that could burst \? doctors , who long thought that berry aneurysms were a onceinalifetime event , now generally believe that they can recur about 5 percent or less of patients who have had a berry aneurysm develop new ones at the original site or elsewhere in the brain over the last two decades , said dr robert f spetzler of the barrow neurological institute in phoenix , we have learned much more about aneurysms , and the fact is that when you have had one aneurysm , you are more likely to develop another one although the likelihood is very low , it does exist doctors' views vary widely on what types of brain imaging tests to recommend to patients who have had a berry aneurysm and when to do them some conduct no tests others periodically conduct tests like magnetic resonance angiograms mr biden has recovered fully without continued effects from the aneurysm , dr eisold , the capitol physician , said in a letter released by the campaign dr eisold , a specialist in internal medicine , has a longstanding policy not to talk to reporters about his patients , even with their permission the obamabiden campaign referred me to dr matthew a parker , an internist in washington , who reviewed mr biden s records and also spoke with dr eisold about them dr parker said that dr eisold told him that brain imaging tests were not needed now because mr biden had done well for the 20 years after the aneurysm it is a nonissue , dr parker said dr eisold told him dr parker , who is associated with george washington university hospital and sibley memorial hospital , said he had not treated or met with mr biden and did not have a direct connection to the campaign federal election commission records show that dr parker contributed the maximum , 2 , 300 , to mr obama s presidential campaign on march 13 , 2008 the medical records released by the campaign contain a summary of mr biden s operation and hospital stay in 1988 but no notes from a neurologist or neurosurgeon since then so it is not known whether mr biden has had recent brain imaging scans or has been evaluated by a neurologist or neurosurgeon recently dr parker said he did not ask dr eisold when a neurologist or neurosurgeon last examined mr biden four leading neurosurgeons interviewed separately in this country and europe said that as a vicepresidential nominee , mr biden should have had recent brain imaging studies to detect any new aneurysm , because if one is found he might face more and be out of work for weeks or longer what would i do in this situation \? said dr eugene s flamm , the chairman of the department of neurological surgery at montefiore medical center in the bronx i would say , get an mra and check you ca n't just play the statistics doctors caring for political leaders and other prominent people often face difficulty in ordering tests that might clarify a situation for such patients but that are not recommended for all patients dr parker said , some people will say , well , given the highprofile nature of the situation , we should do the test to be sure but , he added , that is not necessarily wise among the reasons is a desire to avoid among patients and because doctors may not know what to do about an equivocal finding dr parker said that even when he pressed dr eisold on the very same thing , given the circumstances with mr biden , dr eisold was very definitive about not doing brain scan tests now the question of an aneurysm aside , the documents show mr biden to have relatively minor health problems , including and he has an , but a biopsy showed no evidence of cancer with the help of a statin , he has normal cholesterol levels 173 \( hdl 47 and ldl 98 \) and triglycerides of 133 all in all , the gaps and paucity of information leave the electorate with insufficient information to fully judge the health of the nominees the information that has been released is a retreat from the approach that most campaigns took over the last 10 elections in an earlier time , there was a kind of gentlemen s agreement between officials and the news media that permitted serious health conditions to be played down or kept secret franklin d roosevelt was crippled by more than a decade before he became president and , by his fourth term , he had developed serious heart disease , but the public was largely shielded from the profound effects and while much was made of john f kennedy s bad back and the rocking chair that gave him relief , it was only in the years after his assassination that his case of addison s disease , a hormonal disorder , became widely known what might be called the modern era of disclosure arguably began in 1972 , when mr eagleton had to step down as the democratic vicepresidential nominee because he had not informed his running mate , senator george mcgovern , of his history of depression in 1992 , mr tsongas , who was seeking the democratic nomination for president , spoke to me to assure the public that he was free of nonhodgkins lymphoma , after a in 1986 in interviews , his doctors at the danafarber cancer institute backed his assertion that he was cancer free but in fact the cancer had recurred , and mr tsongas eventually withdrew from the race he died two days before his first term would have ended other candidates who made themselves and their doctors available include the elder george bush , bob dole , al gore and john kerry a leading example of openness was ronald reagan , whose age , 69 , had become an issue in the 1980 election mr reagan authorized his doctors to be interviewed he also agreed to an interview himself , against the wishes of his aides , answering all my questions , including what would he do if he became senile as president resign , he said
chicago s twoyear try at a ban on serving forcefattened duck liver , otherwise known as foie gras , has ended \( click here see a remarkable video moment showing how it ended , and revealing a lot about chicago politics \) while chicago s circle of power restaurants and wealthy gastronomes got their way , there does seem to be a growing push away from the ageold , but highly controversial , practice of transforming ducks \( and geese \) into bloated livers with wings fifteen countries ban foie gras production california is heading toward a ban in 2012 jennifer 8 lee has a fine foie gras post on city room summarizing some of the basic issues there s a bigger question here , though , relating to how humans as populations grow and grow more prosperous choose to relate to the other inhabitants of this very finite planet sure , foie gras production is an ancient practice , with roots more than a millennium old sure , it s delectable \( to some \) but suppose there are alternatives to producing a delicacy like this that don t entail penning thousands of birds in dark sheds and sticking a pipe down their throats three times a day for the last 2 or 3 weeks of their 12week lives until their livers swell about tenfold remember , this isn t just about a few rich people in chicago china is just getting into high gear \( both on producing such food products and , with its swelling ruling class , consuming them \) i have a proposal keep the liver free the ducks this will take awhile , of course after all , it involves the frontiers of food technology making meat in a lab instead of a feed lot there s a growing international push to do this , at least for nuggets and ground meat for both environmental and ethical reasons people for the ethical treatment of animals has even offered a 1 million reward for affordable cultivated meat i think foie gras could be the perfect test case , all you culturedmeat entrepreneurs first , as i learned in college , liver is one of the most proliferative tissues on the planet \( that s one reason it s a relatively easy organ to transplant \) so presumably it s a lot easier to culture in a vat than , say , brisket second , there s none of that structure or texture issue in fact , among the gustatory attributes of foie gras , according to leading chefs and gourmands , is the buttery lack of structure or texture third , it s a highpriced delicacy , so any manufacturer need not worry about trying to bring the cost of making a meat product competitive with , say , mcnuggets i can t think of a better way to cut through the impassioned arguments on both sides of the foie gras trade , which are well represented on youtube in one clip , anthony bourdain , the celebrity gourmand and television personality , attacks animalwelfare campaigners , saying a few twisted angry people would like to take your foie gras away he adds these fanatical stealth vegan extremists believe that the force feeding of ducks to plump their livers is actually cruel in another widely viewed piece , animalwelfare campaigners produced a mock promotional ad for french foie gras that is a ghastly tour of a largescale foie gras operation there showing one grisly scene after the other this one definitely needs parental guidance while we re waiting for factorymade , fowlfree foie gras , it s worth taking note of farmers who are trying more humane methods for fattening waterfowl  and i do recommend you get out the food processor and experiment with some of the faux gras recipes out there i recently chatted with tony mantuano , one of the top chefs in chicago , about a vegetarian alternative that he served during the ban for his restaurant , spiaggia it was inspired by a mock foie gras he tasted in a vegetarian restaurant in milan , joia , many years ago the recipe , in the book wine bar food \( by cathy mantuano and tony mantuano , clarkson potter \) , is essentially a chilled ultrafine puree of chick peas \( also called garbanzo or ceci beans \) , lots of butter , onion , capers , truffle oil , and sweet wine i was a little intimidated by the butter and substituted a ripe avocado and some olive oil my concoction was certainly delicious , although also certainly not foie gras \( which i last ate at a friend s 40thbirthday party for him , it s a last meal kind of ultimate treat \) i ll share both recipes down the line i have to jump back into tracking the climate issue again another round of climatetreaty talks just ended in bonn , germany , with another private round of climate discussions coming in south korea next week \( among major economies recruited by the bush administration \) and there are fresh recommendations from the council on foreign relations on the need for meaningful domestic emissions curbs in the united states and continued efforts to make progress both among the established powers and those emerging as this century s giants but food matters , too , particularly as humanity heads toward a population of 9 billion , more or less , with a ballooning global middle class do you have any favorite recipes for a small planet \?
the french contemporary dance scene is surprisingly different from the american one all penury and barebones experiment over here all state financing , props and wild theatricality over there or is

in lagos , nigeria , and his dancers come from all over africa all of which speaks to the diverse influences that have percolated into french dance over the last decade the second week offers one of france s most important choreographers , maguy marin , whose 2004 umwelt \( the name means perceptual environment \) caused the audience to exit in droves at its lyon premiere ms marin never pulls any

baltimore the first time kent desormeaux came to this venerable old racetrack , he was a kid from the bayou , barely removed from louisiana bush track match races where boys like him , as part of their early lessons , rode against horses strapped with bags of rocks , or a rooster , and sometimes a monkey he was the cajun kid , who won nine riding titles in maryland and still holds a singleseason record for victories here 599 of them in 1989 now desormeaux , 38 , is a hall of fame jockey , a hardknocks one he moved his wife and childhood sweetheart , sonia and his two boys , joshua , now 15 , and jacob , 9 to new york from california two years ago desormeaux had gone sour out west and needed to be reminded what it felt like to be on a good horse as the sun dimmed here saturday , and he was peeking under one shoulder and then the other , looking for somebody anybody to come and get him , desormeaux knew that he was on a great horse , not a good one had floated him around the track they had maybe an eighth of a mile to go and , lord , if desormeaux did not feel his colt had sprouted wings i looked between my legs , under my arms , and they were eight back , he said i just stopped riding and reeled him in and made sure he did n't pull himself up the chart is going to say big brown soared to a fiveandaquarterlength victory in the 133rd running of the anyone who watched the big bay colt with a celestial stride here or on television knows he could have won by 12 lengths the performance will not make folks forget about the injury the filly sustained moments after finishing second in the and led to her euthanization on the racetrack after a tragedyfree afternoon , however , the sport of horse racing will welcome the talk of big brown perhaps becoming the 12th triple crown champion , and the first since affirmed in 1978 , over the next three weeks this is the best horse i 've ever ridden i 've said it , said desormeaux , an ebullient man who has won the kentucky derby three times and , in 1998 , pulled into as the pilot of real quiet with a chance to capture the triple crown the important thing is we get to move into the next town and he s going back to the barn with only using a half a tank horse enthusiasts have plenty to be excited about as big brown joins majestic prince \( 1969 \) , seattle slew \( 1977 \) and smarty jones \( 2004 \) as the only colts who headed to the belmont stakes undefeated and trying for the triple crown only seattle slew managed to cement that piece of sports immortality for desormeaux , however , nosing big brown into the starting gate at that grand old racetrack on long island three weeks from now , for the mileandahalf test of the champion , will not be about how he has successfully revived a career or how he potentially may find a measure of redemption in 1998 , many believe desormeaux got real quiet beat in the belmont stakes desormeaux moved his colt early on the turn and kicked off to a fourlength lead only to be caught at the wire by victory gallop it took an interminable photo finish to figure out that desormeaux and real quiet lost by a nostril instead , big brown s victory today will be one for sonia , joshua and especially his youngest son , jacob , to savor jacob was born with usher syndrome , a degenerative disease that affects his hearing and will eventually take his eyesight with the help of a cochlear implant , jacob certainly heard the crowd of 112 , 222 crackle as big brown galloped this overmatched field of 11 rivals into submission over 1 3 16 miles what he saw was truly remarkable as big brown tracked from third place behind gayego and riley tucker through three quarters of a mile in a rapid 1 minute 1048 seconds , and then inhaled them then as horse and rider hit the far turn , it was over , and they crossed the wire in 1 5480 as desormeaux put it , i said , bye , bye , ' before deciding that was not even enough of a description whoooooooooo ! neither his fellow jockeys nor trainers cared to argue with that description not julien leparoux , who rode macho again to second place we just got beat by a monster , he said he might just be a triple crown winner this is the best second place i 've ever had not graham motion , the trainer of the thirdplace finisher , icabad crane big brown s a very , very good horse , he said he s the real deal it s exciting for the game big brown , a son of boundary out of the mare mien , is indeed a new star for a game that desperately needs one he was the champion of 2 bettors who made him the oddson favorite and raked in a 240 return the colt brought home the 600 , 000 firstplace check for his owners , international equine acquisitions and holdings and paul pompa jr it pretty much looked like small change after they announced in the postrace celebration that they had sold big brown s stallion rights to three chimneys farm in kentucky they did not disclose the price , but a person with knowledge of the deal said it topped 50 million sad perhaps for horse racing fans is that big brown will not race as a 4yearold and perhaps will not step on a racetrack again after the belmont none of this dampened the enthusiasm of desormeaux the cajun kid is now a new york man when he uprooted his family to revive his career , it meant making sure jacob had specialists and educators ready to help him negotiate a difficult future on saturday , jacob rooted his father home and fell into the arms of his mother and brother as soon as big brown crossed the finish line he has now seen his father and big brown win the derby and the preakness no matter what happens in three weeks in new york , that is enough for desormeaux he does not know how long jacob will have his sight i know he saw this one , he said , that s all i know
denver about 12 hours after the lost their fifth consecutive game , wrote the names of fernando tatis , nick evans and claudio vargas on a lineup card with his team playing poorly and his general manager , , refusing to guarantee that he will not be fired this season , randolph was , to an extent , putting his fate in a veteran with five career games of outfield experience , a 22yearold recalled from class aa binghamton and a starting pitcher who was in the minor leagues 10 days ago that s baseball , randolph said that s the way it works sometimes in the mets' current state of flux , the circumstances do not matter , the results do with minaya watching saturday , the mets granted randolph a temporary reprieve by beating the , 92 , at coors field this season has taught the mets to expect the unexpected , and , as fortune would have it , evans ripped three doubles in his major league debut he drove in two runs , including the capper to their fiverun first inning vargas pitched on short rest , aiding a taxed bullpen with seven strong innings after giving up a basesempty homer to matt holliday in the first , vargas allowed only three singles over the next six innings he retired his final nine batters i guess you kind of had to figure we would win one game eventually , billy wagner said it was the first victory for the mets \( 2324 \) since last sunday in the bronx , where they won two in a row against the yankees and hoped that a turnaround was imminent that was not the case , and after four losses in atlanta , some controversial remarks from randolph and a heap of concern , minaya decided to fly here from new york to see firsthand what was going on with the 140 million team he constructed randolph is scheduled to meet monday or tuesday with minaya fred wilpon , the principal owner and jeff wilpon , the team s chief operating officer he said he expected the gathering to resemble one of the standard quarterly meetings he said he had had with ownership minaya arrived here too late friday to speak with randolph before that game , which the mets lost , 65 , in 13 innings , and randolph said saturday morning that the conversations they had had consisted of just chitchat i thought i saw him in the back sharpening his machete , randolph said jokingly he saw me coming , so i think he slipped it in his back pocket i do n't know if that made me feel any better turning serious , randolph continued i'm around omar all the time obviously , when all this stuff is going on around me and he shows up , everyone thinks , why is he here \? he does n't go on many trips whether omar s here or not , whether they support me or not , it really , to me , is irrelevant it s going to be what it s going to be i 'll go down to the last day trying to win a ballgame that s why i'm here that s why i came here all that stuff is out of my hand so , too , are the injuries that have befallen the mets this week following ryan church \( concussion \) and moises alou \( strained left calf \) , marlon anderson strained his left hamstring friday that prompted tony bernazard , the mets' vice president for development , to have evans pulled from binghamton s game evans , who had earlier misplayed a ball that went for an insidethepark homer , said he thought he was being replaced for defensive purposes when he learned he was being promoted , he called his father , wally , in phoenix , and told him to take the day off from his job with the postal service on saturday , the evans contingent watched the game from behind the mets' dugout flying from binghamton , ny , to detroit to denver , evans arrived at coors field a little after 10 am not having slept he shook hands with his new teammates , none of whom he knew , and learned that he was starting in left field i 've never played in a stadium with three levels and that many people in the stands , evans said different than the 1 , 800 we had last night at the game evans had only eight spring atbats with the mets , and randolph said he knew little about him other than that he liked his insideout approach , which allowed him to hit to the opposite field when he batted in the first , the mets were already leading , 40 , after a threerun double by carlos beltr n and a single by ram n castro on the first pitch to him , evans sliced a double to right , driving in tatis in the third , he doubled to rightcenter in the eighth , he doubled down the rightfield line again to the opposite field to bring in castro and put the mets in front , 72 he became the first met to have three extrabase hits in his major league debut since kazuo matsui on april 6 , 2004 i hope all my guys were taking notes , randolph said of a group that batted 220 during its fivegame skid a kid comes up here and sets an example that s the way you could hit evans also has the distinction of perhaps being oblivious to the mets' recent troubles honestly , i have n't really been following a lot about what s been going on , he said a relieved minaya said , you get in those funks where you ask yourself , are we ever going to get a win \? finally , the mets did win one and with another victory sunday , they can climb to 500 and , more significant , continue to relieve the pressure on randolph as randolph , laughing , said afterward , omar still has that machete

dublin , ohio \( ap \) pga tour commissioner tim finchem says he cannot think of a better situation when the international olympic committee meets in october 2009 golf is added to the summer program chicago is announced as the host city for 2016 and tiger woods is going strong and eager to add a gold medal to his trophy collection that is still a long way off , but finchem said tuesday that golf made a strong first impression in an informal meeting last week with jacques rogge , the ioc president finchem was joined by the european tour chief , george o'grady lpga tour commissioner carolyn bivens david fay , the united states golf association s executive director and peter dawson , the royal ancient chief executive they were told the steps leading to the ioc decision next october and what golf executives have to do to make their case it was important that the ioc saw the game was united , which i think they were impressed with , finchem said that got accomplished it s a long way , and we have other sports competing for the same spots we like to think we 're what they want because we 're a sport that s universal woods gives a boost to any tournament , although any involvement in the olympics would probably be shortlived woods will be 40 in 2016 , the earliest golf could be part of the olympics chicago is the united states city under consideration for 2016 , and finchem was quick to note that woods had a strong history in chicago , where he has won two pga championships and four pga tour events his knee aside , he s such a good athlete , you 've got to believe he s going to be competitive , finchem said and there s a lot of interest in whether he plays but the bigger question is the longterm role of golf in the olympics he also mentioned a long list of courses chicago can offer the biggest obstacle will be scheduling olympic golf among the last two majors and the tour s fedex cup finale finchem suggested one possibility of the men and women competing over separate weeks the four playoff events for the fedex cup are being rearranged this year for the ryder cup , and finchem says they will work even into the early part of football season we 're not really doing it for golf in the us , anyway , he said it s for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world , the more people will be watching they 'll be paid back eventually the golf researcher tom ierubino , a former managing editor at golf magazine , came up with some historical nuggets that do not bode well for tiger woods at the united states open the previous nine opens in california \( at riviera , olympic club and pebble beach \) were won by nine players and although no one has won multiple majors in the golden state , some of the game s greatest players have come hauntingly close upon their return ben hogan won in 1948 at riviera , and the next open in california was at the olympic club in 1955 , when hogan lost a playoff to jack fleck jack nicklaus won at pebble beach in 1972 the next time an open was held in california , he finished second to tom watson at pebble a decade later after that twoshot victory in 1982 , watson next played an open in california at olympic club , where he finished second to scott simpson woods won the most recent open in california , at pebble beach in 2000 next up is torrey pines for those curious about those other united states open winners fleck , billy casper , simpson , tom kite and lee janzen none finished in the top 10 upon their open return to california jack nicklaus has been barking about technology for at least a decade , with seemingly no help from the usga but he took part in an announcement last month when golf s governing body in the united states and mexico announced it had signed its fourth corporate partner in the last 18 months he was asked about any perception that the usga is more interested in getting corporate support than in governing the game i wish i had a good answer to that , nicklaus said i have n't had a good answer from the usga on it i think their heart is in the right place i do n't think they 're trying to avoid being a good steward to the game they 're probably between a rock and a hard place their efforts in the grass roots of the game , being involved in youth , certainly has been good , he said they do so many good things it s just the one thing they are n't having success at is controlling the length of the golf ball , referring to how far it is being hit tiger woods has rendered moot the argument over who is no 1 , building a lead that is nearly double the points of phil mickelson but mickelson is carving out a niche at no 2 with his victory at colonial , the points gap between mickelson and ernie els at no 3 is roughly equal to the gap between els and ben curtis at no 80
four bodies were recovered in the ruins of a sugar refinery near savannah , ga , that was rocked by an explosion thursday evening and burned all night john oxendine , the state s fire and insurance commissioner confirmed in a broadcast interview that search crews had found the remains of six workers in the lower levels of the imperial sugar plant where they had evidently sought shelter but by friday night , the number had been revised to four dead and four missing earlier in the day police and fire officials made it clear they did not expect to find any survivors when they said the actions at the plant had been converted from a rescue effort to one of recovery in addition to the dead , who had earlier been listed as missing , dozens of others remained hospitalized , many of them in critical condition with extensive burns michael berkow , the chief of the savannah metropolitan police department , said that authorities planned to meet with the families of the dead workers officials said efforts at the plant on the savannah river in port wentworth said recovery efforts were impeded by the unstable condition of the plant , parts of which were still burning lt cmdr kevin lynn of the coast guard said the river was closed to ship traffic from the port of savannah , about six miles downstream , while the river was searched for possible victims none had been found charles middleton , the savannah fire chief , said the instability of the building may hamper recovery operations , but they are anxious to get the process moving he said he did not want to expose rescue crews to any more danger than absolutely necessary eighteen of the more than 40 plant workers injured in the blast and fire were airlifted to the joseph h still burn center in augusta , ga , for treatment , said beth frits , a spokeswoman for the hospital as of friday morning , 15 were listed in critical condition and three were listed as serious , ms frits said some 30 to 35 additional patients were being treated locally , and burn specialists from medical centers outside the city were being sent to help dr jay goldstein , an emergency room doctor at memorial university medical center said in a televised interview that most of the plant workers had significant burns officials had not determined what caused the explosion , which happened shortly after 7 pm thursday night , but said they were suspicious of sugar dust , which like grain dust , can be volatile there was fire all over the building , said nakishya hill , a machine operator who said she escaped from the third floor of the refinery , according to the associated press all i know is , i heard a loud boom and everything came down , said ms hill , who was uninjured except for blisters on her elbow all i could do when i got down was take off running kelly fields , 40 , who worked the night shift at imperial sugar for five months , handling 10pound bags of sugar , was among the victims with burns over 70 percent of his body just two months ago , mr fields was married at a church in northern by glenn burnsed , 36 , a former pastor mr fields , was airlifted from memorial university medical center in savannah last night to the joseph m still burn center at doctors hospital in augusta , where mr burnsed told reporters that his brotherinlaw lies bandaged , unconscious , and in between surgeries mr burnsed said he and mr fields s boss , have taken to teasing the victim , in the hope of encouraging him me and jimmy are here , and we got a lot of stuff for you to do , he described them as saying he s got to hurry back to work if any of that s getting through , i hope that helps , mr burnsed said it s just difficult to see them bound up and laying there with a lot of stuff in and out of them , he said , noting that not all the victims' family members here wanted to see their loved ones but for mr burnsed , who struck an optimistic chord in relaying his relative s state , his faith and the nascent community of survivors' relatives are a lifeline i think for us and a lot of the families involved , we 're leaning on our faith , mr burnsed said we 're christians , and we 're calling on our christian faith to say a lot of prayers , asking god to give the doctors wisdom i think you see kind of a community forming in the waiting room i do n't know if camaraderie is the right word , but a lot of helping each other out and sharing each other s stories about how their loved one is doing mr burnsed said he and his wife had signed a threemonth lease on an apartment near the hospital today because they were told to expect that mr fields might be here that long dr fred mullins , the medical director at the burn center , said 17 others from the sugar plant were patients at his center , 15 of them in critical condition dr mullins said most patients with such severe burns usually require a year to several years of outpatient rehabilitation to strengthen muscles and optimize their range of motion he went on to say that when someone s body is 70 percent burned , that means nearly everything but their feet and ankles are involved it means the person uses up their protein stores to fight the burns and becomes very weak someone very muscular will leave the hospital very thin , dr mullins said emile delegram , 58 , a board member of the southeastern firefighters' burn foundation , was at the hospital looking for family members of burn victims and giving them his business card he talked to mr burnsed , about supporting his rental costs for his stay in augusta the foundation has set up a center near the hospital with food , computers and a rest area for the victims' families , he said , adding that it is working with more than 60 churches that to bring meals to the families mr delegram estimated that four to six people were at the hospital to accompany each patient the plant is owned by imperial sugar and is known in savannah as the dixie crystals plant imperial markets some of the country s leading consumer brands , imperial , dixie crystals and holly , as well as supplying sugar and sweetener products to industrial food manufacturers
there are video games that try to make you cry there are games that gross you out there are games that tell a sweeping story there are games that make you think seriously about the world around you super smash bros brawl , which was released by nintendo this week , is none of those brawl is about one thing simple fun and that s good enough in fact , it s so good that brawl will almost surely be one of the topselling games of 2008 and may become the bestselling game yet for nintendo s popular wii console it is certainly the most anticipated game released this year \( at least until grand theft auto iv comes out next month , but gta is aimed at an entirely different audience \) thousands of fans , disappointed after the game missed its original release date in december , have flocked to advance tournaments and demonstrations in recent months last sunday , gamestop , the major game retailer , held brawl tournaments at thousands of its stores \( the regional finals are this weekend , with the national finals next month in san jose , calif \) in some ways , brawl is a throwback , a gamer s game the successor to the original 1999 super smash bros and 2001 s super smash bros melee \( which has sold more than seven million copies for nintendo s gamecube \) , brawl is all about jumping , spinning and unleashing various attacks to knock your opponent whether human or machinecontrolled off the screen the secret sauce in the smash bros formula has always been its diverse range of characters taken from other game franchises even companies outside nintendo have seen the value of licensing their famous characters to the brawl series if you like console games , brawl is like having luke skywalker , james bond and indiana jones all in one \( impossibly improbable \) movie brawl s roster reads like a who s who of japanese console stars it includes mario , princess peach , zelda , link , donkey kong , pikachu \( from the pok mon series \) and samus aran \( metroid \) perhaps most interesting , it also includes major characters from outside nintendo , like sonic the hedgehog \( from sega \) and solid snake \( from konami s metal gear series \) in their own games , these characters are central and often engaged in deep stories in brawl , they are reduced to slightly different packages of teenagerfriendly combat moves it s a bit like seeing gandalf as a swordandstaffswinging melee machine \( as he has been in some lord of the rings action games \) rather than as the driver of a sweeping plotline but on its own terms , as a relatively easytoplay fighting game that is ultimately no more gory or violent than saturday morning cartoons , as a game with no larger point than trashtalking friends or relatives on the couch as you bop their character off the next ledge , it s great and there s nothing wrong with that
academics build entire careers trying to figure out why we vote the way we do , whether we make our decisions with our heads or our hearts right now , it s the hearts that are getting most of their attention , and two scholars who stress the role of emotions in political behavior , george lakoff and drew westen , have become darlings of the democratic party people think with their guts , westen says well , none of us really likes to believe that \( is westen thinking with his gut when he votes \? \) , but what s a poor rationalist to do \? politics is hard consider health care during this primary season the candidates have all had their proposals , and there are probably dozens more cluttering up the halls of congress how do we decide which is the best \? responsible newspapers like the one i work for dutifully try to provide an abundance of detailed information so that people can choose intelligently the problem is that as soon as you take two steps into the issue , you re lost in a welter of statistics and regression analyses there s always a wonk on one side of the room loaded down with charts and graphs who is yelling at a wonk on the other side of the room with a different collection of charts and graphs maybe the only thing the concerned citizen can do is to eliminate those plans that don t seem to mesh with his values , and then hope for the best is that rational \? i don t know , but it s what i concluded after reading david frum s new book , comeback conservatism that can win again frum is full of facts and figures about health care he knows much more than i do the typical health insurance policy for a family of four , he says , doubled between 2000 and 2006 the federal government lost 188 billion in tax revenues in 2005 because of the breaks corporations get on the coverage they provide to their employees the united states has the best cancersurvival rates among firstworld countries canadians wait as long as a year for hip replacements i m as eager for healthcare reform as the next guy \( only 20 percent of americans , frum tells us , are satisfied with the status quo \) , but one of my key priorities is to see that all americans have decent coverage , whereas frum s main priority is to get the government out of the healthcare business the us health care system is not a freemarket system , he declares , and that really bothers him , much more than it does me so because frum s goals and values don t mesh with mine , i m inclined to discount his figures on cancersurvival rates and hip replacements \( not deny them , just discount them \) nietzsche wrote if one would explain how the most abstruse metaphysical claims of a philosopher really came about , it is always well \( and wise \) to ask first at what morality does all this \( does he \) aim \? the same goes for wonks and their social policy claims
casino drive is listed at short odds for saturday s , but a victory by him would nonetheless represent one of the biggest winning long shots in horse racing history the japanesebased casino drive , who is 72 in the morning line , will be attempting to become the third straight belmont winner out of the dam better than honour , a proposition that is , depending on how you crunch the numbers , as high as 43 trillion to 1 to think a dam could produce three straight belmont winners is unfathomable , said john kimmel , who trained the 12yearold mare during her racing career she s already produced two straight belmont winners and now might have a third casino drive could win this that would be like woody stephens s five straight belmont wins it s something that will never happen again thoroughbred sires have plenty of chances to produce good horses the top stallions are bred to 100 mares or more each year the sire bull lea produced three winners , including the 1948 triple crown champion citation seattle slew swept the 1977 triple crown , then produced the belmont winners swale \( 1984 \) and a p indy \( 1992 \) but a dam can be bred just once each year , making the odds astronomical that two or more of their offspring will win backtoback triple crown races better than honour is the only mare to produce two belmont winners there are about 35 , 000 horses bred each year in the united states giving every dam an equal chance of producing a belmont winner , the chances of one mare turning out two straight belmont winners is about 12 billion to 1 using the same simple formula , the odds of a dam producing three straight belmont winners is 1 in 42875 trillion you have to take into the account that certain mares have a much greater probability of producing a quality horse over others , said rob whiteley , the breeder of better than honour there 'll be a dam in wyoming without a good pedigree or an opportunity to get to a top stallion you have to drop one like that from consideration but even if you say that there might be 15 , 000 dams who have a realistic chance of producing a top foal , the odds of this happening still come down to the billions better than honour raced eight times , winning a maiden race and the 1998 demoiselle stakes after tutorial was disqualified for causing interference after her last career start , a thirdplace finish in the grade i mother goose at belmont , she was purchased by john sikura of hill 'n' dale farm in lexington , ky i told john , this is a magnificent looking filly , ' kimmel said she is going to be one stunning broodmare a wellbred stakes winner , better than honour figured to be a good broodmare , but it does not always work out that way winning colors , the last filly to win the kentucky derby , produced six foals that raced none was a stakes winner , and the sextet combined to win 8 of 41 races after her first two foals did not win any major races , better than honour went on a roll her third foal , jazil , won the 2006 belmont her fourth , rags to riches , captured the belmont a year later along the way , sikura sold better than honour for an undisclosed price to skara glen stable while carrying casino drive , better than honour was sold at auction by skara glen in 2004 for 2 million to european interests she is probably worth six times that much today whiteley , her breeder , called her the most valuable broodmare in the world today ira gumberg , whose family operates skara glen stable , said we did just fine financially with her to have had her for a time is very special to us sikura and mike moreno reacquired better than honour in 2006 , buying her privately from the european group casino drive was sold as a yearling for 950 , 000 to the japanese owner hidetoshi yamamoto after rags to riches s belmont win , yamamoto became intrigued by the idea of keeping better than honour s streak alive and brought the colt over from japan will be tough to beat , but this could be the horse to do it to have two belmont winners from this dam is unbelievable , gumberg said to have three in a row would truly be mythical
carson , calif it is midday under a bright , midsummer sun , just the type of environment in which mad dogs and englishmen are supposed to feel at ease and so is , finishing a twohour workout with a series of sprints along with the rest of the los angeles galaxy off to the side , his 5yearold son , romeo , kicks a soccer ball into a hockeysized goal after the practice , which is watched by more security guards than fans and no discernable paparazzi beckham takes a few minutes to answer questions from three reporters before he leaves on the back of a groundskeepers' cart romeo rides shotgun on the lap of his father s personal assistant if this is a global sports icon who will transcend the sport of soccer in america and carry it on his shoulders , as major league soccer commissioner don garber proclaimed last year , then beckham has plenty of lifting to do it has been a year since beckham arrived in the united states , and while the ball has been moved forward , it has not been launched in the manner of one of his trademark free kicks rather , it has been a series of small dribbles but if beckham has an ounce of regret about leaving real madrid , leaving on the table a lucrative offer from inter milan , or leaving behind toplevel soccer , it does not show i'm always going to miss playing in europe , said beckham , who starred for manchester united and real madrid and served as the captain of the english national team i did it for 15 years at the highest level for two of the biggest clubs in the world , and i wanted to move to america and try and make an impact and have a new challenge so i'm enjoying the challenge beckham has recovered from the injuries that wrecked his first mls season , and his pinpoint passing is a prime reason the galaxy , which visits the red bulls on saturday night , leads the league in goals this year he has helped spur increases in tv ratings , attendance and jersey sales but beyond the soccer world , any buzz like the kind that might have been anticipated a year ago when his staged introduction was covered by several hundred members of the news media and carried live in parts of europe has mostly fizzled when the galaxy traveled to washington last month , attendance was off by more than 10 , 000 from last year s game , even though that one was played on a weeknight , in the rain , and it was unclear if beckham who was injured would play beckham did play and afterward attended three welladvertised invitationonly parties at dc nightclubs when the galaxy returned last month , there were none crowds at the galaxy s other road games have been almost identical to last season even though beckham did not play in dallas , toronto , colorado and salt lake city a year ago because of injuries beckham may have been a larger than life character , but in america he s become a mediumsize fish in a very big pond , said ellis cashmore , a professor of culture , media and sport at england s staffordshire university , and who has written a book on beckham that engagement he s had with european consumers who have watched him lurch from one crisis to another , on and off the field , then restore himself it does n't exist he goes to the us without that relationship and he has to be accepted as an athlete there s a builtin obsolescence because people cannot continue to be fascinated by a soccer player in the us andrei markovits , a comparative politics professor at the university of michigan who has written about soccer , said the question of how much beckham had moved the needle was irrelevant now if an american player says during the 2014 or 2018 world cup that the hoopla of beckham s arrival steered him into the sport , it will be a success beckham is an investment like pele , markovits said people say the cosmos failed and of course they did but they created an entire generation that made soccer an american word it was like mineral water now you can get a sixpack of mineral water in iowa getting perrier in des moines is one thing , getting noticed in hollywood is quite another tom cruise is often at galaxy games , and kobe bryant and wayne gretzky have made appearances yet while los angeles might be a city that loves celebrity , it loves a winner more twenty years ago , gretzky became the king of la , taking the nhl s kings to a level of relevance and excellence they had not seen before or since the galaxy has not been to the playoffs the last two seasons , and its record with beckham is below 500 though the galaxy leads the league in attendance , at more than 25 , 000 a game , seasonticket sales have dipped from a year ago coverage in the los angeles times is reduced almost exclusively to game reports , and the orange county register the region s second largest newspaper recently stopped covering the team we 're past the honeymoon phase , said tom payne , the galaxy s assistant general manager who oversees the business operation david s been a huge help , but it s not just open up the gates we have to work hard along with beckham came several advisers there are two publicists , one in los angeles , the other in london , who are more likely to allow a sitdown interview with ryan seacrest than a local sports columnist there is also a personal assistant , a business advisor , a representative who handles appearances and a soccer adviser the last , terry byrne , not only contacted ruud gullit about becoming coach , but introduced him to the team before he was hired the galaxy players and management say they have adjusted to the new reality some even relish it edson buddle , a journeyman forward , has taken advantage of beckham s presence and passes to earn a spot on the allstar team with a leagueleading 11 goals josh tudela was beaming after taking his picture with cruise in the locker room mike randolph , who made 17 , 700 as a rookie midfielder last year , made nearly as much on the postseason trips as he did in salary those are our money balls , randolph said of his lowersalaried brethren mostly , though , the galaxy say they feel like professionals the good thing about david being here is that every time we play it s a real game , said landon donovan , the team s american star we 're up for it , the other team is up for it , the games look better on tv when columbus is playing at kansas city and there s 5 , 000 people there , it s different than when we go to new york and there s 50 , 000 people there on a saturday night for a soccer player in america , that is no small accomplishment it is something both teams will get a taste of tonight at the meadowlands it may not be the 66 , 237 that were at giants stadium the last time the galaxy were there , and it may not be madrid or manchester but it sure is not des moines
the parade of a sports team through manhattan is supposed to mean something the canyon of heroes is the dream of any athlete who plays here players who have been shredded by the news media and booed by the fans know that , if they can get through it all , there s that reward awaiting them if you can make it there , it s all worth it we save our parades for cultural celebrations , athletes and war heroes that sounds about right oh , in a few days , we 'll be having one for joakim soria , aaron cook and christian guzman in the hours before the allstar game on tuesday , july 15 , major league baseball will be parading its allstars through manhattan they 'll start at bryant park at 1 pm and make their way up to yankee stadium for the presumed six hours of pregame festivities \( one hopes the players are n't exhausted from the trot oh , and expect the game to end about midnight \) to be fair , the allstar game parade is n't traipsing through the canyon of heroes perhaps , in this regard , even bud selig has some shame but it s tough not to feel like this last season of new york s two major league baseball stadiums neither of which is particularly beloved anymore , though , as always , shea takes a back seat is just more grist for the mlb hype machine \( or have you not noticed the terrifying miniature statue of liberty painted with the marlins logo outside your office \? \) you thought that trotting out ted williams at fenway park back in 1999 was over the top \? the last allstar game at the current yankee stadium will bring everybody out of the woodwork yogi berra , don mattingly , bucky dent , bernie williams \( who might get the largest ovation \) , you name it expect to see about 30 different relatives of babe ruth it has been odd this year to see all the pomp and circumstance about the closing of our two baseball stadiums but still not quite feeling it maybe we need to get this artificial , contrived rigmarole out of the way , let the tourists leave , and then get down to the business of mourning , or celebrating , or whatever yankee stadium is n't about the patriotic bunting , or the parades it s about the bleacher bums , the upper tier folk , the families who have had the yankees in their blood for decades none of them will be there at the allstar game but they 'll be there for the last game of the season let s wait until then for the real commemoration
st paul senator s republican primary campaign looked all but hopeless he had risked the wrath of his party to push for an overhaul and now , just months before the iowa caucuses , his grand compromise was falling apart on the senate floor as well lindsey , my boy , this may bring us down , mr mccain said , turning to his friend senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina but was n't it fun \? by this spring , when mr mccain had astounded political handicappers by virtually locking up the nomination , the thrill of noble defeat had been replaced by an anxious discomfort about his own victory i refuse to believe that this is possible , he said , curling up his face during an interview on his campaign plane i tend to be fatalistic about these things as he accepts the republican presidential nomination on thursday night in st paul , john sidney mccain iii , of arizona , stands at the pinnacle of a career defined by a singular ambivalence about his own ambition , and success time and again , he lunges for the prize , then lashes himself for letting his pursuit get the better of him for doing favors for his patron charles h keating jr , for stooping to ugly attacks on george w bush during the 2000 primary , for outbursts of temper at lawmakers who get in his way it reflects what his brother , joe mccain , calls a public dialectic between the senator s drive to succeed and his desire to serve a higher cause for decades his outward display of that inner conflict has proved advantageous , helping advance his career by forging his image as the unpolitician , the candidate with an almost reckless disregard for his own fortunes his critics assert that the mccain of 2008 is not the mccain of 2000 , or even 2007 he has surrounded himself with former prot g s of karl rove , whose tactics he once denounced , embraced positions he once repudiated and initiated a series of attacks on senator barack obama s patriotism that some say resemble the rhetorical roughhousing he regretted eight years ago bring back the real mccain ! the cover of the economist magazine implored last week his loyalists , though , say such complaints hold mr mccain to the standard of a nostalgic mythology that grew up around his last campaign , overlooking the tough competitor that was there all along he is same guy he has always been , wrestling with all the things he does trying to be the guy he believes he has to be , said mark salter , mr mccain s closest aide but we are not just going to say , ok , we 'll just lose we will lose graciously maybe everybody will remember him fondly' it is his combination of lofty aspirations and hard jabs that has made him a political force you ca n't be above it all and accomplish all that he has accomplished , said bob kerrey , a democratic former senate colleague of mr mccain and fellow vietnam war veteran it s a little like saying that muhammad ali was above boxing while he was doing the ropeadope it s a tactic it s not devious or anything it is what it is mr mccain has always had contradictory impulses he enjoys both boxing and bird watching , cites as favorite movies both viva zapata ! and a fish called wanda , and quotes his idols henry kissinger and henny youngman he wins admirers by boasting of the unpopularity of his views on campaign finance reform , on the iraq war , on immigration an avid gambler , he is drawn to big bets and long odds whether picking 1against99 fights with his fellow senators over their official perquisites , or defying convention by picking as his running mate a littleknown alaskan with a reputation as an irritantreformer he is the most disruptive figure in the , and , as of thursday night , its standardbearer until recently , mr mccain was one of the few united states senators who drove himself around washington tailgating , dashboardpounding and cellphonetaking my philosophy is just to go like hell , mr mccain once explained fullbore he often invokes the crowded hour , a term from his political hero , theodore roosevelt , referring to the assault on san juan hill in the roosevelt and mccain lexicon , the phrase equates to a moment of reckoning , when worthy men prove themselves aboard his campaign plane in february , mr mccain caught his breath after the four months that transformed him from a principled loser to his party s contender for the highest office in the land this has been a very crowded hour for me , he said few politicians have apologized as profusely or as fortuitously as mr mccain he may be the only candidateauthor whose editor cut back on the selfcriticism in the first draft of his campaign memoirs he was quite happy to lacerate himself , recalled the editor , jonathan karp joe mccain attributes his brother s habit of public penitence to the example of their father , adm john s mccain jr he would whack us on the rear end with these leather slippers that he had , joe mccain recalled then he would come back out rubbing his hands together , and i could tell he felt so bad that i almost felt sorry for the guy their father expected them to live up to a military code of honor and atone for any lapses , teaching them that it was the only way to retain the respect of those around them i think one of john s deepest needs is to be believed and trusted , joe mccain said after submitting to a forced confession statement as a prisoner of war in vietnam , john mccain has said , he found relief from his shame by provoking his guards to beat him john mccain s aspirations were always grand as a boy , he dreamed of an admiralty like his father s as the navy s liaison to the senate , he set his sights on becoming a member in vietnam he had mused aloud to cellmates about becoming president , and as soon as he won his first senate race in 1986 he felt an emotional need to envision some future goal , as he recalled in his 2002 memoir , worth the fighting for but he exasperated himself with his own selfdefeating behavior letting his barfly antics as a young pilot undercut his credibility as a navy officer , or later jeopardizing his friendship with his patrons , ronald and nancy reagan , by leaving his first wife for a glamorous beer heiress 20 years younger , cindy mccain he has always felt very guilty about it , his navy colleague james mcgovern recalled in an interview eight years ago i have never talked with him for more than 40 minutes when he did n't bring it up for most of his political career , mr mccain was a straightahead partisan he voted along party lines , crushed his opponents by outspending them , and sought to run the senate republican campaign committee his preferred public image the straighttalking maverick did not emerge until well after 1989 , when he became one of five senators caught up in a scandal over meetings with savings and loan regulators on behalf of mr keating , a wealthy donor in a marathon news conference and nonstop media interviews , mr mccain became the foremost critic of his own poor judgment \( any other accusations he called defamation \) the national media was saying , john mccain is the only one who is talking about this , and sometimes it seems like he wo n't shut up , ' recalled jay smith , a political consultant who advised mr mccain at the time as the senator kept talking , the scandal seemed to improve markedly for him seeing that his openness was effective , mr mccain later wrote , he adopted it as a permanent public relations strategy repentance became a theme of his career he wove his regret over decades of smoking marlboros into his drive for a tobacco tax overhaul then he said he felt ashamed of his own party for neglecting children s health by blocking the bill he even organized his bestselling 1999 memoir , faith of my fathers , as a confession written with mr salter , his longtime aide , as a springboard to the 2000 presidential race , it catalogs his decades of misbehavior leading to the realization in a vietnamese prison of the deeper satisfaction of a cause greater than myself soon he was turning the keating episode into a similar parable of shortsighted selfinterest in the 2000 republican primary , mr mccain sometimes seemed to be battling his own impulses as much as he was his rival , mr bush he opened the year with a speech in new hampshire denouncing contemporary politics as little more than a spectacle of selfish ambition and pledging to take the high ground at the same event , however , his campaign passed out a news release falsely asserting that mr bush s political tax plan would put social security in danger mr mccain was apologizing by the end of the day operatives on both sides say mr mccain gave as well as he got for most of the race it was mccain on the stump fighting the death star , ' his epithet for the bush juggernaut , mr salter recalled but when his opponents unleashed anonymous phone calls and fliers spreading rumors about his family before the south carolina primary , mr mccain fired back with a commercial accusing mr bush of lying like president bill clinton its tone backfired , hurting mr mccain more than his target advisers pushed for a better attack but acknowledged they could not win the state instead mr mccain insisted on publicly apologizing and pulling the commercials so we died on higher ground , said john weaver , a former aide a few months later , mr mccain was back in the state apologizing for holding his tongue about his disdain for the confederate flag to try to win the race i will be criticized by all sides for my late act of contrition , mr mccain declared i accept it , all of it i deserve it his loss in south carolina made him a martyr the politician too good for politics he came out of that primary the most popular politician in the country , mr weaver recalled is he crazy like a fox \? mr weaver added listen , he is a very good intuitive politician , and he is a lot smarter politically than those of us around him or he would n't be where he is at former opponents marvel at mr mccain s political alchemy he takes a past failing , hangs it around his neck , and wears it like a medal , said kevin madden , who worked for mitt romney in the primary there is a part of john mccain that revels in his failures sitting around , feeling sorry for myself after losing in 2000 was wonderful he sometimes says delicious , he recalls , with sarcasm but also a certain relish his 2007 stint as the republican frontrunner did not go well i'm much better in this environment , he said in south carolina after his campaign was nearly broke , he had spiraled in the polls and shed much of his staff and winning can be imprisoning , mr mccain has found for much of the summer , he had seemed merely dutiful on the trail , going through the motions his aides have since imposed a new discipline , shielding him from the news media , scripting a daily message and reining in his tendency to improvise at heart , he s a maverick , and the maverick does n't like the corral , said mark mckinnon , a close aide to president bush and mr mccain who is not involved in the campaign but the corral is where he is and it s working mr mccain s advisers say he hoped to pick up his 2008 campaign where his 2000 race left off bucking convention , running against politics he started his run against the democratic nominee , senator barack obama , with an apology standing on the balcony of the memphis hotel where the rev dr martin luther king jr was shot , he told a mostly black crowd that he had made a mistake years ago in opposing a federal holiday for king he toured the heavily black areas of the south , an unlikely trip for a republican running against an africanamerican and for awhile , he skipped over the attack lines against mr obama that advisers had inserted into his speeches when mr obama declined his invitation to a series of townhallstyle meetings , mr mccain went solo , drawing scant attention from the news media none of it got through nothing , mr salter said of mr mccain s message by midsummer , mr mccain had put the campaign in the hands of steve schmidt , a former aide to president bush \( and a fan of ultimate fighting \) the campaign began a barrage of advertisements that ridiculed mr obama as a celebrity , accused him of indifference to wounded american soldiers , and asserted that he put politics ahead of victory in iraq he stepped up his behindthescenes courtship of influential conservative leaders with whom he had clashed in the past and he abandoned past calls for the party to moderate its opposition to abortion in order to let activists draft what many called the most conservative platform in the party s history if mr mccain has any ambivalence about the conduct of his campaign , he no longer displays it in public friends say he wants to become president and is learning how to get there john has always seen politics as an adventure , his friend mr graham said i'm trying to get him to think of it as a business the choice of sarah palin exemplified both her resolute opposition to abortion fired up conservative activists to get out the vote for mr mccain s election but mr mccain s advisers say he sees her the way he sees himselfas an upstart outsider who shook up her state s corrupt republican establishment the old mccain' is still there look at the palin pick , mr salter said the surprise was also a glimpse of how mr mccain might govern mr mccain promises in every speech that as president he would put country first , but his notions of honor and disregard for his popularity can make him an unpredictable patriot he is a conservative committed to limited government , except when he sees a greater cause like , campaign corruption or children s health he boasts that he stood by the iraq war long after the public turned against it , but also says he would never risk american troops abroad without deep public support his associates say mr mccain has come to see the presidential race in starkly moral terms , convinced that mr obama s election would weaken america at a decisive moment for the security of the world but mr mccain is also the first to confess that not all his drives are so selfless i did n't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism , he wrote in 2002 in truth , i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president he added , i had had the ambition for a long time
obama we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges greater than any we 've seen in generations right now , our brave men and women in uniform are fighting two different wars while terrorists plot their next attack our changing climate is placing our planet in peril our economy is in turmoil and our families are struggling with rising costs and falling incomes with lost jobs and lost homes and lost faith in the american dream and for too long , our leaders in washington have been unwilling or unable to do anything about it that is why this election could be the most important of our lifetime when it comes to our economy , our security , and the very future of our planet , the choices we make in november and over the next few years will shape the next decade , if not the century and central to all of these major challenges is the question of what we will do about our addiction to foreign oil without a doubt , this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet it s also a threat that goes to the very heart of who we are as a nation , and who we will be will we be the generation that leaves our children a planet in decline , or a world that is clean , and safe , and thriving \? will we allow ourselves to be held hostage to the whims of tyrants and dictators who control the world s oil wells \? or will we control our own energy and our own destiny \? will america watch as the clean energy jobs and industries of the future flourish in countries like spain , japan , or germany \? or will we create them here , in the greatest country on earth , with the most talented , productive workers in the world \? as americans , we know the answers to these questions we know that we cannot sustain a future powered by a fuel that is rapidly disappearing not when we purchase 700 million worth of oil every single day from some the world s most unstable and hostile nations middle eastern regimes that will control nearly all of the world s oil by 2030 not when the rapid growth of countries like china and india mean that we 're consuming more of this dwindling resource faster than we ever imagined we know that we ca n't sustain this kind of future but we also know that we 've been talking about this issue for decades we 've heard promises about energy independence from every single president since richard nixon we 've heard talk about curbing the use of fossil fuels in state of the union addresses since the oil embargo of 1973 back then , we imported about a third of our oil now , we import more than half back then , global warming was the theory of a few scientists now , it is a fact that is melting our glaciers and setting off dangerous weather patterns as we speak then , the technology and innovation to create new sources of clean , affordable , renewable energy was a generation away today , you can find it in the research labs of this university and in the design centers of this state s legendary auto industry it s in the chemistry labs that are laying the building blocks for cheaper , more efficient solar panels , and it s in the reborn factories that are churning out more wind turbines every day all across this country despite all this , here we are , in another election , still talking about our oil addiction still more dependent than ever why \? you wo n't hear me say this too often , but i could n't agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago he said , our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making , and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think longterm about the future of the country what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years , he was in washington for twentysix of them and in all that time , he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power \( otcbb sopw \) against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis , it s important to remember that he s been a part of that failure now , after years of inaction , and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices , the only energy proposal he s really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan , and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the longterm challenge of energy independence george bush s own energy department has said that if we opened up new areas to drilling today , we would n't see a single drop of oil for seven years seven years and senator mccain knows that , which is why he admitted that his plan would only provide psychological relief to consumers he also knows that if we opened up and drilled on every single square inch of our land and our shores , we would still find only three percent of the world s oil reserves three percent for a country that uses 25 of the world s oil even texas oilman boone pickens , who s calling for major new investments in alternative energy \( ootc aegc \) , has said , this is one emergency we ca n't drill our way out of now , increased domestic oil exploration certainly has its place as we make our economy more fuelefficient and transition to other , renewable , americanmade sources of energy but it is not the solution it is a political answer of the sort washington has given us for three decades there are genuine ways in which we can provide some shortterm relief from high gas prices relief to the mother who s cutting down on groceries because of gas prices , or the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job and ca n't even afford to drive around and look for a new one i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a 1 , 000 energy rebate , and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now i also believe that in the shortterm , as we transition to renewable energy , we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but have n't touched and if they do n't , we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will we should invest in the technology that can help us recover more from existing oil fields , and speed up the process of recovering oil and gas resources in shale formations in montana and north dakota texas and arkansas and in parts of the west and central gulf of mexico we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude , which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks over the next five years , we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline , delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process but the truth is , none of these steps will come close to seriously reducing our energy dependence in the longterm we simply cannot pretend , as senator mccain does , that we can drill our way out of this problem we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions we have to make a serious , nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away last week , washington finally made some progress on this a group of democrat and republican senators sat down and came up with a compromise on energy that includes many of the proposals i 've worked on as a senator and many of the steps i 've been calling for on this campaign it s a plan that would invest in renewable fuels and batteries for fuelefficient cars , help automakers retool , and make a real investment in renewable sources of energy like all compromises , this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling , and while i still do n't believe that s a particularly meaningful shortterm or longterm solution , i am willing to consider it if it s necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil and yet , while the compromise is a good first step and a good faith effort , i believe that we must go even further , and here s why breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly , and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration , it will likely require us to defer some other priorities it is also a transformation that will require more than just a few government programs energy independence will require an all handsondeck effort from america effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs from businesses and from every american citizen factories will have to retool and redesign businesses will need to find ways to emit less carbon dioxide all of us will need to buy more of the fuelefficient cars built by this state , and find new ways to improve efficiency and save energy in our own homes and businesses this will not be easy and it will not happen overnight and if anyone tries to tell you otherwise , they are either fooling themselves or trying to fool you but i know we can do this we can do this because we are americans we do the improbable we beat great odds we rally together to meet whatever challenge stands in our way that s what we 've always done and it s what we must do now for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , we must end the age of oil in our time creating a new energy economy is n't just a challenge to meet , it s an opportunity to seize an opportunity that will create new businesses , new industries , and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that ca n't be outsourced good , union jobs for a state that has lost so many and struggled so much in recent years , this is an opportunity to rebuild and revive your economy as your wonderful governor has said , any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms 'climate change' or 'global warming , ' just think 'jobs for michigan' you are seeing the potential already already , there are 50 , 000 jobs in your clean energy sector and 300 companies but now is the time to accelerate that growth , both here and across the nation if i am president , i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single , overarching goal in ten years , we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela to do this , we will invest 150 billion over the next ten years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates five million new american jobs there are three major steps i will take to achieve this goal steps that will yield real results by the end of my first term in office first , we will help states like michigan build the fuelefficient cars we need , and we will get one million 150 milepergallon plugin hybrids on our roads within six years i know how much the auto industry and the auto workers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so but i also know where i want the fuelefficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan , not in china , but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan we can do this when i arrived in washington , i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise the mileage standards in our cars for the first time in thirty years a plan that won support from democrats and republicans who had never supported raising fuel standards before i also led the bipartisan effort to invest in the technology necessary to build plugin hybrid cars as president , i will accelerate those efforts to meet our urgent need with technology we have on the shelf today , we will raise our fuel mileage standards four percent every year we 'll invest more in the research and development of those plugin hybrids , specifically focusing on the battery technology we 'll leverage private sector funding to bring these cars directly to american consumers , and we 'll give consumers a 7 , 000 tax credit to buy these vehicles but most importantly , i 'll provide 4 billion in loans and tax credits to american auto plants and manufacturers so that they can retool their factories and build these cars that s how we 'll not only protect our auto industry and our auto workers , but help them thrive in a 21st century economy what s more , these efforts will lead to an explosion of innovation here in michigan at the turn of the 20th century , there were literally hundreds of car companies offering a wide choice of steam vehicles and gas engines i believe we are entering a similar era of expanding consumer choices , from higher mileage cars , to new electric entrants like gm s volt , to flex fuel cars and trucks powered by biofuels and driven by michigan innovation the second step i 'll take is to require that 10 of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now to meet these goals , we will invest more in the clean technology research and development that s occurring in labs and research facilities all across the country and right here at msu , where you 're working with farm owners to develop this state s wind potential and developing nanotechnology that will make solar cells cheaper i 'll also extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power , solar power , and geothermal energy it was because of this credit that wind power grew 45 last year , the largest growth in history experts have said that michigan has the second best potential for wind generation and production in the entire country and as the world s largest producer of the material that makes solar panels work , this tax credit would also help states like michigan grow solar industries that are already creating hundreds of new jobs we 'll also invest federal resources , including tax incentives and government contracts , into developing next generation biofuels by 2022 , i will make it a goal to have 6 billion gallons of our fuel come from sustainable , affordable biofuels and we 'll make sure that we have the infrastructure to deliver that fuel in place here in michigan , you 're actually a step ahead of the game with your firstever commercial cellulosic ethanol plant , which will lead the way by turning wood into cleanburning fuel it s estimated that each new advanced biofuels plant can add up to 120 jobs , expand a local town s tax base by 70 million per year , and boost local household income by 67 million annually in addition , we 'll find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste and we 'll invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal , america s most abundant energy source , with the goal of creating five firstofakind coalfired demonstration plants with carbon capture and sequestration of course , too often , the problem is that all of this new energy technology never makes it out of the lab and onto the market because there s too much risk and too much cost involved in starting commercialscale clean energy businesses so we will remove some of this cost and this risk by directing billions in loans and capital to entrepreneurs who are willing to create clean energy businesses and clean energy jobs right here in america as we develop new sources of energy and electricity , we will also need to modernize our national utility grid so that it s accommodating to new sources of power , more efficient , and more reliable that s an investment that will also create hundreds of thousands of jobs , and one that i will make as president finally , the third step i will take is to call on businesses , government , and the american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 by the end of the next decade this is by far the fastest , easiest , and cheapest way to reduce our energy consumption and it will save us 130 billion on our energy bills since dupont \( nyse dd prb \) \( nyse dd pra \) \( nyse dd \) implemented an energy efficiency program in 1990 , the company has significantly reduced its pollution and cut its energy bills by 3 billion the state of california has implemented such a successful efficiency strategy that while electricity consumption grew 60 in this country over the last three decades , it did n't grow at all in california there is no reason america ca n't do the same thing we will set a goal of making our new buildings 50 more efficient over the next four years and we 'll follow the lead of california and change the way utilities make money so that their profits are n't tied to how much energy we use , but how much energy we save in just ten years , these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east along with the capandtrade program i 've proposed , we will reduce our dangerous carbon emissions 80 by 2050 and slow the warming of our planet and we will create five million new jobs in the process if these sound like faroff goals , just think about what we can do in the next few years one million plugin hybrid cars on the road doubling our energy from clean , renewable sources like wind power or solar power and 2 billion gallons of affordable biofuels new buildings that 50 more energy efficient so there is a real choice in this election a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet senator mccain would not take the steps or achieve the goals that i outlined today his plan invests very little in renewable sources of energy and he s opposed helping the auto industry retool like george bush and dick cheney before him , he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems , and like them , he s found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact , he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month , most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling in a room full of cheering oil executives his initial reaction to the bipartisan energy compromise was to reject it because it took away tax breaks for oil companies and even though he does n't want to spend much on renewable energy , he s actually proposed giving 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 12 billion to exxonmobil \( nyse xom \) this is a corporation that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that , last quarter , made 1 , 500 every second that s more than 300 , 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas that s costing you more than 4agallon and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money , he wants to give them more so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain , and if he wins , they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy well that s not the future i see for america i will not pretend the goals i laid out today are n't ambitious they are i will not pretend we can achieve them without cost , or without sacrifice , or without the contribution of almost every american citizen but i will say that these goals are possible and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the 21st century i want you all to think for a minute about the next four years , and even the next ten years we can continue down the path we 've been traveling we can keep making small , piecemeal investments in renewable energy and keep sending billions of our hardearned dollars to oil company executives and middle eastern dictators we can watch helplessly as the price of gas rises and falls because of some foreign crisis we have no control over , and uncover every single barrel of oil buried beneath this country only to realize that we do n't have enough for a few years , let alone a century we can watch other countries create the industries and the jobs that will fuel our future , and leave our children a planet that grows more dangerous and unlivable by the day or we can choose another future we can decide that we will face the realities of the 21st century by building a 21st century economy in just a few years , we can watch cars that run on a plugin battery come off the same assembly lines that once produced the first ford and the first chrysler we can see shuttered factories open their doors to manufacturers that sell wind turbines and solar panels that will power our homes and our businesses we can watch as millions of new jobs with good pay and good benefits are created for american workers , and we can take pride as the technologies , and discoveries , and industries of the future flourish in the united states of america we can lead the world , secure our nation , and meet our moral obligations to future generations this is the choice that we face in the months ahead this is the challenge we must meet this is the opportunity we must seize and this may be our last chance to seize it and if it seems too difficult or improbable , i ask you to think about the struggles and the challenges that past generations have overcome think about how world war ii forced us to transform a peacetime economy still climbing out of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents and when president roosevelt s advisers informed him that his goals for wartime production were impossible to meet , he waved them off and said believe me , the production people can do it if they really try and they did think about when the scientists and engineers told john f kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon , he told them they would find a way and we found one remember how we trained a generation for a new , industrial economy by building a nationwide system of public high schools how we laid down railroad tracks and highways across an entire continent how we pushed the boundaries of science and technology to unlock the very building blocks of human life i ask you to draw hope from the improbable progress this nation has made and look to the future with confidence that we too can meet the great test of our time i ask you to join me , in november and in the years to come , to ensure that we will not only control our own energy , but once again control our own destiny , and forge a new and better future for the

greenburgh , ny three weeks ago in a fleeting moment of bliss , isiah thomas handed the ' offense to jamal crawford and effectively proclaimed the start of a new era had just bowed out on the season to have ankle surgery the knicks had won three straight games with crawford as their doitall point guard and thomas , the knicks' coach and president , gushed about the prospect of crawford as marbury s longterm replacement he may not be a true point , but that may be his best position , thomas said jan 18 the premise seemed solid enough as the knicks won five of their first seven games without marbury but they have since lost seven straight games to fall to 1435 , and thomas is suddenly bemoaning the shaky play of his starting guards after wednesday night s sloppy loss to the indiana pacers , thomas gave an unsolicited critique of crawford and fred jones , saying that they needed to do a better job of getting the floor organized we 're asking jamal and fred to do things that they 're really not accustomed to doing , thomas said and right now , that s the position that we 're having some difficulties with right now none of this should be surprising crawford is a capable ball handler but not a true point guard jones has played almost exclusively at offguard indeed , without marbury , the knicks do not have a reliable point guard on the roster this is not only a problem for the final three months of a lost season , but for the foreseeable future marbury has one year left on his contract given his degraded relationship with the team , he may have already played his last game as a knick in four years as the team president , thomas has never acquired a suitable successor in crawford , nate robinson and mardy collins , the knicks have three guards who can play the point in spurts but are not suited to play there full time thomas has conceded as much in deeds , if not necessarily in words he made collins his starting point guard when he benched marbury in midnovember but collins played sparingly and was bounced from the rotation after marbury returned to the lineup collins has played in only 22 games this season robinson , who is generously listed at 5 feet 9 inches , is regarded as a useful changeofpace player and a scorer but he is too short and too impulsive to be a fulltime point guard crawford has played respectably at both guard spots throughout his career but he has a scorer s mentality and is considered a gunner , not a distributor so whoever is running the knicks this summer thomas or his brave successor will almost certainly be shopping for a point guard thomas did not deny the need for a longterm solution , but he called it a discussion for a later date at some point in time , you will have to move on and do some other things , he said thursday but that s not where our head is at today right now , i still think we have enough to get it done the good news for the knicks is that they actually own their firstround draft pick this year \( the last two picks went to chicago in the eddy curry trade \) the bad news , according to draft watchers , is that this year s point guard class will be thin , even if all the top underclassmen enter the draft two point guards derrick rose of memphis and o j mayo of southern california are expected to be taken in the top six both look to score first , although rose is viewed as more of a true point , while mayo is more of a chauncey billupstype combo guard the next best point guard may be d j augustin of texas , but he is 511 and will probably go late in the lottery the best playmaking point guards are regarded as lower \( nonlottery \) firstround picks ty lawson of north carolina , darren collison of ucla and jeremy pargo of gonzaga free agency may not be the answer , either the knicks , who are over the salary cap , will have only the midlevel exception \( which starts at about 54 million \) to spend , and few attractive choices among the unrestricted freeagent point guards will be jason williams , beno udrih , damon stoudamire , juan dixon , chris duhon and carlos arroyo restricted free agents will include jos calder n , delonte west , sebastian telfair , juan carlos navarro , jos juan barea and daniel gibson some more established veterans including mike bibby and andre miller could be available this summer if they are not dealt by the feb 21 trading deadline marbury s time , however , seems to have passed the knicks never talk about missing him , although they are now 59 since his operation when asked if the knicks could use marbury now , thomas talked about him unenthusiastically , and in the past tense he was a good basketball player , thomas said when he was out on the floor , he was a threat when you lose a player like that , although we 've been playing pretty decent basketball , every little bit helps
wasilla , people here in s hometown learned science from her father they remember how she led the warriors to an unexpected high school basketball championship , her success as a beauty queen and how her family grew along with the wasilla bible church so when ms palin , then a young mother , ran for the city council in 1992 , of course they voted for her and they kept doing so , for mayor and then for governor especially the women who , like her , had small children , hated abortion and prayed every day i admire her intelligence and i admire her integrity , but first and foremost she s a mom , and she has an understanding of what being a mom is , said janet kincaid , a grandmother and republican who last summer opened her lakeside wasilla home for a 20 , 000 palin fundraiser as ms palin , a firstterm republican governor , sampled the curried tuna puffs and gave her speech , ms kincaid recalled , even the woman who cleans ms kincaid s house decided to give money although some liberal democrats dismiss them as palinbots for their reflexive devotion , these women are as dedicated to ms palin as the women senator hillary rodham clinton , democrat of new york , called her sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits were to their very different version of the modern female politician these are women who dip in and out of the work force , believe in prayer and spend their days trying to keep the crayon off the walls they feel they have been looked down on by clinton feminists and ignored by the power structure in the the fact that ms palin has five children , including trig , a newborn with down syndrome , only makes her that much more part of the sisterhood i'm not that into politics , said delores field , an alaska inupiat from eagle river , near anchorage , who does not consider herself a democrat or a republican i'm just going to vote for trig van palin s mom this segment of ms palin s supporters are not the women of phyllis schlafly s deeply conservative generation of republican women , nor are they the polished women who might have enjoyed lunch with the first lady , laura bush , in her texas days like many women in the valley where ms palin comes from , her appeal here , and in recent days across the country , is more about who she is that is , a devout christian with a husband who supports her career , but a person who is not afraid to show up in public with a baby on her hip she did n't create this , but she showed up at the right time , said darla shine , whose happy housewife club franchise includes a talk radio show , a book and a web site that receives millions of hits a month she represents a huge pocket of women who have been the ignored community for so long although strong opposition to abortion and an evangelical approach to christianity are often shared traits among the palin women , they do not necessarily walk lock step with republican politics , said serrin m foster , president of feminists for life , a lobbying group with 28 , 000 members , including ms palin some of the group s members are vegans who might not appreciate ms palin s penchant for hunting moose others might consider themselves moderates who could vote for either party there is a spectrum within the prolife movement , ms foster said , and sarah is proof that you can be prolife and prowoman rick mystrom , a republican who was the mayor of anchorage when ms palin was wasilla s mayor , said other women in alaska who are politicians , like senator lisa murkowski , also a republican , are seen differently , as part of the alaska political machine \( ms murkowski supports abortion rights \) sarah s appeal , mr mystrom said , is that she is everywoman and she became what every woman thinks she can become ms palin s evangelical christian beliefs were an asset in this conservative state , and they also helped propel her to the republican ticket as senator john mccain s running mate she is part of a generation of christian women who began serving on school boards and small governmental bodies in the 1990s , and often look out for one another when she bucked her party and then ran against the republican governor in 2006 , she did not get much support from the traditional channels so republican women s clubs around the state came through by raising tens of thousands of dollars for her campaign ms palin s political career has grown along with her church , which began with a few families and recently moved to a new building that seats 400 and hosts three services on sunday steve menard , a member of the church who is running for wasilla mayor next month , said that although the church helped ms palin s rise , a political climate ready for someone like her was helping her national profile you needed the right candidate at the right time , mr menard said , to open doors for working women who share a set of values her ability to mix church , family and politics is part of the draw through connections with other longtime family friends , including political allies and members of her church , she was able to raise the sales tax in wasilla as a way to help finance a 15 million sports complex that featured a new hockey rink for her son track to play on this summer , several christian groups came together for a day of prayer at the arena ms palin was there with her infant trig in her arms and a daughter , piper , nearby some of ms palin s critics say that her popularity , to a degree , is superficial mike doogan , who for 14 years was a columnist with the anchorage daily news before he became a democratic state legislator , said he understood her appeal to a certain type of female voter but mr doogan said her image was carefully cultivated to do just that there is no more unlikely hockey mom on this planet , he said they are usually not this politically ambitious or cutthroat anne kilkenny , who said she voted for ms palin in city elections , said she became disillusioned with her after participating in wasilla city government and seeing ms palin up close you 've got to remember , ms kilkenny said , we are not much bigger than a high school and she is the homecoming queen none of that matters for the women who see ms palin s rise as their rise sarah palin is a different kind of feminist , said joy ng , who lives in kodiak with her husband of 35 years she is a strong woman who can wear a skirt and be proud of it
los angeles regardless of how the remainder of this national league championship series plays out , philadelphia manager charlie manuel and outfielder shane victorino will not miss any games to attend the funerals of family members who died friday general manager pat gillick said their respective families had coordinated the arrangements for manuel s mother , june manuel , and victorino s grandmother , irene victorino , so they would not interfere with the ' quest for a world series berth they lead the , two games to none , heading into game 3 on sunday night gillick said manuel would fly to roanoke , va , on wednesday night , after a possible game 5 , on a private plane furnished by the organization , to attend a viewing thursday evening and services friday morning in his hometown , buena vista , va manuel will return to philadelphia in time for a potential game 6 on friday night he told me coming out that his mom would want him to be here , gillick said saturday afternoon in the visiting dugout of dodger stadium but i think naturally , when you 're going back to the hotel , your thoughts have to be focused you have to certainly think about it but when he s here , in his office , on the bench and making decisions on the field , he s all baseball manuel has not spoken with reporters since learning of his mother s death friday afternoon june manuel had been admitted tuesday to roanoke memorial hospital according to gillick , she had what was deemed a successful angioplasty thursday before her condition deteriorated victorino sobbed for a while after his father , mike , told him of his grandmother s death following friday s game , and has vowed to attend his grandmother s funeral in his native hawaii he said saturday that arrangements had yet to be made a few teammates said that he was quieter than usual on the crosscountry flight , but that he playfully interrupted an interview with his teammate jayson werth and , at least on the outside , appeared to be in better spirits he seems like he s doing ok , werth said he s the same disaster he s a lot quieter today , ca n't you tell \? implicit in the dodgers' challenge in preventing the phillies from needing their excellent closer , brad lidge , is their desire to use theirs , jonathan broxton he was brilliant while pitching in each of the dodgers' three openinground victories against the cubs , but has yet to throw a pitch in the nlcs broxton , elevated to closer after takashi saito s elbow problems and earlier struggles , did not allow a hit while recording five strikeouts in three and onethird scoreless innings against the cubs our goal is to get broxton in each and every game the rest of the season if we can , catcher russell martin said manny ram rez once again was in a bubbly mood , joking with reporters and wondering aloud whether his dynamic postseason 444 in five games with 3 homers and 7 runs batted in would help him collect a sixyear freeagent contract this offseason he played coy when asked to list possible destinations , though he noted that his ideal home ballpark would have dimensions similar to those at los angeles memorial coliseum , where the leftfield foul pole stands 201 feet from home plate jayson werth , asked whether the phillies were in danger of being overconfident , did not answer the question he merely held up a foldedover page from the sports section in saturday s edition of the los angeles times and pointed to a headline that read , werth says it s too early to celebrate do you want my quotes from yesterday \? said werth , laughing
nobody s been right all the time on iraq , but senator john mccain has been less wrong than most he knew a bungled war when he saw one and pressed early for increased force levels he backed the injection last year of some 30 , 000 troops , a surge that has produced results modest results , yes , and violence has blipped upward again this month , and , yes , iraqi political progress is slow but progress is always slow when a population terrorized over decades is freed violent attacks were down 60 percent in december from their 2007 high and refugees have begun to go home a trickle homeward , yes , a speck in the ocean of 22 million iraqis forced into exile , but tens of thousands of people do n't return unless they see hope that s why more than 4 million afghans have gone home since the taliban s fall yes , i know , the myriad iraqi dead wo n't return mccain was politically dead six months ago , his campaign undone by his backing of president bush s iraq policy his remarkable resurgence , which has put him in the lead among republican candidates , according to recent polls , is one measure of the iraq shift that shift has unsettled the political ground with iraq looking less hopeless , mccain has scored points for being consistent and forthright on the war a quality shared only by barack obama \( in his opposition to it \) among leading candidates at the same time , an economy getting a subprime pummeling has nudged iraq from the center of americans' concerns the victory of mccain s rival mitt romney in the michigan primary came in a state craving quick fixes for 74 percent unemployment mccain did n't offer that so , three states have chosen distinct republican candidates , with a social conservative , mike huckabee , triumphing in iowa mccain taking new hampshire with independent support and romney using his ceo image to win michigan bush s party is split god , heroic nation and wall street are out of sync it s been widely assumed that the democratic party s shootitselfinthefoot capacity , evident in 2004 , would have to hit overdrive to wrest defeat from victory this year these republican splits comfort the notion of inevitable democratic triumph but , as norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute noted , there s no doubt that the one republican candidate that leaves most democrats quaking is mccain they 're uneasy about the breadth of his appeal mccain s attractiveness to independents , between 10 percent and 30 percent of the vote nationally , involves policy and personality his readiness to take on global warming , back immigration and demand legal representation for war on terror detainees give him centrist appeal at the price of opposition within his party but mccain does not win the wavering as policy wonk he s flesh and blood the straighttalking survivor of more than five years of vietnamese imprisonment is at home in his own skin in a way bush will never be mccain has a temper but no need to be macho to convince he walks without his arms clenched none of this would matter if mccain s support of the iraq war had condemned him but it now appears that is not the case in new hampshire , where independents were an important factor , mccain s support was broad he tends to defy categorization but he s categorical in his opposition to tyranny saddam hussein , as nick cohen , a british author , observes in his important book on liberal hypocrisy in iraq called what s left \? , represented not a tinpot dictator but real fascism , complete with a messianic oneparty state and armies that swept out in unprovoked wars and secret policemen who organized the gassing of impure' races this deathandgenocide machine killed about 400 , 000 iraqis in internal persecutions and another million or so people in iran and kuwait when you 've been imprisoned , as mccain has , you know what terror means death of spirit , soul , life itself saddam s nightmare ended in a misbegotten , mishandled , bloody and costly war does bush s fraudulent , blunderridden rush to war matter more than the prizing of 26 million human beings from a sadistic tyrant who modeled himself on hitler and stalin \? that core question has seldom , if ever , been dignified by honest debate through all the verbal iraq wars fought on us soil i still believe iraq s freedom outweighs its terrible price so does mccain in the looming battle between the baptist minister , the corporate whiz and the war hero and perhaps mr 9 11 to unite the frayed strands of republicanism , mccain now has a fighting chance if he s nominated , some lines would be blurred in the white house fight mccain s not my choice for president he s too conservative across a range of social questions , and his temperament and age raise concerns but he s too honorable to dismiss at a moment so critical to us standing in the world blog
beijing it should come as no surprise that the chinese , centralizers by tradition , have given us a centralized olympics , which is another way of saying that they have given us a sports fan s theme park the television viewer in asia or elsewhere may not realize that the spectacular release move the chinese gymnast li xiaopeng performed on the horizontal bar occurred less than 200 yards from the pool where michael phelps was about to touch the wall and obliterate all together now , no dubbing allowed another world record nine competition sites and most of the games' bigticket items are within quick walking or striking distance of one another at the epicenter of these games , which is much longer on new crosswalks and fresh landscaping than party ambience it is a sprawling area that stretches south to north in the green shape of depending on your sociopolitical perspective either an upright pingpong paddle or a protest sign inside its wellprotected borders \( a creamcolored military tank was on site this week \) , there is more than enough to keep any olympicminded soul diverted from morning to midnight off i went on tuesday my parents , concerned about my future employability , were relieved when the eventual choice was sportswriting because it is that rare profession where you can rise consistently late and still have a profession translation 10 am at the water cube feels to me the way 5 am on the cellphone must feel to a fund manager but the matinal hour imposed by nbc s quest for ratings is not bothering phelps any as he eventually dives back into his element , entering the water as smoothly and eagerly as an otter who had just dodged a fox phelps , impervious to pain and the opposition s years of sacrifice , swims the 200meter freestyle nearly one second faster than even he has swum it before , which seems , at this numbercrushing stage , like the most normal thing in the world as for the mortals , the swimmers who merely win two or three gold medals at the planet s biggest sporting event , the most interesting is leisel jones , the oncetormented australian prodigy who is all grown up and who finally wins an individual gold medal in the 100 breaststroke , in her third olympics even more remarkable , she does break her own world record deadline over , i walk into the heat and across the street to the national indoor stadium , where i arrive too late to see li or anybody else on the horizontal bar , but not too late to miss li holding court in the upper reaches of the arena for a phalanx of television crews , his gold medal from the team competition around his neck for me , it is like walking in at the tail end of a frat party , with the detritus of the evening scattered across the floor but at least there is still meaningful conversation about down the stairs in the mixed zone the sweaty , serpentine place where athletes meet the extended digital voice recorders of journalists the american gymnast raj bhavsar is talking into a cluster of the devices as their owners nod rhythmically bhavsar is a pocketsize man with biceps that look flexed even when he is at ease he has thoughts aplenty after getting a bronze medal despite coming here as an alternate every single tear shed and all the toil in life , the emotional battles it s all worth it , he said , speaking as americans often do with ease about the sentimental china s six team gold medalists , who know plenty about privation , are less communicative in the news conference that follows , but then their coach , huang yubin , answers most of the queries in their stead and gets a long ovation from the chinese press corps at one stage centralized indeed if i have learned one survival skill in 20 years of international sportswriting , it s this when it comes to lunch \( or dinner \) , follow the italians , particularly at an event sponsored by mcdonald a group of milanese scribes of my acquaintance have been coming to this hotel cafe in the main press center for the last three days , and i 've been right behind them in notso distant olympics , the press section would have been standingroomonly for a serbiacroatia men s match but there are empty seats aplenty as the former yugoslavian antagonists thrash it out in the white water of the yingdong natatorium this , after all the political turmoil of the 1990s , is just a game , although , as usual with water polo , it is tough to tell the difference between friendship and enmity with all the foul behavior happening below the choppy surface water polo referees earn their keep , but then what other referees in a team sport work the field of play \? but the play soon ends , with the croatians winning , then embracing the serbs while still treading water on the short walk from the natatorium to the olympic sports center gymnasium , i realize that , for the first time , i can actually see the sun and i do n't mean the bare outline of it through a gauzy veil of gunmetal smog for the first time since my arrival 10 days earlier , the sky is legitimately blue , the clouds are legitimately white and welldefined with the lateafternoon sunlight playing off the willows , beijing feels almost like a place one could linger for a while in the summer almost the quick nature hike over , i'm back indoors watching spain furiously trying to come back on poland in men s team the happy revelation at the olympics is that just about every sport , no matter how obscure in your personal universe , becomes a gripping spectacle once you are right there in front of it feeling the intensity and riding the learning curve team handball is no exception and why should it be \? the danes seem like reasonable people , and they love the game the spanish like and respect it , too , and even have a duke , inaki urdangarin , who married into the royal family after playing it professionally the spaniards are down by 6 when i arrive , but by the time i leave they have won , 3029 , with plenty of help from albert rocas , their small , quicksilver lefthander with a shaved head and jordanesque hang time jackson richardson , the dreadlocked frenchman who was one of the sport s greats is watching the spanish celebrate from the stands the north americans are missing something , richardson tells me with a grin on a new bridge , chinese families are taking turns posing for photographs in front of an olympic star that would be the bird s nest , the latticed national stadium , where begins on friday simultaneously massive and light , the bird s nest commands attention , even from an obstructed vantage point , as frank gehry s guggenheim does in bilbao , spain the view from here is grand , with the olympic caldron that li ning ignited in gravitydefying fashion spewing flames in the distance pipedin chinese mood music heavy on the strings and , to a western ear , the maudlin is making it difficult to have an independent thought this area is in the lower reaches of the olympic green , only recently green , which will serve as a postolympic lung for the residents of this modern zone years from now chic beijingers , like urbanites in most postmodern nations , will surely realize the value of the past and rush to renovate what is left of their alley houses and tile roofs but for now at least , the modern and its implications are king where i stroll , just east of the main arenas but still within the security perimeter , there are new pedestrian thoroughfares very much in the monumental spirit of tiananmen there are youngsters sprinting with kites , and there is so much friendly eye contact that you wonder if a directive has been issued nearby are the official pavilions of the corporate sponsors \( the olympic advertising ban only applies \) the atmosphere as you walk between arenas here is sterile compared with that of many games past , an eerie , industrialpark contrast with the color and emotion inside the arenas themselves but the mood in this sector is more animated if decidedly mercantile at the samsung pavilion , eight chinese cheerleaders with silver pompoms are dutifully doing a routine to chubby checker s version of the twist , a song that clearly could survive the cultural revolution \( or a nuclear winter \) a smoke machine on stage provides extra atmosphere , even if a smoke machine is surely the last thing that beijing needs the pompom girls and a certain vision of new china are gone , and i enter an updated version of europe s past in the confines of the national convention center , with the crowd in shadow and the spotlight on an elevated rectangular stage , two men wearing clear masks and white suits fence for the men s sabre gold medal with the referee s instructions in french en garde pret allez zhong man is from china and nicolas lopez from france , but zhong , an outsider , has a secret weapon in a sport where weapons are a necessity he has a french coach , christian bauer , and when zhong finally rips off his mask in delight as china s first gold medalist in 24 years , bauer is part of the victory scrum after a long walk through the darkness , with the distant stadium lights and intermittent roars of the crowds gradually intensifying , the reward for finally reaching my next seat is orange the dutch women s team is about to score to take a 32 lead for good over south korea in a roundrobin game , and their many orangeclad supporters are voicing their support the dutch women are prominent enough at home to have been the subject of a fine documentary film , guld \( dutch for gold \) , after their world championship in 2006 but from the look of their predominantly male fan base and from the lithe , tanned look of the predominantly blond dutch squad , one suspects that their dazzling ability to control a small ball with a stick seemingly unsuited to the purpose is only part of the explanation for their popularity past the empty field , with its targets parked on the grass in the moonlight and the crickets providing accompaniment , there is only one arena in the olympic epicenter still operating at full tilt as midnight approaches what else but \? this is the sport where matches have no time limit the sport where lleyton hewitt and marcos baghdatis finished a round at this year s australian open at 4 33 am this night session wo n't last quite so long , but james blake of the united states looks none too happy as his backhand strikes the net , allowing dominik hrbaty of slovakia to take him to a third set but i wo n't be there to see blake win wednesday is almost here , and the rewriting of the record books resumes early , or so it seems to me
\? housing housing prices are off about 10 percent from their peak , and experts expect them to drop another 20 percent or so without policy changes , several million households will default on their mortgages over the next few years roughly 14 million homeowners will owe more than their houses are worth uncertainty about mortgagebacked securities will continue to whack at the foundations of the banking system who s not to blame \? the mortgage brokers were out of control regulators were asleep home buyers thought they were entitled to corian counters and a twostory great room everybody from norwegian town elders to financial geniuses decided that house prices would always go up this was an episode of mass idiocy our economic system is based on the idea that people take responsibility for their own decisions it would be ruinous if people felt free to take horrendous risks knowing that the government would bail them out if those decisions did n't pan out nonetheless , individual responsibility is not absolute as behavioral economists demonstrate every day , human beings are powerfully and unconsciously influenced by the ideas and assumptions that float around in the social ether if the financial elites misprice risk and offer delicious loans to consumers , then many of those consumers will end up grabbing the loans , the just and the unjust alike we should at least see if there s a way we can ease the pain those people are bound to suffer besides , in case you have n't been watching the fed lately , we 're in the midst of a potentially disastrous financial crisis people worry about moral hazard issues in normal times but in times like these , they put those concerns on the back burner  that s the lesson of the japanese financial crisis people are n't going to buy houses if it seems that prices will continue their gradual fall for another several years if people who made bad decisions are allowed to stay in homes they ca n't afford , then prudent people who made good decisions will lose opportunities to move up to nicer places all that s true , but bubbles can move both ways just as housing can get overpriced during a frenzy , it can get underpriced during a panic it makes sense to try to find some circuit breakers so the housing market does n't totally collapse moreover , there are social costs to mass foreclosures people build up social capital in their neighborhoods , which they lose if forced to move out first , no bailout for the true greedheads the speculators , the flippers , the people who bought second homes they could n't afford help only those who can stay in their homes with a modest amount of aid do n't succumb to lenders who want the government to buy up their bad paper on the other hand , as douglas elmendorf of the brookings institution points out , it would be selfdefeating to crack down on the socalled irresponsible lenders so harshly that you skew their incentives to lend in the future none are wholly satisfactory on the democratic side , barack obama and chris dodd are proposing federally backed loan guarantees people in danger of defaulting could get new mortgages that reflected the new , lower value of their homes lenders would write off some value , but it would be better than nothing there are significant administrative problems with this idea , of which the sponsors are fully aware how would you make sure only the worthy qualified for the guarantees \? in a world of securitized mortgages , how do you track down the actual owners of the debt to renegotiate \? nonetheless , they think the plan would get us through the crisis john mccain s staffers are acutely aware of the problem , but are having trouble coming up with a response they think would work one idea is to use the lowincome housing tax credit to subsidize those who would otherwise default the idea is sensible , but if the housing crisis provokes a campaign bidding war , the democratic plans are bigger we do seem to have reached some bernankeera consensus in normal times , the free market works well but in a crisis like this one , few are willing to sit back and let the market find its own equilibrium
he s running wild and the season hasn t even started yet not content with breaking up with don cherry \( i m just over with him \) , sean avery is now gunning for gary bettman and nhl marketing we linked to the globe and mail story yesterday on the unsavory avery s comments about grapes , who he says is way out of touch with the game today they were taken from the cbctv show the hour \( you can watch that segment here , and it s great viewing \) now on espn s e 60 he tells rachel nichols in a segment that will air tuesday , it would certainly be good for the game if we marketed the game , but the nhl does a terrible job of marketing they just , they haven t figured it out that villains and heroes are what sells our commissioner hasn t realized that he needs to probably do a better job of marketing the game and certainly some of the players in it but i don t think that s ever going to change unless they hire me to run their marketing stuff not a bad idea , but he d have to take a substantial pay cut men s vogue or some fashionista would certainly pay him more so you have to wonder stars gm brett hull said on tsn a few weeks ago that he told avery , as long as you don t embarrass the organization , you can do , say , act any way you want will someone in the nhl phone brett and advise him to have avery zip it \? if so , what will brett do \? maybe he thinks sean is right seems to us that hockey is a little more than merely heroes and villains and one fan s hero is another fan s villain anyway even the game s agitators , the sean averys , have fans at least in the city where they plays their home games so it s hard to design a marketing campaign around that the good guy bad guy approach works better in pro wrestling and electoral politics but if the nhl wants to focus on building identifiable personalities among the game s players , to get fans to watch for specific players rather than for teams as it says it does then who is a more identifiable character than the unsavory avery \? one of those new tv spots with avery in the still picture waving his hands in marty brodeur s face \? whadd ya think \? the euro plan the nhl and nhlpa remain committed to a continuing presence in europe through preseason and regularseason games both nhl commissioner gary bettman and nhlpa executive director paul kelly spoke about that during a news conference in prague yesterday , ahead of the rangers opening games there against the lightning the penguins and the senators also play two games this weekend in stockholm to open their season last year , the kings and the ducks opened with a pair of games in london these games will hopefully usher in an era of a more permanent presence for the league , and by permanent presence i don t necessarily mean putting franchises here , bettman said instead , he suggested a program where we re coming back on a regular basis to satisfy and address the interest we know is in our game here there has been talk that russian cities are interested in being part of this program , but bettman did not seem warm to the idea , an obvious reaction to the continuing friction with the khl over alexander radulov s jumped contract if you re going to do a game or a series of games like we re doing , you have to do it in an environment where everybody s working together and there s a joint cooperation , he said so i don t know that we d go to a place where we weren t comfortable kelly did not oppose the russian option as quickly i don t think we would reject those cities simply because they happen to be in russia or connected to the khl , kelly said in a canwest article about the news conference , peter o neil played up the possible implications of placing nhl teams in europe , which bettman and kelly also addressed restating what both the league and the pa have recently said , kelly remarked , right now , we have 30 very strong cities , some stronger than others and there may be a day i don t think it s next year , i don t think it s the next five years but there may be a day that we might include european cities to that list kelly said the players , like league execs and owners , will take a hardheaded approach toward euro expansion it is true that 50 percent of the players in the nhl are from canada , and they enjoy seeing franchises placed in canadian cities , he told a european reporter when asked whether canadian players would be uncomfortable with europe getting teams ahead of canada but kelly also characterized the players as businesspeople whose first priority is to see all teams backed by fans and local businesses they know there are some cites that , although they have great hockey traditions , they don t have the economic base to support a team , they don t have the building of a sufficient size to support a team , said kelly , obviously referring to locales like winnipeg and quebec city so we ll be seeing more of these quickies , here today , gone tomorrow , leaving tv contracts and licensed merchandise behind game 1 the rangers open the nhl season against tampa bay in prague tomorrow , and the lightning s offseason has been , of course , tumultuous new ownership \( oren koules and len barrie \) , new hockey department \( led by exnhler and former player agent brian lawton \) , a new coach \( barry melrose \) and a number of new players \( best known gary roberts , ryan malone , olie kolzig , andrej meszaros and top draft choice steven stamkos \) all made headlines and caused both puzzlement and amusement along the way how has their preseason gone \?

george w bush has only a few months left in the white house , and he seems destined to leave office with some of the lowest approval ratings in the history of the presidency but he is not pulling back on most of the controversial policies that have marked his presidency like presidential signing statements that is the disturbing practice of saying that he has the executive authority to reject parts of bills passed by congress at the same time he is signing them into law other presidents have done this , but none with anywhere near the frequency of mr bush , who has objected to more than 1 , 100 sections of laws on tuesday , he objected to parts of two more bills in one , a military authorization bill , he objected to a section that required negotiations for an agreement to make iraq share the cost of american military operations in the country in another bill , he objected to sections that give internal watchdogs within federal agencies more protections against political interference mr bush s signing statements undercut the roles the constitution has set out for the three branches of government hardly the only time he has done that congress , the people s branch , gets to pass the laws with the president s signature or without it , if they override his veto president bush , however , has acted like he gets to play a role in drafting congress s legislation , picking and choosing which parts he likes it s a practice we hope will come to an end when a new president takes office next year
just when you thought it was safe to go back to the bookstore , questions are being raised about the nonfictional status of another best seller in a story in sunday s boston globe ideas section , drake bennett writes that ben mezrich s 2002 book bringing down the house a tale of whizkid gamblers from mit that was the basis for the new kevin spacey movie 21 is so heavily embellished as to verge on fantasy while the book , published by the free press , contained a disclaimer alerting readers \( in fine print , on the copyright page \) that names , places and other details had been changed and some characters were composites , bennett who interviewed 5 players from the blackjack team the book is primarily based on , along with 9 others fails to find any evidence that some of the book s most vivid scenes ever happened instead of describing events as they happened , bennett writes , mezrich appears to have worked more as a collage artist , drawing some facts from interviews , inventing certain others , and then recombining these into novel scenes that didn t happen and characters who never lived for example , jeff ma , the basis \( according to mezrich \) for the team leader , kevin lewis , says the team never strapped thousands of dollars on their bodies before boarding planes to casinos , as mezrich quotes lewis describing to him ma says he had never even heard of the technique until he read mezrich s book the scene in which a shadowy goon with narrow iceblue eyes beats up a player in a casino bathroom \? none of the dozen former players inteviewed by bennett , including the one the supposed victim was primarily based on , recall any beatings , or any blueeyed goon \( though they say they were sometimes threatened by casino personnel \) and none recall telling mezrich that the same goon once forced a player to swallow a 500 chip at gunpoint , dismissing the very idea as implausible mezrich defends himself vigorously \( if gnomically \) , saying the idea that the story is true is more important than being able to prove that it s true his editor , dominick anfuso , told bennett that any alterations to the plot were done to protect the identities of the characters , adding , i don t think you should make the plot more exciting at the expense of truthfulness , ever but according to bennett , anfuso refused to provide a definition of the standards he uses to distinguish fiction from nonfiction , and did not return followup calls as for mezrich s fellow authors , their judgments are harsh the kind of liberties mezrich seems to have taken , gay talese told the globe , are unacceptable and dishonest , adding i have little respect for people who do it it s lying , said sebastian junger , whom mezrich cites as one of his idols nonfiction is reporting the world as it is , and when you combine characters and change chronology , that s not the world as it is that s something else
london only weeks after predictions of his political demise were making headlines , prime minister bounced back with a byelection victory that had british political commentators revising forecasts on friday of how the governing labor party might fare in the next general election the labor candidate in the scottish constituency of glenrothes won the seat by a margin of more than 6 , 000 votes , defeating a challenge by the scottish national party the nationalists , with a program calling for scotland s independence , had been on a long winning streak and were predicting victory in the byelection right up to the voting on thursday local factors played a strong role , prompting caution in extrapolating wider lessons for labor s prospects in a general election that might be held as late as june 2010 the glenrothes constituency , in a former coalmining area , borders mr brown s district of kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath , and mr brown , a scot who is a strong advocate of scotland s remaining part of , broke with past practice of prime ministers by campaigning personally but the most powerful factor for labor appeared to have been mr brown s steadying role in the economic crisis sweeping britain the 57yearold prime minister , who was finance minister for 10 years until stepping up to the top job 17 months ago , has been widely credited in recent weeks for taking steps to stabilize britain s banks that have influenced similar measures in europe and the united states winning the byelection easily , after four successive byelection defeats since mr brown became prime minister , buoyed labor officials , who had already been scenting a wider upturn in the party s fortunes after senator barack obama s victory on tuesday in the united states presidential race senior officials of the brown government have spoken of a shared progressive agenda with mr obama on a wide range of issues and suggested that senator john mccain s defeat could have implications for conservative politics in britain labor s hopes of defeating the conservatives in a general election , which mr brown can call at a time of his choosing , have also been raised by recent national opinion polls after months of trailing the conservatives by margins of 20 percentage points and more , labor has seen its deficit in polls halved as the economic crisis has worsened mr brown lost no time in proclaiming the glenrothes result a vote of confidence in his government s handling of the banking crisis what i have learned from this election is that people are prepared to support governments that will help people through the downturn and offer real help to people , a smiling but restrained mr brown said friday but mr brown dismissed suggestions that he might call national elections as early as this spring many in his party say they do not expect a vote before the fall of 2009 and perhaps as late as the spring of 2010 the prime minister visited the glenrothes constituency three times during the byelection campaign , and his wife , sarah , a mother of two young children who has only recently taken an active political role , campaigned there aggressively , turning the vote into something of a personal referendum the labor candidate in glenrothes , lindsay roy , 59 , who is the headmaster of the secondary school in the town of kirkcaldy that mr brown attended as a boy , won 19 , 946 votes , against 13 , 209 votes for the scottish nationalist candidate , peter grant as expected , the conservatives and the liberal democrats , the two major political parties that will face labor in a general election but that have scant support in economically depressed areas of scotland , finished distant runnersup alex salmond , the nationalists' leader , is a former economist whose claims that scotland could prosper as an independent country were undercut , at least in the short run , when scotland s two main banks , the royal bank of scotland and the halifax bank of scotland , turned to the brown government s to survive some british newspapers were quick to interpret the glenrothes result as a major boost for mr brown against the odds , brown bounce is back , a headline in the times of london declared six weeks ago there were huge questions over whether he would lead labor into the next election now there are none , a political analyst for the paper , philip webster , wrote but other commentators have warned that the brown bounce , as british tabloids have called it , could be brief the brown government itself has warned that the recession in britain could be deep and prolonged , and a range of financial institutions , including the international monetary fund , have warned that britain , after an explosion of government deficits and consumer debt during labor s years in power , is headed for a deeper downturn than other leading industrial countries
cincinnati it s recently been announced that the mount , edith wharton s home in lenox , mass , faces foreclosure , unless as much as 3 million can be raised before april 24 this loss would be terrible for fans of american literature , not merely because wharton is one of our most enduring novelists and we would lose a valuable window into her life and work , the place where she finished writing house of mirth and was inspired to write ethan frome we would also lose access to the grand 35room white classicalrevival house , surrounded by three acres of gardens , as beautiful and inspired a creation as wharton s fiction , which is saying something just as significant , foreclosure on the mount would send a clear signal to the scholars and readers who depend on the houses of other writers for research and inspiration literature and all that goes into creating it , because it is not financially viable , is not worth preserving the reasons for the foreclosure are depressingly familiar to those who operate , sustain and care about historical homes unmet fundraising goals , heavy debts and , in the case of the mount , a 25 million loan used to buy wharton s 2 , 600volume library from a british book collector but sometimes familiar problems call for unfamiliar solutions that s why it is not enough to merely send a donation to the save the mount campaign citizens and public officials of new york city should buy the mount outright , to make it their own yes , the house stands in massachusetts , but for various reasons i believe it is up to new yorkers to save it first , edith wharton is a new york writer , not a new england one her greatest novels , the age of innocence and the house of mirth , are set in new york city , and have contributed mightily to our understanding of manhattan in the gilded age it is almost impossible to separate our sense of turnofthelastcentury new york from wharton s depictions of it nor should we want to new york is a great place , but greater yet for having inspired wharton s novels her most famous new england novel , ethan frome , is also powerful and influential , but maybe unfortunately so before that book was written , rural northern new englanders were known for their optimism and volubility after ethan frome , they came to be thought of as doomed , taciturn mopes indeed , i assume new englanders would gladly allow new york to buy the mount , in the hope that the veil of ethan frome would be lifted and they could be happygolucky once more perhaps the stress of their literary legacy is causing new englanders to take lessthanperfect care of their famous writers' homes in december , a group of teenagers in ripton , vt , vandalized one of robert frost s houses , causing thousands of dollars of damage just as the ornate mount is a reflection of its former owner s writing style , so does the simple frost farmhouse exemplify the new england austerity that came to define his poetry to have the mount imperiled so soon after the frost farmhouse was vandalized makes one wonder if something larger and more sinister is at work here \( disclosure i wrote a novel in which several writers' homes are destroyed , but i meant it to be a satire , not a blueprint \) taking control of the edith wharton house would also go a long way toward helping new yorkers reclaim from massachusetts the mantle of regional superiority as any new yorker knows , the empire state has fallen behind in most important categories the red sox have won two world series championships in the last four years , the yankees and mets none the celtics have the best record in the national basketball association , while the knicks have one of the worst the purchase would be practical , given that lenox is pretty much overrun by new yorkers who in summer flock to see the boston symphony at tanglewood , and who have long known that it s cheaper to park their bmws there than to pay for a garage in manhattan buying the mount would only make their presence more official and as owners , they 'd have a motive to spend more time at this glorious house conceived and lived in by one of our most brilliant authors new yorkers know a worthy cause when they see one edith wharton and her house , the mount , is such a worthy cause i hope that new yorkers will make that cause their own
the top of the third base dugout at wrigley field was the site of the nhlchicago blackhawks press conference today to discuss the winter classic , and the nhl and hawks did the right thing by making the proceedings available on the nhl network , xm s nhl home ice channel 204 and the blackhawks web site but after all the buildup for this presser , about 15 minutes of executives followed , providing all the obligatory thank yous in their opening statements , but none said anything of any consequence at all nothing about where the rink would be set up , nothing about ticket availability , nothing about what precautions or alternate plans might be implemented for severely inclement weather not even a word that it was too soon to say nothing gary bettman was interviewed after the prepared remarks and concluded by saying , hopefully it will snow a little , which isn t necessarily the best thing for the game conditions then came interviews with the hawks jonathan toews and patrick kane , which were nice , but a half hour into the event there was still no hard news jim devellano , representing the red wings , was interviewed next , and he was happy about playing in the cathedral of baseball and exposing the red wings brand across the united states , adding it would be a great opportunity for the league to expose itself \( there s a lot of exposing going on here \) , but still there was no news then bobby hull , stan mikita and tony esposito talked humorously about their childhood memories of playing outdoors , especially about their warm underwear , and bobby recalled sitting in the wrigley bleachers , passing the flask and watching the bears beat the giants for the 1963 nfl championship we watched that game on tv and it was indeed very cold still , no news in the final minutes of the telecast , the nhl network showed a very good video compilation of last year s winter classic it was the best part of their hourlong show and a longer version of that game followed the end of the broadcast portion of the press conference any news , though \? nope , nothing , nada , zip , zero it was nice to see all those hockey faces in an empty ballpark , however a perfect opportunity missed to announce something other than what has already been announced if you were a member of the media , you would have gotten a press release in your email inbox shortly after noon with lots of quotes and this final line at the very bottom ticket information and other nhl winter classic 2009 details will be released at a later date thank you putting the cart before the horse department the devils signing of fyodor fedorov raises a peculiar point the iihf suspended the international transfer of fedorov along with five others last week he had played for dinamo moscow last season in the russian superliga and two other russian clubs the season prior but now it seems apparent that fedorov had not yet signed a contract with the devils when the suspension was issued we wonder how the iihf could suspend a transfer that had not yet taken place we assume this will all be clarified once the documents from the khl and nhl have been submitted at the end of the month and reviewed for the investigation of course , knowing that fedorov s transfer was going to be reviewed didn t stop the devs or the nhl from proceeding with the signing that probably won t make alexander medvedev and the khl very pleased the numbers game the maple leafs don t retire numbers as a rule , they honor them only two leaf numbers have actually been retired one is the number 5 worn by defenseman bill barilko \( who actually wore the number in only his final season \) barilko scored the leafs stanley cupwinning overtime goal against montreal canadiens goalie gerry mcneil in game 5 of the 1951 final , a moment that resulted in one of hockey s most famous photographs , by nat turofsky \( and here s an interesting little sidebar of the story from the mcneil perspective courtesy of a dalhousie university publication \) it was the last play of barilko s career and of his life he left on a fishing trip in august and his plane went down in northern ontario it would not be found for 11 years there s lots on this most famous of maple leaf moments to be found on the web , but for those not born until after that goal , it is perhaps best immortalized in song the other retired number is 6 , worn by maple leaf irvin ace bailey , a star for toronto who , as commissioner gary bettman knows , was critically injured on dec 12 , 1933 , when upended from behind by boston s eddie shore bailey s skull cracked on the ice , nearly causing his death he survived emergency surgery and weeks of recovery , but his career was over this incident led to the first nhl allstar game \( a benefit for bailey \) and resulted in another famous photo , which is purported to be a smiling bailey greeting shore at that benefit game , but is actually a restaging of the moment a few weeks later the rest of the numbers that hang in the rafters of the air canada centre are not retired , but merely honor the players who have worn them nos 1 \( turk broda , johnny bower \) , 7 , \( king clancy , tim horton \) , 9 \( charlie conacher , ted kennedy \) , 10 \( syl apps , george armstrong \) , 21 \( borje salming \) and 27 \( frank mahovlich , darryl sittler \) there had been numerous calls to retire numbers during the harold ballard ownership era of the leafs , but he would have none of it , and the current ownership instituted the honoring method jeff klein reminds us that the leafs are adhering to british tradition of honoring players , not numbers with this practice , and only the most extraordinary circumstances would have called for the actual retirement of a number that is what their footy clubs have done had manchester united been the montreal canadiens , for example , eric cantona s number 7 would never have been worn afterward by david beckham or cristiano ronaldo and no one would ever have worn 9 after bobby charlton there s something to be said for not taking some numbers out of circulation the canadiens have retired 13 numbers under 30 \( and more could come this upcoming season , the franchise s 100th \) , and it still looks strange to our eyes when we see andrei markov wearing 79 or guillaume latendresse wearing 84 but on the other hand , since the team s tradition has long been to retire numbers , how can the habs not honor their greatest heroes by retiring their sweaters \? in any case , the leafs have announced that two more players will be honored this season wendel clark and doug gilmour and both are quite deserving , even though their exploits did not result in ending the leafs cup drought or even get them to the final they were great leaders , among the most dedicated we ve ever seen , guys who gave everything for the blue and white and their fans if they couldn t get their names on the barrel of lord stanley s mug , this is a pretty good consolation prize here s the story on the latest honorees from the maple leafs web site and from today s toronto star  a new mike for the hotstove there have been some mighty unusual trades in hockey history when he ran the springfield indians of the ahl , eddie shore felt he was being shortchanged in one exchange of players , so he insisted on a little more from the other club and he got it a goal net then there was the case of stephane beauregard , a journeyman goaltender who was traded from the winnipeg jets to the philadelphia flyers in 1992 for future considerations after playing the season for the flyers , they dealt him back to the jets for those same future considerations essentially , beauregard was traded for himself now here s another interesting deal as it ends up , tsn got the rights to the hockey theme from cbc for an analyst to be named later the transaction is complete as mike milbury goes from tsn to hockey night in canada bill houston of the globe and mail raves about milbury joining hnic and gives lots of info on his new deal and why he accepted it the cbc is happy as well , but what none of them say is that the saturday night satellite hotstove , where milbury will probably get his biggest exposure , has been rather flat in recent seasons and he ll certainly liven it up with his bombastic comments additionally , this puts him in position to succeed don cherry in the first intermission if cherry ever decides to retire not everyone is happy about the move , however blogger sean zandberg at waiting for stanley sundin imagines this is what the hockey night hotstove will look like in the fall on your tv screen impatient in vancouver blogging for the vancouver sun , brad ziemer seems impatient for mats sundin to make up his mind about the canucks maybe sundin took a close look at the recently released canuck schedule and noticed how brutal the travel is this season it would be a huge adjustment for a guy who has spent his entire career playing in the east all this puts canuck gm mike gillis in a tough spot how long does he give sundin to make up his mind \? at some point gillis may have to turn to plan b , which would likely involve trading away one of his defencemen maybe kevin bieksa for some offence from a team that is up against the salary cap if he hasn t already , gillis needs to tell sundin and his agent jp barry that the canucks very generous offer of 20 million over two years has a deadline give him until the end of the month if sundin still hasn t decided by then , the canucks need to turn the page and move on and finally , new lightning owner oren koules was profiled today in the tampa tribune by jerome r stockfisch and , aside from remarks on his informal personal dress code , he insisted there will be no meddling from the owners suite we re smart enough to know that once we give the coach the players , they re his players , koules said it s coach barry melrose s team it really is it s not a cliche remember that quote and let s hope it is so

it happened last spring the police commissioner s office and a new york city police captain tried to convince the public that a marauding band of kids had gotten out of control and terrified residents , motorists and pedestrians on a street in the bushwick section of brooklyn the cops were wrong and they must have known that they were wrong , that the picture they were creating of youngsters climbing on top of cars and blocking vehicular and pedestrian traffic was completely false the brooklyn district attorney , charles hynes , carried the canard further that had to have been deliberate , too he went on the brian lehrer radio program on wnyc and said that his office had investigated the matter had conducted what he described as an independent inquiry we had many , many interviews with local store owners and people who live in the neighborhood who are , frankly , scared to death of these kids , he said and they were not just walking on one car they were trampling on all sorts of cars it was almost as if they were inviting their arrest thirtytwo people were arrested on that bushwick street last may 21 , including young women and children they had been walking along a quiet , treelined block of putnam avenue on their way to a subway station where they had hoped to catch a train to attend a wake for a friend who had been murdered the police , who have said that the friend was a gang leader , surrounded the group and closed in the youngest person arrested was 13 all of the kids were handcuffed , cursed at and humiliated , and several spent 30 hours or more in jail to date , there has been no evidence produced no witnesses , no photographs or videotapes , no dented vehicles or broken mirrors , nothing whatsoever to indicate that any of the youngsters had done anything at all that was wrong how is it that you can have a rampage in broad daylight on a street in new york city and not be able to show in any way that the rampage occurred \? at least 22 of the 32 people arrested have had their charges dismissed or were never formally charged at all no one has been convicted of anything the case against 18yearold zezza anderson was dropped last month after his lawyer , ron kuby , filed a motion demanding that mr hynes s office produce documentary evidence of the youngsters misbehaving no evidence was produced instead , an assistant district attorney moved to have the charges against mr anderson dismissed , acknowledging that the case against the defendant could not be proved i 'd like to know why , after the better part of a year , the authorities are still tormenting some of these kids why are charges still hanging over 10 of them \? why should it take more than nine months to resolve charges of unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct \? a number of the kids have missed days at school to show up for court dates at which nothing of consequence happens asher callender , a senior at bushwick community high school , had to go to court on friday , only to have his case postponed again until march 3 these are not gangsters these are not drug dealers these are kids who were trying to go to a wake for a friend it was not the kids who were out of control , it was the criminal justice system , which ca n't seem to tell the difference between right and wrong , between the truth and deliberate lies , or between justice on the one hand and gratuitously cruel behavior by public officials on the other all the charges in this case should be dropped and police commissioner ray kelly , who apparently wants to be mayor of this city , and district attorney hynes should offer the kids a public apology the authorities have become accustomed to treating disadvantaged young people in new york city like dirt and getting away with it in this case , local school officials , community residents and the civic group make the road new york rallied to the youngsters' cause neither the police nor the district attorney expected to be confronted in any kind of sustained way over their treatment of these kids mr hynes said on the radio program none of these kids are going to be prosecuted they 're not going to go to jail we are going to offer every one of them community service what he meant was that he expected the kids to go quietly , to plead guilty and passively accept the blot on their records and what he thought of as mild punishment but the kids had a surprise for him they refused to plead guilty to something they had n't done ten of them are still paying the price for standing up for themselves
if part of the aim of free , informal outdoor concerts is to lure new listeners to a genre , the new york grand opera company s enjoyable performance of verdi s traviata on wednesday surely won a few new devotees the amplified , fully staged performance at the naumburg bandshell in central park was conducted by vincent la selva , the grand opera s indefatigable artistic director , who founded the company in 1973 a verdi specialist , mr la selva staged productions of all 28 of the composer s operas in chronological order from 1994 to 2001 this traviata , directed by roberto stivanello , was often rough around the edges , but the rawness contributed to a level of excitement and intensity often missing from bigname productions a stellar performance by the soprano marsha thompson as violetta raised the emotional temperature of the humid night it s difficult judging opera singers using microphones , but ms thompson survived the trial by amplification , revealing a warm , agile soprano and secure technique plaintive in ah , fors' lui and joyously carefree in sempre libera , ms thompson sang and acted expressively throughout the evening , poignantly conveying the torment of her conflicted heroine as alfredo germont , aaron sheya did n't match her dramatically or vocally , but he warmed up considerably as the night went on , and there were plenty of sparks between these two lovers constantinos yiannoudes sang well , portraying germont senior with paternal dignity the rest of the cast , whose singing was variable , also included lucia palmieri as the maid annina , william brooke as gastone , justin ryan as the baron and seth malkin as the doctor there were some undignified sounds from the strings in the act i and iii preludes , when intonation problems and orchestral imbalances were crudely magnified by the amplification but under mr la selva s baton the pacing never flagged , and there was plenty of seething tension in his reading glaring glitches with the microphones , particularly in the first act , added some unexpected background noises , while occasional overamplification of some of the singers meant their voices boomed like oracles over central park the sets and some of the period costumes were rather threadbare but in the end , none of that detracted from the performance , which the large and attentive crowd seemed to enjoy during the poignant final scene , as violetta lay dying , even the picnickers were almost entirely silent small children sat quietly , cyclists stopped to listen , and central park seemed to melt away as mesmerized listeners shared the grief onstage
washington where have all the 5to4 decisions gone \? and whatever happened to the kennedy court \? a year ago at this time , the had decided 13 cases by votes of 5 to 4 , out of 41 total decisions that proved to be an accurate snapshot of a highly polarized term by the time the court wrapped up its work five weeks later , a third of the cases the highest proportion in years had been decided by margins of a single vote but so far this term , with 35 cases decided with full opinions , there has been only a single 5to4 decision it came in a lowvisibility statutory case , not in a hotbutton constitutional one and the justices did not break along the ideological divisions that shaped the last term justice , who was in the majority in all 24 of last term s 5to4 decisions , voted in dissent justice kennedy s dominance last term was so complete that , of 68 decisions , he cast only two dissenting votes he has already dissented five times this term so have justices samuel a alito jr , stephen g breyer and john paul stevens in other words , no longer the essential justice , anthony kennedy now looks like just one of the pack something is happening , clearly the question is what the caveats against drawing any hard conclusions at this stage are obvious for one thing , the term is functionally only half over , with 35 cases down and 32 to come and it is common for the hardestfought decisions to come at the very end the district of columbia gun control case , the latest case on the rights of the guant namo detainees and a case on whether the death penalty is a constitutional punishment for raping a child are yet to be decided still , there is a clear pattern in the cases the court has already decided this term the court upheld kentucky s method of execution by lethal injection by a vote of 7 to 2 it upheld indiana s law requiring photo identification at the polls by a vote of 6 to 3 the justices voted 7 to 2 on monday to uphold the latest federal effort to curb trade in  all were major cases , all plausible candidates for 5to4 outcomes all were government victories , hardly surprising coming from a conservative court but even justice john paul stevens , the leader of the court s beleaguered liberal bloc , voted with the majority in all three cases the surprise was that the government side won each so handily it would be too simplistic an explanation to say that the liberal justices , at least some of them , have simply given up something deeper seems to be at work each of those three cases might have received a harderedged , more conclusively conservative treatment at the hands of the same fivemember majority that controlled the last term instead , the lethal injection and voter id decisions hewed closely to the facts of each case kentucky s lethal injection protocol passed muster , but the court left open the possibility that another state s practice might not the voter id challenge reached the court on a nonexistent record , so perhaps a stronger case could be made at a later time justice antonin scalia s majority opinion in the child pornography case construed the statute so narrowly as to allay the first amendment concerns of justices stevens and breyer and win their full concurrence so perhaps there was a bit of movement on both sides not simple liberal capitulation , but liberals using their limited leverage to exact some modest concessions as the price of helping the conservatives avoid another parade of 5to4 decisions with the conservative bloc so clearly in control , what leverage could the liberals possibly have \? recall the pledge that chief justice made , both in his 2005 confirmation hearing and in the early months of his tenure , to seek consensus and to lead the court in speaking in a modest judicial voice that was not how the last term looked , as the majority took aim at precedents and appeared to have in mind an agenda much more ambitious than simply calling balls and strikes indeed , much of the commentary on the court s performance during the last term was harsh , and it came not only from liberals judge richard a posner , the conservative icon who sits on the federal appeals court in chicago , offers some pointed and unusually personal criticism of chief justice roberts in his new book , how judges think , published this year by harvard university press the chief justice s selfdescription during his confirmation hearing as a simple baseball umpire might have been a tactical error for one who evidently aspires to remake significant areas of constitutional law , judge posner writes , adding the tension between what he said at his confirmation hearing and what he is doing as a justice is a blow to roberts s reputation for candor and a further debasement of the already debased currency of the testimony of nominees at judicial confirmation hearings such words from richard posner would cause any member of the court , let alone a relatively new and young chief justice who undoubtedly admires him , to swallow hard the court s modulated tone may also stem from the fact that this is an election year lee epstein , a political scientist and law professor at northwestern university , said that political scientists had long observed an election effect on the court that results in more consensus and fewer 5to4 decisions during an election year than in the preceding term of course , lots of things could explain this , but the pattern is pretty interesting , ms epstein said in an email exchange , adding that the justices probably do n't want to provoke controversy , or become an issue , during the election especially an election with a highly uncertain outcome perhaps the conservative justices were taken aback by the public response to the lilly ledbetter case , a 5to4 decision in an employment discrimination case last term that placed a tight time limit on an employee s ability to file a pay discrimination claim the decision led to congressional hearings during which the court was denounced as out of touch with the reality of women s working lives a bill to overturn the decision failed in the senate , but came close whether as a direct result , the court adopted a notably different tone in an employment discrimination case decided in february the court voted 7 to 2 to excuse an employee s failure to file the proper form to initiate an age discrimination case with only justices scalia and clarence thomas dissenting , that case , federal express corp v holowecki , produced one of the term s few liberal victories another closely watched employment discrimination case ended , surprisingly , with a unanimous decision that avoided drawing the clear line that the two sides were arguing over none of this is to suggest that whatever strategic decisions the justices are making are being made collectively the court is by its nature an atomistic institution , its actions the aggregation of determinedly individual decisions but if any one individual is smiling , it is no doubt chief justice roberts by this time last year , he had cast seven dissenting votes so far this term , he has dissented only once

inviting me it s been a little while since i 've had the honor of addressing you , and i appreciate very much your courtesy to me today you know , we should do this more often \( laughter , cheers , applause \) i hope you 'll pardon my absence last year and understand that i intended no personal insult to any of you i was merely preoccupied with the business of trying to escape the distinction of preseason front runner for the republican nomination , which i'm sure some of you observed i managed to do in fairly short order \( laughter , scattered applause \) but now i again have the privilege of that distinction , and this time i would prefer to hold on to it for a little while \( cheers , applause \) and i say i know that you were addressed earlier by a great governor , governor romney , and i had \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) and i say \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) may i say may i say that i had a phone conversation with governor romney i congratulated him on running an energetic and dedicated campaign we agreed to sit down together , and we agree the importance to unite our party all of you who worked so hard in the support of the millions of people in our party who supported governor romney , i congratulate you you did a fine job and you are welcome to join my campaign , and it 'll be a campaign based on conservative principles in a consequential election about the country s future i 'd also like to say a word about our friend governor huckabee , a great and fine man \( cheers , applause \) who has also i also know that he s injected from time to time some muchneeded humor in the campaign and i would like to again congratulate him as he continues to run a very strong campaign and i congratulate him on his success tuesday night my friends , i 'd be honored and deeply humbled to receive the nomination of my party as we continue moving forward in this campaign \( cheers , applause \) my friends , i know i have a responsibility , if i am , as i hope to be , the republican nominee for president , to unite the party and prepare for the great contest in november and i am acutely aware that i cannot succeed in that endeavor nor can our party prevail over the challenge we will face from either senator clinton or senator obama without the support of dedicated conservatives whose convictions , creativity and energy have been indispensable to the success of our party that it has had over the last quarter century \( cheers , applause \) many of you have disagreed strongly with some positions i have taken in recent years i understand that i might not agree with it , but i respect it for the principled position it is and it is my sincere hope that even if you believe i have occasionally erred in my reasoning as a fellow conservative , you will still allow that i have , in many ways important to all of us , maintained the record of a conservative further , i hope you will grant that i have defended many positions we share just as ardently as i have made my case for positions that have provoked your opposition if not , thank you for the opportunity to make my case today thank you \( cheers , applause \) i am proud to be a conservative , and i make that claim because i share with you the most basic of conservative principles that liberty is a right conferred by our creator , not by governments and that \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) and that the proper object of justice and the rule of law in our country is not to aggregate power to the state , but to protect the liberty and property of its citizens and like you , i understand , as edmund burke observed , that whenever a separation is made between liberty and justice , neither is safe well , i have long worked to help grow a public majority of support for republican candidates and principles i have also always believed like you in the wisdom of ronald reagan who wanted and warned in an address to this conference in 1975 he said , a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers i attended my first cpac conference as the invited guest of ronald reagan , and long after i had returned not long after i had returned from overseas , when i heard him deliver his shining city upon a hill speech i was still a naval officer then , but his words inspired and helped form my own political views , just as ronald reagan s defense of america s cause in vietnam and his evident concern for american prisoners of war in that conflict inspired and were a great comfort to those of us who , in my friend jerry denton s \( sp \) words , had the honor of serving our country under difficult circumstances i am proud , very proud to have come to public office as a foot soldier in the reagan revolution , and if a few of my positions have raised your concern that i have forgotten my political heritage , i want to assure you i have not and i am as proud of that association today as i was then \( cheers , applause \) my record in public office taken as a whole is the record of a mainstream conservative i believe today , as i believed 25 years ago , in small government , fiscal discipline , low taxes , a strong defense , judges who inform and not make our laws , the social values that are the true source of our strength , and generally the steadfast defense of our rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness which i have defended my entire career as godgiven to the born and the unborn \( cheers , applause \) these are my beliefs these are my beliefs , and you need not \( sic \) examine only my past votes and speeches to assure yourselves that they are my genuine convictions you can take added comfort from the positions i have defended during this campaign i campaigned in iowa in opposition to agriculture subsidies \( applause \) i campaigned in new hampshire against biggovernmentmandated health care and for a free market solution to the problem of unavailable and unaffordable health care \( applause \) i campaigned in michigan for the tax incentives and trade policies that will create new and better jobs in that economically troubled state i campaigned in florida i campaigned in florida against the national catastrophic insurance fund bill that passed the house of representatives \( applause \) and i defended my opposition to the prescription drug benefit bill that saddled americans with yet another hugely expensive entitlement program \( applause \) i have argued to make the bush tax cuts permanent , to reduce the corporate tax rate and abolish the amt , that threatens 25 million american families \( applause \) i have defended my position on protecting our second amendment rights , including my votes against waiting periods , bans on the socalled assault weapons , and illegitimate lawsuits against targeting gun manufacturers i have proudly defended my 24year prolife record \( cheers , applause \) throughout throughout this campaign , i have defended the president s grave decision to increase troop levels in iraq \( applause \) to execute a long overdue counterinsurgency \( cheers , applause \) a long overdue counterinsurgency that has spared us the terrible calamity of losing that war i hold these positions because i believe they were in the best interests of my party and country surely , i have held other positions that have not met with widespread agreement from conservatives i wo n't pretend otherwise , nor would you permit me to forget it \( laughs laughter \) on the issue of illegal immigration , a position which \( boos \) which \( cheers , applause \) a position which obviously still provokes the outspoken opposition of many conservatives , i stood my ground , aware that my position would imperil my campaign i respect your opposition , for i know that the vast majority of critics to the bill base their opposition in a principled defense of the rule of law while i and other republican supporters of the bill were genuine in our intention to restore control of our borders , we failed , for various and understandable reasons , to convince americans that we were i accept that and i have pledged that it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first \( cheers , applause \) to secure our borders first and only after we have achieved widespread consensus that our borders are secure would we address other aspects of the problem in a way that defends the rule of law and does not encourage another wave of illegal immigration \( applause \) my friends , all i ask of any american conservative , moderate , independent , or enlightened democrat , is to judge my record as a whole and accept that i am not in the habit of making promises to my country that i do not intend to keep \( cheers , applause \) i hope i have proven that in my life , even to my critics then vote for or against me based on that record , my qualifications to the office and the direction where i plainly state i intend to lead our country if i am so fortunate as to be the republican nominee for president , i will offer americans , in what will be a very challenging and spirited contest , a clearly conservative approach to governing i will make my case \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) i will make my case to voters , no matter what state they reside in , in the same way i will not obscure my positions from voters who i fear might not share them i will stand on my convictions , my conservative convictions , and trust in the good sense of the voters and in my confidence that conservative principles still appeal to a majority of americans republicans , independents and reagan democrats \( cheers , applause \) i know i know that you know that often elections in this country are fought within margins of small differences this one will not be we are arguing about hugely consequential things whoever the democrat nominee is , they would govern this country in a way that will , in my opinion , take this country backward to the days when government felt empowered to take from us our freedom to decide for ourselves the course and quality of our lives to substitute the muddled judgment of large and expanding federal bureaucracies for common sense and values of the american people to the timidity and wishful thinking of a time when we averted our eyes from terrible threats to our security that were so plainly gathering strength abroad it s shameful and dangerous that senate democrats are blocking an extension of surveillance powers that enable our intelligence and law enforcement to defend our country \( cheers , applause \) to defend our country against radical islamic extremists my friends , this election is going to be about big things , not small things and i intend to fight as hard as i can to ensure that our principles prevail over theirs senator clinton and senator obama want to increase the size of the federal government i intend to reduce it i will not \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) my friends , i will not sign a bill with earmarks in it , any earmarks in it \( cheers , applause \) and i can assure you senator coburn will hold me to it \( laughter \) i will fight for the lineitem veto , and i will not permit any expansion whatsoever of the entitlement programs that are bankrupting us i will not i will not on the contrary \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) on the contrary , i intend to reform those programs so that government is no longer in that habit of making promises to americans it does not have the means to keep \( applause , cheers \) senator clinton and senator obama will raise your taxes i intend to cut them i will start by making the bush tax cuts permanent \( cheers , applause \) i will cut corporate tax rates from 35 to 25 percent to keep industries and jobs in this country \( cheers , applause \) i will end the alternate minimum tax , and i wo n't let a democratic congress raise your taxes and choke the growth of our economy \( cheers , applause \) they will offer a big government solution to health care insurance coverage i intend to address the problem with free market solutions and with respect for the freedom of individuals to make important choices for themselves they will \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) they will appoint to the federal bench judges who are intent on achieving political changes that the american people cannot be convinced to accept through the election of their representatives i intend to nominate judges who have proven themselves worthy of our trust , that they take as their sole responsibility the enforcement of laws made by the people s elected representatives \( cheers , applause \) judges judges of the character and quality of justices roberts and alito , justices who can be relied upon to respect the values of the peoples whose rights , laws and property they are sworn to defend \( cheers , applause \) senator senator clinton and senator obama will withdraw our forces from iraq based on an arbitrary timetable designed for the sake of political expediency and which recklessly ignores the profound human calamity and dire threats to our security that would ensue \( cheers , applause \) i i intend to win the war and trust in the proven judgment of our commanders there , and the courage and selflessness of the americans they have the honor to command \( cheers , applause \) my friends , we share the grief over the terrible losses we 've suffered in the prosecution of this war there is no other candidate for this office who appreciates more than i do just how awful war is but i know that the cost in lives and treasure we would incur , should we fail in iraq , will be far greater than the heartbreaking losses we have suffered to date , and i will not allow that to happen \( cheers , applause \) audience members \( chanting \) john mccain ! john mccain ! john mccain ! john mccain ! john mccain ! john mccain ! john mccain ! john mccain ! sen mccain those senators wo n't recognize and seriously address the threat posed by an iran with nuclear ambitions to our ally israel in the region i intend \( applause \) i intend to make unmistakably clear to iran we will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the state of israel as its fondest wish and pledges undying enmity to the united states to possess the weapons to advance their malevolent ambitions \( applause \) senator clinton and senator obama will concede to our critics that our own actions to defend against its threats are responsible for fomenting the terrible evil of radical islamic extremism , and the resolve to combat it will be as flawed as their judgment i intend audience member hear , hear ! sen mccain i intend to defeat the threat by staying on offense and by marshalling every relevant agency of our government and our allies in the urgent necessity of defending the values , virtues and security of free people against those who despise all that is good about us those are but a few of the differences that will define this election they are very significant differences , and i promise you i intend to contest these issues on conservative grounds and fight as hard as i can to defend the principles and positions we share and to keep this country safe , proud , prosperous and free \( cheers , applause \) we have had a few disagreements , and none of us will pretend that we wo n't continue to have a few but even in disagreement , especially in disagreement , i will seek the counsel of my fellow conservatives if i am convinced my judgment is in error , i will correct it and if i stand by my position even after benefit of your counsel , i hope you will not lose sight of the far more numerous occasions when we are in accord i began my comments today to you by assuring you that we share a conception of liberty that is the bedrock of our beliefs as conservatives as you know , i was deprived of liberty for a time in my life and while my love of liberty is no greater than yours , you can be confident that mine is the equal of any american s it is a deep and unwavering love my life experiences and service to our country inform my political judgments they are at the core my convictions i am prolife and an advocate for the rights of man everywhere in the world because of them , because i know that to be denied liberty is an offense to nature and nature s creator i will never waver in that conviction i promise you i know in this country our liberty will not be seized in a political revolution or by a totalitarian government , but rather as burke warned it can be nibbled away for expedience and by parts i am alert to that risk and will defend against it and take comfort from the knowledge that i will be encouraged in that defense by my fellow conservatives you 've heard me say before that for all my reputation as a maverick , i have only found true happiness in serving a cause greater than my selfinterest for me that cause has always been our country and the ideals that have made us great i have been a her imperfect servant for many years , and i 've made many mistakes you can attest to that , but need not , but need not \( laughter \)

augusta , ga some unexpectedly familiar figures emerged atop the firstround fray at the on thursday and in perhaps the biggest surprise in a day filled with many none was you know who the litany of golfers shooting underpar rounds included justin rose , the englishman who , for the third time in four masters appearances , has part of the firstround lead he shot fourunderpar 68 zach johnson , the defending champion , shot 70 the 1998 champion mark o'meara , 51 , toddled in with a 71 even sandy lyle , the 50yearold scot who won the masters in 1988 and never won again in the united states , was three under through 14 holes before bogeying three of the last four to finish at 72 from the time a morning fog lifted until the final group staggered off the course under cover of darkness , it was clear something strange was afoot in the 72nd masters polite applause replaced raucous roars as expectations of a strong opening performance by the pretournament favorite cooled , and the day s most explosive cheer went to ian poulter for his spectacular hole in one at the 16th hole tied for the lead with rose at 68 was trevor immelman of south africa the englishman lee westwood made the final putt of the day to head a group at 69 that included brian bateman and brandt snedeker poulter finished at 70 along with robert karlsson , stephen ames , jim furyk and johnson a large group at 71 with o'meara included phil mickelson , heath slocum , peter lonard , arron oberholser , retief goosen and jeev milkha singh woods , 32 , who hopes to make this masters the first step in his quest for the grand slam , needed a chipin eagle at the 15th hole to salvage a 72 it might not have been the start he was hoping for , but he was upbeat afterward i hit a lot of good putts , nothing really went , said woods , whose eagle at no 15 offset consecutive bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes i just had to stay patient out there , and i ended up ok , even par even par was ok for a tie for 19th , which is a difficult but hardly impossible spot for woods he recently demonstrated that when he climbed out of a tie for 20th into a tie for the lead in the third round of last month s arnold palmer invitational , which he went on to win in dramatic fashion the next day i kept myself in the tournament , i'm right there , woods said with the weather supposed to be getting more difficult as the week goes on , i'm right there no one is prepared to argue with that assessment , but there are those who will do their best to contradict it with their golf clubs rose , 27 , is one who may finally have the maturity to challenge woods rose is the former boy wonder of british golf who 10 years ago stunned the sport with his tie for fourth at the british open at royal birkdale last year , he won the european order of merit rose , the player who opened the 2004 masters with the lead only to finish tied for 22nd , and who finished tied for fifth last year after holding the lead , is more polished now the score i churned out today was a lot more through course management , strategy , experience rather than just hitting great shots , you know , which it may have been in 2004 , he said i just went out there and played great golf and obviously scored well , whereas today , i probably just managed my game better to shoot the same score , or to shoot to sort of get up there at the top of the leader board rose ripped through one of the toughest parts of a golf course that played to a stroke average of 7480 , birdieing the sixth through the ninth holes his was one of only four birdies at the seventh hole he hit a 7iron to five feet at no 6 , a 6iron to 15 feet at no 7 , twoputted the parfive eighth hole from 45 feet and hit a 9iron to 20feet at the parfour ninth hole those birdies offset bogeys at the first and fourth holes he birdied twothirds of amen corner , adding two more at the 12th and 13th holes hopefully i'm more of a consistent player , rose said i think that s what last year proved to me my consistency was great all year , and last year i turned into more of a four round player he added i had a lot of top finishes , and you can only do that by putting four good rounds together i 've learned that you ca n't count your chickens too early to torture another american clich , he might also have learned that the early bird gets the worm two weeks ago rose came here with immelman and poulter to check out augusta national he learned enough during the visit to give him the confidence earlier this week to practice only his wedge game and putting during one practice round whether all of this will matter once the heat is turned up in the next few days will soon be determined for now , the third time for justin rose is charming , but a very large shadow is sitting just four strokes behind he , too , has a goal in mind this week
for the last two weeks , democrats have not settled on a singular approach for how to deal with gov sarah palin s sudden entry into the presidential campaign several strategies have been discussed and debated , but perhaps none have been as original as the observations offered by lt gov patty judge of iowa sarah knows how to fielddress a moose i know how to castrate a calf , ms judge , a farmer and former state agricultural secretary , told an audience in iowa the other day neither of those things has anything at all to do with this election but since we know so much about sarah s special skills , i wanted to make sure you knew about mine , too senator john mccain of arizona , and ms palin , of alaska , are headed thursday to iowa for the first joint appearance in the state by the republican ticket it is a safe bet that ms judge will not be on the welcoming committee jeff zeleny
peshawar , five people were killed and three were wounded when a united states predator drone fired missiles into a house in the restive south waziristan tribal region , local residents said wednesday the attack came as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , adm , met with pakistan s army chief , gen ashfaq parvez kayani , and prime minister in an effort to ease tensions over an american incursion into the tribal areas and a rising number of drone strikes residents of the village of baghar cheena , who took the wounded to a hospital in the regional center of wana , said drones had fired four missiles two hit a house , and two others landed in the mountains , they said the attack occurred in the evening , as the villagers were breaking the fast , they said local militants immediately cordoned off the area , and retrieved and moved the bodies to an undisclosed location local residents said none of the wounded were from the area , but came from the punjab a senior security official confirmed the missile attack but said that the identities of those killed were yet to be established a pakistani military spokesman , who identified himself as major murad , said an investigation was under way an intelligence source said the attack took place around 7 pm local time , less than three miles from the afghan border it killed 13 militants , mostly from punjab , and wounded at least 9 , the source said in his account , five missiles were fired , two of them hitting a compound and the rest falling in the nearby mountains the target may have been a group of militants based in wana who seemed poised to cross into afghanistan for an attack against nato forces , the official said thousands of wazirs from the area vowed during a meeting on wednesday to raise a volunteer army to make incursions into afghanistan against nato forces if the americans again carried out a raid inside pakistan , local residents said
my apologies , folks when i posted here two weeks ago about the television series v and its literary sequel v the second generation , i shouldn t have been so flippant about the dangers posed to our planet by a race of lizardlike aliens who are able to disguise themselves as humans apparently , the danger is much more tangible than i thought according to author david icke , whose books \( including the biggest secret and children of the matrix \) and dvds \( including the reptilian agenda and secret space \) have made him something of a sensation in his native britain , the horrifying scenario envisioned by kenneth johnson and his v colleagues has already come to pass icke , a former professional footballer and spokesman for britain s green party , argues that the earth has been secretly colonized by a race of reptilian extraterrestrials , able to pass themselves off as humans and mate with homo sapiens , that has infiltrated the highest levels of the us and uk governments , as well as the british royal family , and organized such cataclysmic events as the death of princess diana and the 9 11 attacks meanwhile , the rest of us have been conditioned to ignore this conspiracy by the aliens use of superior technology and their manipulation of the mass media \( if none of this is true , ask yourselves why have i been playing so much guitar hero iii lately \? \) but not everyone is in on the scheme this past tuesday , icke was invited to expound upon his ideas at the oxford union , the prestigious debating society of oxford university no word yet from icke on how he felt about following the evening s previous guest speaker , vogue editorinchief anna wintour
baghdad ayman , bleeding profusely from his arm , was rushed to company b s stronghold in sadr city late sunday afternoon a bullet had carved a bloody groove near his left elbow as he was going to fetch some bread from a market seven children had been struck by a burst of gunfire from militia fighters who have been roaming through the streets near the american positions , his distraught father said but ayman , 11 , was one of the lucky ones four of the children , his father said , were dead with no functioning police force and the streets a battle zone , it could not be determined if the children had been caught in crossfire or had been deliberately shot at by militia fighters , as ayman s father suggested the militias have concentrated their fire on iraqi and american forces and generally avoided shooting at civilians , whom they have sought to use as their power base but as the fighting has intensified , civilian casualties have increased sgt kevin stine , the senior medic for the company , which is part of the first battalion , 14th infantry regiment , cleaned and bandaged the boy s wound before telling the father to take him to a hospital for further treatment capt logan veath , the company commander , tried to give the boy a packet of mms , but ayman turned it down he wanted a soccer ball the medic rummaged through the stryker vehicle until he found one in a neighborhood in which gun battles are a daily occurrence , sunday was just another day a threat by the cleric to wage open war on the iraqi government unless it promised not to crack down on his followers heightened tensions but fighting has raged through this impoverished section of sadr city for almost a month at company b s headquarters , the sounds of battle were close at hand a team of heavily armored american route clearance vehicles that was searching for roadside bombs struck two on a nearby street and was then attacked by militia fighters equipped with small arms and rocketpropelled grenades none of the americans were killed or seriously wounded , but one of the vehicles had to be towed away militant fighters attacked an iraqi police station on the same street , prompting an appeal for iraqi t72 tanks two rockets whooshed as they were fired into the green zone a large mortar blast and other mysterious explosions resounded through the neighborhood company b s medics were kept busy through the day two iraqi soldiers were brought in the morning after being wounded by the backblast of one of their own rocketpropelled grenades a third was wounded by a round from an m16 , a weapon recently provided to iraqi troops an hour after the medics treated ayman , the violence crept closer to company b s base a militia fighter heaved a grenade over the wall into the parking area for the strykers the explosion reverberated through the structure , raising a cloud of dust but causing no casualties there were a few rounds , like there is all the time , and then an explosion , said staff sgt austin boots , with the company s second platoon you could see the smoke billowing up right in a corner of the compound the platoon ran into the street , only to find that the assailants had vanished civilians who witnessed the episode described how two men had sneaked into an alley while one threw the grenade , the other one , armed with a pistol , approached a group of people who live nearby according to an american military interpreter who spoke to them afterward , the assailant s warning was direct you did not hear anything , he told them if you talk to coalition forces , we will kill you
jerusalem the jewish people are marking the 60th anniversary of their national rebirth , the founding of , on thursday with the usual military flyovers , flag buntings and televised reminiscences of aging pioneers but there is another form of celebration planned , and its sponsors believe it says something about the national character a threeday conference of some of the best minds from around the world on some of the biggest challenges facing humankind and especially the jews in the coming decades the brain enriches the pocket , not the other way around , , israel s president and the patron of the conference , said in an interview we are a small land and a small people , but we can become a daring world laboratory , and that is our desire and plan nearly 700 guests are expected to take part next week in 35 discussion groups they include statesmen like henry a kissinger , vaclav havel , tony blair and joschka fischer , but also sergey brin of google , terry semel of yahoo and rupert murdoch , along with seven jewish nobel laureates and president bush given the guest list , the topics are naturally big and ambitious , including the shift in global power from west to east \( and south \) , nuclear proliferation and but much of the focus will also be on topics closer to home like islamic extremism , the rise of iran and sovereignty in jerusalem in fact , what are billed as global challenges terrorism , iran seem to be somehow especially jewish and israeli ones the organizers say this is not coincidental or unusual and point as an example to hitler , who posed an enormous threat to the world but focused particularly on the jews cataclysms always seem to affect jews first , remarked stuart e eizenstat , a senior official in the clinton and carter administrations , who wrote an essay that forms a basis for the conference go back to the black plague it was not a jewish issue , but it had particular impact on jews because they were blamed for it there will be a number of senior officials from central europe and africa , including the presidents of georgia , poland and burkina faso missing from the conference will be any serious arab representation arab leaders and thinkers from egypt , jordan and the areas have been invited , but none have confirmed partly because simultaneously the arab world will be marking israel s 60th anniversary as a catastrophe known as nakba day , which will involve its own conferences and demonstrations the organizers in jerusalem are still hoping a few arab leaders will come mr peres said that to him the idea was to bring thoughtful jews and nonjews together in the perhaps idle hope of making the jews more worldly and making the world more jewish he gave as examples israel s innovative approach to irrigation and its strong presence in medical equipment production worldwide in china , they may not know who moses was , but they do know about our drip irrigation systems , he said speaking of israel and china in the same breath , which will occur many times at the conference , raises some complex questions and offers some staggering contrasts according to mr eizenstat s paper , israel has more engineers per capita than any country in the world 135 per 100 , 000 \( there are 85 per 100 , 000 in the united states \) but even so , the total number of israeli engineers nearly 100 , 000 is tiny compared with the number china is producing every year , about 600 , 000 the back work for the conference has been done by a relatively new institute known as the jewish people policy planning institute , which was the brainchild of a former israeli journalist named avinoam baryosef and whose chairman is dennis ross , the former top middle east peace negotiator for the united states the institute seeks to incorporate strategic planning into jewish life here and abroad and to make sure israel and world jewry understand their common interests one significant development of recent years that will be discussed here is the shift in the relationship between israel and diaspora jewry for decades , israel was the needy child depending on contributions and support from abroad as it struggled to survive today israel s jewish population of 55 million is the world s largest , just ahead of that of the united states , which is slowly declining through low birth rate and intermarriage israel has in fact become the center of jewish life and is increasingly being asked to act like the older brother to jewish communities elsewhere this imposes certain responsibilities on israel as the center of jewish culture , literature and religious thought , mr eizenstat said because israel has been so focused on its security , it has not reached out enough in the past to strengthen the diaspora such a move also ran counter to zionism , which foresaw all jews moving to israel but that is not going to happen , and israel is starting to understand that a weak jewish diaspora means a weak israel mr baryosef said for him the point of the gathering was to nurture the hope of change in israel , to have the willingness to repair what needs repairing and also to take a breath and acknowledge what has been accomplished in just 60 years
in my book review column last weekend , i looked at some issues that arise when genre authors best known for their adult fiction try their hand at writing for younger readers of course , sciencefiction , fantasy and horror writers have been publishing ya fiction for decades everyone from robert a heinlein to ursula k le guin has done it even clive barker has his own ya franchise and there are those who argue that orson scott card shouldn t be writing it to my mind , perhaps the most unusual example of a wellknown genre author crossing over into ya turf is a long outofprint relic called nick and the glimmung , written by none other than philip k dick published in 1988 , six years after his death , and never released in the united states , nick and the glimmung has the gentle pacing and simplified vocabulary of a youngadult novel , but its sensibility and subject matter are unmistakably dickian from the opening paragraphs of nick and the glimmung \( a sequel of sorts to dick s 1969 novel galactic pot healer \) , you can tell we re in a vaguely sinister future dystopia nick knew exactly why his family intended to leave earth and go to another planet , a colony world , and settle there it had to do with him and his cat , horace owning animals of any kind had , since the year 1992 , become illegal horace , in fact , was illegal , whether anyone owned him or not for two months now , nick had owned horace , but he had managed to keep horace inside the apartment , out of sight one morning , however , horace climbed through an open window he scampered and played out in the back yard which all the apartmentowners in the building shared someone , a neighbor perhaps , noticed horace and called the antipet man i told you what would happen if horace ever got out , nick s dad said a few pages later , dick touches on another of his favorite themes the idea of an authority figure in this case , a schoolteacher who propagates their power through the magic of television good morning , class , miss juth said or rather her image on the big television screen at the front of the classroom said miss juth , like all teachers , had too many classes to teach she could not appear in person in any of them instead , she spoke to all her students , in all her classes , by means of a tv screen in nick s class there were sixtyfive pupils , and mis juth \( as she had told them \) taught nine other classes , too so in all , miss juth had about six hundred pupils nevertheless , she seemed to recognize each pupil at least , nick had that impression when she spoke to him from the big tv screen she seemed to look directly at him , to see him as well as hear him he usually felt as if miss juth were actually in the classroom and here s an introductory lesson in ontology , made palatable for the kiddies , when the protagonist discovers a book that seems to have the ability to predict the future yes , there it was right in the book a short but accurate account of mr frankis death had this passage been here yesterday \? nick wondered suppose he had looked this up , on the car trip to the house \? suppose mr frankis had looked for his own name in the index \? would he have found this and known what was going to happen to him \? what is there in the book about me \? nick wondered the text which we read before , on the way here , after glimmung accidentally gave the book to me \? or by now has it changed \? special thanks to bookhobbycom for archival assistance

april is the month for considering financialaid offers from colleges and universities this is not a typical year , however good news first the trend toward noloan packages at top colleges now , the bad an economy in turmoil and more than 55 lenders withdrawing from the system of federally guaranteed student loans will there be trouble securing a loan \? how do you compare aid packages \? what is this thing called need , anyway \? five financialaid directors sarah clark donahue of harvard , caesar t storlazzi of yale , kent mcgowan of buffalo state college \( state university of new york \) , ronald w johnson of the university of california , los angeles , and jorge rodriguez of st john s university , in new york city address reader questions , both personal and general , until april 22 the backstory on aid q is it true that private schools generally have far more aid assistance than state schools \? jeff kent mcgowan generally speaking , yes , for two reasons institutional financial aid usually comes from two sources endowments and tuition discounting older , more prestigious schools typically have larger endowments , meaning a big pot of money earning interest that can be paid out as scholarships tuition discounting is the practice of setting a high tuition and then lowering the price for needier or more gifted students in reality , no real money is spent on the student s behalf the school just collects less revenue from that student schools blessed with a large endowment usually don t engage in discounting , but at most private schools , the endowment is not large enough to provide adequate assistance so discounting is common contrast that with state schools , where endowments are smaller and discounting may be against state law state schools are still the best option for many because of the substantially lower cost for every student , not just the needy or gifted unfortunately , when state economies erode , one of the first things that gets cut is the subsidy to state colleges more and more have to raise tuition without endowments or discounting to fall back on the lack of commitment on the part of state legislators is making access to college less and less a reality to lower and even middleincome families the preparation gap q i assume my \( two \) children will be eligible for lots of financial aid because i am a single mother in a lowpaying clerical job but i m not sure i can afford to get them academically prepared to even consider a highquality college i can t afford to live in a town with a good school system i can t afford extra tutoring i can t afford anything but the cheapest music lessons , so her interest in music is waning because her performance in band isn t competitive i m told that an add assessment is going to cost me 500 , which i can t afford i can t afford to dress my children nicely and give them other amenities so that they fit in with academically successful peers i read to my children , bring them to museums and make them do their homework , but i see now that i can t really compete with families with more money how do generous financial aid packages from ivy league schools really help anyone who needs it \? athena sarah clark donahue athena , it is difficult and expensive to raise children but all colleges and universities are looking for talented students who have thrived in spite of significant financial obstacles , and the truth is , there are many students in this situation achievement is not necessarily linked directly to family income or to access to educational resources it sounds as if you are supporting your children in ways that will translate to their success in life your children can find worlds of inspiration and knowledge at museums and libraries that will help them in the college admissions process admissions officers work closely with guidance counselors at high schools across the country to learn more about their applicants , and if your children work hard and find a way to contribute to extracurricular activities that are meaningful to them , they ll be fine when it comes time for them to apply to college , you ll want to be sure to work with their guidance counselors and to research colleges well online to find a good group of options , and it makes sense to apply to a range of colleges it sounds as if you ll qualify for the aid necessary to pay for their college expenses , and they will also know how to manage well on limited resources understanding the new policies q the admissions crunch at the best schools already creates sociopathic behaviors in students bent on gaining acceptance at any cost now that the stakes are much higher due to the immediate benefit of financial aid like yale s , will more be done to monitor applicants for fraudulent tactics \? your school s generosity will be fought over , and immorality ought not be allowed to win out noah caesar t storlazzi noah , human nature is human nature our admissions and financial aid offices are predicated on the fact that , for the most part , applicants are honest folks who wish to attend our institution both the admissions and financial aid offices have procedures in place to double check information and to have that information validated has a yale education suddenly become more desirable \? i don t think so it has certainly become more affordable we do expect more applications , and we will exercise the same level of scrutiny on admissions and financial aid applications that we always have q how will all the new changes affect aid for graduate students \? alberta storlazzi alberta , at yale we have focused our financial aid initiatives on undergraduates our graduate students \( who make up onehalf of our student body \) are just as important each of our graduate and professional schools is reviewing its aid policies in the light of the changes at yale college and in the light of policies at competitors q for the new income thresholds being used to qualify for aid , exactly how is income defined \? how is taxfree income treated \? my husband died 18 months ago i have proceeds from his life insurance because of this , my daughter s college \( a wellendowed liberal arts institution \) has refused support living off the proceeds generated by the life insurance is more challenging given current interests rates i ve considered selling our home , but i would most likely lose money on a sale at this time additionally , the proceeds would add to available cash nadean storlazzi nadean , when aid officers talk about total income we are referring to earnings , interest and dividend income , business and rental income , partnerships , corporate income and untaxed income \( like the annual amounts contributed to taxdeferred annuities , or the untaxed portion of social security benefits \) essentially , the income used in need analysis consists of items that exist from year to year , though the amounts can change onetime events , like the sale of a home or stocks or the receipt of an insurance settlement , are usually treated as asset events at yale \( and not as income , since they are not repeated \) total income is not just the adjusted gross income from the tax return this is a complex area where different schools may apply different policies but keep in mind that income is weighted much more heavily in the need analysis formula than assets , by a factor of about 10 in other words , assets are protected much more heavily than income q financial aid offers from schools where my son was admitted \( several ivies , other highly selective \) average 25 , 000 , with parent contribution around 20 , 000 i m still not sure how that amount is calculated \( percent assets , salary , etc \) where can i find the formulas to better understand this \? elayne storlazzi elayne , i d recommend you run your numbers through the online parent contribution calculator at the college board \( http appscollegeboardcom fincalc efc welcomejsp \) the report you get at the end of the process should help you understand the formula better both williams and amherst colleges \( www williams edu and www amherst edu \) have calculators on their web sites that produce a nicely detailed report that would show you the interim calculations that go into determining the parent contribution negotiating a better deal q my daughter has been admitted to two small liberal arts colleges college a has given 5 , 000 in grant money college b offered 10 , 000 daughter feels college a is a better fit my harddriving business associates says i should try to negotiate more money out of college a is it bad taste to even attempt this kind of negotiation \? roger q once a student receives a financial aid package , can he or she appeal for additional funds \? if so , what is the best way of going about such a task \? jonathon jorge rodriquez yes , you absolutely can request a review of the aid offer government aid cannot be adjusted , because it is based on a federal formula but you can certainly ask a college to review any grants or scholarships they offered of their own money financial aid offices are not generally aware of what institutional aid other colleges are offering , so tell the college of your choice what you have been offered sometimes they are able , and willing , to increase it to attract a student but let s say a college costs 30 , 000 and you are offered 10 , 000 in grants you are getting a 33 percent discount now let s say another college costs 20 , 000 , and you are offered 7 , 000 in grants though the grant amount is less , because this college s tuition is less , your discount is actually more 35 percent the amount of free aid is important , but you need to compare the actual cost to you a college may offer higher grant amounts because it is more expensive you may not be receiving the best offer in the form of a discount always look at the bottom line when comparing college offers storlazzi we are always open to reviewing an aid offer , especially in the light of new information from the family or due to the receipt of an award from another school that might be better than ours of course , if the other awards are meritbased , there may not be anything we will do except we can always look over our needs analysis to see if we might have missed anything what would i qualify for \? q what are the guidelines , financially , for federal grants for collegebound student \? my daughter is a single mother in a lower income bracket joan mcgowan when your daughter applies for federal financial aid , she will submit income and asset information via the free application for federal student aid the information is run through a formula to create an index of need called the expected family contribution the formula is actually quite complex , taking into account the student s and parents income and assets , family size , number of nonparents in the family , even the taxation rate in the state in which the family resides in reality , it is not one formula but seven a student s dependency status and income determine which of the formulas will generate their efc each treats income and assets slightly differently all that is to say that it is very difficult to predict someone s eligibility without knowing all the details of their situation for that reason , the best way to find out what you may be eligible for is to actually apply for aid by completing the fafsa , or get an idea by going to www fafsa4caster ed gov fortunately , the efc formulas tend to be most generous to single parents , so if your daughter is indeed low income , she should be eligible for both state and federal grants as an undergraduate q if harvard is offering scholarships to students whose parents make up to 180 , 000 annually , what are the financial aid prospects of parents with a joint income of just under 200 , 000 of which just over half is from wages and salaries \? nycollege mom donahue this is tough to say , not knowing the source of the other income , and whether or not it is indicative of unusually significant assets at harvard , we take a close look at a family s total income , including taxed and untaxed sources many families with incomes of 200 , 000 and over qualify for our needbased scholarship aid , but family finances in general for those with incomes of over 180 , 000 can become more complex and less easy to categorize we encourage all families that think they need help in paying for harvard costs to apply for financial aid q my child has been admitted to a top15 national university with no aid and to several top75 schools with 12 , 000 to 25 , 000 in merit scholarship need has become a factor as my wife lost her position in the financial services industry , reducing our family income from 300 , 000 to 100 , 000 our appeal has been denied based on my spouse s severance package with such a significant drop in income , how can we be deemed not in need \? do colleges expect families to deplete savings \? john rodriquez unfortunately , john , your wife s severance package is considered income and even 100 , 000 is considered high for needbased aid at most colleges and universities also , the college will take into account that your child is receiving some form of aid scholarships so it may be that you in fact show financial need with your lower income , but that s negated by the academic scholarships your child is already receiving and no , most colleges do not expect you to deplete your savings to pay for college the federal formula will determine what percentage of savings should go toward family contribution , and it may be as much as 8 percent if a college also requires the css profile application , which many private colleges do , the percentage can be even higher at st john s , we don t look at savings additionally because they are already considered in the federal formula q how much can a student have in a savings account before the college counts that as an asset to be spent on tuition \? stephen johnson stephen , the federal formula expects students to contribute 35 percent of their assets each year to meet the cost of attendance for example , if you reported savings of 1 , 000 , your student contribution would be 350 this amount would be combined with your parents assessed contribution and would become part of the expected family contribution if your efc exceeds the cost of attendance , you would be ineligible for needbased assistance q my daughter has money given to her under the uniform gifts to minors act , and it has grown to about 200 , 000 will this preclude her from consideration for need packages \? my husband and i have a limited income and would like to avoid loans but we would like our daughter to be able to preserve her money for graduate school and beyond anne mcgowan my understanding is that funds given to your daughter via the ugma are hers to spend as she likes once she turns 18 or 21 , depending on state law as such , this would be reported on her fafsa as an asset , which would likely eliminate eligibility for needbased aid the formulas that determine eligibility are complex if you , the parents , have an adjusted gross income of under 50 , 000 and were not required to file a 1040 form , your daughter s eligibility would be determined by what is known as the simplified efc formula this formula ignores all assets of the student and parents , effectively removing consideration of the ugma funds in determining your daughter s eligibility for needbased aid having said that , many private schools use a separate formula to determine eligibility for institutional aid the result would be that the student might qualify for federal aid but not for any institutional needbased aid the bottom line is that the best way to get a picture of her aid eligibility is to complete the fafsa , or if she is not yet a senior in high school , to use the estimator at www fafsa4caster ed gov q my daughter is deciding between several schools , public and private originally from the new york metropolitan area , we now live in arizona while the private schools are in the neighborhood of 45 , 000 , the two state schools will run 16 , 000 my wife and i made a little over a 100 , 000 last year and have not been offered much in terms of grants the financial aid adviser broke it down to a government loan at 85 percent or a home equity loan i am 62 , and after paying off my home , i am not interested in entering into retirement owing close to 200 , 000 he also advised depleting our 50 , 000 in stocks by paying off credit cards , etc , to get more financial support next year are these really the only choices i have \? robert johnson robert , i certainly understand your concerns , but it should be noted that paying for college is primarily the responsibility of the family due to your financial strength as assessed by the fafsa , you have little eligibility for grants you may wish to confer with the schools your daughter is considering regarding eligibility for academic scholarships public college is certainly an option for reducing cost your daughter might also consider a local college and living at home or a community college for her first two years as the primary beneficiary of her education , she should also contribute by assuming a summer job and or working part time during the academic year as you were advised by the financial aid adviser , the plus loan can be borrowed up to the cost of attendance at a rate of 85 percent , and payments begin while your daughter is in school the other option , a home equity loan , would be tax deductible q if my child checks on the application that he does not need financial aid , will that improve his chances of acceptance against an applicant of identical qualifications who requests aid \? kelvin rodriquez this is a very individual question st john s is need blind we consider whether to admit a student before determining financial need but even if not , i believe that most institutions of higher education would not make an admissions decision based on whether the student indicates that he she will not need aid divorce who pays \? q i was a single parent raising my daughter for 10 years she ll enter college in 2009 i remarried in 2007 my husband \( not her father \) earns approximately 65 , 000 i earn 40 , 000 will his income also be counted when considering the aid we receive \? her real father is 35 , 000 in arrears in child support , and has not had significant income in many years melanie donahue applying for financial aid can be complex when you are divorced and or remarried not only may you have extenuating circumstances like court agreements specifying which parent needs to pay how much , or the unwillingness of the other parent even to file the application forms , but schools can often have different guidelines for their own grant assistance than the federal government has for federally subsidized grant and loan programs the federal guidelines for needbased federal assistance \( like the pell grant or federally subsidized student loans \) require only the custodial parent household to complete the fafsa , and eligibility is determined using only this information this includes the income and asset information of a stepparent regardless of how long he or she has been married to the student s parent schools will generally require students to file the fafsa first , and then if there is institutional grant assistance available , they will often ask you to complete a profile form , which is offered through the college board s college scholarship service many schools that use the profile form will also ask the noncustodial parent to file the noncustodial parent profile form these forms ask for more information about your financial situation than asked by the fafsa , but this doesn t necessarily mean you will be asked to pay more than your federal expected family contribution it s a lot of forms and questions , but in the end schools want to make it possible for your son or daughter to join them , so check in with them directly \( either by phone or email \) to make sure that you understand their financial aid application guidelines , and that they understand your unique circumstances q i am in the midst of an awful divorce , and my children s father has decided not to pay for college in applying for aid , is the fact that the father \( who has several million dollars \) will not be contributing taken into consideration , or will that work against my kids in looking for government lowinterest loans \? gail donahue if gail is separated , the fafsa does not require her soontobe exhusband s information , and her eligibility for federal needbased loans will be based on her information only q my son will be applying for college next year combining my income with my exhusband s results in something in the 250 , 000 range , presumably too high to qualify for financial aid but for a variety of reasons , including bad financial choices , a costly divorce and 12 years of private school tuition , almost all of what we earn goes toward paying off debts our son has very good grades and a combined sat of around 2300 do you have any recommendations for financial idiots like us \? mary rodriquez mary , the good news is that only one of you the parent whom the child lived with the most the previous year , or whomever provides the majority of support needs to report income on the financial aid form around october of your son s senior year , you should contact all the colleges he will be applying to to find out about available academic scholarships some require an application , some don t you don t want to exclude yourself from any form of aid even if you think your income is too high , complete the fafsa , at www fafsa gov the calculation for needbased aid will be based on your previous year s adjusted gross income , taxes paid , number in the family and in college , plus any savings \( not retirement accounts \) and business value what is not considered is personal debt q under the terms of divorce , i am responsible for my daughter s tuition she is entering a large private east coast university this fall she and her mother are unwilling to file fafsa and css profile applications , including the referral to the noncustodial parent , because they have no interest in easing my financial burden my gross income is above 200 , 000 , but i ve argued that the application is worthwhile so that my daughter may be considered for aid based on merit is an aid application at my income level worthwhile or a fool s errand \? are there procedures for meeting the fafsa css requirements when parents are unwilling to cooperate \? chester rodriquez merit aid is usually based on a student s academic record , and so doesn t require the fafsa but some federal aid , including the unsubsidized stafford and plus loans , which are low interest , are available regardless of need by financial aid regulation , the parent your daughter lives with the most is the one responsible for her but if you can substantiate that you provide more than half the support in the way of living expenses , etc , then you may , and i stress may \( because another college s interpretation could be different \) , be able to file the financial aid form as the parent most responsible for the child still , the student needs to sign the form if your former wife prohibits that , there is nothing that can be done q my girlfriend is a teacher with one son in college and two daughters who will be in the next few years their father has not provided financial support for a while i understand that if we get married , my income will be included in financial aid calculations , but what if we are just living together \? kim donahue federal guidelines do not ask for financial information for a boyfriend or girlfriend some colleges may not count a stepparent s income if they require the noncustodial parent to contribute to college expenses , so it really depends on the school in the end , it is probably more advantageous for financial aid eligibility to live together , and not get married i m not sure this should be driving the marriage decision , however , for there are so many other , more important factors to consider independence day students on their own q is there anything that can be done for students whose parents refuse to help them with the cost of college \? i m a sophomore with a nearly 40 gpa , and while i have meritbased scholarships and grants , my parents make too much money for me to qualify for much needbased aid i have been taking out increasingly large loans to pay for tuition my financial aid adviser and several faculty at my college have all given me the familiar line that it s the responsibility of the family to pay for college this is very nice , but it does nothing to help those students whose families aren t supporting them barbara donahue both the federal government and most colleges assume that parents will contribute to the cost of their dependent child s education to the extent that they are able this can certainly pose a challenge for students whose parents refuse to help , as their unwillingness to pay is not an allowable justification for a dependency override the higher education act allows schools to make a dependency override only for students with unusual circumstances like an abusive family environment or abandonment colleges often have their own guidelines for declaring independence , but in most cases , they require severe estrangement from parents unfortunately for students whose parents refuse to pay , loans are the default source of financing many students caught in this situation find they need to take time off to earn money , or hold jobs while studying some even transfer to less expensive schools q i have a 17yearold cousin who is finishing his junior year of high school and will apply to college in the fall his mother died seven years ago his father died a year ago he is concerned about whether the income and assets of his guardians , an aunt and uncle who own a small business \( but who also have four children of their own \) , will hurt his ability to get financial aid he turns 18 in 2009 , at which time the guardianship ends , and is considering whether to delay his college applications until the following year to avoid his guardians finances affecting aid decisions can you comment \? dan donahue students whose parents are no longer alive automatically qualify under federal guidelines for independence unless they have been adopted guardians are not expected to contribute to the cost of their education , so there is no reason for your cousin to delay college applications while colleges may handle these situations differently , most will follow the federal guidelines preparing for the big bill q is it true that you can liquidate investments and park that cash in one or two personal residences by paying down off related mortgages and keep the amount of this investment out of the net worth calculation for financial aid \? that is the conclusion i have drawn on taking a closer look at the crazy calculus of financial aid after being told we were too rich to qualify jim q i have three daughters who will all enter college in the next 10 years ! i have a job in which i can control my income , by about 12 , 000 a year is it better to earn as much money as possible to pay tuition debt , or should i decrease my income to improve my need status on the fafsa form \? william donahue it rarely makes sense to try to position yourself financially to qualify for more financing because schools have different guidelines for their own grant programs although federal financial aid guidelines don t include your home equity in the determination of eligibility for federal funds , and some schools have also eliminated home equity from their need analysis , the majority of schools with needbased institutional grant aid will include your home in their analysis of your ability to contribute to educational expenses similarly , although you may qualify for more assistance with a lower income , the change is by no means a dollarfordollar correlation so you d have less income to handle basic living expenses as well as to pay for college in the end , the best strategy is to make sure schools have as much information about your finances as possible so they can respond to your individual circumstances within the general guidelines of their program remember , schools that have admitted your children want to make it possible for them to come , and this often involves more than one discussion with a financial aid office q our daughter starts school in five years and our son in 10 what is the best way to plan \? we have 24 , 000 for my daughter and 7 , 000 for my son in utah s 529 our income is in the 110 , 000 range , so i assume we would not qualify for aid our daughter will most likely attend a state college special education program while my son may have more choices jane johnson first , i commend you for your proactive planning , which will put you at an advantage other options you should consider begin the hunt for scholarships , particularly if you know your daughter s interests , using scholarship search sites like www fastweb com , www salliemaefund com or www collegeboard com state higher education agencies are often a clearinghouse for information on financial aid programs contact the utah state board of regents at www utahsbr edu and to focus your planning , investigate www collegeanswer com select the paying tab for the long term planning calculator this calculator estimates monthly savings required to support up to three children in college finally , with college cost rising 7 to 10 percent annually , i would not rule out the possibility that your daughter could demonstrate financial need when the time comes , apply the student loan crisis q my son will be starting law school in august at florida state will the recent problems in financing affect his ability to get federal loans \? also what is the best financing available for graduate students \? millard ronald w johnson the subprime mortgage crisis as well as a cut in government subsidies to lenders has led some lenders to discontinue making federally guaranteed loans while these issues are unsettling , congress has responded with emergency legislation that seeks to eliminate disruptions for the coming academic the senate bill is pending the house passed its bill overwhelmingly on april 17 , and the bush administration has expressed support some of the features would allow lenders to sell their debt to the department of education at a premium , giving investors confidence in securities backed by the loans as a result , i anticipate loans will be available , and would encourage your son to apply for stafford loans and graduate plus loans , which will provide advantageous interest rates for private loans , review conditions closely as they have very restrictive terms , including a cosignor to get the best rates contact the florida state university financial aid office to discuss their aid programs q my daughter is graduating soon we have four parent plus loans for each school year of her education i d like to consolidate our loans into one there used to be lot of offers for consolidation , now there are none is consolidation still possible \? ismael johnson ismael , first , congratulations on your daughter s graduation second , because of the credit crunch we are anticipating students will not have the broad range of options as before with a third of the top student lenders having exited the federal loan program , some have redirected their resources from consolidation to students entering college effective april 11 , the biggest student lender , sallie mae , suspended participation in the federal consolidation loan program students who want to consolidate their variable interest rate loans will probably want to wait until july 1 interest rates are expected to drop enough to make it advantageous but lenders may require higher balances it s important to really shop around for the best deal you can compare lender terms at www simpletuition com q i m graduating from a master s program with 100 , 000 in debt , split between federal and private loans i ve been accepted to law school but given the current loan environment , do you think it would be smarter to work for two to three years , reduce my debt , and hope lenders would give me a good rate three years from now , or attend law school this fall and graduate with more than 250 , 000 in debt knowing that the private loan rate could be quite high \? cjd johnson given the current economy , i cannot predict what the loan rates will be three years from now but i think the real question is whether you can manage additional debt burden with 100 , 000 already outstanding reducing your current debt would be a prudent alternative to taking on more in an uncertain economy and employment market realistically assess your earnings potential , and whether you would be capable of managing 250 , 000 in debt while addressing your postcollege living expenses scholarship hunting q for years we were paying the florida prepaid college plan to give an initial push to the child we thought would get all kinds of invitations due to her talents as senior year is here , average gpa is nothing to brag about \( 25 \) she has big dreams but we are afraid these aid packages come for those on the 35 range and above is there hope for aid for the average student \? beta mcgowan most state and federal aid does not take into consideration high school grade point average the student simply needs to be admitted to a college having said that , finding scholarships for your daughter will be more difficult but never assume that organizations awarding scholarships are simply looking at grades or test scores when researching scholarships , look locally first see if the high school has a scholarship check with your church or synagogue check with your employer and absolutely check at the colleges to which she is applying if your daughter is active in community service or has artistic or athletic talent there may be funds for her also , many towns have a clearinghouse of sorts for local scholarships go to this web site to find the organization in your area that serves this function www cof org locator index cfm \? crumb 2 what about transfer students \? q my daughter is in a musical theater program at a wyoming community college next year she will apply to complete her final two years do colleges provide the same kinds of aid to a transfer as they do to a freshman is she at a disadvantage because she went to community college \? paul mcgowan the answer is , maybe yes , maybe no since we are talking about institutional financial aid here , it depends on the policies and resources of the college to which she is transferring in the world of scholarships , there are many more resources for new freshmen than for transfers but this is a situation where a little extra homework and pushing might pay off thoroughly research what is available at each of the schools she is considering , including asking the theater departments if there are scholarships she might be considered for since she is unknown to them , she might need to submit an audition tape also , she should apply for admission early and make it known to the theater department that she is considering more than one school grandparents and retirement q my husband and i have just started a college savings plan for our 10monthold grandson his parents live in rural massachusetts and earn 75 , 000 , which probably won t rise substantially will the college plan be counted as assets when he applies for financial aid \? joan rodriquez a 529 savings plan is an excellent way to save for a child s college , as the account will grow tax free over time but how the money impacts financial aid depends on who holds the account a 529 is treated as follows if under the student s name , the total value will be considered in the calculation for aid if the account is under a parent s name , only 56 percent will figure in if under someone else s name , like yours , joan , the asset is not included on the application at all the upshot it is best to have a grandparent own the account q my grandson will be attending college this fall as a freshman at an expensive private university i have read that if i give his parents money to pay for any of his expenses , next year s financial aid package could be affected is there any way i can contribute toward my grandson s college expenses without jeopardizing his financial aid package \? ida storlazzi ida , if your grandson is receiving needbased aid , that decision was based on his immediate family s finances if his family receives more money from some source , like a gift from you , your grandson s need is affected his family resources are higher , therefore his need is lower some would consider this a fallacy in the needbased aid philosophy i understand that your intent is to help your grandson s parents pay for college yet their contribution stays the same and the university now expects an additional contribution from the funds you have gifted to your grandson it is the only fair way to distribute needbased aid q if you have for retirement an aftertax annuity , is this considered a retirement account that you do not have to list as savings on the fafsa \? libby mcgowan i believe the key here is whether the aftertax annuity would legally be considered a retirement plan if it is , then the accumulated value would not be reported but if the annuity is just the mechanism that you are choosing to save money for the day you retire , opposed to investing in stocks , cds or real estate , then it is an ordinary asset and it must be reported q my husband and i married late and had our 9yearold twin daughters in our mid40s we will both be eligible for retirement within the next three to five years and i will be 63 when they graduate from high school although our current combined income is high \( 200 , 000 \) , i don t think our retirement income will be sufficient to pay for college and it is unclear whether we can put enough aside to enable us to retire before they graduate if poor health or other circumstances lead to retirement , will our retirement income be counted in calculating their eligibility for student aid \? or do we need to work into our 70s to pay for their college education \? maria johnson though you may be on a limited income after retirement , your resources will be assessed to determine what you will be capable of contributing toward your daughters education the contribution will be factored against the cost of attendance that is , if it s a highcost institution , your daughters may qualify for needbased aid if a moderately priced institution \( if one exists in five years \) , you would likely not qualify when you retire , you will want to consult with the financial aid office at the college to determine how your lower income will be assessed further , if there are health issues that drain retirement income , by all means document these circumstances depending on the nature of the situation , financial aid officers can exercise professional judgment by evaluating your special situation while i understand you are starting late , i still encourage you to save as much as you can toward your daughter s college enrollment the impact of early admissions q applying for early decision can increase the chance for admission at the selective schools my daughter is considering \( she s a junior \) does an early decision affect her chances at scholarship help \? is it better to wait until regular application times to apply to compare scholarships from other schools \? diane mcgowan if you apply early decision that becomes a binding agreement you are stating that you will attend that does not then allow you to shop around for the best deal my colleague in admissions suggests requesting early action , which is nonbinding , and allows you to choose the best option after reviewing aid offers storlazzi yale has early action , not early decision the distinction is that , while yale can offer admission in december , we don t require the student s decision on whether to attend or not until may 1 so a student can wait to see award offers from other schools before committing we use the same criteria to determine eligibility for aid , no matter if the student is admitted early or on the regular schedule waiting until the regular application timetable will not change the financial aid eligibility equation gap year deferrals q my daughter is considering a gap year if she defers an acceptance , and assuming she is offered some financial help , will it carry over until her delayed entry \? anne rodriquez colleges do not normally offer assistance and then hold it until the student is ready to enroll institutional aid is valid only for the year the student is enrolled , as is federal and state aid , which is based on income from the previous year aid for international students q how disadvantaged is an international student who needs financial aid when it comes to being accepted at college \? justine q i am a german exchange student , spending junior year of high school in the us my mother is american and thus i also am a us citizen , but i will graduate in germany because college is free in germany , my parents have not saved toward college am i handled as an international or domestic student for financial aid \? phil donahue at institutions with needblind admissions , like harvard , international students are not disadvantaged , nor are us students living abroad international students are covered by the same financial aid program as are domestic students the difference would be in the source of the funding , as international students are not eligible for federal financial aid in this case , phil is actually eligible for federal funds , and the aid package would meet full need continuing ed bachelor s redux q i think i have put myself in a bad position though i already have a bfa , i am returning to college as an undergrad to study a different subject , then applying for grad school i have been told that because i already have a bachelor s , it will be difficult to receive money i have heard many horror stories about private student loans what are my financial options \? cris mcgowan the rumors are true once you have a bachelor s degree you no longer qualify for the federal pell grant this leaves you the option of federal student loans but there is a cap on how much you can borrow as an undergraduate if you already borrowed extensively to complete your first bachelor s , you may have little to no loan eligibility left you are wise to be cautious when it comes to pursuing private loans they can be very costly because they are not regulated by federal aid laws the real question is do you really need a second bachelor s before pursuing a master s degree \? make sure that going straight to a master s is not an option for most people acquiring a second bachelor s is of little benefit beyond the knowledge gained lastly , there are always scholarships check with the school you will be attending do some research on the internet if a degree is in subjects that are in high demand , like teaching , there may be additional financing available getting an associate s degree q next fall , i will be entering a community college to get an associate s degree in nursing i have no other degree i will need financial assistance for tuition and living expenses i have a \( legally bound \) savings account , and the funds are to be spent only for medical reasons will i be able to get loans given that it is an associate s degree and not a bachelor s \? what are the guidelines regarding a savings account as mentioned above \? would it be best to begin at my private bank to get a loan \? lisa mcgowan often families don t want to report the value of a trust fund on the fafsa because the trust has a stipulation that it cannot be accessed until a certain age or condition has been met for most people , for aid purposes , those conditions are irrelevant the value of the trust must be reported on the fafsa the one exception is when there is a court order requiring that the trust not be invaded for anything but a designated condition like medical expenses so if this is the case , you would not report the value of those savings as to loans , as long as the community college participates in the federal student loan programs you should qualify for one the loan may not be subsidized , meaning interest might start to accrue immediately , but you should be able to borrow as much as any other freshman and no , you do not have to visit a bank branch to get a loan most lenders have this process centralized and want you to apply via the internet making ends meet q i am very surprised at the number of parents represented here with incomes exceeding 100 , 000 who are struggling to afford college how did we reach a situation in which even those with household incomes in the top 10 to 15 percent of the population cannot afford to educate their children without government assistance \? jake mcgowan you ask a philosophical question so i will attempt a philosophical answer when i was in college in the early 80s , my middleclass parents owned one car they did not have cable television let alone a home theater i attended a public high school and got one new pair of sneakers , converse , that were to last the year i didn t get my first car until i had graduated from college , and even then it was a hand me down from my parents bottom line , the expectation for what was an appropriate standard of living was much lower couple that with the success of financial aid as more aid has been made available , there hasn t been as great a push to save for higher education in fact , in many ways , until the recent advent of 529 plans , there have been disincentives saving for college could decrease your eligibility for federal aid the values of our elected officials have also changed there was a time when congressional delegates saw higher education as a way to drive the economy , so they poured tax revenue into grant aid but in the mid80s a shift began away from grant assistance to loans then , when the public began to rely on loans , the cost of subsidizing student loans increased congress did not see fit to increase loan limits , so there is the recent explosion in nonfederally backed student loans i also have begun to see at buffalo state college a reluctance on the part of students to ask their parents or relatives for assistance i believe some of this is pride and some is the message they have received from their parents that if they want to pursue college , they are on their own the parents have their own financial problems to worry about so is cost making higher education unreachable for many \? yes but in part this is because government does not recognize the positive economic impact that investing in higher education makes and second , the willingness to sacrifice to achieve such goals has diminished after all , it might require students and parents to give up their daily starbucks lattes for a while three lattes a day , 10 a day , 365 days a year , that s 3 , 650
beijing it is hard to buy junk at these olympics outside some of the stadiums and arenas , there are stands selling small chinese flags and flags bearing the likeness of the inescapable fuwa , the olympic mascots humanpropelled versions turn up at most of the events , wobbling and waving to an annoying techno theme song the fuwa suits at the water cube are inflatable , and resemble giant beach toys but there are no tshirts on sale near the sites or on any of the long pedestrian boulevards that bisect the main complex , the olympic green no yao ming bobbleheads , no liu xiang key chains , no chairman mao soaponarope no thong underwear , with or without the red star logo these may be the least schlocky games since the ones back on olympia in the shopping areas downtown , of course , you can buy souvenirs of the usual touristy sort paper fans , jade figurines , ceramic incense burners , miniature pagodas and the great wall is overrun with tchotchkes but little of this stuff is specifically tied to the olympics the chinese must not understand the cheesy side of capitalism yet , because someone has clearly missed a big chance to cash in there is a souvenir shop at the olympics , but you have to know about it there is no signage or advertising and from the bird s nest , say , it is a sweaty trek of a halfmile or so , past a gantlet of corporate pavilions more interested in entertainment than salesmanship there is the china mobile building , for example , whose facade features giant athlete figures bursting through the walls inside , there is a more or less continuous show of acrobats , traditional chinese dancers and a hiphop crew who spin on their heads in a neighboring room , a young man wearing a shirt that lights up demonstrates a gizmo that appears to be an update of the old theremin it makes chinese music if you blow or wave your hand over it next door is the pavilion of the volkswagen auto group , and more acrobats , except that these run along the walls there are also cars in big glass vitrines with waterfalls in back , and a symbolic exhibit of a giant gas nozzle squeezing out a single drop of oil while next to it another nozzle , made of straw , gushes out a clear fluid that is apparently the fuel of the future the souvenir shop , called the super store , is pretty tasteful as such places go there are tshirts for sale , but not many there is a modest selection of caps , but none , as there were at the atlanta olympics , with beer cans attached fuwas can be purchased small medium and large singly or in a fivepack and in plush , cloth , or as beanbags there are olympic backpacks , dishtowels , wristwatches , key chains , jewelries and eyeswear , or sunglasses , and none of this stuff is particularly inexpensive an olympic medallion set in plexiglass will set you back 100 or so as at any olympics , there are pintraders bartering those little enameled insignia that for some collectors take on inestimable value anything with a dragon or a panda on it is particularly sought after , and so is the pin from cctv , the chinese television network but several veteran traders complained that there was no central designated trading site , as there has been at other olympics , and that as a result , bartering had not reached the frenzied intensity of say , the barcelona or nagano games the best spot is probably outside the gate leading to the news media center , where a halfdozen or so traders squat on camp stools or overturned buckets , their wares laid out before them on tuesday , one of them , timm jamiesen , an architect from roanoke , va , said he had been trading olympic pins for 20 years it s passion , he said we 're spreading good will and having fun but he added , there is n't the big fever here , concentrated in one place the fever has broken into smaller pods janet grissom , a psychiatrist from salt lake city , had her bulletin board of pins balanced on a trash bin i 'll never be an olympic swimmer , but i can trade , she said , and she added that her hobby was not unconnected to her professional life a lot about pin trading is about what you have with the other person , she said it s not so much the pin you get it s the experience that makes for a good trade it is also impossible to find junky food at these games , or even interesting food of the sort you find at the night market or the wanfujing snack street kebabs and dumplings , candied fruit , grasshoppers and starfish and something called delicious lamb s tummy the menus at all the concession stands are the same ice cream , yogurt , popcorn , fruit cup beer is available at many stands , but does n't seem to produce the kind of boozy , noisy crowds that have turned up at other olympics late on monday afternoon a young man wearing a union jack as a cape , with two smaller union jacks attached to his head , was wandering around a little glassyeyed but he might have just been tired
11 13 pm wrapup these debates gave new hampshire its own chance to evaluate the candidates in the new postiowa dynamic mr obama basically followed the traditional strategy of the frontrunner , or at least the winner in iowa he ducked he kept his chatter to a minimum and did not go after his rivals he certainly seemed more surefooted on global warming than foreign policy we saw a scrappier mrs clinton , whose iowa loss put her on the defensive she controlled a lot of face time to make her argument and went negative against mr obama her willingness to attack mr obama might show a certain desperation it could also show that new hampshire s tolerance for negativity is higher than iowa s \( it makes you wonder whether , if she had understood how big her loss in iowa would be , she would have taken on mr obama more directly in iowa \) but will this aggressive approach to mr obama matter \? she said that when he ran for the senate , he said he would vote against the patriot act and against the iraq war but when he got to the senate , he voted for the patriot act and for funding of the war she also said his new hampshire chairman is a lobbyist for the drug companies is this the worst that she can say about him \? can this information which is not new , just new for her to raise during a debate really change the minds of those supporting him \? finally what to make of her answer to the question about her likeability that voters like her positions but not her \? her response , that it hurt her feelings said with a smile was an odd mixture of vulnerability , humor , coyness and sarcasm with all of the attention to her personality and supposed lack of warmth , she may have wanted to underscore that she does have feelings but she also turned the tables to remind listeners that they had made a grave error when they based their decision in 2000 on likability \( aka , who would you rather have a beer with \? \) mr edwards pressed his populist , anticorporate message if anyone thought he was going to help bail out mrs clinton against mr obama , they were wrong his ultimate message was that he is still in the game perhaps the most interesting thing about this debate is its timing , just three days before the new hampshire primary , with all three of these candidacies hanging in the balance they all had some pretty good moments , as did mr richardson full transcript ps back on mr edwards for a minute here is the transcript of the moment he rose to mr obama s defense against attacks by mrs clinton and positioned himself and mr obama as the forces of change and mrs clinton as the status quo any time you speak out powerfully for change , the forces of status quo attack that s exactly what happens it s fine to have a disagreement about health care to say that senator obama is having a debate with himself from some associated press story , i think is just not that s not the kind of discussion we should be having i think that every time this happens what will occur every time he speaks out for change , every time i fight for change , the forces of status quo are going to attack every single time but the the one thing i do not argue with him about is he believes deeply in change and i believe deeply in change and anytime you re fighting for that , i mean , i didn t hear these kinds of attacks from senator clinton when she was ahead now that she s not , we hear them 10 43 pm regrets , i ve had what have you said in the debates that you wished you hadn t \? mrs clinton shifts the focus to the differences between republicans and democrats , but many viewers probably flashed to the end of the debate in philadelphia when she struggled mightily over the issue of drivers licenses for illegal immigrants mr richardson says he regrets picking byron r \( whizzer \) white as his favorite supreme court justice and later finding out he was against roe v wade and dissented in some civil rights decisions that wasn t a good one he gets applause laughter and applause mr edwards , prompted by mr gibson , pinpoints the debate in which he made the horrendous mistake of teasing mrs clinton about her jacket then went on to refer to her looks tonight \( terrific , he says \) mr obama says he agrees with mrs clinton pundits might point to the moment when he was asked how he would respond to another 9 11 and he failed to say he would retaliate swiftly 10 18 pm words or actions mrs clinton calls for a reality break and takes on both mr edwards and mr obama she may have hoped that mr edwards would side with her against the winner in iowa , but clearly knows he is not she says mr edwards s patients bill of rights never got through the senate she says that mr obama s chairman in new hampshire is a lobbyist for the drug companies words are not action , she says as beautifully presented and passionately presented , they are not action , she says mr obama responds to mrs clinton s dismissal of mere words words do inspire , he says , in a clip you are bound to see repeated over the next few days words do help people get involved words do help members of congress get into power so they can deliver health care reform and a bold energy policy don t discount that power he attributes his growing success in part to his use of words 10 11 pm edwards gets assertive mr edwards takes a swipe at both mr obama and mrs clinton , saying his fight against corporate greed isn t either academic \( blow to him \) or political \( blow to her \) , but personal for him he s trying to show he s still in the fight , should not be written off and is not ready to pick between the two of them 10 03 pm the likability question the observation from pollsters is put to mrs clinton voters like your resume but they seem to like mr obama more that hurts my feelings , she says , with a coy look , but i ll try to go on odd mixture of sarcasm and seriousness , but she gets a laugh , and the camera cuts to her daughter in the audience he s very likable , she says of mr obama i agree with that i don t think i m that bad mr obama chimes in you re likeable enough mrs clinton goes on to note that in 2000 many people seemed to base their vote whether they wanted to have a beer with the candidate , a reference to what voters saw as george w bush s likability i m offering 35 years of experience of making change , she says , slipping in both experience and change and then , perhaps as a result of the iowa caucuses in which mr obama won the support of more women than mrs clinton , she made this direct assertion i embody change i think having the first woman president is a huge change after a reference to the republican debate , mr obama says i was going back and forth between the republicans and football and delivers the news that the redskins lost he avoids criticizing any of his rivals 9 51 pm iraq and the surge all the candidates have called for a timetable for withdrawal of troops from iraq but what if the generals in iraq said it s wrong to withdraw them \? mr edwards said he would always listen to my uniformed military leadership , but adds , i will end combat missions in the first year , and there will be no permanent military bases in iraq mr richardson is passionate about ending the war and bringing all troops home within a year and leaving none behind he doesn t really answer the question , suggesting that perhaps he wouldn t listen to those generals mrs clinton said they all agree about withdrawal but no one can predict what will happen , and we have to be ready for whatever they might be she doesn t answer the question about the generals either and so to break mr obama has been keeping his head down 9 40 pm more clinton v obama mrs clinton flatly accuses mr obama you stopped short of going the distance to make sure we could have a system that covers everyone then she switches tactics , saying that two weeks ago , mr obama had said mr edwards was unelectable because he had changed positions she adds you ve changed positions within three years on a range of issues , saying he had said he would oppose the patriot act then voted for it and had opposed the iraq war then voted to fund it mr obama said he never said that mr edwards was unelectable mr edwards is amused i didn t hear these kind of attacks from senator clinton when she was ahead mr richardson inserts i ve been in hostage negotiations that are more civil than this mrs clinton shouldn t count on mr edwards or mr richardson joining her in beating up on mr obama mr richardson has a good line as he tries not to get mired in the arguing and instead tries to focus on his record of experience , which he feels voters have overlooked is experience a leper \? he asks 9 28 pm clinton v obama mrs clinton had said it s hard to know where mr obama stands and mr gibson asks her what does he need to be vetted on and what are the unanswered questions about him \? she says the associated press has said that mr obama could have a pretty good debate with himself about his healthcare plan , and says he was for singlepayer health care , then universal health care , then proposed a health care plan that doesn t cover everybody you have to be able to count on a president mr obama says the ap was quoting clinton aides if you ve got a tv or can stream this , you should catch this back and forth between mr obama and mrs clinton she s hitting him pretty hard , she s also drawing in mr edwards as an ally ! \( update we meant to say she is trying to draw mr edwards in as an ally , by noting that mr obama has said negative things about mr edwards too \) 9 16 pm pakistan and nuclear weapons charles gibson , the moderator , thinks mr obama s view on nuclear proliferation , especially regarding pakistan , is essentially the bush doctrine we can attack if we want to no , says mr obama strike when we have actionable intelligence mr edwards says more forcefully , if i knew where osama bin laden was , i would go get him but , he says , the real problem with united states policy is that it is ad hoc mrs clinton offers an analysis and says she has a fivepoint plan for an approach to pakistan be sure america doesn t ignite a dangerous situation she seems to be trying to supply an awful lot of detail , thereby suggesting that mr obama lacks her depth on the subject mr obama comes back to say the united states has to get pakistan s agreement before taking action there but he adds that the nation can t hesitate to act against al qaeda he had been rapped earlier in the campaign for appearing hesitant mrs clinton then offers a primer on stateless terrorism 9 05 pm welcome back and then there were four ! the democrats are now up , with bill richardson still hanging in there with the top three , barack obama , john edwards and hillary clinton , despite his sagging position in the polls maybe he s thinking about the no 2 spot on the ticket and by the way , a reader helpfully pointed out that the debate can be seen online on the wmur site we don t mind noting that

cromwell , conn as the sky faded to a menacing gray , was the lone splash of color at the 13th hole his stunningly yellow shirt , better suited to the glorious sunshine that bathed the travelers championship until sunday morning , stood out in the darkened afternoon when his game did not but with the smell of rain clinging to the course , cink nailed a 6foot birdie putt on no 13 and went into a weather delay still leading the field by a shot another birdie on no 15 over an hour later proved to be enough for him to secure the 108 million first prize sunday at tpc river highlands , the same course where he won his first pga tour event 11 years ago the victory , his first on the tour since 2004 , also moved him into third place in the fedex cup regularseason rankings behind tiger woods and phil mickelson cink finished with an 18underpar 262 , edging tommy armour iii and the defending champion , hunter mahan , by one shot but cink s finalround 67 on the par70 course was more the product of consistency than inspiration his four birdies in the round came only when he seemed prodded into action by the chasing pack we had to endure a rain delay and guys were firing left and right , cink said and i just stayed a step ahead , just enough i think that makes it even more sweet cink had carried a twoshot lead from saturday , but his career record when leading after 54 holes was hardly a confidence boost he was 1 for 9 before sunday and as he took on the 444yard , par4 18th hole , needing only a par to seal the result , that record nearly caught up to him you 've got the way tiger goes here any time he s sniffing the lead he seems to just will it through , cink said then you 've got the way i was , where it seems like any time there s a chance to lose you lose he hit a towering 366yard drive straight into the crowd on the hill to the right of the fairway but he was only 93 yards from the pin , and it took a delicate iron shot to the fringe of the green to remedy the wayward drive ultimately , he said , it was a pearl of wisdom from his wife , lisa , that made the difference she said sometimes you have to be willing to run naked across the green , he said and that sounds crazy , but guys like tiger and phil , they let it all out they do n't think about the next one they do n't think about the consequences they just go for it tournament organizers had rescheduled the final round of play on sunday in anticipation of the heavy downpour , sending the field off in threesomes on the first and 10th holes starting at 7 30 am the leaders did not tee off until 9 30 , but perhaps the earlier start was to blame for cink s sluggish play while the field sneaked up on him , cink bogeyed the fourth hole before recovering with a birdie on no 6 mahan , armour and cink s friend heath slocum took another jab at him by posting birdies on the ninth to tie at 15 under by the time cink had matched them , 11 players skulked within four shots of the lead none , however , could mount a charge on a back nine that had been so vulnerable through the weekend d j trahan , for instance , carded a 30 there on saturday i did n't feel like i played those holes badly , mahan said , i just did n't quite make them , did n't quite read them the way i needed to neither did cink , but he read them just well enough

the woes of the world have been so multitudinous lately that it s hard to give them all proper attention you start fretting about the collapse of the housing market then you wander off into melting glaciers or large cranes collapsing at urban construction sites and before you know it , the day is over and now it turns out that there s a giant particle accelerator in switzerland that critics say could create a black hole that would swallow up the earth \( or , in a more optimistic scenario , turn it into what dennis overbye of the times called a shrunken dense dead lump \) the european center for nuclear research has done several safety studies on the accelerator , known to its friends as the large hadron collider , and says there is absolutely no danger still , you have to admit this sets the bar for worrying at a whole new level let s prioritize rank all your causes for concern on a scale of \( unfortunate development \) to \( large hadron collider has a bad day \) for instance zimbabwe fails to come up with a vote count after nearly a week texas fails to come up with a vote count after more than a month new opportunities for worrying pop up everywhere just a few weeks ago , the director of national intelligence , mike mcconnell , gave a speech at johns hopkins university he opened with a story about a captain of an american aircraft carrier who got into a fight with another party over who should divert course to avoid a collision , not realizing the other party was a lighthouse now this is true , mcconnell began i was in the signals intelligence business where you listen to the people talk and so on this is true it s an actual recording you know where this is going , right \? the head of national intelligence begins remarks with now this is true and follows up with an old , untrue , naval legend \( a spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence claimed that mcconnell was setting the crowd up for a punch line it s a technique comedians use it all the time to get the audience to buy in , he said consider iraq according to an article in the times by erica goode , iraqis now celebrate april 1 by pulling lighthearted pranks , like informing a class of students that their teacher had been assassinated april fools ! clearly , these folks deserve all the worrying time we can give them recently , the iraqi government marched into basra to route out the forces of the shiite extremisttroublemaker moktada alsadr this did not seem like such a terrible idea at first glance , until it did n't work then the cia chief , gen michael hayden , showed up on meet the press and gave the impression that the americans had been blindsided by the whole affair at least in terms of being prebriefed or , having , you know , the normal planning process in which you build up to this days or weeks ahead of time even if there are only a halfdozen people in our embassy who are fluent in arabic \( you 'd think we 'd get cued in when the government starts a miniwar \( from today s times , however , we now know that the americans really were in on the planning what they got short notice on , it seems , was prime minister nuri kamal almaliki s decision to go with something more spurofthemoment this is the kind of freespirited approach that works well when the goal is , say , throwing a small dinner party for six friends but it tends to be less successful in matters like taking over a city by force then the real surprise came when instead of proceeding in a strategically intelligent way , maliki opted for the popular but controversial alternative of inept blundering none of this really bodes well for whoever s in the white house next year imagine president barack obama or president hillary clinton trying to extricate 158 , 000 men and women without benefit of the normal planning process in which you build up to this days or weeks ahead of time or , of course , if john mccain becomes president we can keep getting surprised for the next 100 years \( the story that mccain said he was prepared to stay in iraq for 100 years is on one level unfair , although this fall democrats will be featuring it in commercials about every six seconds what he was that he s prepared to keep troops stationed in iraq for 100 years as long as no one is injured or harmed or wounded or killed in the process which is another matter entirely estimates on how long mccain is prepared to stay if some injuring or harming or wounding or killing is involved are yet to come feel free to worry in advance
kabul , dozens of afghan men who were previously held by the united states at air base and , cuba , are now being tried here in secretive afghan criminal proceedings based mainly on allegations forwarded by the american military the prisoners are being convicted and sentenced to as much as 20 years' confinement in trials that typically run between half an hour and an hour , said human rights investigators who have observed them one early trial was reported to have lasted barely 10 minutes , an investigator said the prosecutions are based in part on a security law promulgated in 1987 , during the soviet occupation of afghanistan witnesses do not appear in court and cannot be crossexamined there are no sworn statements of their testimony instead , the trials appear to be based almost entirely on terse summaries of allegations that are forwarded to the afghan authorities by the united states military afghan security agents add what evidence they can , but the cases generally center on events that sometimes occurred years ago in war zones that the authorities may now be unable to reach these are nowitness paper trials that deny the defendants a fundamental fairtrial right to challenge the evidence and mount a defense , said sahr muhammedally , a lawyer for the advocacy group human rights first who has studied the proceedings so any convictions you get are fundamentally flawed the head of afghanistan s national intelligence agency , amrullah saleh , said his investigators did their best to develop their own evidence but he added that the afghan judicial system remained crippled by problems more than six years after the fall of the taliban this is afghanistan , he said referring to the afghan trials , he added , i am equally critical of that procedure , but who is supposed to fix it \? since 2002 the bush administration has pressed foreign governments to prosecute the guant namo prisoners from their countries as a condition of the men s repatriation but many of those governments including such close american allies as britain have objected , saying the american evidence would not hold up in their courts afghanistan represents perhaps the most notable exception although president hamid karzai refused to sign a decree law drafted with american help that would have allowed afghanistan to hold the former detainees indefinitely as enemy combatants , the afghan authorities have now tried 82 of the former prisoners since last october and referred more than 120 other cases for prosecution of the prisoners who have been through the makeshift afghan court , 65 have been convicted and 17 acquitted , according to a report on the prosecutions by human rights first that is to be made public on thursday a draft copy of the report was provided to the new york times united states officials defended their role in providing information for the afghan trials as a legitimate way to try to contain the threats that some of the more dangerous detainees would pose if they were released outright these are not prosecutions that are being done at the request or behest of the united states government , said sandra l hodgkinson , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detention policy these are prosecutions that are being done by afghans for crimes committed on their territory by their nationals ms hodgkinson said the united states had pressed the afghan authorities to conduct the trials in a fair manner , and had insisted that lawyers be provided for the prisoners after the first 10 of them were convicted without legal representation but she did not directly reject the criticisms raised in the human rights first report , adding , these trials are much more consistent with the traditional afghan justice process than they are with ours the new court is located on the ground floor of a new highsecurity afghan prison that was built by the united states at pulicharki , on the outskirts of kabul although afghan officials say the trials there are not officially secret , they have allowed only three outside observers two human rights investigators and a representative of a local united nations office the human rights investigators were permitted to see two trials in february , review some trial documents and interview judges , prosecutors and defense lawyers for the court gen safiullah safi , the afghan army officer who runs the prison where the trials are being held , told a reporter that permission to view the trials could be granted only by mr karzai s office but that office referred the request to abdul jabar sabit , the afghan attorney general mr sabit s office finally said he was too busy to meet with a journalist the human rights investigators who observed the operations of the new court described them as a perversion of the efforts by afghanistan and the united states to rebuild and reform the afghan judicial system after years of war , corruption and neglect they said that the defense lawyers , who work for a legal aid organization based in new york , typically meet their clients five days before their trials begin and have few resources to investigate the distant events on which they turn at least some of the afghan judges also appear to accept the american allegations at face value , they said , and routinely admit allegations that would not pass the evidentiary standards of special military tribunals at guant namo , much less the federal courts of the united states the files provided by us authorities and the information in them would never have been admissible in a us court or even a military commission in guant namo , said jonathan horowitz , an investigator for one world research , a publicinterest investigations firm in new york that also monitored the afghan trials in an interview , one of the justices of the afghan supreme court argued that while the trials might have some flaws , they represented a fair process all of these trials have been prepared by our friends from the united states , said the justice , who uses the single name rashid they have seen it themselves we do n't have any doubts about the trial not being fair justice rashid added that he had complete confidence in the accuracy of the information that was being provided to afghan investigators by the american military i'm 100 percent sure that what was done by the united states was done according to the legal system of the united states , he said and i am familiar with the legal system of the united states but one case file that was partly reproduced in the human rights first report underscores questions that have been raised about the procedures of the afghan trials and the american evidence with which they begin in a single paragraph , the united states report of investigation recounts that the afghan prisoner rais mohammed khan was detained by the police as he and a friend tried to cross the afghan border in the eastern department of khost on may 1 , 2006 the report , which misidentifies mr khan by a name his father used , matelky , notes that he and his injured friend were suspected of having planned a suicide bombing that went awry their stories are conflicting , and the khost police force believe they are directly tied to suicide attacks that were taking place during the independence day parade in khost , the report reads it notes that mr khan appeared to lie on a polygraph examination when he denied involvement in suicide bombing but it adds confessions admissions incriminating statements none witnesses none physical evidence none photographs none also in his afghan court file was a onepage summary of the recommendation from the united states military panel that reviewed his case at bagram it describes him as a low threat to american and coalition forces and him as low prosecution value he was convicted under the 1987 afghan security law and sentenced to eight years in prison
beirut , lebanon islamist candidates won 24 of 50 seats in s parliamentary elections on saturday , a gain of two seats over their total in the last round of elections there two years ago , according to official results released sunday liberal candidates and their allies won seven seats , one fewer than in the last round none of the 27 women who ran won in what was the second election since women were granted the right to vote and run for office in 2005 economic issues dominated the monthlong election campaign , and it was not clear how the islamists' greater share of power would affect the kuwaiti parliament , one of the most powerful and active legislatures in the arab world there are no legally recognized political parties in kuwait , and affiliation is flexible it s a sign of a more conservative mood in the society , said nasser alsane , an islamist candidate who won a seat but to have a conservative color does not mean that we are against economic reform tribally oriented candidates , who , like islamists , tend to be conservative on social issues , also did well , mr sane added kuwait s emir , sheik sabah alahmed alsabah , dissolved the parliament in march after cabinet ministers resigned , saying they were frustrated by repeated confrontations with lawmakers the election campaign itself was a striking departure from the past because of a new election law that reduced the number of districts to 5 from 25 , forcing candidates to take their messages to many more constituents lawmakers fought for the change in 2006 , arguing that the smaller districts allowed candidates to buy votes more easily voters chose up to four candidates in their respective districts the campaign relied heavily on the media , with new newspapers and satellite tv stations carrying election coverage intensively in the past , candidates depended mostly on personal ties with voters at diwaniyas , traditional evening social gatherings candidates from kuwait s minority shiite community won five seats , one more than the last round they were energized by a dispute in february when the authorities questioned former shiite members of the kuwaiti parliament who had sent condolences to the militant shiite group hezbollah after the assassination of imad mugniyah , one of its top commanders economic reform was an important issue for many voters despite its vast oil wealth , kuwait has let hospitals , schools and roads crumble , and some citizens would like to emulate the more vibrant private sectors of persian gulf neighbors like the united arab emirates and qatar about 360 , 000 people were eligible to vote of a population of 26 million foreigners more than a third of the population cannot vote
when the supreme court ruled in june that detainees at had the right to challenge their detention in federal court , the justices said that after more than six years of legal wrangling the prisoners should have their cases heard quickly because the costs of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held in custody but nearly four months later , as the bush administration has opened a new defense of its detention policies in federal court , none of the scores of cases brought by detainees have been resolved by any judge since the supreme court issued its ruling , lawyers for most of the 255 detainees in guant namo bay , cuba , have pressed ahead with lawsuits , yet most of those cases have been delayed by battles over issues like whether some court sessions will be held in secret , whether detainees can attend and what level of proof will justify detention some of the arguments made by the justice department appear to challenge the supreme court s conclusion that the federal courts have a role in deciding the fate of the detainees one bush administration argument asserts that only military officials not federal judges have the power to decide how to conclude wartime detentions officials and lawyers inside and outside of the government say the new legal confrontation suggests that the bush administration will most likely continue its defense of the detention camp until the end of president bush s term and is not likely to close the camp , as administration officials have said they would like to do the legal issues that are being raised by the administration are going to take longer than the remaining time of the administration to resolve , said vijay padmanabhan , an assistant professor at cardozo law school who was until july a state department lawyer with responsibility for detainee issues it is part of a broader strategy , mr padmanabhan added , which is not to make difficult decisions about guant namo and leave it to the next president detainees' advocates say that the administration is using the legal battle to delay judicial review of its evidence , while government lawyers argue that the cases are moving rapidly considering that they are unprecedented a justice department spokesman , erik ablin , said the government was working toward quick hearings for detainees , but was determined to take every precaution to avoid having dangerous people released he added that it is certainly the government s goal to detain enemy combatants who are deemed a threat to the united states habeas corpus suits , which have their root in centuriesold english law , are generally streamlined proceedings for prisoners to force officials to explain why they are being held the guant namo cases permitted by the supreme court s ruling , boumediene v bush , are to review the government s reasons for holding the men as enemy combatants the military s enemy combatant hearings , which the administration says permit indefinite detention , are separate from the pentagon s effort to prosecute some detainees in military commission trials a first test of a judge s power in a federal habeas case may come on tuesday during arguments in a case involving 17 detainees who claim a right to immediate release the path to court has been slow for the habeas cases , and most seem unlikely to reach resolution until well into the next president s administration , lawyers say in some cases , government lawyers are adding new grounds for holding the men , supplementing or replacing the accusations made during guant namo hearings four years ago lawyers say some of the government s arguments could create grounds for years of new appeals by the justice department many of the hurdles to moving the cases to court have been practical ones , including an initial shortage of justice department lawyers and the need to develop procedures for intelligence agencies to review classified evidence in august , justice department lawyers told the united states district court in washington that they could not meet their own deadline for providing initial responses to the cases the task has proven even more difficult than originally envisioned , said a justice department filing the new schedule called for initial responses to 50 cases a month beginning in september as a result , challenges by some detainees would not begin to move in the courts until january , the bush administration s last month in office mr ablin , the justice department spokesman , said accusations against detainees might need to be updated because of the changed legal landscape and because intelligence collection might have changed what is known about detainees it would be irresponsible , he said , not to update the courts with additional information gained over the past several years that proved links to terrorism the government is relying extensively on classified information that is quite likely to raise defense questions about how detainees can defend themselves since they are not permitted to see much of the evidence against them long a contentious issue in the military s hearings at guant namo bay time is on their side , matthew j maclean , a washington lawyer for four kuwaiti detainees , said of the government every day of delay is one more day our clients are in prison without a hearing the habeas case scheduled for a federal court hearing on tuesday involves 17 guant namo detainees who are ethnic , a restive muslim minority in western china in a separate case that was under way before the supreme court ruling in june , federal appeals judges issued a decision this summer that ridiculed as inadequate the pentagon s secret evidence for holding one of the uighurs , huzaifa parhat , a former fruit peddler who said he had gone to afghanistan to escape china since then , the pentagon has conceded that it would serve no useful purpose to continue to try to prove that any of the 17 uighurs were ever enemy combatants the uighurs say they have never been enemies of the united states , though they were in afghanistan in 2002 , where they were detained they say they would be persecuted or killed if they were returned to china the bush administration says it has failed to find another country willing to accept them on tuesday , a federal district judge , ricardo m urbina , is to hear an urgent claim by lawyers for the uighurs , that they should be released immediately into the united states since they are no longer considered enemy combatants the government argues that they should be held at guant namo until another country can be found to accept them in filings , the justice department lawyers make expansive arguments that , while judge urbina can hear the uighurs' case , he cannot order their release the judiciary simply has no authority to release the uighurs into the united states , one filing said the justice department said the government s executive branch , not the judicial branch , has the authority to conclude military detentions , as it has in prior wars it noted that in world war ii no court ever questioned that it was solely for the political branches not the courts to decide how italian prisoners of war were handled p sabin willett , one of the uighurs' lawyers , said such claims appeared to be laying the groundwork for government appeals in the event that a judge orders a detainee freed the first full court hearing examining the evidence in a habeas case this one involving six detainees at the center of the supreme court s june decision is scheduled for oct 27 still , hearings for the vast majority of the detainees are unscheduled the supreme court justices said in their june decision that the detainees were entitled to a prompt hearing , but did not specify how prompt mr willett said that while prompt might be open to interpretation , i think they meant more quickly than this
hard times at douglass high a report card is , despite that subtitle , a drawyourownconclusions sort of documentary the film , which has its premiere monday on , observes the 2005 school year at frederick douglass high in baltimore , a troubled institution that has not fared well in meeting the benchmarks established by no child left behind , president bush s education initiative but no child left behind occupies relatively little of the twohour film , which is by the veteran documentarians alan and susan raymond and the standard complaints about the law for instance that it forces schools to be preoccupied with test taking at the expense of more enriching types of education do n't seem to interest the raymonds instead they take lingering looks at douglass s teachers and administrators as they work and at its students as they , more often than not , do n't work though eventually the raymonds \( just barely \) take sides they seem not to be fans of mr bush s program their dismaying film is n't really asking whether no child left behind can help douglass it s asking whether anything can the film finds a few success stories among the school s 1 , 100 students , but it is filled largely with teenagers who are drowning in apathy and attitude , those who seem well beyond any to sir with lovestyle rescue it is filled as well with emptiness at backtoschool night for parents early in the school year the camera pans the auditorium it is largely empty at the christmas concert the school s wellregarded choir is belting out a lovely messiah , again to a largely empty auditorium against such obstacles , no child left behind seems at best a wellintentioned irrelevance in one of the film s starkest moments a young enthusiastic english teacher quits in the middle of the year , his third at the school it had been the year that i stopped seeing progress in kids , he says as he s packing up , the year i stopped finding the little joys he is not alone apparently 66 percent of the douglass educators are not certified , we 're told the school is running on substitutes and other emergency fillins and that is the bottom line for schools like this bureaucrats can make all the rules and set all the benchmarks they want , but none of it will change anything if no one can be found to do the handson work of teaching as seen in this film , it s not just a thankless job it looks disconcertingly as if it might be an impossible one a video v rit production produced and directed by alan raymond and susan raymond written and narrated by ms raymond mr raymond , cinematographer and editor for hbo john hoffman , senior producer sheila nevins , executive producer

you 're on the first tee of a memberguest tournament you 're the guest and your friend s buddies are standing around waiting as you warm up already , you feel like your golf swing is being silently analyzed for proper technique you want to do well and the first tee is a symbolic moment on the practice range a few minutes earlier , you felt smooth and confident , but now the first tee feels a world apart , full of tension and nerves worse , you just noticed that the windows of the pro shop and clubhouse dining room face the first tee box is everybody within five miles watching this tee shot \? what if you hit a big , embarrassing slice \? what if you dribble it \? what if oh , no you whiff it \? they call this the firsttee jitters , which sounds a bit wimpy for something so vexing in the theater , they give it a beefy name stage fright in golf , we ought to call it firsttee terror it s one of golf s most common maladies and even the great tiger woods has admitted to having it lee trevino once said the only people on the first tee of a pga tour event who were n't nervous were the volunteers keeping score gary player meditated on the first tee and ben hogan slowed his every movement on the first tee in caddyshack , rodney dangerfield told ted knight \( a k a judge smails \) i bet you slice into the woods , 100 ! responded knight gambling is illegal at bushwoods , sir , and i never slice and we all know what happened what s the source of all this angst and edginess \? and what can be done about it \? after interviewing dozens of people in the golf industry , i 've come to the conclusion that the first tee is simply the most common staging ground for an eternal golf conundrum at face value , it s such an easy task the ball , after all , is not only not moving , it is propped up on a tee but there is subtle and definable pressure typical golf pressure in making sure you do the eminently doable that s why i tell my students to step on the first tee , take a practice swing about three inches from the ball , immediately step closer and hit it , said butch harmon , rated the country s best golf teacher last year by golf digest there should n't be any more thought than that the other thing i tell them is this no one watching cares what you do golfers are too worried about what other people will think of them no one cares the other people are busy worrying about their own first shot the keepitsimple approach was the advice of a lot of teachers , although there were some clever tips for defusing the tension i tell people to take in the scenery because the first tee is usually an attractive spot with a view , said ben alexander , who operates a golf academy at poppy hills golf course in pebble beach , calif it s a game , right \? be happy you 're out there bryan jones , director of instruction at the david glenz golf academy in franklin , nj , said he encourages students to do a little homework first , making a visit to any golf course to watch other people tee off take 45 minutes to watch four or five groups hit off the first tee and you wo n't be worried about how you look anymore , jones said you might come away feeling pretty good about your ability level eddie merrins , the charismatic pro at belair country club , has for years advised golfers waiting on the first tee to toss a golf ball a few inches in the air and then catch it he says it has an almost hypnotic effect when done over and over and promotes a subliminal confidence other teachers felt that firsttee troubles actually start long before the ceremonial first tee box people should eat the right foods in the morning and then get to the golf course early so they 're not rushing around , said kylee naffziger of the bridger creek golf course in bozeman , mont , who , like alexander , is a nominee for the 2008 pga teacher of the year i see people arrive five minutes before their tee time would a baseball or basketball player arrive five minutes before a game , hop out of the car and expect to perform well \? the overriding consensus was that players should warm up on the range slowly , focused on tempo and rhythm only it s not the right time to start working on some new tip you received , alexander said and in the end , if nothing else works , be thankful you 're not a tour pro who has to tee off with thousands of people enveloping the tee box tom joyce , the director of golf at glen oaks club on long island , had a long career as a top competitive golfer last week , he recalled when he made the cut in the 1973 united states open at oakmont country club making his way through the crowd to start his third round , joyce arrived at the first tee and saw that fans several rows deep lined both sides of the first fairway i said to myself , 'my god , i'm going to kill somebody , ' joyce said my knees were shaking , and i felt my breathing getting short and then i just blanked out i do n't remember hitting that ball i still do n't remember it my muscles took over and knocked it into the fairway so there you have it hit it before thinking , try hypnosis or perhaps just blank out sounds like golf to me saturday night look for the final round
someday i may better understand the mechanics of the millennial mind until then i will wonder how shows like ghost whisperer keep going and a series like swingtown fails to catch on a period piece on cbs , swingtown nears the end of its summer run with a dwindling audience despite all the elements that seemed to point to its potential for popularity any network executive familiar with domino magazine would have been justified in thinking that swingtown , with its meticulous recreation of the 1970s living space , could easily attract every high earner from 34 to 56 , from tribeca to laurel canyon set in 1976 on the eve of the carter presidency and during the midnight of masscultural sexual mischief , swingtown reminds us what a rerun the american experience really is we make our beds more neatly now tuck our children into them more securely but in many ways the scent of mayhem is familiar has it ever felt quite so much like the mid'70s \? here we are on the brink of a turningpoint election , facing an oil crisis , tumbling employment , fears of stagflation , executive overreach at the same time trend watchers know that decorators have exhumed and repurposed trellis wallpaper , ceramic dogs , black lacquer and upholstery fabric that looks as if it has come from the cabin of a braniff 747 swingtown \( fridays at 10 pm \) takes place up in the milehigh club and down on the ground on chicago s suburban north shore , among three couples endangered more by viral class consciousness than by the rampant partner swapping suddenly in vogue tom and trina decker \( grant show and lana parrilla \) are the seasoned swingers , the match to the fire , a couple who conduct their marriage according to a contract that frees them to open and close the party as their jealousies ebb and encroach their dalliance with a wealthy exboyfriend of trina s muddled things for a bit , and tom s retaliatory gesture briefly made matters worse but the deckers maintain their equilibrium , we 're made to understand , because they keep to the era s code of compulsive honesty they live in the moment , and then , presumably , they talk about that moment , a lot trina is intoxicating all historical accuracy prettiness she seems to swim and wear sarongs as a vocation she is also kind and generous in a periodspecific way , anticipating who will need her nudges toward selfactualization most it serves her marriage well that she is the sort of a woman who never goes anywhere not to a downtown sex club or a branch of marshall field s worried that she might encounter someone thinner , younger , better made to wear jersey her new friend , susan miller \( molly parker \) , who has moved into a big house across the street , is mesmerized by her confidence susan s husband , bruce \( jack davenport \) , a dull , republican stock trader , meanwhile , is just mesmerized swinging is often referred to by its practitioners as the lifestyle , but swingtown has had the good sense to brush past its conceit , focusing instead on the tensions surrounding styles of living , absent the quotation marks the deckers and the millers get their foursome over with early on , settling into a traditional friendship primarily complicated by the thompsons janet and roger \( miriam shor and josh hopkins \) old neighbors of the millers from a less prosperous part of town where the lawns are stingy and the attitudes just as boxed in swingtown can occasionally feel like an assault by visual clich , but the dynamic captures culture wars just as they are incubating in 1976 newsweek ran a cover story declaring the year of the evangelical , marking a new era of national fissure janet conservative , churchgoing , always home baking and scrubbing the counters represents a distaste for a new world in which the elites are no longer just manning the command posts but also redefining what it means to have a good time though she initially seemed doomed to caricature , janet has bloomed into full human form , trying to accept her old friend s exploratory impulses while envying her new status the millers' rise has coincided with the thompsons' descent the recession has left roger without the job he never liked twelve years of selling insurance and i have n't had a day full of wonder yet , he told janet one morning roger wants more more meaning , more growth , more of what the decade has dangled before him and put up for sale that he silently sees it in susan , with her pale , blank , open beauty so far unsullied by the era s raunch and aspiration moves the narrative along to call swingtown a thriller is n't to mischaracterize it roger and susan are ticking bombs ambling toward the last second in 20thcentury life when you could still leave your family for the soul mate around the block and get away with it swingtown turns out to be a double entendre on the one hand it delivers the image of the '70s as a great big sexual playpen , and on the other it suggests a world where people might still leap from the aframe to the sprawling colonial , regardless of education or pedigree none of the principals appear to have gone to college bruce and susan married right out of high school , when she became pregnant with their daughter , laurie this being the '70s , it should go without saying that no one is paying attention to the children still , despite all the neglect , laurie is the most grating presence on the show because she is the vision of the dull , divided future she patronizes her mother for her tentative feminism and disdains her father for reading jaws her own summer pleasure runs toward kierkegaard as laurie s boyfriend explains to her when they 're watching the republican convention on tv , ford might have won the nomination , but reagan really is the one to watch swingtown is a nostalgia vehicle , but what it is nostalgic for is n't the epoch of roundtheclock spinthebottle for consenting adults it is wistful for the years in which it was still possible for rather average people to do extremely well tom is an airline pilot living in a modernist fantasy of a house with a view of lake michigan and a kidneyshaped pool but we know where the

some playoff series are so grueling and punishing that the winner limps forward to the next round the bonerattling match between the and the is one of them after winning game 5 on thursday in san jose , the sharks lead the series , three games to two , and could close it out sunday night in calgary the sharks entered the playoffs as the hottest team in the league the flames backed in , clinching a spot on a night when they lost when the puck dropped for game 1 , none of that mattered calgary crashed and banged to a 32 victory with their backs already to the wall , the sharks bounced back with 43 shots on miikka kiprusoff in game 2 , a 20 shutout for evgeni nabokov calgary replied in game 3 with the hit san jose had taken a 30 lead early in the first period at 12 minutes 54 seconds of the first , flames defenseman cory sarich rocked the sharks' captain , patrick marleau , with an unpenalized check along the boards that left him bloodied the sharks wilted calgary goals by jarome iginla , daymond langkow , dion phaneuf and owen nolan followed , and the flames had a stunning 43 victory nabokov had a frank assessment after the game you have to be men to play this sport , not a bunch of boys , he told reporters we looked like a bunch of boys out there , and they were looking like a bunch of men game 4 brought the goal the sharks played a manly game , holding calgary to 10 shots on goal with the score at 22 and the game seemingly headed toward overtime , san jose s best player , joe thornton , tipped a shot from the blue line by defenseman douglas murray and scored his first goal of the series with 94 seconds left in regulation that was about as relentless as i 've ever seen our team play , sharks coach ron wilson told the san jose mercury news you put that game in a vault and whenever you need to show a team how to play hockey , you say , watch this right here' pummeled to victory if you outhit the other team , you will win that is one of hockey s most basic assumptions , but statistical studies have shown it to be untrue once again this spring , the results on the ice illustrate that dishing out physical punishment may be entirely beside the point when it comes to winning games through the first 35 games of this season s playoffs , the team that held the advantage in hits won 16 times and lost 17 \( the hit count was equal in two other games \) that record included such extreme examples as those of thursday night , when colorado beat minnesota , 32 , despite being outhit , 2412 , and boston trounced montreal , 51 , despite being on the short side of a 3621 hit differential those figures are not unusual recent statistical studies have shown that teams that are outhit tend to win more often than those that like to take the body dirk hoag , proprietor of the blog , found that in the 20067 season the statistical correlation between winning and being outhit was a suggestive minus023 \( a correlation of minus10 would have shown an absolute and perfect relationship , while a plus10 would have shown that outhitting the other team inevitably leads to victory \) for the 20056 season , he found a still stronger minus040 correlation body checks are certainly thrilling to watch alex ovechkin of washington has averaged 65 hits a game this postseason , followed closely by such disparate talents as the rangers' dan girardi , the stars' st phane robidas , the flames' dion phaneuf and the bruins' milan lucic but their overall effectiveness is questionable , as many physically beatenup teams that have hoisted the stanley cup can testify out of playoffs , and job kevin lowe of the edmonton oilers is now the sole member of the fraternity of nhl general managers of nonplayoff canadian teams john ferguson jr was eliminated from the club before his toronto maple leafs were eliminated from the playoffs last week , dave nonis , 41 , was shown the door when his vancouver canucks tumbled from first place in the northwest division and missed the playoffs by 3 points only a year earlier , the canucks set franchise records with 49 wins and 105 points and battled behind goaltender roberto luongo to the second round of the playoffs it was a shining achievement for nonis , who made what is considered a wildly lopsided trade for luongo shortly after being appointed before the 20056 season but the canucks had missed the playoffs in nonis s first season , too , and though the team s defense was hobbled by injuries most of this season , the canucks' new lead owner , the real estate magnate francesco aquilini , concluded that new leadership was in order i think our fans deserve better , he said though aquilini said no one specific thing was behind the firing , it was doubtful nonis would be scanning the classifieds if the canucks had held on to a playoff spot nonis said he was loath to sacrifice the canucks' future for a shortterm fix at the trade deadline would i make deals to save myself \?

st petersburg , fla so many emotions have washed over the this season , most of them negative they let august go by without much of a fight , but there is one last chance to make a playoff push they are hopeful now , because there is no other choice i think we 've gone through the frustrating and disappointing points , general manager brian cashman said during batting practice tuesday the focus is on the small things concentrating on today s game , trying to pick up a game a week and get to fenway park and making that series meaningful that s the simple way to look at it cashman continued is it too much to ask to pick up a game a week , or something along those lines \? it s not out of the realm of possibility it is unlikely , but not impossible , especially if the yankees play the way they did at tropicana field in a 72 victory over the firstplace mike mussina worked six innings , improving to 177 as he seeks his first 20win season joba chamberlain returned from a shoulder injury , collecting four outs in the seventh and the eighth , and alex rodriguez ripped his 548th home run , tying mike schmidt for 12th on the career list the yankees trail the by 11 games in the american league east and remain seven behind the boston red sox for the wild card they are also chasing the secondplace team in the al central for the wild card yet the yankees play the chicago white sox four times in their final home stand , and finish the schedule with the series in boston that cashman referenced picking up a game a week on the red sox would leave the yankees three back with three to play well , that s no pressure , mussina said we pick up a game a week and then we 've got to sweep them in boston let s just win on the day we 've got to play it s that simple mussina earned his 15th win on aug 7 the yankees won his next four starts , but he had a no decision in three of them mussina has the most career victories of any pitcher without a 20win season , with 267 one more than bob feller that underscores mussina s durability , and also points out bad luck mussina won 19 games in the strikeshortened 1995 season , and armando ben tez blew the save in his wouldbe 20th win for the baltimore orioles the next year twenty victories seemed farfetched at this time last season , when mussina was bumped to the bullpen but with improved health , 2008 has been a renaissance it s just fun again , mussina said it was so frustrating last year , it was miserable it s fun to be able to throw the ball where you want to throw it and do what you want to do none of that was happening last year at 38 , mussina does it differently than the rays' matt garza , who throws a searing fastball that bores in toward the shins of righthanded hitters against derek jeter in the first inning , he threw three successive sinkers at 94 , 95 and 96 miles per hour jeter popped to right , and through three innings , garza allowed only an infield single he received spectacular defense in the second inning from b j upton , who snagged a drive by rodriguez at the warning track in center field on a full sprint , with his back to the infield , climbing the wall to stop his momentum that might have been his best catch , rays manager joe maddon said but garza tired over the fourth and the fifth , and he was gone in the sixth after 100 pitches the most damaging was a high fastball to xavier nady , who hit it off the second catwalk high above left in the fourth inning it was the ninth homer in 35 games with the yankees for nady , who was playing for the first time at the rays' quirky dome i 've never been a guy to really watch where it goes , but i did see that it bounced , and i did n't know if it was in play , nady said luckily , it bounced over , so i kind of relaxed i think it landed in the first or second row the homer put the yankees ahead , 31 , and gave mussina all the support he needed he was not crisp , allowing 10 hits , but he struck out eight , and the rays left a runner in scoring position four times mussina had four called strikeouts , and he credited catcher jos molina for helping him never known for praising umpires , mussina seemed just fine with brian runge s strike zone jos was presenting the ball real well , mussina said sometimes , if you make the ball look good , you get some calls mussina left after two doubles in the seventh , and d maso marte got two outs chamberlain retired rocco baldelli on a fielder s choice , but he seemed rusty in a scoreless eighth i was n't over the rubber , my hands were latebreaking , chamberlain said you name it , it was pretty bad the yankees could probably say the same thing about their season in general but on nights like this , they seem determined to make the most of what remains
sixtyone years ago , george marshall announced the plan that would come to bear his name much of europe lay in ruins the united states faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination this menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy life on an unimaginable scale the soviet union did n't yet have an atomic bomb , but before long it would the challenge facing the greatest generation of americans the generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield was how to contain this threat while extending freedom s frontiers leaders like truman and acheson , kennan and marshall , knew that there was no single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom we needed a new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and dangerous world such a strategy would join overwhelming military strength with sound judgment it would shape events not just through military force , but through the force of our ideas through economic power , intelligence and diplomacy it would support strong allies that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy open markets and the rule of law it would foster new international institutions like the united nations , nato , and the world bank , and focus on every corner of the globe it was a strategy that saw clearly the world s dangers , while seizing its promise as a general , marshall had spent years helping fdr wage war but the marshall plan which was just one part of this strategy helped rebuild not just allies , but also the nation that marshall had plotted to defeat in the speech announcing his plan , he concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations but rather with questions and a call for perspective the whole world of the future , marshall said , hangs on a proper judgment to make that judgment , he asked the american people to examine distant events that directly affected their security and prosperity he closed by asking what is needed \? what can best be done \? what must be done \? what is needed \? what can best be done \? what must be done \? today s dangers are different , though no less grave the power to destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the hands of terrorists the future of our security and our planet is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas from the cavespotted mountains of northwest pakistan , to the centrifuges spinning beneath iranian soil , we know that the american people cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military alone the attacks of september 11 brought this new reality into a terrible and ominous focus on that bright and beautiful day , the world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our cold war victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble , and twisted steel , and clouds of smoke but the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and determination of our nation at blood banks and vigils in schools and in the united states congress , americans were united more united , even , than we were at the dawn of the cold war the world , too , was united against the perpetrators of this evil act , as old allies , new friends , and even longtime adversaries stood by our side it was time once again for america s might and moral suasion to be harnessed it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an everchanging world imagine , for a moment , what we could have done in those days , and months , and years after 9 11 we could have deployed the full force of american power to hunt down and destroy osama bin laden , al qaeda , the taliban , and all of the terrorists responsible for 9 11 , while supporting real security in afghanistan we could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world , and updated a 20th century nonproliferation framework to meet the challenges of the 21st we could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in alternative sources of energy to grow our economy , save our planet , and end the tyranny of oil we could have strengthened old alliances , formed new partnerships , and renewed international institutions to advance peace and prosperity we could have called on a new generation to step into the strong currents of history , and to serve their country as troops and teachers , peace corps volunteers and police officers we could have secured our homelandinvesting in sophisticated new protection for our ports , our trains and our power plants we could have rebuilt our roads and bridges , laid down new rail and broadband and electricity systems , and made college affordable for every american to strengthen our ability to compete we could have done that instead , we have lost thousands of american lives , spent nearly a trillion dollars , alienated allies and neglected emerging threats all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we have given them what s missing in our debate about iraq what has been missing since before the war began is a discussion of the strategic consequences of iraq and its dominance of our foreign policy this war distracts us from every threat that we face and so many opportunities we could seize this war diminishes our security , our standing in the world , our military , our economy , and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century by any measure , our singleminded and openended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction to seize this moment s promise instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face , i want to overcome them instead of pushing the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military , i want to use all elements of american power to keep us safe , and prosperous , and free instead of alienating ourselves from the world , i want america once again to lead as president , i will pursue a tough , smart and principled national security strategy one that recognizes that we have interests not just in baghdad , but in kandahar and karachi , in tokyo and london , in beijing and berlin i will focus this strategy on five goals essential to making america safer ending the war in iraq responsibly finishing the fight against al qaeda and the taliban securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states achieving true energy security and rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century my opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor , and we all respect his sacrifice we both want to do what we think is best to defend the american people but we 've made different judgments , and would lead in very different directions that starts with iraq i opposed going to war in iraq senator mccain was one of washington s biggest supporters for war i warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism , and distract us from the fight against al qaeda and the taliban senator mccain claimed that we would be greeted as liberators , and that democracy would spread across the middle east those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic question since the end of the cold war now , all of us recognize that we must do more than look back we must make a judgment about how to move forward what is needed \? what can best be done \? what must be done \? senator mccain wants to talk of our tactics in iraq i want to focus on a new strategy for iraq and the wider world it has been 18 months since president bush announced the surge as i have said many times , our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence general petraeus has used new tactics to protect the iraqi population we have talked directly to sunni tribes that used to be hostile to america , and supported their fight against al qaeda shiite militias have generally respected a ceasefire those are the facts , and all americans welcome them for weeks , now , senator mccain has argued that the gains of the surge mean that i should change my commitment to end the war but this argument misconstrues what is necessary to succeed in iraq , and stubbornly ignores the facts of the broader strategic picture that we face in the 18 months since the surge began , the strain on our military has increased , our troops and their families have borne an enormous burden , and american taxpayers have spent another 200 billion in iraq that s over 10 billion each month that is a consequence of our current strategy in the 18 months since the surge began , the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated june was our highest casualty month of the war the taliban has been on the offensive , even launching a brazen attack on one of our bases al qaeda has a growing sanctuary in pakistan that is a consequence of our current strategy in the 18 months since the surge began , as i warned at the outset iraq s leaders have not made the political progress that was the purpose of the surge they have not invested tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to rebuild their country they have not resolved their differences or shaped a new political compact that s why i strongly stand by my plan to end this war now , prime minister maliki s call for a timetable for the removal of us forces presents a real opportunity it comes at a time when the american general in charge of training iraq s security forces has testified that iraq s army and police will be ready to assume responsibility for iraq s security in 2009 now is the time for a responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes iraq s leaders toward a political solution , rebuilds our military , and refocuses on afghanistan and our broader security interests george bush and john mccain do n't have a strategy for success in iraq they have a strategy for staying in iraq they said we could n't leave when violence was up , they say we ca n't leave when violence is down they refuse to press the iraqis to make tough choices , and they label any timetable to redeploy our troops surrender , even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government not to a terrorist enemy theirs is an endless focus on tactics inside iraq , with no consideration of our strategy to face threats beyond iraq s borders at some point , a judgment must be made iraq is not going to be a perfect place , and we do n't have unlimited resources to try to make it one we are not going to kill every al qaeda sympathizer , eliminate every trace of iranian influence , or stand up a flawless democracy before we leave general petraeus and ambassador crocker acknowledged this to me when they testified last april that is why the accusation of surrender is false rhetoric used to justify a failed policy in fact , true success in iraq victory in iraq will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down their arms true success will take place when we leave iraq to a government that is taking responsibility for its future a government that prevents sectarian conflict , and ensures that the al qaeda threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not reemerge that is an achievable goal if we pursue a comprehensive plan to press the iraqis stand up to achieve that success , i will give our military a new mission on my first day in office ending this war let me be clear we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months that would be the summer of 2010 one year after iraqi security forces will be prepared to stand up two years from now , and more than seven years after the war began after this redeployment , we 'll keep a residual force to perform specific missions in iraq targeting any remnants of al qaeda protecting our service members and diplomats and training and supporting iraq s security forces , so long as the iraqis make political progress we will make tactical adjustments as we implement this strategy that is what any responsible commanderinchief must do as i have consistently said , i will consult with commanders on the ground and the iraqi government we will redeploy from secure areas first and volatile areas later we will commit 2 billion to a meaningful international effort to support the more than 4 million displaced iraqis we will forge a new coalition to support iraq s future one that includes all of iraq s neighbors , and also the united nations , the world bank , and the european union because we all have a stake in stability and we will make it clear that the united states seeks no permanent bases in iraq this is the future that iraqis want this is the future that the american people want and this is what our common interests demand both america and iraq will be more secure when the terrorist in anbar is taken out by the iraqi army , and the criminal in baghdad fears iraqi police , not just coalition forces both america and iraq will succeed when every arab government has an embassy open in baghdad , and the child in basra benefits from services provided by iraqi dinars , not american tax dollars and this is the future we need for our military we cannot tolerate this strain on our forces to fight a war that has n't made us safer i will restore our strength by ending this war , completing the increase of our ground forces by 65 , 000 soldiers and 27 , 000 marines , and investing in the capabilities we need to defeat conventional foes and meet the unconventional challenges of our time so let s be clear senator mccain would have our troops continue to fight tour after tour of duty , and our taxpayers keep spending 10 billion a month indefinitely i want iraqis to take responsibility for their own future , and to reach the political accommodation necessary for longterm stability that s victory that s success that s what s best for iraq , that s what s best for america , and that s why i will end this war as president in fact as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain the central front in the war on terror is not iraq , and it never was that s why the second goal of my new strategy will be taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan it is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3 , 000 americans were killed on our soil , the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large osama bin laden and ayman alzawahari are recording messages to their followers and plotting more terror the taliban controls parts of afghanistan al qaeda has an expanding base in pakistan that is probably no farther from their old afghan sanctuary than a train ride from washington to philadelphia if another attack on our homeland comes , it will likely come from the same region where 9 11 was planned and yet today , we have five times more troops in iraq than afghanistan senator mccain said just months ago that afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to iraq i could not disagree more our troops and our nato allies are performing heroically in afghanistan , but i have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to iraq that s what the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said earlier this month and that s why , as president , i will make the fight against al qaeda and the taliban the top priority that it should be this is a war that we have to win i will send at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan , and use this commitment to seek greater contributions with fewer restrictions from nato allies i will focus on training afghan security forces and supporting an afghan judiciary , with more resources and incentives for american officers who perform these missions just as we succeeded in the cold war by supporting allies who could sustain their own security , we must realize that the 21st century s frontlines are not only on the field of battle they are found in the training exercise near kabul , in the police station in kandahar , and in the rule of law in herat moreover , lasting security will only come if we heed marshall s lesson , and help afghans grow their economy from the bottom up that s why i 've proposed an additional 1 billion in nonmilitary assistance each year , with meaningful safeguards to prevent corruption and to make sure investments are made not just in kabul but out in afghanistan s provinces as a part of this program , we 'll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppygrowing for afghan farmers , just as we crack down on heroin trafficking we cannot lose afghanistan to a future of narcoterrorism the afghan people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring , because the security of afghanistan and the united states is shared the greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of pakistan , where terrorists train and insurgents strike into afghanistan we cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary , and as president , i wo n't we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan , pakistan and nato to secure the border , to take out terrorist camps , and to crack down on crossborder insurgents we need more troops , more helicopters , more satellites , more predator drones in the afghan border region and we must make it clear that if pakistan cannot or will not act , we will take out highlevel terrorist targets like bin laden if we have them in our sights make no mistake we ca n't succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy we must expect more of the pakistani government , but we must offer more than a blank check to a general who has lost the confidence of his people it s time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the pakistani people that s why i'm cosponsoring a bill with joe biden and richard lugar to triple nonmilitary aid to the pakistani people and to sustain it for a decade , while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaeda we must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience , or face mounting popular opposition in a nucleararmed nation at the nexus of terror and radical islam only a strong pakistani democracy can help us move toward my third goal securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states one of the terrible ironies of the iraq war is that president bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active nuclear program but the fact that the president misled us into a misguided war does n't diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction in fact , it has only increased it in those years after world war ii , we worried about the deadly atom falling into the hands of the kremlin now , we worry about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium some of it poorly secured at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries now , we worry about the breakdown of a nonproliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the cold war now , we worry most of all about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world s deadliest weapons to the world s most dangerous people terrorists who wo n't think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in tel aviv or moscow , in london or new york we cannot wait any longer to protect the american people i 've made this a priority in the senate , where i worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials i 'll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term as president and i 'll develop new defenses to protect against the 21st century threat of biological weapons and cyberterrorism threats that i 'll discuss in more detail tomorrow beyond taking these immediate , urgent steps , it s time to send a clear message america seeks a world with no nuclear weapons as long as nuclear weapons exist , we must retain a strong deterrent but instead of threatening to kick them out of the g8 , we need to work with russia to take us and russian ballistic missiles off hairtrigger alert to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material to seek a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons and to expand the usrussian ban on intermediaterange missiles so that the agreement is global by keeping our commitment under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , we 'll be in a better position to press nations like north korea and iran to keep theirs in particular , it will give us more credibility and leverage in dealing with iran we cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that support terror preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons is a vital national security interest of the united states no tool of statecraft should be taken off the table , but senator mccain would continue a failed policy that has seen iran strengthen its position , advance its nuclear program , and stockpile 150 kilos of low enriched uranium i will use all elements of american power to pressure the iranian regime , starting with aggressive , principled and direct diplomacy diplomacy backed with strong sanctions and without preconditions there will be careful preparation i commend the work of our european allies on this important matter , and we should be full partners in that effort ultimately the measure of any effort is whether it leads to a change in iranian behavior that s why we must pursue these tough negotiations in full coordination with our allies , bringing to bear our full influence including , if it will advance our interests , my meeting with the appropriate iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing we will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the iranian regime instead , we will present a clear choice if you abandon your nuclear program , support for terror , and threats to israel , there will be meaningful incentives if you refuse , then we will ratchet up the pressure , with stronger unilateral sanctions stronger multilateral sanctions in the security council , and sustained action outside the un to isolate the iranian regime that s the diplomacy we need and the iranians should negotiate now by waiting , they will only face mounting pressure the surest way to increase our leverage against iran in the longrun is to stop bankrolling its ambitions that will depend on achieving my fourth goal ending the tyranny of oil in our time one of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil we ship nearly 700 million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil it pays for terrorist bombs going off from baghdad to beirut it funds petrodiplomacy in caracas and radical madrasas from karachi to khartoum it takes leverage away from america and shifts it to dictators this immediate danger is eclipsed only by the longterm threat from climate change , which will lead to devastating weather patterns , terrible storms , drought , and famine that means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty africa , the middle east , and south asia most disastrously , that could mean destructive storms on our shores , and the disappearance of our coastline this is not just an economic issue or an environmental concern this is a national security crisis for the sake of our security and for every american family that is paying the price at the pump we must end this dependence on foreign oil and as president , that s exactly what i 'll do small steps and political gimmickry just wo n't do i 'll invest 150 billion over the next ten years to put america on the path to true energy security this fund will fast track investments in a new green energy business sector that will end our addiction to oil and create up to 5 million jobs over the next two decades , and help secure the future of our country and our planet we 'll invest in research and development of every form of alternative energy solar , wind , and biofuels , as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe and from the moment i take office , i will let it be known that the united states of america is ready to lead again never again will we sit on the sidelines , or stand in the way of global action to tackle this global challenge i will reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new global energy forum that will lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols we will also build an alliance of oilimporting nations and work together to reduce our demand , and to break the grip of opec on the global economy we 'll set a goal of an 80 reduction in global emissions by 2050 and as we develop new forms of clean energy here at home , we will share our technology and our innovations with all the nations of the world that is the tradition of american leadership on behalf of the global good and that will be my fifth goal rebuilding our alliances to meet the common challenges of the 21st century for all of our power , america is strongest when we act alongside strong partners we faced down fascism with the greatest wartime alliance the world has ever known we stood shoulder to shoulder with our nato allies against the soviet threat , and paid a far smaller price for the first gulf war because we acted together with a broad coalition we helped create the united nations not to constrain america s influence , but to amplify it by advancing our values now is the time for a new era of international cooperation it s time for america and europe to renew our common commitment to face down the threats of the 21st century just as we did the challenges of the 20th it s time to strengthen our partnerships with japan , south korea , australia and the world s largest democracy india to create a stable and prosperous asia it s time to engage china on common interests like climate change , even as we continue to encourage their shift to a more open and marketbased society it s time to strengthen nato by asking more of our allies , while always approaching them with the respect owed a partner it s time to reform the united nations , so that this imperfect institution can become a more perfect forum to share burdens , strengthen our leverage , and promote our values it s time to deepen our engagement to help resolve the arabisraeli conflict , so that we help our ally israel achieve true and lasting security , while helping palestinians achieve their legitimate aspirations for statehood and just as we renew longstanding efforts , so must we shape new ones to meet new challenges that s why i 'll create a shared security partnership program a new alliance of nations to strengthen cooperative efforts to take down global terrorist networks , while standing up against torture and brutality that s why we 'll work with the african union to enhance its ability to keep the peace that s why we 'll build a new partnership to roll back the trafficking of drugs , and guns , and gangs in the americas that s what we can do if we are ready to engage the world we will have to provide meaningful resources to meet critical priorities i know development assistance is not the most popular program , but as president , i will make the case to the american people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common security of the entire world that was true with the marshall plan , and that must be true today that s why i 'll double our foreign assistance to 50 billion by 2012 , and use it to support a stable future in failing states , and sustainable growth in africa to halve global poverty and to roll back disease to send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says , you matter to us your future is our future and our moment is now this must be the moment when we answer the call of history for eight years , we have paid the price for a foreign policy that lectures without listening that divides us from one another and from the world instead of calling us to a common purpose that focuses on our tactics in fighting a war without end in iraq instead of forging a new strategy to face down the true threats that we face we cannot afford four more years of a strategy that is out of balance and out of step with this defining moment none of this will be easy , but we have faced great odds before when general marshall first spoke about the plan that would bear his name , the rubble of berlin had not yet been built into a wall but marshall knew that even the fiercest of adversaries could forge bonds of friendship founded in freedom he had the confidence to know that the purpose and pragmatism of the american people could outlast any foe today , the dangers and divisions that came with the dawn of the cold war have receded now , the defeat of the threats of the past has been replaced by the transnational threats of today we know what is needed we know what can best be done we know what must done now it falls to us to act with the same sense of purpose and pragmatism as an earlier generation , to join with friends and partners to lead the world anew
baghdad s cabinet on sunday overwhelmingly approved a proposed security agreement that calls for a full withdrawal of american forces from the country by the end of 2011 the cabinet s decision brings a final date for the departure of american troops a significant step closer after more than five and a half years of war the proposed pact must still be approved by iraq s parliament , in a vote scheduled to take place in a week but leaders of some of the largest parliamentary blocs expressed confidence that with the backing of most shiites and kurds they had enough support to ensure its approval twentyseven of the 28 cabinet ministers who were present at the twoandahalfhour session voted in favor of the pact nine ministers were absent the nearly unanimous vote was a victory for the dominant shiite party and its kurdish partners widespread sunni opposition could doom the proposed pact even if it has the votes to pass , as it would call into question whether there was a true national consensus , which shiite leaders consider essential the proposed agreement , which took nearly a year to negotiate with the united states , not only sets a date for american troop withdrawal , but puts new restrictions on american combat operations in iraq starting jan 1 and requires an american military pullback from urban areas by june 30 those hard dates reflect a significant concession by the departing bush administration , which had been publicly averse to timetables iraq also obtained a significant degree of jurisdiction in some cases over serious crimes committed by americans who are off duty and not on bases in washington , the white house welcomed the vote as an important and positive step and attributed the agreement itself to security improvements in the past year throughout the negotiations , the shiite parties and the prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , under pressure from forces both within and outside the country , had been trying to strike a balance in forging a viable agreement with the americans that would guarantee iraq s security and that would still stand firm against what many , including neighboring iran , consider a hostile force that has occupied iraq since the spring 2003 invasion that toppled saddam hussein this vote shows that the iraqis have figured out how to stand up for themselves , to iran and to the us , said michael e o'hanlon , a specialist on iraq at the brookings institution they will have stared in the face at the various options and concluded that none are ideal , but the best for their security is an amount of ongoing but finite american cooperation , while also indicating their strong desire to run their own country on their own as soon as possible american officials said the accord was the result of tough bargaining by the iraqis speaking about the negotiations a few days before the cabinet vote , ryan c crocker , the american ambassador , said of the 100 requests for changes sought by the iraqi side in recent weeks some were substantive , some were linguistic , some were stylistic we looked at it all we were as forthcoming as we could possibly be in responding some iraqi shiite politicians said a significant factor in the cabinet decision was the approval of the pact by grand ayatollah ali alsistani , the most influential shiite cleric in iraq , who from the outset had laid down three conditions full iraqi sovereignty , transparency and majority support for the pact sheik dhia aldin alfayyadh , a member of the islamic supreme council of iraq , one of the largest shiite parties , said the ayatollah did not consent until a delegation of shiite leaders visited him on saturday to assure him that those conditions were met we told him that we had got as close as we could possibly get , mr fayyadh said we did n't get everything , but almost ali aldabbagh , the iraqi government spokesman , said the agreement allowed for the possibility that american forces could withdraw even earlier if iraqi forces were in a position to take over security responsibilities earlier he also said either side had the right to cancel the agreement with one year s notice several political analysts suggested that iranian opposition to the pact had softened because of the american presidential election victory of senator barack obama he has suggested a more diplomatic approach to tehran and has described a withdrawal timetable from iraq faster even than the one laid out in the security agreement , though recently he has qualified that stance if george bush s presidency were going to continue on through 2012 , i think people would be a lot more concerned , said karim sadjadpour , a middle east analyst at the carnegie endowment for international peace having this administration really lightens the blow for the iranians a section of the agreement that iraqi officials said barred the united states from launching attacks on neighboring countries from iraq also may have diminished iranian resistance we sent messages to neighboring countries to say , this is in our interest , ' said mr fayyadh , the shiite lawmaker specifically we spoke to the iranians and gave them guarantees that no one will use our country to attack you' there was no immediate reaction from iran to the vote in many ways , the vote can be seen as a calculated judgment by the iraqi leaders as to who , for now , is best positioned to guarantee their political survival it was the united states , after all , that helped usher many of the current iraqi leaders into power and , given the improved but still fragile security situation in the country , many still see a need for an american military presence the presence of american troops in iraq is governed by a united nations resolution that expires dec 31 if the pact is not approved and if the security council were to balk at extending it , the americans say their forces in iraq would have to cease operations as if to underscore the risks of no agreement , violence spiked in the two weeks leading up to the cabinet vote on sunday the heightened attacks included a car bombing that killed 10 in diyala province it remains unclear how hardened opponents of the agreement might respond , particularly followers of the antiamerican shiite cleric moktada alsadr after the cabinet vote , sadrist politicians , reiterating their opposition to the accord , claimed that as a procedural matter , parliamentary approval would require a twothirds majority supporters say a simple majority will suffice in a statement released sunday night , mr sadr sought once again to position himself as a nationalist opponent of the americanled forces i call on the iraqi parliament again to refuse this pact without hesitation because it is a deal to sell iraq and its people , said mr sadr , who in a statement at friday prayer last week also called for armed resistance against the americans many sunnis have opposed the pact for the opposite reason they worry that without the americans , they could be at the mercy of iraq s majority shiite population and , behind it , the iranians but tawafiq , the largest sunni bloc in parliament , appears to be divided a little more than a fourth of its members have said they will vote for the agreement , while leaders of the iraqi islamic party , tawafiq s largest member party , said they would not approve any agreement without a national referendum , an unlikely development the sole minister to vote against the pact on sunday was a sunni , and several of the nine ministers who were not present for the vote are sunni the sunnis are probably hoping for a better deal on other things , mr o'hanlon said possibly they 've concluded that this was going to pass anyway so they 'd rather take this antiamerican stance for their future political benefit several politicians said an obstacle to parliament s approval would be its failure to achieve a quorum , a chronic failing especially if lawmakers immediately left for saudi arabia on the annual hajj pilgrimage parliament quickly sought to thwart that possibility by banning members from traveling abroad on sunday , shiite legislators could barely conceal their delight in the halls of the parliament building , which still bears the marks of mr hussein s baathist government in the form of mosaics depicting american jet bombers flying over defiant iraqi soldiers in a sign of their newfound boldness with the americans , they referred to the pact as the withdrawal agreement hadi alameri , a shiite lawmaker who leads the badr organization , the onetime paramilitary wing of the supreme council , said shiites would seek widespread consensus in parliament he also cautioned that they expected a possibly violent reaction from rejectionists , which would have happened if we signed it , and if we did n't sign it
here s a quick roundup of notable developments related to perceived or projected links between dramatic events and global warming while the greenhouse basics remain clear \( more co2 warmer world \) , the connection between the trend and dramatic events on short time scales the kind that catch our attention remains murky , at best none of this means global warming is unimportant to address all of this , though , does illustrate the challenge facing those trying to jog the public to respond now to limit a longterm risk there is no single smoking gun it remains more a seuratstyle pointillist canvas of evidence and pointillism does not have the potent punch of , say , the scream  tornadoes there was a spate of instanet attacks on senator john kerry yesterday for discussing projections of stronger storms in a warming world in the context of the catastrophic tornado strikes his comment was nuanced , but by even bringing climate policy into a conversation on severe weather , he was probably destined to get roughed up the reason \? the science remains utterly equivocal on how global warming might boost the longstanding peril from tornadoes in the storm belt there is no evidence of any trend in the number of potent tornadoes \( f2 and up \) over the past 50 years in the united states , even as global temperatures have risen markedly there has been one modeling study from nasa projecting that warming could make potent thunderstorms more powerful , and potentially tornado makers making analysis tougher , any trends in annual counts of tornadoes are clearly a function of shifting patterns of monitoring and reporting , not actual changes in the numbers of funnel clouds , according to several experts at the national severe storms laboratory the ballooning numbers of weak tornadoes in the chart above are known to be the result of more weather watchers , with more ways to report funnel clouds , as well as more radars and the like the steady drumbeat of potent twisters , which are easier to track , shows a declining trend , but that , too , the federal experts say , was likely the result of a change in data crunching , not a drop in actual tornado numbers as roger edwards , a forecaster at the federal storm prediction center in norman , okla , told me this morning , the data are not only soft , but spongy , in other words full of holes through and through update 2 10 08 the capital weather gang blog at the washington post has some more background on climate , statistics , and storms reefs natural temperaturelimiting processes may prevent ocean surface waters from warming past levels dangerous to corals , at least in some important regions , according to a study being published in geophysical research letters on saturday the researchers found that reefs in the warmest part of the pacific ocean holding some of the most diverse coral arrays on earth have not been adversely affected as global ocean and atmospheric temperatures have risen since 1980 the area , a vast stretch of atolls and shallows northeast of papua new guinea , is called the western pacific warm pool water temperature commonly approaches 88 degrees or so there appears to be a selflimiting thermostatlike effect that prevents further heating , and thus danger for corals , according to the authors , led by joan kleypas of the national center for atmospheric research increased evaporation could be removing heat , stirring cooling winds , and boosting cloudiness that could exert a parasollike effect computer simulations of the atmosphere and ocean , when run with rising greenhouse gases , show the warm pool heating at the same rate as other ocean regions , in contrast to what has been observed there so far , the researchers said climate change is damaging many corals , but it appears to be bypassing certain reefs that support some of the greatest diversity of life on the planet , dr kleypas said in a news release from the national science foundation in essence , reefs that are already in hot water may be more protected from warming than reefs that are not this is some rare hopeful news for these important ecosystems other recent research has shown that corals can bounce back from bleaching episodes , in which the algae partners of the reefbuilding organisms die from overheating it remains hard to define where in nature there is resilience and the ability to rebound , and where there are real thresholds beyond which big longlasting harms lie la ni a one thing that makes climate and weather experts relax , amid all the complexity in the seas and atmosphere , is the clarity that emerges when the pacific sloshes toward its hot el ni o phase or its cold la nina pattern wind and storm patterns shift in relatively predictable ways the latest analysis and forecast from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is out , and it doesn t bode well for water managers in the droughthammered southeast  we re in a cool la ni a phase at least through the spring , the experts said for the contiguous united states , potential impacts include aboveaverage precipitation in the northern rockies , the pacific northwest , and the ohio and tennessee valleys , they concluded belowaverage precipitation is expected across the south , particularly in the southeastern states
why did you join al qaeda \? praise to god and peace and blessing be upon god s prophet , his family , his companions and his allies as for the answer to your question , why did we join al qaeda \? we say , why should n't we join al qaeda \? god ordered us to be united , to be allied , to cooperate and fight against the idolaters in straight lines the same way they fight us in military allies and economic and political massgroupings why should n't we join our brothers while almost all these nations got united against the muslims and separated them , and divided their land , and took away al aksa mosque out of their hands , and consumed their goodness , and destroyed their morals \? then look at the crimes that happen in gaza and iraq and afghanistan , and somalia and others places these crimes are committed by the jewcrusader ally but when the muslims get together to defend themselves , they blame them for getting together and accused them with massgrouping , and made an approach about their unity yes , we see that it s our duty to join al qaeda so that we can have our fight under one flag and one leadership in order to get ready for the confrontation an ally is faced by another ally , and unity is faced by unity the joining was a legitimate necessity by the book of our god and the sunnah of our prophet , peace and blessing be upon him it was a mindful necessity imposed by the actual reality and the international system that is full with injustice against the muslims many analysts and observers are mistaken when they think that our joining was a result of secular accounts and self interests we are a jihadi ancestral community we rely on legitimacy \( from religion \) before anything else as a base of our decisions what have you gained from your relation with al qaeda , and conversely what has al qaeda gained from your joining \? as we mentioned in our previous answer that our joining to al qaeda was n't a deal that we try to gain something out of it , as many of those who call themselves experts in jihadi groups promote in reality , they are way far from the real understanding of the jihadi ancestral movement we say that we realized and we got from this joining many goals the most important one is that we believe that we won and acquired the pleasure of god by following his order god s says hold on to the rope of god and do not be dispersed if there was nothing to realize from this joining except following the order of this verse , we would never hesitate to do so secondly , we realized a condition and a reason for victory if difference and division are causes of weakness and defeat as it was mentioned in our religion and fall into no disputes , lest ye lose heart and your power departs \( koran chapter 8 , verse 46 \) unity is a reason of strength and victory this is a universal norm that even the infidels are aware of all these massgroupings and the international alliances are proof of that we muslims must be the ones who apply this universal norm thirdly , by this unity we brought grief and sorrow to our enemies the jews and apostates and crusaders these are some of the most important goals , which are many , thank god we hope that we got our god s pleasure , and the confidence of our nation , and that we made terrorized our enemy we understand that the correspondence between you , abdelmalek droukdal , and abu musab alzarqawi in 1994 and 1995 by email played a decisive role in your joining to al qaeda is that true \? the date that you mentioned is wrong maybe you meant the years 2004 and 2005 yes , we do n't deny the pivotal role of the martyr of the nation abu musab alzarqawi , may god bless him , in the joining operation since its first phases we ask god to reward him with the best reward for what he has done for islam , jihad , and for the nation nevertheless , we do n't underestimate the efforts of many of the brothers because the joining operation relied on other channels and contacts that other brothers participated in them may god reward them goodness on our behalf and islam s behalf did abu laith allibi and atiyah abdel rahman help in making your contact with al qaeda \? we do n't want to mention persons in particular , but there was a participation from many brothers to make the contact and there are many channels that allow us to do it thank god as we understand , you continue to communicate with qaeda leaders in waziristan is this true \? and what is the nature of the information you exchange \? we care about staying in contact with our brothers in afghanistan or iraq or any other jihad side our project is one therefore , we have to help , advise , consult each other , and exchange the experiences and coordinate the efforts to face the world s crusade war against islam does al qaeda give you any assistance \? and if so , what is the nature of this assistance \? we and al qaeda are one body it s normal that they get stronger by us and we get stronger by them they back us up and we back them up they supply us and we supply them with any kind of support , loyalty , advice and available support do you have any support in europe \? and if so , how much and what kind \? yes , there are people who are sympathetic with us in europe and elsewhere the muslims are sympathetic with al qaeda because its cause is just also , most of the muslims including those residing in europe are against the crusade war lead by america , and they hate the arab regimes that are working as agents and that crushed their people and sold the cause in the giveup market but what should be thought about is that whoever is arrested by the european governments in spain , france , britain or italy and allegedly say that they are related to our organization , all that is a lie , and deception , and injustice the problem is that the european government started judging the muslims about their intentions and their sympathy with the muslims' causes this comes from the crusade s religious hate that moves the west , and that blew up all the bright slogans that they hold dear , such as freedom , forgiveness , human rights and justice , those slogans that they hurt our hearing with for years how many active fighters do you have \? thank god we have enough fighters to make our enemies lose it does n't matter if they were in hundreds or thousands , because the numeric factor in the unification doctrine is the last and the weakest of the influencing factors in the equation of victory or defeat we have a holy koran and a pure sunnah the way of the prophet muhammad and a large history that has a balance of tests , and it s full with examples that prove that the victory of the believers during all past generations , since prophet moses until today , is from god god says there is no help except from god and god is exalted in power , wise \( chapter 8 , verse 10 \) and if god helps you , none can overcome you \( chapter 3 , verse 160 \) it s not from themselves or from their large number or arms lately , specifically in algeria , france left defeated in 1962 after the liberation war , even though the day it went out it was and still is a military superpower , the third or fourth power in the world meanwhile , the power of the mujahedeen in algeria went backward in the last few years of the revolution they were weaker when france went out , compared to the years that represent for the revolution its top power and hest ascendancy you see today many wars against islam in many places , and where barely a tracker finds any mentioned role of numeric superiority for the mujahedeen nevertheless , we stress that we possess a huge inventory of men this inventory gets wider , bigger and spreads with time we use it according to the necessity and according to our available material as far as the numbers that the interior ministry has given , the confusion and the contradiction that they contain make them unreliable and subject of ridicule between people where do your fighters come from \? the large proportion of our mujahedeen comes from algeria and there is a considerable number of mauritanians , libyans , moroccans , tunisians , mali s and nigerians brothers how many of your fighters have returned from fighting in iraq \? what the media is promoting about the existence of a large proportion of fighters in iraq that came back and joined us is wrong but there is a limited and very small number of the mujahedeen brothers who fought in iraq than came back and joined us how many men have joined your group after being released from prison through the government s amnesty program for convicted militants \? if you mean those who came back from iraq as i said their number is very limited and there is nobody among them that the government released but if you mean those whom the government released , within what you call reconciliation , and then joined the jihad , they are plenty , thanks to god and this is proof that the reconciliation program that algerian president bouteflika promotes has failed badly , and the matter of jihad is still alive inside the hearts of the muslims in algeria what are your goals \? god says , and fight them on until there is no more persecution , and religion becomes god s in its entirety \( chapter 8 , verse 39 \) our first goal is the arbitration of the lord of the world s law , and the achievement of the servitude to god our general goals are the same goals of al qaeda the mother , and you know them as far as our goals concerning the islamic maghreb , they are plenty but most importantly is to rescue our countries from the tentacles of these criminal regimes that betrayed their religion , and their people because they are all secretions of the colonialism that invaded our country in the last two centuries , and enabled those regimes to govern therefore , they started governing for its account and on behalf of it they implement its programs and protect its interests and fight islam on its behalf it s never going to be possible for this region to stabilize unless its people start enjoying freedom and dignity and security under islam the conditions of stability will not be available in the presence of these corrupt and harming models that proved for decades that they are unable to achieve the least rapprochement between their people in any of the areas we are one nation with one religion and one language our history is the same but our land is divided , torn apart into states by colonialism after half a century since independence , there is a clear deliberate action from the agents of colonialism in creating this rupture more than that , there are hidden intentions that enlarge and deepen the chasm between its people the sahara issue is the best witness about that what is strange is that the moroccan regime according to its claim seeks to annex the western sahara that is ruled by saharans in the mean time , it is as silent as an accomplice about the occupation of centa and melilla by the spanish crusaders the same thing applies for algeria , they claim that they strongly support the principle of the right of the people to decide their self determination , while a few days ago they refused to acknowledge the independence of kosovo from the criminal serbian entity even though the muslim people of kosovo chose to be independent in the elections that was supervised by the us administration and the un and nato therefore , one of our goals is to stop this tampering and make an end to these foolish and blind policies , and rescue our islamic maghreb from the project that was designed to destroy it also , we seek to liberate the islamic maghreb from the sons of france and spain and from all symbols of treason and employment for the outsiders , and protect it from the foreign greed and the crusader s hegemony do you intend to attack any american interests in algeria \? when we carried arms we declared that we are fighting the crusaders' agents among those rulers who came out against islam and committed crimes of corruption and tyranny and treason against the religion and the nation and we said that we want to bring back the place of islam in the country and the ruling of the koran over the people , and bring to the nation its rights that were taken but what happened later on is the west they provided it with all kind of support and encouraged it and supported it in the forums it did not stop there , it even went further to a direct intervention then we found ourselves on the black list of the us administration , tagged with terrorism then we found america building military bases in the south of our country and conducting military exercises , and plundering our oil and planning to get our gas also , opening an fbi branch in our capital city , and starting an unusual christian conversion campaign among our youths to change their religion in order to create religious minorities among us its embassy in algeria began playing almost the same role as the american embassies in baghdad or kabul it intervenes in the internal policy by planning , instructing and controlling all of that just to kill the spirit of jihad and resistance among the muslims so that it can put its hand on the energy stock that we have so did america leave us any choice with this flagrant aggression \? no doubt that the answer is going to be no therefore , it became our right and our duty to push away with all our strength this crusade campaign and declare clearly that the american interests are legitimate targets to us we will strive to strike them whenever we can and we are sure that america is going to loose its war against us like it lost it against afghanistan and iraq it s america that is unfair and that started evil and injustice injustice is the greatest cause of the disappearance of the countries even if they were muslims why not and america has the both infidelity and injustice and those who did wrong will know what they will endup with do you intend to carry out any attacks on american soil \? if the us administration sees that its war against the muslims is legitimate , then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate \? everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet we say to the american people who are driven to more catastrophes by the bush administration if you are truly looking for your security and safety then listen carefully to the speeches of our sheik and emir , osama bin laden , may god protect him , who advised you to stop supporting bush and his policies and to unseat your government that is invading the muslims' homes otherwise , bush and his administration will drive you to abyss and loss how strong is organization in the maghreb \? how much support do you have \? yes , we do have a lot of support from our islamic nation in the maghreb this generous nation that gave and still giving the best of its sons for the jihad without this support our fight against this puppet regime and its masters would n't last for 16 years continuously despite the french and the americans' material and information support , and despite the alliance of the maghreb regimes and the coast region against us the maghreb region is witnessing an awakening blessed jihad in mauritania , morocco , libya , nigeria , after the nation and its youths discovered the size of employment for the crusaders and the treason committed by this government against its people what is your view on the estimated 120 billion the algerian government has collected from oil and gas sales , and the criticism that the government has not spent this money on programs to help create jobs for algerians \? this is the greatest kind of crime and theft against our nation , and among the greatest methods of looting and robbery that these robber governments are characterized with the country is floating over a sea of oil and gas the size of the revenue never stopped getting larger , year after year , and month after month it s ironic that as the line is on the rise in oil revenues , the line of the living standards of the population is in decline it is logic that this situation drags us to ask this question where does the oil and gas money go \? the algerian finance minister months ago said he does n't know where is this money , and after a short time from this statement the supreme authority wanted to rectify this scandal , and then announced that 60 percent of this money is in the american banks and that 40 percent is distributed between britain and france and japan do you now know who is the first beneficiary of the 120 billion \? it s the american and european economy , and the way of the remaining percentage of the money is opposed by the senior thieves deployed in all the official institutions starting by the presidency of the republic , passing by the ministry of fuel and trade , and the ministry of defense which its generals conquer the drug trade , the smuggling of goods , transfer of property , looting of public money through embezzlement , bribery and types of commissions how is it possible for the country to benefit from this wealth if the president himself is considered to be a burglar with criminal records \? in the 1980s he was required by the court of suppress of economic crimes , and his story is well known in short , the beneficiaries of the energy revenues in the first place are the american and european economy , followed by the thieves that are ruling the country the rest is spent to fight the jihad and the mujahedeen by acquiring weapons that are directed only towards the chests of the muslims , and airplanes that do n't stop shelling the best children of the nation in the mountains as far as the conditions of the poor people , they will not change the poverty will remain plagued in the body of the nation the boats of death will remain throwing the desperate youths to the sea all the honorable in the nation , the intellectuals , unions , students and advocates should resist this plunder they should incite the nation for jihad and martyrdom in order to recover the rights taken away the muslim youths must not take the policy of escape and clandestine , they have to carry the weapon to take back their rights and push away the domination of those agents how do you respond to critics who say the algerian government has weakened your operational abilities , and that the passage of april 11 without a large attack was evidence of this \? the algerian government can lie to the public however it wants and it can make its effort to field facts but what can not be hidden is that its soldiers are killed constantly and that the bombs of the mujahedeen harvest dozens of them monthly and that the western interests cannot be protected , and that it will get its share also as we did with the un and the interpol headquarters and the embassy of israel in nouakchott , and the german hostages , then the austrians just as a reminder , this is not the first time that they repeat this talk for years , they described the mujahedeen as tattered and tearing but , during the recovery of the jihad in the last few years people discovered the size of the government s misleading of them with the complicity of the algerian press that is dependent , especially in what concerns the security news that is controlled by the intelligence agencies concerning the april 11th question and that we could n't strike this year in this date , of course we are not stupid to let our enemy define for us the date when we should strike but , by the strength from god , we define the date and the place the apostates and their masters have to wait for the strikes that the heroes of islam will generously do in the right place and time some people have criticized the december 11 attacks in algiers , saying innocent people were killed how do you justify this \? we are not insane to target our muslim brothers we left our homes and took this long and tiring road and we sacrificed ourselves and our efforts and our time only to defend the muslims and to preserve their lives and their holy sites this lie that the media is repeating about us is very untrue , and its objective is to mangle us and to isolate us from the nation so that they would n't sympathized with us if we really wanted to strike the civilians , we could have reaped hundreds in one strike by targeting the markets and the transportation and the public gatherings our goals in our fight are very clear , which are the military and official targets of the government and the western interests we make sure as much as we can in our attacks that no muslim gets hurt but , the government and the press lie to the people and say that the people who died in the un headquarters are civilians but the truth is that more than 95 percent of the injured are associated with the un headquarters and are from the crusaders and from the police and guards , eventually with a civilian dress those are not all civilians also the people associated with the blasphemousness constitutional council are in the scale of the commencing \( religion \) fighters and enemies of islam and those who were injured in batna when bouteflika was targeted , they were police and military intelligence wearing a civilian dress so , are those civilians \? this is lying and mangling that s all it s the same thing that the americans and the apostate government are doing in iraq they ignore 30 killed apostate police men and focus on one muslim who got hurt unintentionally also , most of the time they call the police civilians and this is mangling and media war , nothing more we assure our muslim brothers that they will not get hurt by their mujahedeen brothers we sacrifice our souls and blood to defend you and to protect you from the sons of france and the agents of america our nation must know that we are in a war against the apostates and their crusader masters mistakes may occur in the war but they are unintentional we seek pardon from god and we apology to our nation about that have you had to adjust your tactics in any way to deal with the support provided to algeria by america , such as electronic surveillance or night vision goggles \? of course , we do modify our strategy according to each stage and we have an advice council and senate that convene each time to put down the plans and the strategies for the phase it also assesses the previous phases and remedies the deficiencies and takes into account the development on the jihad ground the americans entered the line and they have bases on the algerian territories and other places even if the government lies and claims other than that then they \( the americans \) provide the algerian military with developed materials as you mentioned and they train the security services in the sahara , and provide them with information and air watch we draw our power from god , glory to him , and we rely on him on god the believers shall rely god is greater than america america or other than america will not frighten us , but we never underestimate the reason we do strive to make the right plans to face this evil alliance against islam and the muslims america must know that when it gets involved in a war with the sons of youssouf ibn tachfine and the grand children of tarik ibn ziyad , then the region will turn on fire under america s feet , if god permits it we will mobilize the sons of the islamic maghreb in order to soak the nose of the americans in the mud , and put into their account that s already filled with defeats , another defiance what do you see as your biggest accomplishment to date , and your biggest failure \? we believe that our greatest achievement is that the jihad is sill continuing in the islamic maghreb for 16 years and today it is developing and climbing by the generosity of god we were able to transfer our jihad from the country to regional , and we were able to expand our activity to the maghreb states and the african coast , and we could participate in the regional awakening jihad based on their sacrifices and their blood , our mujahedeen could keep the jihad reason and carry the flag generation after generation , and revive the absent duty in the hearts of the muslims today , we receive a lot of requests from some muslims who want to do martyrdom operations in mauritania , morocco and tunisia we see muslim youths who support our matter , they are ready to sacrifice themselves and their money for the sake of supporting islam we consider this as one of our greatest achievements among our greatest achievements is that we realized unity with our brothers as an important step towards the adult succession also , we did not weaken and we remained on the road , we developed our jihad and we revived the jihad matter in the heart of our nation after it was absent for a long time this is a big change in the region and we thank god that he enabled us to participate in its achievement we ask his glory to be like those people whom he said about how many of the prophets fought \( in god s way \) , and with them \( fought \) large band of godly men \? but they never lost heart in they met in disaster in god s way , nor did they weaken \( in will \) nor give in and god loves those who are firm and steadfast \( chapter 3 , verse 146 \) regarding failure , we do n't know what failure is the real failure is in these agent regimes who betray their religion and their nation the nation discovered their betrayal , their corruption and their cooperation with the enemies of islam the large percentage of nonparticipation in the last elections , and the large opposition to the government s policies by the people , and the death of hundreds of youths in the ocean because of the clandestine immigration , and the repeated popular intifada , which the last one happened in achlaf , and the proportion of the poverty and unemployment indices , and the growing union strikes , and the gap that grows day after day between the people and the government these are all indicators of a real failure that becomes an emerged feature of all the governments of the islamic maghreb that are agents if it is necessary to have a failure , then surely our failure is that we are for a long time unable to win the martyrdom and join our brothers who preceded us on the road of sacrifice and martyrdom o lord ! \( they say \) , let not our hearts deviate now after thou guided us , but grant us mercy from thee from thou art the grantor of bounties without measure \( chapter 3 , verse 7 \)

paris in the general european euphoria over the election of , there is the beginning of selfreflection about europe s own troubles with racial integration many are asking if there could be a french , british , german or italian obama , and everyone knows the answer is no , not anytime soon it is risky to make racial comparisons between america and europe , given all the historical and cultural differences but race had long been one reason that europeans , harking back to the days when famous american blacks like josephine baker and james baldwin found solace in france , looked down on the united states , even as europe developed postcolonial racial problems of its own they always said , you think race relations are bad here in france , check out the us , ' said mohamed hamidi , former editor of the , founded after the 2005 riots in the heavily immigrant suburbs of paris but that argument can no longer stand , he said for many immigrants to europe , mr obama s victory is a small revolution toward better overall treatment of minorities , said nadia azieze , 31 , an algerianborn nurse who grew up here it will never be the same , she said , over a meal of rice and lamb in the racially mixed paris neighborhood of barb srochechouart her sister , cherine , 29 , is a computer engineer mr obama really represents the dream of america if you work , you can make it , she said it s a hope for the entire world but the sisters are less optimistic about the realities of france , where minorities have a limited political role , with only one black deputy elected to the national assembly from mainland france has the obama election caused any real selfreflection among the majority here \? it s politically correct to say , ok , great ! he s black , ' and clap , nadia said but deep down , there s no change people say one thing and believe another in all the jobs she has ever had , she said , i 've always been asked to do more , because i'm an immigrant we always have to prove ourselves down the street , picking through the cheap clothes on sidewalk stands , fatou diedhiou , 34 , born in senegal , said that mr obama s victory may make the french give blacks a bit of respect but she finds deep racism among the french , who she says think that all blacks are illiterate and ca n't do anything but clean mr obama is an exceptional figure even in the united states , a nation of immigrants with a long and complex history of racial problems going back to the indian wars and the extensive slave trade , which produced a bloody civil war most european countries were relatively monoethnic until the postcolonial period britain , for example , was largely white until the mid20th century and still does not have a substantial black middle class , while french immigrants are almost all from former french colonies in north africa , like algeria , morocco and tunisia , or in black africa , like mali , senegal and ivory coast measured by political representation of minorities , both the united states and europe seem lagging , though mr obama s victory seemed to underscore how much farther behind europe is mr obama is the only black in the current senate , and unless he is replaced by an africanamerican , the new senate will have none the new house has 39 black representatives , about 9 percent blacks make up about 13 percent of the country s population but rama yade , the senegalborn state secretary for human rights , called herself a painful exception in the french government , despite president nicolas sarkozy s appointment of three prominent black or muslim women to his government as for the political elite s embrace of mr obama , she said , the enthusiasm they express toward this faraway american , they do n't have it for the minorities in france it is not only immigrants who are pondering what mr obama s victory says about europe france s defense minister , herv morin , called the obama victory a lesson for a french democracy late to adopt integration in this election , the americans not only chose a president , but also their identity , said dominique mo si , a french political analyst and now we have to think , too , about our identity in france it s the most challenging election ever we realize we are late , and america has regained the torch of a moral revolution in italy , jeanl onard touadi , the only black member of the italian parliament , sees the obama victory similarly it is a great and concrete provocation to european society and european politics , said mr touadi , born in the congo republic mr obama gives hope , he said , that one day there can be a similar outcome in europe but not soon hossain moazzem , a bangladeshi waiter at l'insalata ricca restaurant , said he hoped mr obama s victory would foster change all over the world but italy , he said , had a long , long way to go in britain , too , there was skepticism trevor phillips , the black chairman of the independent equality and human rights commission , said that the political system held immigrants back if barack obama had lived here , i would be very surprised if even somebody as brilliant as him would have been able to break through the institutional stranglehold that there is on power , he told the times of london britain has several minority ministers below cabinet rank , but just 15 nonwhites in the 646member house of commons the parliamentary system makes it harder for a young person or an outsider to emerge in britain , you ca n't make a brilliant speech and get noticed the way barack obama did , sadiq khan , a labor minister , told the guardian you have to rise up through the ranks in parliament but ashok viswanathan , assistant director of , which works to engage members of minorities in politics , predicted that britain could have a party leader from a minority in the next 10 to 15 years , and a minority member as prime minister in 30 if someone said two years ago that there would be a black president , most people would have laughed that person out of town , he said the very nature of aspiration is when barriers are broken , whether in flying to the moon or being the first black person around a cabinet table it s something that nobody believes will happen germany is yet a different case , with its largest immigrant population invited from turkey to work in west german factories in the 1960s and 1970s germany now has some 29 million inhabitants of turkish background , 800 , 000 of them with german citizenship under new laws but they have little political representation in the unified germany of 82 million , with just 5 members of the 613seat bundestag even cem ozdemir , germany s bestknown ethnic turkish politician , currently a european legislator , is having trouble getting on the greens party list of candidates for the bundestag in part because of internal opposition to his ambition to lead the party germans ca n't believe a turkish politician believes in a politics for germany , said mely kiyak , 32 , a germanborn daughter of turkish parents who wrote a book , ten for germany , about the problems of ethnic turkish politicians the germans think , this is our country why should we elect a turk \? he might want to islamicize the country the germans love mr obama , she said , but we do n't have minorities anywhere , not in media , in politics , in the executive or the judiciary ferdi sarikurt , 22 , who works in a bakery in berlin s kreuzberg district , came to germany at age 1 and is a citizen a german obama is beyond his imagination , he said the german government would not allow this to happen because it would think that a person with an immigrant background would favor the foreigners maybe this will change when i am 50 years old , if at all but ms kiyak said the obama victory was causing significant reflection in the immigrant community , if not yet in the country at large minorities see what is possible in another country , and they become jealous , she said , noting that president abdullah gul of turkey said recently in that turkish germans should take part in german society and politics and not look back given that france has such close ties to its former colonies and more muslims than any other country in europe , the debate here is more complicated on sunday , numerous politicians signed a manifesto written by yazid sabeg , a millionaire child of algerian immigrants , calling for affirmativeaction programs to turn the supposedly colorblind french ideal of equality into reality for alienated immigrants the election of barack obama highlights via a cruel contrast the shortcomings of the french republic and the distance that separates us from a country whose citizens knew how to go beyond the racial question , the manifesto said it won support from mr sarkozy s wife , carla , who told le journal du dimanche , our prejudices are insidious and hoped the obama effect would help to reshape society but the french model of citizenship does not allow for official distinctions by race or religion when a legislative official here was asked for data on the number of black or muslim legislators , he told a reporter to look at the pictures on the senate directory , to judge by name and skin color joseph mac scaron , writing in the frenchlanguage weekly , said that the discussion of a french obama was a diversion and a screen , substituting a false american model onto france the problem here , as in other parts of europe , he said , was less the rejection of nonwhite immigrants than the way political and cultural elites patronized and used them , only to better block access to the top of the social ladder praising the difference' of nonwhites locked them inside identities of resentment , he said but the conservative blamed french minorities themselves for part of their exclusion the paper noted that mr obama s success was based on his upbringing , education and success at integrating into the larger society and articulating its values , including patriotism from this point of view , obama should be the model to follow for young immigrants who have come to doubt their feeling of belonging to the nation , the paper said minorities , who have chosen their exile , in contrast to black americans , still have a lot to prove

washington aaron heilman had pitched a grand total of an inning and a third this month , giving him ample time to think in the bullpen and when he did , he did not reflect on his sore left knee or a dreadful five and a half months or his turning 30 in november rather , heilman looked forward specifically , to the next two weeks and whether it was possible to sweep away what he called a funny abomination of a season by helping to pitch the into the playoffs i do n't know , but it would certainly help , heilman said before monday night s game against the nationals i know there s not that much time left , so i have to keep going out there , keep battling and think positive , knowing that things will turn around at some time it is hard to believe that a team that entered the day 18 games over 500 and leading its division , even by a single game , can say that its reliever with the most innings pitched is 38 with a 538 earned run average only four relievers in the national league who have pitched significant innings pittsburgh s franquelis osoria , atlanta s blaine boyer , chicago s bobby howry and the mets' luis ayala had a higher era this season than heilman , according to stats llc only ayala \( 76 \) , who joined the mets from washington on aug 17 , exceeded heilman s 73 appearances at this stage , those numbers are only a slight deterrent the mets' bullpen , which had given up 11 runs and 3 homers in the previous four games , is a chaotic place , where ayala and brian stokes assume pivotal roles , outshining more established relievers like heilman and duaner s nchez it is a place where manager jerry manuel has no idea none what he will get from game to game or from reliever to reliever i ca n't sit back and say , you got the eighth , you got the ninth , ' manuel said in other words , you can normally manage to the sixth or the seventh , and you manage those two bridge innings to get to your eighth or ninth or whatever here , you 've got to manage to the end of the game the bridge is all the way to the end , you know what i'm saying \? his only truly reliable reliever has been joe smith , who had not allowed a run in his previous 16 appearances , since aug 11 ayala , the day after blowing a save against atlanta , remained the closer with an asterisk as manuel readily acknowledged , we 've obviously got some issues late in the game for him and for us , i 'll just have to be ready if things do n't work out , manuel said it 'll be batter by batter if i do n't like what i see early , i'm going to tell him what made heilman such an appealing lateinning option his versatility is partly what discourages manuel from using him now once tough against lefthanded hitters because of his neutralizing changeup , heilman had allowed them to hit 314 with eight homers through sunday once depended on to pitch multiple innings , heilman has been eased out of that role because of his knee pain asked when he would feel comfortable using heilman , who in two games this month has pitched with a sixrun deficit and has given up a gametying tworun homer , manuel offered a vague response if the matchups fit , he said if we feel like it s a good fit for him , then we 'll put him in he 'll get an opportunity the nationals are primarily a righthandedhitting team , and if manuel shies away from smith \( or wants to save him for later \) , heilman may be an option but manuel has already begun exploring other possibilities , namely the rookie bobby parnell and the injured starter john maine parnell , a hardthrowing righthander , is scheduled to face hitters tuesday afternoon so manuel can decide whether he wants to use him down the stretch maine , who has not pitched since aug 23 because of a bone spur in his right shoulder , threw about 35 pitches from 60 feet monday and said he hoped to be available during next week s seasonending homestand whether it s just an inning or two out of the pen , i do n't care , maine said i just want to go out there and pitch turning a starter into a reliever is a trick the mets employed with heilman , who was a dominant setup man in the late stages of 2005 and in 2006 but he has been bothered since spring training by tendinitis in his left knee some days , it feels fine on others , it does n't , and he never knows when the good days or the bad days are going to come he did not offer it as an excuse but said monday that there had been a handful of times when it had affected his performance by no means do i feel like i 've hit any sort of a wall , heilman said it s just another speed bump in the road sometimes you have to slow down when you 're going a little too fast just slow down , get over it and move on inside pitch jerry manuel said that damion easley \( right quadriceps strain \) may be available for pinchhitting duties but that he could not play the field for several days manuel confirmed that brandon knight would start wednesday
berkeley , calif on tuesday night , the nine members of the berkeley city council are expected to do something they , or the marines , for that matter , very rarely do retreat in the face of fierce opposition the staff are supposed to be there to protect us from our stupidity , said councilwoman betty olds , who is 87 , as feisty as a cornered rattlesnake and a leader of the retrenchment and they did n't do any better than we did for weeks , the council has been at the heart of a mess related to its proclamation that the marines them that stormed the beaches of iwo jima were not welcome to run their threeperson recruiting office downtown the council , with its staff s concurrence , apparently , also set aside a parking spot one day a week in front of the office for code pink , an antiwar group that aims to disrupt the recruiters and , like all californians , loves a good parking spot the parking and the proclamation , which called the marines uninvited and unwelcome intruders , sparked an angry response in the form of hundreds of telephone calls , thousands of email messages and countless hours of how dare they ! on the radio and elsewhere typical of the outrage was a posting on monday on , a conservative web site , that decried patchoulismelling berkeley hippies and radical antimilitary haters groups like code pink and the berkeley city council do n't care about freedom , a poster , sgt seth conner , blogged they only care about saddling another generation my generation with their hippieloving propaganda the shock and awe extended to washington and sacramento , where republican elected officials proposed withholding millions in state and federal money for berkeley for programs like school lunches and transportation so it is that on tuesday , amid the glare of television cameras and protesters on both sides , the council is scheduled to consider another resolution that affirms its opposition to the iraq war but also expresses support for the men and women who voluntarily serve this country mayor tom bates , who was in the army and seems slightly bewildered by the backlash , said the resolution would be a substitute for what we 've had out there actually i would n't even call it a substitute , mr bates said a moment later i think it s just a restating of our policy the proclamation , drafted by ms olds and another council member , laurie capitelli , will also back off a request to the city manager to send a letter to the marine corps commandant with the uninvited and unwelcome language in another concession , mr bates said other groups would be invited to apply for parking spots for their protests if someone wants a monday or a tuesday , he said , they would be entitled to get it none of which is likely to appease critics it would be astonishing if they did something meaningful like apologize , not only to the military , or the marines , but to the families of service members , said melanie morgan , host of a conservative talk show and leader of move america forward , which backs troops they are finding out that the rest of america does n't go along with their kooky politics ms morgan said her supporters would protest on tuesday at city hall with a poster board depicting a marine with his mouth taped shut code pink also plans a vigil a cofounder , medea benjamin , said she welcomed the fight they 'll come from out of town and stage their show and then they 'll go home , and we 'll have a galvanized base , ms benjamin said they 've helped us draw a line in the sand it is not completely surprising that line is in this liberal enclave of 100 , 000 people the council regularly takes up foreign policy and other faraway issues but even veterans of the scene say the marine hoopla is one for the books ms olds , who voted for the parking spot but not the language about the marines , said she had never seen such a response not that the council did not deserve it , she added i live in the hills , ms olds said and they do n't like this one bit
to the editor re edwards admits to affair in 2006 \( front page , aug 9 \) if john edwards had become the democratic presidential nominee , the news of his affair in 2006 would have caused serious damage to his candidacy if barack obama had selected mr edwards as a running mate , mr obama s candidacy would have been jeopardized both scenarios make the story of mr edwards s affair much more than a private matter mr edwards says he told his wife about the affair in 2006 instead of joining him in his presidential bid , mrs edwards should have dissuaded him from running call it egotism , narcissism , ambition or a combination of all three , the couple misled the voting public by promoting a flawed candidate who had the potential of harming the democrats' chances of winning the presidency in 2008 susan bienen johnson brookline , mass , aug 10 , 2008  to the editor john edwards claims that he became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic , and that is what enabled him to have an extramarital affair perhaps he should search his unconscious a bit more to uncover an even deeper truth his narcissism is so strong that he thought he could become president of the united states and keep his secret margaret m kennedy charlottetown , prince edward island aug 10 , 2008  to the editor i find all of this breastbeating about john edwards s infidelity somewhat nauseating is a man \( or woman \) not permitted to err once in his or her life \? yes , there was something especially upsetting about this mr clean doing dirty but let him who is without sin cast the first stone morton shor somers , ny , aug 10 , 2008  to the editor john edwards s statement but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough speaks volumes about his notions about honesty one cannot be a little bit dishonest being 99 percent honest should never be enough that 1 percent of dishonesty could represent the most devastating lie of all elisha hoffman abrams new york , aug 9 , 2008  to the editor the monotony of listening to another politician apologize for an affair is as tiresome as the assumption that contrition is somehow owed the public in these situations if personal matters must be aired \( and i would argue that they need not be \) , it would be refreshing to hear the words this is none of your business answer the scandalhungry press after all , is n't that how most of us would feel under similar circumstances \? david terhune wellfleet , mass , aug 10 , 2008  to the editor re keeping it rielle , by maureen dowd \( column , aug 10 \) as an almost eightyear survivor of breast cancer , i am asking myself why , as ms dowd so aptly put it , john edwards needed to be oncologically correct when he reported that his affair occurred while his wife s cancer was in remission did he mean to imply that he waited until she was feeling better to cheat on her , or that the specter of cheating on someone while she is undergoing chemotherapy and vomiting is itself nauseating \? it seems that either explanation is fraught with the narcissism he blames for his infidelity mr edwards should leave his wife s cancer out of the picture by invoking it , he implicitly asks for our understanding and empathy he s certainly not going to get it from this person in remission is he suggesting that those of us now in remission should start to worry about the stability of our marriages \? carol g feldman boston , aug 10 , 2008
omar minaya is somewhere over middle america , on his way to denver to either show support for the mets or to see firsthand what has happened to his 140 million team the mets have a frontoffice representative either minaya , tony bernazard , the vice president of development , or the assistant general manager john ricco traveling with the team to every city , but i can t recall minaya making a trip out here since i took over the beat , in august 2005 because he can , minaya will usually pick cities like miami , san francisco or washington , but i can guarantee you that he is not here , on memorial day weekend , because he wants to try the vesta dipping grill  the mets are , for better or worse at this point , you may say worse the team minaya constructed he has made several shrewd trades during his tenure he has also made some moves that have not turned out so well , and he has given aging players some questionable contracts that could hamper the team moving forward none of them can be viewed in a vacuum , but the gambles he made over the winter that he didn t have to bolster the bullpen much , that angel pagan would be the safety net if \( and when \) moises alou got hurt , that the rotation could withstand injuries to orlando hernandez and pedro martinez because john maine and oliver perez were ready to take the next step are not looking as sharp at least not right now i had written yesterday that it is entirely possible that the mets could turn their season around it s been done before they certainly have the talent to do it they have the payroll flexibility to make additional moves all of this could be forgotten only difference is , the mets , unlike the 2005 astros and 2006 twins , are coming off a monumental collapse look at the 1996 california angels a year after blowing a 95game division lead and a 12game wild card lead , they went 7091 and finished 4th in the al west how about the 1965 phillies \? they went 8576 but finished 6th in the nl the 1952 brooklyn dodgers , who went 9657 in winning the nl pennant , may be the exception although there are still 117 \( ! ! ! ! \) games left in the season , this weekend will go a long way toward determining whether the mets will be the 52 dodgers , the 95 angels or just the 2008 mets , slogging toward 500
roger bennett and josh kun are the authors of and you shall know us by the trail of our vinyl the jewish past as told by the records we have loved and lost our book is the product of five years of obsessively collecting vinyl from across the country a work of passion that took over our lives believe it or not , after tracking down thousands of lost albums and chasing down the performers who once recorded them \( now mostly in their 80s and 90s \) , we still can t quit the music below are some of our favorites that dominate our ipods consider it a chanukah top 12 1 \) havana nagila , the irving fields trio all quests need their ground zero and for us it began with a 1959 decca lp , bagels and bongos , by the amazing irving fields trio fields turned his days playing cruise ships in puerto rico and cuba into a jewishlatin musical love affair when we heard his mambo and merengue versions of jewish staples , we were convinced there was a lost kingdom of sound waiting to be rediscovered it was this lp that sent us scurrying to thrift stores and garage sales and that sent us into late night ebay auction battle i guess you could say our book was born in bagels and bongos 2 \) kol nidre , johnny mathis admittedly , we started looking for explicitly jewish albums , which in most cases meant albums by artists we knew \( or assumed \) to be jewish but we quickly learned that the history of american jews in popular music goes far beyond jewish communities as such a whole chapter in our book is devoted to nonjews taking cracks at jewish material \( perry como , connie francis , charleton heston \) , and another is devoted to the rich backandforth between jews and africanamericans the legendary johnny mathis plays a role in both stories on his 1958 album for

george , sang this old yiddish theater song at the apollo theater , it caught the attention of sammy cahn , who put it in the hands of the andrews sisters their englishlanguage version of the song became the first true yiddish crossover hit on the american pop charts their success inspired two sisters from the bronx to change their name from bagleman to barry and start mixing yiddish tunes with jazz and bigband swing on their last album , our way \( 1973 \) which our nonprofit record label has just reissued on cd the barry sisters not only performed yiddish makeovers of raindrops keep falling on my head and my way , but also turned back the clock and reminded the world just how good bei mir sounds in yiddish 4 \) fiddler on the roof medley , the temptations , and 5 \) sabbath prayer , joe quijano once we got knee deep in lp collecting and our garages and offices started filling up , it was clear that we could do a whole spinoff book on music inspired by fiddler on the roof more than any cultural event in american jewish life , fiddler transformed jewishness \( in the folksy guise of eastern european shtetl romance \) into universal american pop aside from the many loyal riffs on both the play and the film that kept the jewish angles intact , there were more than a few that moved tevye to some new rooftops the pathbreaking puerto rican percussionist joe quijano did a whole fiddler on the roof goes latin album , and cannonball adderley gave it a jazz remake but one of our favorite fiddler tributes came from the soundtrack to a network tv special , on broadway , that starred diana ross and the supremes along with the temptations , whose fiddler medley goes places with if i were a rich man that neither sholom aleichem nor gwen stefani ever imagined 6 \) jennifer juniper , theodore bikel one of the most interesting threads that runs throughout these lps is the flexibility of jewish identity and jewish music for every traditional cantorial album , there are albums that take tradition and reshape it , mash it up with other styles and genres a key figure in that story is the great theodore bikel singer , actor , activist whose musical career has ranged from singing israeli folk songs to founding the newport folk festival we feature him in the book but pay more attention to his early albums for elektra than we do to a new day , a spacedout 1969 recording that found a slick bikel , complete with goatee and suit , adrift in a 60s haze he covers joni mitchell , cat stevens and the stones , as well as this one from donovan , where his acting chops really come in handy 7 \) kiddush , richard tucker richard tucker , born ruvn ticker , was one of the great tenors of the last century who kept his cantorial career clicking along even as he starred in aida at the met this was a man who had everything one minute he was playing ponichielli in la giocanda , the next he was releasing cantorial jewels , then dropping his version of little town of bethlehem onto the columbia collection great songs of christmas \( an album on which six of the 14 performers were jewish \) his version of kiddush on cantorial jewels stops the show 8 \) a taste of honey , hannah ahroni few of our finds have been as visually beautiful as hannah ahroni sings songs of israel , which we discovered on a collecting sortie in the thrift stores of boca a beautiful songbird cutting a ripe , exotic and confident figure , laughing casually against the backdrop of a freshly harvested wheat field ahroni was the most successful of a gaggle of israeli female solo performers who broke in america at the same time yaffa yarkoni , shoshana damari and geula gill were also soulful and stunning but something about this cover haunted us and forced us to track her down we finally found her last month in uptown manhattan she looks as beautiful today as she did back then 9 \) orcha bamidbar , avram grobard avram grobard once owned the west village nightclub where many of the acts in our book broke through , the legendary el avram he now lives in wachtung , nj , in a quintessentially suburban scene when we first found him , he met us at the door a stocky gentleman maybe in his 70s and without a word whisked us down to his basement , where he has painstakingly rebuilt his entire club down to the very last fixture the bar , the stage , the kitchen , a magical field of dreams just waiting for us seeing this inspired us to reach out to the musicians we had met and invite them onstage one more time to perform before a live audience we are starting at joe s pub in new york and playing a number of cities sort of like the buena vista social club , only less cuban this track is on itunes the thumping piano rocks out 10 \) el exigente , larry harlow the latinjewish craze of the 1940s and 50s produced all sorts of amazing hybrids yiddish chachas , mazeltov merengues , miami beach rhumbas but it also set the stage for the more conspicuous work of jewish musicians in the emerging salsa scene of new york in the 1960s and 70s chief among them was the brooklynborn ira kahn , better known as larry harlow , and even better known among latino musicians as el judio maravilloso , the marvelous jew harlow , whose dad was the bandleader at the latin quarter , became one of the more acclaimed and indemand pianists and session leaders in salsa , a mainstay at fania records and the head of orchestra harlow he studied in afrocuban music in cuba , studied santeria , and worked with greats like celia cruz and ismael miranda miranda is featured on this sizzling title track from a 1967 orchestra harlow lp 11 \) it s a scream how levine does the rhumba , ruth wallis we lost ruth wallis last year , but thankfully her lps are around to keep her memory alive wallis is best known for her sexedup comedy tunes , and she got dirtier as she got older this one is on the tamer side her hilarious , innuendoladen ode to a jewish man who learns what his maracas are for when he falls in love with latin music she says it better than we ever could 12 \) exodus , jimmy scott the viennese refugee ernest gold wrote the oscarwinning main theme to otto preminger s film about the founding of the state of israel , but that s about where its jewish centrism ended the song was covered by everyone from edith piaf to count basie , and its lyrics were written by none other than pat boone , a southern church elder and the greatgreatgrandson of daniel this land is mine , boone wrote , god gave this land to me the words became easily adapted to different social and political histories where minorities were fighting for power and justice the song took on particular meaning in africanamerican musical circles this 1969 version by jimmy scott , with junior mance on piano and ron carter on bass , turns the original song s chestswelling pride into a haunting blues as holy as anything we ve ever heard
orchard park , ny the spent the first half of their season talking about what kind of team they could be , talking about potential and possibility and promise they knew as well as anyone the way their extreme makeover of an offseason unfolded the palatial new team headquarters the trades for nose tackle kris jenkins and quarterback the blank check the owner woody johnson cut for general manager mike tannenbaum all those moves were made for games like the one the jets played sunday in the division , on the road , against a squad that won the teams' previous three meetings , the jets played their most complete game this season they played like the team they were talking about all along , beating the bills , 2617 , in front of 71 , 827 fans , most of whom left ralph wilson stadium dazed , confused and muttering questions the home team had no answer for you bring people in , in hopes of what you want to do , to take a football team on the road into a hostile environment like this , jets fullback tony richardson said you come in here expecting to play well , knowing you can win after their victory , the jets \( 53 \) walked off the field without so much as a hint of celebration some shook hands with the bills , others stopped to pray near midfield all walked toward the tunnel without the expected screams and without the expected swagger never mind that they had just recorded their most important road victory since 2006 , when they beat the patriots in foxborough , mass never mind that it followed a month of uneven play that had critics labeling the jets as more pretender than contender never mind that they had just topped last season s victory total in eight games \( and never mind that the win , combined with the patriots' 1815 loss to the colts on sunday night , moved the jets into a tie for first place in the american football conference east \) the jets walked as if they expected this they talked as if they expected this it was huge , linebacker david bowens said good teams do that they finish off a game they 're able to run the ball late they 're able to make stops the jets did all of that sunday their defense , which last forced a turnover on oct 12 , responded with three takeaways and five sacks their offense , last seen searching for its identity , moved efficiently throughout their kicker , jay feely , made four field goals it was our best game , as far as everybody coming together and doing their job , linebacker calvin pace said favre turned in a game memorable for how unmemorable it was after throwing seven interceptions in the three games that preceded this one , favre stuck with the jets' offensive plan , throwing passes short and safe , mixing in the run of the 28 passes favre threw against the bills , 19 found the hands of his receivers and , most important , only one was caught by a bills defender shedding his wild , gunslinging ways , he was a model of efficiency maybe he followed the advice of coach eric mangini , who , using a blackjack analogy last week , told favre not to hit on 20 mangini played down their regular tuesday meeting it was n't like we had a giant summit , he said but whatever was discussed worked when the jets needed an efficient drive to milk the clock in the fourth quarter , they turned not to favre , whose interception had just been returned for a touchdown , but to their running game leading by 2317 with 10 minutes 47 seconds remaining in the game , the jets followed their running backs downfield richardson , the fullback , was one of the new additions , as were linemen alan faneca and damien woody by the time feely kicked his fourth field goal , the jets had bled more than eight minutes off the clock mangini called the drive critical the bills needed two scores in about two minutes and got none that was the biggest part of the acquisitions we made in the offseason , tight end chris baker said of the run game it has n't become our identity yet but it should be , with the guys we brought in and the guys we have to run the ball the jets' revival on offense was accompanied by one on defense in their previous three games , the jets struggled to stop the lackluster offenses of the bengals , raiders and chiefs not here against the bills not after allowing a touchdown on the bills' first drive cornerback darrelle revis , in the middle of a pro bowlcaliber season , blitzed bills quarterback trent edwards from his blind side edwards never saw revis coming , and revis stripped the football and recovered it that play ended up producing 3 points , but the jets' defense was not done late in the first quarter , jenkins flattened edwards , and edwards s pass floated into the hands of safety abram elam at the jets' 8 elam , who was starting in place of the injured eric smith , took off up the right sideline , slowing before stumbling into the end zone for a 137 lead apparently , elam made a similar play during the jets' last practice before this game this one meant a little more it was a big momentum swing , elam said speaking of big momentum swings , the signing of the 350pound jenkins certainly qualifies the jets' run defense has been their primary strength this season , and with bills running back marshawn lynch missing long stretches of this game with nausea , they held the bills to 30 yards on the ground jenkins finished with five tackles , two sacks and three quarterback hits he was credited with the fourthdown stop of running back fred jackson at the jets' 8 midway through the second quarter but his impact stretches , like his waistline , far beyond the stat sheet in fact , while mangini called jenkins a beast , several teammates went further , calling him their most valuable player he s two guys , revis said we do n't have 11 we have 12 last week , the jets spent the postgame defending their victory over the chiefs , talking again about their unrealized potential now , they have their best record at the midway point since 2004 they are 21 in the afc east , 20 in the division on the road , on a twogame winning streak they have built a topoftheline run defense , and they have an emerging running game , two key ingredients when the weather turns worse in the coming months on sunday , the stoic mangini even smiled talking again about potential , safety kerry rhodes stopped the question before it finished the team that we can be \? he said , laughing the team that we 've been hoping , saying that can show up at any time now \? it showed up today now , we 've got to keep it going
in their first nine games against the western conference this season , the ran up against a group of big , immovable teams , for whom a snarling defensive style has become the price of admission to any conference game on their 10th and final try , the rangers played tough enough they not only stood up to san jose in a 31 victory sunday afternoon at madison square garden , but they beat the in every part of the game there was goaltender henrik lundqvist fighting to cover a puck while under a pile of players late in the third period , his mask knocked off and chaos all around him there was forward ryan callahan , all 188 pounds of him , throwing himself around and collecting a gamehigh seven hits there was center chris drury blasting in a crucial slap shot on a power play that would become the winning goal it was a fun game , said lundqvist , who had 29 saves it was a good test for us going into the third , we said this was the way it s going to be moving forward we have to learn how to kill it , to take care of business callahan took care of the last bit of business by scoring an emptynet goal with two seconds remaining for his second goal of the game , helping the rangers to their second victory in two days on saturday , they steamrolled buffalo , 51 this victory pushed the rangers to 30247 , and their 67 points nudged them into sixth place in the eastern conference it also snapped the rangers' 072 slide against western teams this season that streak helped show how different the conferences have become since the start of the 20056 season , when the nhl loaded the schedule with divisional matchups and turned the two conferences into strangers with a more balanced schedule in store for next season , the rangers now have at least a running start on dealing with it i think we 're a team that s more and more comfortable with who we are , rangers coach tom renney said it took a little while to get to that point we 're not the biggest team in the national hockey league , but no one should ever underestimate our toughness and our character exhibit a in the rangers' toughness test sunday was the 22yearold callahan , who has battled through a terrible start to his second nhl season he missed 16 games after spraining a knee in october he struggled after his return , then he spent most of january in the minors he has scored four goals in his last five games , none bigger than the one that beat san jose goalie evgeni nabokov in the first period sunday the sharks had taken a 10 lead only 3 minutes 31 seconds into the game on a goal by jonathan cheechoo callahan kept the puck in the zone to start the play , then camped in front of the net while drury dug the puck off the side of it callahan took a pass from drury and propelled it past nabokov at 11 34 i think that s part of my role , go out there and create energy , throw my body around a bit and get the team going , callahan said every time i go out there , that s what i'm trying to do drury s goal , at 5 44 of the second period , showed a bit of stubbornness on the rangers' part as well it came late in a power play , which started badly sharks center joe thornton controlled the puck for almost 20 seconds and forward milan michalek nearly scored a shorthanded goal but as the sharks tried for a line change , rangers center scott gomez charged into the offensive zone , finding an open drury it was weird , thornton said that s how hockey goes milan had a great opportunity , then they turn around and put one in the back of our net it was exciting hockey , but it went on the wrong end there it was exciting hockey , western conference style and the rangers finally figured out how to win it slap shots for the second consecutive day , the rangers signed a defenseman to a contract extension this time , it was fedor tyutin , who confirmed that he signed a fouryear deal worth about 11 million dan girardi s twoyear , 31 million extension was announced saturday it s my first team in the nhl , and i could n't be more excited , tyutin said
in the los angeles i grew up in it was always summer but actual summer , from june to august , belonged to my mother , the swimmer , who gave up swimming when we came to america my mother had been a multiple high school medalist in the 100meter breaststroke in tehran , and for her swimming remained a symbol of the prosperous old iran of the '60s and '70s her welltodo family was from hamadan , which my nuclearphysicist father dubbed the dallas of iran , and they and all their friends played and swam at an elite country club , carefree in a way that i , a child of islamic revolution iran , would never experience by the time my family settled into our california exile , my mother had already convinced herself that the international language of horizontal bodies kicking in a bright blue tank would serve her better than her barely there textbook english it was the one way she could connect with americans , though she would n't do the actual connecting herself she felt her body was too old , or too scarridden from the caesarean that had been fashionable among progressive iranians instead , she handed the kickboard over to me the family pastime , my mother declared , speaking for my unathletic father as well our only sport jos s , no ways ! i told my parents i was 5 , and still rough in the americanexpressions department but it had been decided to make matters worse , my imagination was already filled with aquatic angst blame '80s los angeles our tap water held deadly secrets acid rain was a constant feature of weather small talk and taking a dip at the beach meant dodging beer bottles and discarded diapers for just a thin layer of ocean wave to take you toenaildeep water , scary water , particularly for those of paranoid immigrant stock , was at best an element for drinking , preferably filled with corn syrup , carbonated and from a mcdonald s fountain plus , after having gone through half a dozen international cities in my first three years of life , i had given stability paramount significance mom s description of swimming feet off ground , face in water sounded suspiciously like another altered state she pushed genetic imperative it is in your blood then immigrant sacrifice it s not free after all ! finally , she countered my fears with fears only swimming could counter what if you fell off a boat \? or the ocean flooded our city \? your airplane crashed to bits in the water \?  since premature death was the alternative to not learning to swim , there i was , inmate of the cramped overly chlorinated indoor pool of our local ymca mom , like a fierce guard , stationed herself at the glass chamber where parents could spy on their kids' lessons , and she remained there for years , her hands always on her hips on the first day , all i did was stand in the shallow end and stare mutely at the teacher , in deep mistrust of the water up to my chest mom s warnings persisted in my head do anything your teachers tell you ! do whatever the other kids do ! but the clamorous echoes of kicking and gasping sounded to me like a horror movie the first summer went like that disastrously yet as i aged into double digits , and as i grew even less like my mother i was scrawny , pale , dressed always in funeral tones , with matching black imagination , reading furiously , endeavoring to become all brain i still made myself swim , and graduated from polliwog \( youth beginner \) to guppy \( youth advanced beginner \) i had to i was heavily invested in the wellbeing of my parents i 'd come to understand that neither my mother nor my dad had the ability i had to erase an accent they did n't have the allabsolving unifiers of kids incorporated , cartwheels and clapping games and while dad could disappear into his mysterious world of work , what did the jockdebutante matriarch have \? she was trapped in a house of immobile nerds , with only soap operas and department store catalogues and diet milkshakes for her , i tried to conquer my admittedly very guppy fear of the deep end but out there thoughts could get lost just as fast as lurking menaces could drag one down and so during laps , the intangibles of family life would creep back up on me my parents' cluelessness and loneliness , the things that made me think of them as children for me to care for and then i 'd finally succumb and cry into the goggles , and then yank them off and cry into the blurry turquoise of the subterranean y , and think about my father and mother and me as a galaxy of just three planets , hopelessly alone , revolving around and around and around ourselves , while circling epicenter america , a big beaming blue and white marble the earth revolves around the sun , like all the other planets , dad would correct me please , for us , learn something  by my preteens i was a minnow , and depressed i continued to unload tears during laps thankfully , noncryers , particularly parents , could not tell the difference between cryeye and chlorine eye eventually , i became a fish this was a big deal a fish could really swim but my mother s insistence did not stop there there was still flying fish , shark and porpoise freestyle and backstroke were the beginning there was the breaststroke , the butterfly ! there was treading water for a minute , three minutes , no , try five ! there was diving , somersaulting , handstands , rescue swims ! i undertook so much , and none of it came easy for my mother , though , i got to porpoise by 13 upon my graduation she , never one to hug , shook my hand and then , rather miraculously , she left me alone i never figured out if she had decided that i was n't champion material or if i had passed some rite of passage or what , but it was over for much of the next decade and a half , there was a parlous distance between us , as if we were two retired assassins , just keeping an eye on each other in case it was n't until my late 20s , during one of those summers that i had slumped back to california due to new york unemployment , heartbreak and or just plain exhaustion , that i found myself returning to my hometown y the first time i got back in the water , it felt different i was fast , i was strong , i felt graceful , content if i could just stay in the pool swimming laps mindlessly forever i 'd be ok the only worry was knowing i 'd get tired and the pool would close and i 'd be back to the sofarsougly real world and its infinite complications but some things were still the same the tears came and went , until my stomach knotted up and i could barely breathe i climbed out slowly and indulged that startling transition , the old drunken stagger when you 're renegotiating your land legs and i looked over at the glass window and there was one mother sleeping with her mouth wide open i did not want to leave

you work 16 games , and what do you get \? a fresh pink slip and a severance check  gary shelton , st petersburg times there are no heroes in this post other than that of tennessee ernie ford s 1955 hit record none of that poor man s muscular , bloody dreams would have him getting fired and walking away from the mine with 25 million over the next three years but it s not a bad sum for being the object of a failed hockey experiment , to see if a tv personality who coached with some success in a different era could flourish in today s nhl and perhaps that s why barry melrose didn t sound terribly upset friday about getting canned as head coach of the tampa bay lightning still , a careful listen reveals he feels he s been wronged , though he won only 5 of those 16 games maybe the positive thinker inside barry told him the bolts also got four extra points for regulation ties and that means he did pretty well in at least 9 of the 16 games true , he says , he didn t motivate them as well as he had wished , but 16 games \? c mon ! part of the sentiment from local columnists shelton and joe henderson of the tampa tribune , also focused on the small sample used to judge melrose s work however , while wins are the final yardstick , there s more to coaching than the record melrose s dismissal is equally about the direction the team was taking , or the lack of direction , and the regard the players had for him , or lack of regard a team doesn t have to love their boss , but they must have confidence in his leadership lose the room and you might as well not be there in fact , following a confrontational meeting with his players on tuesday , melorse decided to ditch practice and let his assistants run things so that , in melrose s words , the players could get another voice that tactic resulted in an awful game at sunrise on wednesday , one about which the st pete times damian cristodero remarked on his blog , i ve been watching the lightning for a long time and i have to say i believe the team should be ashamed of that performance against the panthers the bolts were shut out 40 no team has scored fewer goals than tampa bay then red wings came to st pete for the first sellout of the season and outshot the lightning by 3918 no team has allowed more shots than tampa bay the home side gave up a 20 lead and lost 43 , thanks to what melrose called a brain dead second period in which they took untimely penalties leading to a pair of wings goals it is often said that teams take on the personality of their coach , and if the bolts seemed like a chaotic team , especially lacking structure in their own zone , scott burnside s story on espncom from friday \( which we highly recommend \) explained via an unnamed lighting player that melrose did not come to camp with a plan that was going to help a team that had undergone a dramatic overhaul of personnel in the offseason it was , the player said , like shinny hockey with a few fights thrown in for good measure there was no system no plan at least not one that was discernible , he said but , as many observers agree , the blame should not fall to the coach alone this starts with an ownership group , len barrie and oren koules , who fired a stanley cupwinning coach in john tortorella to hire a crony , a guy who , as we wrote in june , was an analog coach in a digital world , whom the game had passed by they also shoved a cupwinning gm aside in jay feaster and started signing players on their own they presented melrose with the oldest roster in the league , a team with a surplus of skilled veteran forwards , lacking in defensive forwards , experienced defensemen and a power play quarterback with those ingredients , they asked him to mold a team that would play an inyourface style with too few inyourface players as burnside writes , physical players like nick tarnasky , david koci and shane o brien were dealt or waived the owners claiming their blueline corps was going to be just fine burnside notes , 11 different defensemen have dressed for the bolts this season melrose was a motivationoriented coach , not a systems guy that was his calling card when he helped inspire the kings to the 93 stanley cup final the game has markedly changed in terms of the importance of defensive structure and the correct mix of players needed to make the structure work this team may have lots of dynamic offensive potential , but he wasn t given the tools to succeed and didn t know how to get the players he had to play a more disciplined game so , as anyone who watched the lightning witnessed , their power play and penalty kill languished in the lower depths the league the team was too often trapped in its own zone , unable to run an effective breakout they turned the puck over far too often and were forced into penalties through being tired and chasing the play constantly being trapped in your own end and an inability to create offense wears on players , and the effort that melorse called for couldn t be sustained for 60 miutes \( i m not a big rules guy i don t think integrity needs rules i just ask them to come and compete every night when we do that , we re an excellent hockey club when we try to do it for 20 minutes , when we try to do it for 40 minutes , it costs you \) it wasn t getting any better and the players must also share the blame , although they didn t assemble the roster nor did they mastermind strategies to make the roster succeed \( actually , no one did \) the players blame is that they quit on their coach mutiny might be a better word it s not the first time this has happened last night on hockey night in canada , ron mclean interviewed melrose , who denied team defense was a problem , maintaining it was a lack of scoring that did him in he added , i think the players didn t want to play for me you don t have to be kreskin to figure that out melrose added , i m not a guy who sings cumbaya around the fire i let you know if i m not happy with you and obviously a lot of guys didn t like to be held accountable with this team , and obviously they went to lenny and oren and said , we don t like this style of coaching and would you get rid of him i don t think there s any secret about that the great new york baseball manager casey stengel once said , the secret to managing is keeping the 15 guys who hate your guts away from the 10 guys who haven t made up their minds yet the tipping point for melrose may have come from vinny lecavalier , melrose s best player , his team captain , the guy whose contract extends to infinity and beyond vinny averaged 23 minutes a game last year but hasn t had the best start he s coming off shoulder surgery , his wrist is not right and too few of the defensemen can get him the puck believing the bolts poor third periods last season were a result of his players tiring , melrose took lecavalier off the penalty kill and cut his ice time it was a seasonlow 16 32 against detroit , and you have to wonder if that s when vinny , as casey said , made up his mind the players have power here and they exercised that power and now they can play who they want and when they want and how much they want and not have someone demand a lot of them , melrose told mclean you have to earn ice time , he continued the only power a coach has to motivate players is ice time saying he was frank sinatra and he coached the team his way , the way he thought would bring success , melrose told hockey night viewers , i m leaving here with my head high it didn t work i m fine with that i can live with myself with that but he ll also have to live with his role as head coach of the team that joe henderson described in the tampa tribune when he wrote saturday , in the league of serious people ,

going strictly by the weekly ratings , the days of creating big realityshow hits in the summer may be over oh , a few network shows this summer have produced respectabletogood numbers wipeout on abc , and so you think you can dance and hell s kitchen on fox but the disappointments \( the greatest american dog on cbs \) and outright flops \( high school musical get in the picture on abc \) are piling up like lawn cuttings and none of the current summer entries seems to be seizing the nation s attention the way survivor on cbs , american idol on fox and dancing with the stars on abc once did still , at least one expert in the field , a gentleman named simon cowell , would beg to differ i think we have a 20millionviewer show here eventually , said mr cowell , who knows about outsize audiences from his perch as a judge on idol the here he referred to is , where the third season of its grabbag talent competition , america s got talent owned and produced by mr cowell s company will enter a new phase starting tuesday a twohour edition , followed by a 90minute installment thursday , will feature 113 semifinalists displaying talents from singing and dancing to swordswallowing to hiphop violin playing they will be culled by the ubiquitous realityshow threejudge panel \( in this case , sharon osbourne , david hasselhoff and piers morgan \) to a field of 40 these hopefuls will then rehearse their hearts out for three weeks while nbc broadcasts the olympics , preparing to return aug 26 for the start of twiceweekly live showdowns , all the way through a finale oct 1 so is agt , as nbc calls it , a hit show \? brad adgate , senior vice president for research at horizon media , a media buying firm , votes yes the show reached 14 million viewers last week , above its weekly average and a number that s as good as many hits in the regular season , he said , adding it s unusual because it s in its third year and shows tend to go the other way this one is on an uptick but mr adgate cautioned we 'll have to see how the show does when it goes against shows in the regular season in september and october nbc might have to move it to the regular season to prove it s really a hit on that score nbc has no doubts it is clearly a hit show , said ben silverman , the cochairman of nbc entertainment , hardly an objective analyst but he articulated nbc s argument talent is the most watched show of the summer , averaging more than 13 million viewers that is in the same range as lost and heroes , and about twice as many viewers as the top cable summer hit , the closer on tnt talent also seems to be growing while other successful summer series are fading a bit and it is broadly popular last week , for the first time , it was also no 1 among 18 to 49yearolds , a demographic coveted by advertisers and thus the rating most networks use as the true measure of success mr silverman said that unlike most other reality shows this summer talent is easily expandable we can get a ton of hours out of it none of this adds up to an idolstyle phenomenon but mr cowell , in a telephone interview from london , said that other factors pointed toward the show s increasing promise for one thing , he said , nbc and the producers are finally getting a handle on the format this season the show \( which is hosted by jerry springer \) traveled to different cities to spotlight the real and oddball talents that turn out for auditions we asked for a bigger budget to do that , and we got it , mr cowell said then there is the international evidence in britain the finale of britain s got talent attracted the biggest audience of the year for any entertainment show , peaking at about 16 million viewers , in a population onefifth the size of the united states' the format is now playing in 100 countries , mr cowell said , another indication of its popularity the most telling proof of the format s appeal , he said , is that it is creating stars in britain the winner of the first edition , paul potts , emerged as a popular singing phenomenon his performance from the show was watched more than 30 million times on youtube , and his debut album of mostly opera selections hit no 1 on the british charts it has sold more than 22 million copies the story of last year s american winner is perhaps even more remarkable terry fator came to talent as a 42yearold ventriloquist from mesquite , tex he also did vocal impressions , and his career consisted mainly of performing at county fairs and elementary schools he was stonecold broke , mr cowell said , perhaps exaggerating a bit mr fator said he was scratching out a meager living with his appearances he was dedicated to his career , though he recognized , as mr fator said in a telephone interview , there is a stigma attached to ventriloquism , mainly because there are so many bad ones mr fator had a peculiarly spectacular vocal ability i do literally hundreds of impressions , he said i can sound like anybody when i sing his repertory extends from nat king cole to maroon 5 only a few years ago his manager had the idea of combining mr fator s impressions with his ventriloquist training the puppets became the impressionists mr fator decided to give talent a shot , not because he hoped to win i never thought america would vote for a ventriloquist , he said instead i thought i could get some exposure that might let me ask for a little more money from the fairs and the schools but he did win , and the 1 million prize became only part of his reward mr fator began making semiregular appearances at the las vegas hilton , leading to an extraordinary offer the mirage hotel , also in las vegas , signed him to a deal to headline one of its theaters \( to be renamed for mr fator \) for five years starting next february , with an option for another five the total package reportedly could be worth up to 100 million without the show , nobody still would know who i am , mr fator said it absolutely changed my life and career mr cowell said this guy is the biggest realityshow winner of all time nobody from idol' has signed a 100 million deal because of mr fator s success the winner of this year s america s got talent will get an appearance deal in las vegas along with the 1 million prize that makes it more essential , said craig plestis , head of nbc s realityshow division , that the winning act is highlevel and polished it s become a bigtent show that attracts really broad talent , mr plestis said like mr cowell and mr silverman \( and mr fator for that matter \) he evoked the ed sullivan show as the show s true predecessor mr plestis said that mr cowell s prediction of an audience of 20 million is in reach , should the show gets a lift from promotion during the olympics that is planned to be extensive \( in other words , saturation \) of course if talent does grow significantly after the olympics , it will raise the inevitable question would nbc move it out of the summer \? that is not in the plans , mr silverman said we like it as an annual event in the summer it may not be an option for nbc anyway mr cowell controls the format and by all accounts remains intensely involved in the american show s production we 've said no , he explained keep it as a summer show , separated from idol' i do n't think we 'd ever want to divide the audience that way
warren , mich it showed up on monday , right there on his lapel , as he addressed veterans in west virginia a flag pin there it was again on tuesday , in missouri , as he spoke to workers at a garment factory and it was there wednesday as he toured a chrysler plant in sterling heights , mich , near here in the detroit suburbs seven months ago , senator said he did not feel compelled to wear a flag pin , saying he would prove his patriotism in deed , not apparel what gives \? was it the woman in indiana who pulled him aside , gently suggesting that he wear one \? was it part of a larger embrace of all those things presidential candidates simply have to do on a campaign , along with eating cheese steaks in philadelphia or chugging miller in milwaukee \? or was it in reaction to continued questions like the one this week from a local reporter in south charleston , wva , who asked how mr obama could attract bluecollar , white voters in this state , adding , they think you are unamerican none of the above , say mr obama s aides , who have insisted during these rare three days of pin wearing the first consecutive days he has worn the pin in the campaign that it is just fashion happenstance sometimes i wear it , sometimes i do n't , mr obama told the associated press when he was asked about the pin on monday , the first day he had donned it since a veteran handed him one in april in pennsylvania over the last several weeks , people have been handing me flag pins , he said i 've just been leaving it on but mr obama is now turning his attention to white , workingclass voters whose support has been elusive in recent primaries mr obama has been the target of email campaigns reporting that he is muslim \( though he is christian \) and questioning his stand on flag pins , but he is not alone in sporting a bare lapel senator hillary rodham clinton , his democratic competitor , and senator john mccain , the presumptive republican nominee , do not always wear them but it was mr obama s decision not to regularly wear the pin that drew attention when , on oct 3 eight months into his campaign a television reporter in cedar rapids , iowa , asked why he had no flag pin on his lapel mr obama said that he had occasionally worn one after the attacks of sept 11 , but added that he thought the pins had become a substitute for true patriotism my attitude is that i'm less concerned about what you 're wearing on you lapel than what s in your heart , he told audiences in iowa you show your patriotism by how you treat your fellow americans , especially those who served you show your patriotism by being true to our values and our ideals the controversy went away , until he started winning nominating contests then it dogged him , in ohio , texas , pennsylvania and indiana on his plane wednesday , mr obama called it a phony issue as he was not opposed to flag pins it was a commentary on our politicians and folks in washington who sometimes are very good about saluting our soldiers when they come home , he said , but then do n't follow up with budgets that make sure they 're getting treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder recently in indiana , he was asked about the pin at backtoback events betty mcmanama , 87 , a retiree from columbus city , ind , suggested that wearing a pin might be wise i think it would be nice if you did , ms mcmanama said it sure would n't cost you much
like a lot of football kickers , benjamin dato s journey to the sport began on a soccer field entering his sophomore year of high school in tiny wyomissing , pa , he caught the eye of a football coach with his ability to kick the soccer ball almost the length of the field we 've had a lot of allcounty kickers , wyomissing coach ben wolfrum said by telephone this week and ben s leg stood out above all the others dato eventually gave up soccer to concentrate on placekicking and punting a decision that has been paying off ever since as a punter for in the bronx , he went on to become one of the best at the position in the ncaa s football championship subdivision and last sunday , the signed him to a freeagent contract , giving him an opportunity to become the 64th professional football player from fordham it s surreal , dato said in an interview monday at the mcginley center on campus in the back of my mind , it s like it s not really happening dato was a sweeper on the soccer team at wyomissing high school , where he also ran track one summer , todd zechman , the football team s kicking coach , was so taken with dato s ability , he asked him to stop by practice dato was initially expected to be a backup , but the starter quit by his senior season , he had become an integral part of the team that year , dato belted 95 percent of his kickoffs for touchbacks , including one through the uprights , wolfrum said he also kicked a 54yard field goal in a playoff victory he earned firstteam allpennsylvania class aa honors and a scholarship to attend fordham while waiting his turn as an underclassman at fordham , dato said he would often set goals in practice that he had to achieve before leaving the field one day , he decided to punt seven consecutive balls in one 10yard area another time , it was 10 consecutive punts with a certain hang time at some workouts , he remained on the field for up to four hours sometimes , i would n't be able to walk the next day , dato said the hard work paid off last season , 26 of his 67 punts were downed inside the opponent s 20 he averaged 447 yards a punt and set a season record at fordham with 2 , 992 punting yards the associated press named him a secondteam allamerican in the football championship subdivision in the classroom , he has 27 gradepoint average and is on pace to graduate this spring with a degree in business management none of that has seemed to surprise his parents , robert and darnal when their son would return home from campus , he would spend much of his time training at his high school s practice facility each goal he accomplished , he kept working harder to the next one , robert dato said growing up a philadelphia eagles fan , dato often watched the nfl on sundays and he would often question how kickers missed important field goals once he started playing , he followed the sport differently he studied the placekickers and punters , focusing on how they dealt with adversity and trying to understand the technique they had used to make or miss kicks as an assistant at louisiana tech earlier in his career , fordham coach tom masella watched placekicker josh scobee develop well enough to make the jacksonville jaguars masella said dato possessed a quality common to all good kickers and punters the ball jumps off his foot baltimore is seeking a player who can handle punting and kickoffs dato s private kicking coach , fred pinciaro , who trains several nfl punters and placekickers , has also worked with the ravens' current punter , sam koch pinciaro said koch has more experience but cannot match dato s leg strength ben s got all the abilities of a punter that the national football league wants , pinciaro said dato s first chance to demonstrate that will be a rookie minicamp next week when he told his parents he had signed with the ravens on sunday night , he warned them not to buy any of the team s merchandise yet this is an opportunity that comes to only certain people , dato said i'm going to take advantage to the fullest
i ve pulled out a number of comments from the hundreds that have been submitted in response to nick s column on sunday  a number of folks took nick to task for comparing sen obama and abraham lincoln t smith  i am sick and tired of the comparisons between obama jfk and now you want to compare him to lincoln \? my point is yes , there have been great presidents who have not had much prior washington experience , but then again there have some pretty awful ones too so how else does a voter judge obama , based on his inspiring and charismatic speeches \? there is not much of a political career to judge him on i don t believe oratory prowess is and of itself enough to win my vote frank l cocozzelli washington \? lincoln \? come on nick , you ve got to be kidding us ! you re trying to make the case for obama over hillary by comparing the requirements for today s presidency the age of nuclear weapons , global warming and the internet with the requisite experience in the age of horsedrawn wagons \? then , to top it off you compare obama s neighborhood experience \( coupled with him being just three years out of the illinois state legislature \) with a candidate who a \) served as congressional counsel during the watergate hearings b \) has been a very effective senator for seven years c \) and to boot , has her own experience fighting for children esther goodwoman the comparison of obama with president lincoln is far reaching lincoln was an ambitious and highly successful politician first , and a man of passion and vision only later in the presidential process viewing his development and comparing it to obama s is overreaching he fought many personal battles , and overcame many obstacles before becoming the superb leader he was obama s problem seems that things have always gone his way he has yet not lived through a serious professional nor personal crisis to come out on the other side as a stronger individual to be beaten and overcome is a must have quality for a president one comparison with lincoln actually has not been mentioned they are both excellent orators , not a insignificant factor in elections but that is all that the two have in common maxim ledoux has a problem with nick s comparison between obama and another candidate i can t believe you compare john mccain getting tortured to barack obama what exactly did barack obama do \? i m not actually too clear on that maybe it is comparable to , what , five years of imprisonment \? a number of readers had problems with nick s definition of a great presidency lee i strongly disagree with your evaluations of lyndon johnson s and woodrow wilson s presidencies you said that johnson was not among our very greatest presidents domestically , he was and even when vietnam is factored in , i think johnson should be considered at least a near great president in a 1996 poll of historians by arthur schlesinger jr , almost half of those surveyed voted to rank him as such i don t believe woodrow wilson was one of the greatest presidents wilson had serious flaws , particularly his active racism \( he introduced segregation into the federal government \) i believe that johnson , with his towering civil rights achievements , was definitely a better president than wilson christian vanschayk wilson , a great president \? gullible , yes , by entering into ww i a war where the us had no vital interests at stake and then to do so without written guarantees regarding the peace settlement wilson , afraid of germanamerican opposition , carried on a campaign of vilification and suppression of individual liberties the 20th century might have been much more peaceful had the us not fought in wwi as a result of a hopelessly naive and inexperienced man erica i would like to reference stephen skowronek s theory of political time and its relation to the presidency , and your use of the term great presidents presidents who are commonly labeled as great are presidents who often head the opposition party when the current political climate has crumbled many of the presidents you quoted were indeed , reconstruction presidents perhaps they were elected because of their lack of experience , and it was a symbol of their lack of connection with the political climate of their time was the timing merely posed with the politics they wanted to put politics into place \? many of these presidents also served during a time of national crisis when legislation combined with strong nationalism can poise someone for great success in congress bush had an opportunity to become one of the greatest presidents of this time , but squandered his legacy in the pursuit of his own overly ambitious agendas your point is indeed correct experience , or lack of it , may not be necessarily be the determining characteristic in such situations , but in other arenas , experience is ultimately needed to deal with congress in order to pass legislation a couple commentators said nick was using double standards tiago s nunes you discard hillary s many years of political experience as irrelevant , and yet you attribute great importance to obama s achievements in the state senate , not to mention to his grade school years in indonesia that purportedly grant him unique insight into american foreign policy do i detect a double standard here \? but i have to agree with you on one thing , experience comes from many places and in many forms , and the kind that comes from navigating the murky waters of washington politics doesn t necessarily make a great president sal anthony a subjective snapshot of the greatest achievement or insight from each of our last four presidents george w bush s immediate grasp of alqaeda as an existential threat to the west \( even if he waged his second war in the wrong country \) bill clinton s efforts in deficit reduction as the necessary if not the sufficient element for our nation s prosperity george hw bush s decision not to enter baghdad ronald reagan s handsoff approach to paul volcker s deliberate engineering of a recession in order to slay the inflation dragon once and for all in each case profound judgment was required from each of these four men and experience was of little use bush junior likely relied on his belief that there exists true evil in this world and that only cowards turn away from it clinton accepted bitter economic medicine and had to postpone \( some might say jettison \) his agenda in the process bush senior ignored the clarion call of empire and prevented the debacle his son would later invite and ronald reagan took a handsoff approach to paul volcker as the latter deliberately engineered a severe recession in order to slay the inflation dragon once and for all what these four accomplishments have in common is that none of our four presidents saw them coming and yet all made an inspired judgment and thereby left his mark on history we also know that each of these four men made serious misjudgments and that history will record those as well the lesson , if there is one , is that the presidency , like many positions of great authority , is an experience unto itself , and i suspect nothing can prepare a person for what s to come in the end , we don t know what sort of experience or expertise or excellence will be of value when extraordinary circumstances present themselves what seems clear is that a leap of faith is involved , from the candidates when they enter the fray , from the people when they enter the voting booth , and from the eventual winner when he or she enters the oval office voter s voice said that nick was an ungrateful clinton hater nick , you are just one of many clinton haters in the reporting columnist industry and one among those clinton haters who actually one of the beneficiaries of clinton s remarkable accomplishments during his administration economic prosperity , job abundance growth , surplus and countless achievements never attained by other presidents including reagan you and a bunch of howlers just ignore the fruits the clintons brought to this country and at the same time savor their tastes like hungry lions you are all ingrates and shame on all of you and finally , a few found nick s time away has impaired him joseph anthony so i m not quite sure what the point is since some have done well in the presidency without much experience , we shouldn t pay much attention to experience as a criteria \? or experience comes in different fashions , and nonexecutive office experience is just as good \? surely , this is an argument almost solely designed against hilary jfk was a hero of my youth but in his first days in office , he was overwhelmed by the bay of pigs perhaps experience would have helped and though one of his finest hours was the missile crisis , it was khrushchev s scorn of his inexperience when they met in vienna that probably led khrushchev to try and bluff the world to near catastrophe and of course , there is w bush and the incredible damage he has done , stemming in good part from his lack of experience combined , i suspect , with arrogant disregard of experience \( at least as measured by his treatment of his father s advisers \) i like barama and think he would make a good president , but his strengths are not in his experience hilary has that strength why be so partisan in your commentary \? why not point out the candidates relative strengths and weaknesses without creating a ridiculous treatise against experience \?
the ' flight touched down at 2 30 am wednesday that is normally a time of little traffic at la guardia airport , but there was a slight delay in getting off the plane the pilot informed the yankees that the ' charter was just ahead of theirs on the tarmac so it is with these teams , in the skies and in the standings , never far apart the red sox came to yankee stadium one game better than the yankees , and after a flurry of hitting by both teams in a game that took 4 hours 8 minutes , they left with the same record every yankees starter scored at least one run , and the thirdstring catcher , chad moeller , had three hits a dormant offense stirred , and a stellar effort from the bullpen overcame chienming wang s poor start to give the yankees a 159 victory it showed that we can win a game when our ace is n't on that day , said brian bruney , who got the last five outs for his first yankees save once these guys get going , they can put a lot of runs on real quick latroy hawkins worked two scoreless innings , billy traber retired david ortiz with his only pitch , and bruney took care of the rest it was a tworun game when he entered in the eighth a save situation and then the yankees piled on four runs against mike timlin the official scorer awarded hawkins his first yankees victory in his first game wearing no 22 hawkins changed his number wednesday because some fans had booed him for wearing no 21 , which had last been worn by paul o'neill the quicker it goes away , the better off we are , hawkins said of that issue he was more talkative on the state of the bullpen , which has a 334 earned run average this season , compared to 497 for the starters we 've got some good arms down there , hawkins said people have to understand , sometimes when you go out there , things are n't going to go your way every time that s what people lose sight of but a good part of the time , we 're going to be all right wang was seeking his 50th career win in his 84th career start the last pitcher to win 50 games faster was dwight gooden , in his incandescent days with the mets gooden earned his 50th victory in his 82nd start , in 1986 but wang was not sharp after tossing a twohit complete game at fenway park last friday , he allowed eight runs and nine hits in four innings manager joe girardi said wang s pitches were too low early in the game , and then they were too high they did n't swing at the first pitch they waited for the high pitches , wang said , adding later , i could n't find the strike zone the red sox scored in the first on a double by manny ram rez , who is hitting an otherworldly 473 off the yankees since the start of the 2006 season but a tworun homer by bobby abreu gave the yankees a lead in the bottom of the inning , and alex rodriguez followed by launching a clay buchholz fastball into history he just got his hands extended , buchholz said , and it was probably the longest ball i 've ever seen hit the blast carried onto the netting above the retired numbers in left center , giving the yankees a 31 lead and pushing rodriguez past the hall of famers willie mccovey and ted williams on the career home run list rodriguez has 522 homers , good for 15th place , with jimmie foxx next at 534 the yankees , whose 15 runs were the most at home against boston since july 7 , 1954 , knocked out buchholz in the fourth , with moeller s brokenbat bloop double a big blow moeller has caught three games for the yankees all victories and he has reached base more than half the time he is likely to start again thursday , with jorge posada not catching because of a weakened shoulder and jos molina still nursing a hamstring strain moeller , who has played for six major league teams , said he felt no pressure beyond helping on defense it s a nice feeling when everything you do up there is a true bonus , moeller said normally they do n't actually mean it , but here , it s the truth even after the yankees knocked out buchholz and built their lead to 73 in the fourth inning , wang could not get an out in the fifth the first five hitters he faced in the inning had hits , and none of them were cheap each one was smoked off the barrel of the bat , an obvious sign that wang s sinker was not running as it usually does ross ohlendorf took over with a 76 lead , but hits by sean casey and dustin pedroia put boston ahead by two runs the yankees charged back with four runs off juli n tav rez in their half of the fifth , taking the lead when boston could not double up melky cabrera with one out a wild throw by julio lugo on the attempt scored another run to put the yankees ahead by two , 119 hawkins relieved ohlendorf in the sixth , entering to little fanfare , one way or the other , when his no 22 was announced the fans could not ignore his performance hawkins retired six of the seven hitters he faced , bringing order to a game that was lacking it and helping lift the yankees to a wild victory

it s funny how baseball works sometimes the yankees are going to extraordinary lengths to protect the golden arm of joba chamberlain , who turns 23 in september baseball history is littered with pitchers who threw too many innings too soon in their careers , none more prominent than mark prior to make sure they have a long reliever to back up chamberlain on tuesday , after he reaches his limit of 65 pitches or so , the yankees called up dan giese from the minors every offseason , giese works out with mark prior the year prior turned 23 , in 2003 , he pitched 234 2 3 innings for the cubs , including october the yankees want chamberlain to pitch about 100 fewer than that prior has not thrown even 200 innings since , and he missed the 2007 and , now , the 2008 seasons with shoulder operations he has no bitterness , no grudges , giese said of prior it s amazing how positive he is he s 100 percent positive he s going to get back to where he was before maybe so , maybe not it would be a great story if that happened but the yankees are taking no chances with their version of the 2003 mark prior
the return of quarterback tony romo managed to relax and energize the cowboys his presence even overshadowed a spectacular effort by the maligned dallas defense by defeating the washington redskins on sunday night , the cowboys reasserted themselves in the national football conference playoff race with consecutive home games against san francisco and seattle \( on thanksgiving \) , dallas could be 84 as it begins a brutal final month of the season aside from romo s return , the game sunday night might have solved a more vexing problem finding ways to use receiver terrell owens he had been quietly grumbling all season about the playcalling of jason garrett , the team s offensive coordinator in nine games before sunday , owens had just 35 receptions for 467 yards and 6 touchdowns \( he had 81 receptions for 1 , 355 yards and 15 touchdowns last season \) in the three games without romo , as the offense ground to a halt , owens had 12 mostly meaningless receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown with the new receiver roy williams now deployed , the cowboys moved owens all over the field , and the redskins had trouble staying with him he went in motion he ran reverses he lined up on the same side of the field as tight end jason witten , which must have been an awful sight for washington defenders because romo had a splint on the pinkie of his throwing hand he said he had some trouble gripping the ball he made few of the deep passes that owens loves romo also missed owens on a few occasions , including one pass that resulted in an interception still , the cowboys kept trying to feed owens the ball , and late in the second quarter , romo hit him for 25 yards on a crossing route a sign , perhaps , of things to come the final stat line may not look any better than it did a few weeks ago five receptions for 38 yards , no touchdowns and an average of 76 yards a catch but everyone seemed happy with the results jerry jones , the cowboys' owner , said he had been curious to see how everything would work with everyone on the field , meaning owens and williams he was thrilled and for one of the few times this season , owens was delighted it s what i did in san francisco and philadelphia , he said about being put in motion i was open , and we took advantage of it almost a year ago , the dolphins' owner , h wayne huizenga , wept while embracing his team s coach at the time , cam cameron miami had just defeated baltimore in overtime to win its first \( and only \) game of the season a year later , cameron is the offensive coordinator in baltimore the dolphins' rookie coach , tony sparano , is a coachoftheyear candidate and somebody better have the tissues ready because cue the tear ducts miami is in the playoff race really the dolphins' remarkable turnaround may be bill parcells s greatest reclamation project yet is there a player on the roster , besides the rookie tackle jake long and maybe running back ronnie brown , whom anyone would choose to build a team around \? and it comes just in time for huizenga , who is likely to be little more than a minority shareholder by the time the playoffs start huizenga has already sold half of the team and the stadium to stephen ross , and nfl owners unanimously approved a plan last month to allow huizenga to sell another 45 percent of the team to ross huizenga is going to keep a small stake that deal is expected to be completed before the end of the year , because huizenga is concerned that barack obama s administration will raise capitalgains taxes the same issue that is spurring four of the rooney brothers to complete a deal to sell their shares in the steelers to the oldest brother , dan , by the end of the year what a way to go for huizenga four consecutive victories have put the dolphins in a tie with the new england patriots , one game behind the jets in the american football conference east , with a titanic matchup against the patriots this sunday in miami the dolphins unveiled the wildcat offense to stun the patriots in their first meeting this season , 3813 the system has become a leaguewide craze , and the patriots will undoubtedly be better prepared for it now but the dolphins are not surviving merely on a few gimmicks quarterback chad pennington has been virtually mistakefree , the running game averages 1175 yards , and linebacker joey porter is having a career renaissance still , the dolphins have largely beat up on bad teams , and they allowed a 98yard punt return for a touchdown that gave the raiders a lead with little more than four minutes left sunday miami needed a field goal with 38 seconds remaining set up by a 7yard completion from pennington to ted ginn jr on fourthand5 to beat oakland , the nfl s most dysfunctional team i'm too young for this , sparano said with six games remaining , including meetings with all three division opponents remaining , the dolphins can control their destiny that is especially true because none of the three outofdivision opponents remaining on the schedule \( st louis , san francisco and kansas city \) have more than three victories it is too early for dolphins fans to relax , though parcells was said to be concerned about their ownership situation when he was considering the job late last year so just how will he get along with the new boss \? the nfc north is parity or is it mediocrity \? defined the top three teams are tied at 55 , and the lions are making a determined run at 016 but things could shake out very soon , especially for the vikings , who lost on sunday to the buccaneers , 1913 the nfl is scheduled to hear player appeals this week in the cases of those who tested positive for a banned diuretic under the performanceenhancing drug policy two of the players caught in the net were the vikings' mammoth pro bowl defensive tackles , pat williams and kevin williams the players are expected to argue that they did not know the supplements they took contained the diuretic that usually does not sway the nfl , which maintains that players are responsible for everything they ingest if the players lose their appeals , they will be suspended for four games , which could torpedo the vikings' playoff chances by damaging a run defense currently ranked second in the league their appeals probably will not be decided before the vikings' game against the jaguars after that , minnesota faces chicago \( 21stranked running game \) , detroit \( 31 \) , arizona \( 29 \) , atlanta \( 2 \) and the giants \( 1 \) jacksonville coach jack del rio made a point of demoting linebacker mike peterson last week in an attempt to seize control of his fading team but when the jaguars and the titans played sunday , with tennessee coming from behind to win by 2414 , the game exposed one of the biggest differences between the promising jaguars of last season and the underachieving ones of this season last year , quarterback david garrard had a breakout season , providing balance to an offense that also enjoyed a twoheaded running attack this year , not so much with injuries to the offensive line , garrard has regressed in 12 games last season , garrard was sacked 21 times , threw 18 touchdown passes and was intercepted 3 times this year , in the first 10 games , he has been sacked 26 times , tossed 8 touchdown passes and thrown 6 interceptions because he has much less time to throw , garrard has watched his yardspercompletion average decline , to 107 this season from 121 last season much of the damage came in the first three weeks \( four interceptions \) but a clunker against cincinnati two weeks ago and a miserable game against the titans left the jaguars at 46 and all but out of the wildcard chase the jaguars' collapse is an example of why many coaches like parcells value the lines more than any other part of the team
melrose meets the press in tampa bay earlier today there can t be a more interesting hire this summer than barry melrose s appointment as lightning coach there just can t how can you top oren koules making a splash today in tampa bay with his old buddy , whose espn rep , big smile , hearty laugh , telegenic visage , cartoon wardrobe and world class mullet will make him an instant media darling after years clamped in the yoke of the despotic john tortorella , the players will laugh along with their new boss it could be , by comparison , a season at the beach for them figuratively speaking , of course if melrose revives any of his laera tony robbins voodoo , he can motivate the lightning players to overachieve the same way he got his 1993 kings who finished four games over 500 and allowed the fourthhighest goals against in the nhl to the stanley cup final , just as he coached his medicine hat tigers to the memorial cup in 1988 and his adirondack red wings to the calder cup in 1992 it s all possible and it could be a lot of fun conversely , when you examine the whole picture , especially melrose s la d nouement two years out of the playoffs with sub500 records this hire could be little more than one showbiz guy hiring another showbiz guy the flash of gleaming teeth and wellstyled hair won t camouflage the fact that melrose hasn t coached in the nhl since 1995 and spent the last 12 seasons behind a microphone \( and more entertaining than insightful , at that \) and not behind a bench he was away for a good reason because the game passed him by long ago , perhaps while he was still coaching and it has kept advancing at a rapid pace while he s been futzing with his pancake makeup seen this way , barry melrose is an analog coach in a digital world gone will be tortorella s discipline which , after all , helped them to a stanley cup a few years ago in its place \? real days at the beach if so , melrose could end up like bernie boom boom geoffrion , the canadiens hall of famer who briefly coached the rangers then went to atlanta as the flames first coach for twoplus seasons before retiring to the broadcast booth then , after scotty bowman left montreal , the boomer got his dream job coaching the defending champion habs it lasted 30 rudderless games and geoffrion had to flee , sick to his stomach , back to the microphone hockey had changed and he was out of touch the players , who chaffed under bowman , now wished he was back this , too , is all possible and it could be very ugly and perhaps what the lightning , their fans and the nhl will end up with is something between these two extremes a team with some superstar talents but lacking an identity , will get one from its popular new coach if they come up with a goaltender and a bit of depth on defense through ownership s promised aggressiveness in free agency , the lightning could be competitive , and perhaps the coach will be aided by a good group of assistants who can bridge that 12year gap and extend the otherwise short shelflife of melrose s motivationallymessaged tenure this scenario is also possible and would be mildly , pleasantly surprising so today in tampa bay , the flashbulbs will pop , the cameras will whirl , the tape machines will spin , all at their analog best melrose will probably wear one of his best al capone suits , wide lapels , broad stripes hair in place , the quotes will fly and the laughs will resound and , as st petersburg times columnist gary shelton wrote a few weeks ago when it became clear that melrose would be coming to town , in the end , it won t matter that this was a splashy move or a solid one , a questionable move or a popular one in the end , all that will matter is whether it was the right move in the games to come , the answer will be found on a scoreboard whither mats \? no sign yet of bob gainey , arcade fire or even youppi in a delegation of montreal celebs winging to stockholm to sell mats sundin on the city , writes lance hornby in the toronto sun on the rumored trip by the canadiens gm to sweden in an attempt to woo the leafs captain back to quebec larry brooks in the post assures us today that sundin isn t going to retire , isn t going to be a canadien but has made it clear new york is his desired destination , where he will partner with jaromir jagr on a goforitnow first line if glen sather agrees and figures out the math of both jj s and mats contracts brooks writes , the rangers have held conversations with both the centerman and his representative , jp barry , after having received permission to do so by toronto sportsnetca reported yesterday that the rangers were granted permission to speak with sundin by interim leafs gm in perpetuity cliff fletcher even before he made an agreement with montreal for exclusive prejuly 1 sundinspeaking rights fletcher denied the sportsnet report to michael traikos in the national post  no matter , says tsn s bob mckenzie the truth is , this is all happening too fast for sundin , who doesn t feel comfortable being pressured into deciding right now which nhl team he wants to play for because he hasn t gone through his annual introspection of whether he is even going to play another season mac says in addition to the rangers and canadiens , the red wings remain interested and lance adds that panthers defenseman wade belak , sundin s exleaf teammate , has been working the phones trying to get mats to florida , where there s a big hole where olli jokinen used to skate so we ll all just wait and for some lucky team , sundin will be worth the wait habs fans have been itching for sundin since the trade deadline , however , when they almost had a deal with fletcher , and those stories prompted montreal songwriter daniel iorio , whose clever ditties usually find their way on to montreal s english language sports radio station the team 990 , to compose an ode to mats to the tune of the eurythmics sweet dreams are made of this the song played for a few days until sundin invoked his notrade clause , but the revival of the sundin rumors revived the song and it found its way to habs inside out daniel is no annie lennox or dave stewart , but he s a lot funnier listen for the cameo impression of hockey night in canada s bob cole and sweet dreams , mats skating around remember good ol boots del baggio , the partowner of the predators who has all sorts of legal and financial trouble for falsifying his worth \?

when a sack is n't a sack demarcus ware , below , tied a league record with a sack in his 10th straight game on sunday , but he remains one away from the cowboys' team mark how could that be \? it s because the cowboys consider harvey martin s 11game streak from 1976 to 1977 , which ended before the nfl established the sack as an official statistic in 1982 , as their team record john turney , a member of the professional football researchers association , who has done extensive research on sacks , said that to his knowledge , none of the other unofficial sack leaders , players like deacon jones and coy bacon , had had a longer streak than martin s but he pointed out in a telephone interview monday that a discrepancy similar to the cowboys' existed with the giants for nearly a decade the giants' media guide listed lawrence taylor as the team s career sacks leader with 142 , making it a point to include without a qualifier the 9 1 2 sacks he had as a rookie in 1981 , the year before the sack was officially recognized but starting last year , taylor s total dropped to 132 1 2 an asterisk notes the 9 1 2 sacks he had in 1981 , but the mathematical adjustment meant that this year he dropped to second on the team s career list behind michael strahan , who finished with 141 1 2 pat hanlon , the giants' vice president for communications , said in an email message we made a decision in 2007 to include only the official sacks totals in the media guide to avoid any confusion taylor s number is officially 132 1 2 andrew das photo \( photograph by tom gannam associated press \)

october with the only victory a 3817 win over fcs opponent wofford before winning four straight to even their mark at 500 blowout losses to end the season put a damper on the monthlong winning streak , but fans hope that the momentum built during the period of solid play carries over to the fall the major problem with the 2007 wolfpack was a lack of offensive consistency \( they averaged only 202 points per game \) , a result of substandard quarterback play and a myriad of injuries at running back it is no surprise , therefore , that the fourgame winning streak coincided with their best offensive output of the season high point the fourgame streak saw the wolfpack beat east carolina , 3420 , no 18 virginia , 2924 , miami by 1916 in overtime and north carolina by 3127 in a rivalry game  low point after battling back to 55 , nc state dropped its last two games to wake forest and maryland by a combined score of 7518 the maryland loss , 370 in raleigh , was the worst defeat of the season for the wolfpack returning starters 9 \( 5 offense , 4 defense \) key losses among the wolfpack s six departed starters on defense are three of their top receiving options , receivers darrell blackman \( 41 catches for 593 yards \) and john dunlap \( a teamleading 45 catches , 375 yards \) and tight end marcus stone \( 36 for 452 \) while stone may be easily replaced by the return of the allconference tight end anthony hill from a knee injury , the wolfpack will be looking for wideouts to step up in the fall the biggest of two losses up front is guard kalani heppe , a twoyear starter on defense , the wolfpack lost the services of their three leading tacklers from a year ago , as well as the standout defensive tackle demario pressley pressley , who was slowed by injuries as a senior , still managed to start 31 games for the wolfpack , and was selected in the fifth round by the new orleans saints safety dajuan morgan , a secondteam allacc choice , led the team in tackles \( 117 \) and tied for the team lead with three interceptions his safety partner , miguel scott , also chipped in 53 tackles and an interception morgan , who declared for the nfl draft as a junior , was the only other wolfpack player taken , landing with the chiefs in the third round nc state lost its entire starting linebacking corps of ernest jones \( 113 tackles , 45 for loss \) , james martin ii \( 92 stops , 15 sacks \) and lerue rumph \( 61 tackles , 6 for loss \) players to watch if hill can return at full strength in the fall he will be a favorite for allconference honors a member of the mackey award watch list prior to his injury , hill could help immensely in the passing game another member of the receiving corps to watch is the junior wideout donald bowens , the leading returning receiver after catching 41 passes for 598 yards a year ago bowen tied for the team lead with three touchdown receptions the offensive line returns three starters from a year ago the seniors curtis crouch \( right guard \) and meares green \( center \) and the junior left tackle julian williams the defensive line will be a strength for the wolfpack leading the way are a pair of juniors , defensive end willie young and tackle alanmichael cash young led the team with 6 sacks and 24 quarterback pressures in 2007 , and cash led all linemen in tackles with 50 , including 65 for loss he was second on the team with 35 sacks a player to watch is the sophomore end markus kuhn , who earned freshman allamerican honors last fall disruptive \( 33 tackles , 5 for loss \) in parttime duty , kuhn will be asked to be an every down player as the starting end in 2008 position battle to watch the quarterback position remains unsettled after two starters were unable to provide a boost to a stagnant wolfpack offense in 2007 the first to get a shot at the job was the nebraska transfer harrison beck , but he struggled mightily \( two touchdowns against nine interceptions , including five against boston college \) in losing three of his four starts his replacement , the senior daniel evans , fared much better , throwing for 2 , 030 yards with 12 touchdowns in starting eight of the last nine games evans missed spring ball after shoulder surgery , but looks to be the front runner entering the fall the coaching staff is also giving a hard look to the redshirt freshman russell wilson , who also plays baseball for the wolfpack keep an eye on the incoming freshman mike glennon , the most highly touted recruit in nc state s first full class under o brien the younger brother of virginia tech quarterback sean glennon , he could be a dark horse to steal snaps from beck and evans if they struggle at running back , the wolfpack return three starters in the juniors toney baker and jamelle eugene and the senior andre brown nc state lost baker and brown both have over 1 , 000 career rushing yards to injuries in the regular season , but eugene held down the spot over the last six games , rushing for more than 100 yards three times down the stretch baker is most talented of the trio , and if he can recover from a serious knee injury should top the depth chart on defense , the push is on to grab one of the three open linebacker spots the sophomore nate irving had seemingly solidified his spot on the weakside after starting four games as a freshman , but will need to hold off another sophomore , thomas barnes , to keep the starting position the junior ray michel has played in 24 games , more than any other linebacker , and is competing with the big \( 65 , 245 pound \) redshirt freshman , jr sweezy , to start in the middle the senior robbie leonard , a converted safety , has been moved to the strongside but seems undersized \( 60 , 194 pounds \) another redshirt freshman , audie cole , sits right behind him on the depth chart it s a very young , talented group , and has the potential for great things 2008 schedule aug 28 south carolina sept 6 william mary sept 13 clemson sept 20 east carolina sept 27 south florida oct 4 boston college oct 16 florida state oct 25 maryland nov 8 duke nov 15 wake forest nov 22 north carolina nov 29 miami game \( s \) to watch the fourgame home stretch from late september through midoctober four tough opponents , but the wolfpack will need to take three of four if they want to get back into a bowl game season breakdown prediction nc state will only go as far as its offense can take it , and after barely gaining 1 , 000 yards rushing as a team and throwing 23 interceptions , the only place to go is up but the offense will improve , and not only because it can t get any worse having three running backs with starting experience is a huge bonus , because the trio can split carries in an attempt to tire out opposing defenses at quarterback , the experience gained during last season s struggles will pay dividends this fall , with the wolfpack s hoping either evans or beck will have learned from their mistakes and begin to play errorfree ball the defense is young , but talented early setbacks should lead to lateseason maturity for a unit that features seven underclassmen big picture , o brien is a proven winner and the right fit in raleigh he was able to turn around a struggling bc program , and the rebuilding job with nc state should prove a much easier task looking at this season , the wolfpack are definite bowl contenders should they amend their past offensive missteps while repeating last year s 57 mark is a possibility , i think getting up to seven wins is just as likely so i predict a 66 finish and a lowertier bowl appearance dream season an 84 season provides a quick turnaround under o brien nightmare season a miniwinning streak to end the season is not good enough to rescue the wolfpack from their third straight losing season where nc state fans congregate a great independent site is the red and white from state wolfpack fans interested in recruiting should check out the wolfpacker , part of the rivals network another option is the web site of the raleigh news observer  who is no 79 \? this university is located in the lightning capital of the united states
wants the to run fast and hard and with a purpose because it is easier to put the ball in the basket if the defense is not there yet but first , the knicks literally have to learn how to run lift this foot , then that one , and repeat vigorously the task falls to the smoothpated veteran of the knicks' bench , greg brittenham , and his toy box of foamrubber hurdles brittenham has served as the team s strength and conditioning coach \( officially , as assistant coach player development \) for nearly two decades he has spent only a few months with d'antoni , the former phoenix suns coach , but when brittenham explains the importance of efficient running , he sounds like a d'antoni acolyte our first three to five steps are so critical in winning the race down the court , said brittenham , affirming , i can really help teach how to run the race training began in earnest last week in saratoga springs , ny brittenham rolled out a long carpet runner on the skidmore college basketball court and strategically placed a series of 8inchhigh foamrubber hurdles at regular intervals 2 feet , 3 feet , 4 feet and so on the idea is to refine a player s stride , to force him to lift his knees and lengthen his steps it s up to them to do it mechanically right and as fast as possible , brittenham said right now , we 're just working on sprint mechanics the body alignment , the knee lift , the arm action , that s what we 're working on in the warmup period the exercise is one of many that brittenham is using as he tailors daily workouts to help d'antoni turn the knicks into a runandgun team i know that i feel a lot better , said forward david lee , who began working with brittenham over the summer i'm making better transitions from defense to offense and from offense to defense my stride has gotten better i feel lighter on my feet running correctly is nearly as important to transition basketball as defensive rebounding , good outlet passes and accurate shooting a good head start makes everything else academic brittenham paraphrased an adage of larry bird s nobody i do n't care how fast they are in this league nobody is going to beat me to the basket from 18 feet away he described a typical transition moment team a grabs a defensive rebound , and two players on the weak side one from team a and one from team b turn to run upcourt if they run at the same pace , the player from team b can intercept any pass thrown to the player from team a but if the team a player explodes in his first three to five steps , he can free himself for a quick pass in transition , and perhaps for an uncontested shot now i 've just distanced myself from you , the defender , brittenham said the whole complexity , the whole game , has changed with regard to your thought process now i 've got to catch this guy , because he s five feet ahead of me he added , if you do n't win the race the first three steps , then you 're not going to beat the guy down the court some players , like guard nate robinson , are so quick and efficient that they will beat anyone in a 90foot race , without mechanical adjustments conversely , no amount of retraining is going to turn jerome james into usain bolt but brittenham contends everyone between those two extremes can benefit from even the smallest of adjustments if i can improve a guy s stride length by two inches , and you take 20 steps to go from baseline to baseline , that s a 40inch separation , brittenham said if the defender ca n't match that , you 've got a tremendous advantage forty inches is huge to gain that two inches , brittenham has devised drills that work on huge ranges of motion , including highstepping drills in which the knees almost hit the chest and arm motion is exaggerated brittenham examines each element of a player s sprinting form , then highlights weaknesses he identified robinson as someone whose fantastic sprint mechanics make him a role model for his teammates on the counterintuitive side , brittenham praised the hulking eddy curry for having very , very good mechanics eddy really does run well for a man his size , brittenham said the program is not new brittenham has been using elements of it throughout his 18year tenure with the knicks one of his first tasks , after being hired by pat riley in 1991 , was to improve the speed and vertical leap of mark jackson you really see more gains in kind of the nonathletic person , brittenham said but every coach and brittenham has worked for nine has his own ideas about fitness , and none have given him as much free rein as d'antoni i said we just try to do a lot of running , so whatever you can do to enhance it , d'antoni said d'antoni keeps his practices brief but intense , preferring that players build their stamina by playing fullcourt , rather than through the usual regimen of suicide sprints that leaves ample time for brittenham to work with players on core strength , coordination , balance and quickness that s totally important , d'antoni said if i practice them all the time , they 'll go and they 'll slough off this other stuff d'antoni s breakneck style combined with steve nash s ball wizardry turned the suns into a western conference power the knicks have no wizards in their midst , just a 49yearold conditioning coach with a box full of tricks there s a method to his madness , jamal crawford said
august 23 , 1988 if senator bob dole is right that the incautious choice of dan quayle as his running mate is hurting george bush , at least two vital questions are raised what kind of presidential judgment was it for mr bush to make a decision that clouded what should have been his finest hour at new orleans , and may continue to cast a shadow on his campaign \? what kind of system is it that allows such a profoundly important decision to be made by one man , with as much or as little advice as he may choose to hear \? the voters ultimately will decide the political fate of mr bush and mr quayle , unless the republican presidential candidate and his advisers decide to drop the senator from the ticket a decision that now appears unlikely , and a remedy that probably would be worse than the complaint on the second question , however , even the quayle controversy probably wo n't set off much public agitation for a change in the method of choosing vicepresidential nominees no such discussion followed the nixon fund crisis of 1952 or the removal of tom eagleton from the democratic ticket in 1972 perhaps americans assume there s no better way or that since vice presidents always have been chosen by presidential nominees at least since the 12th amendment was ratified in 1804 they always should be but vice presidents always stand only a heartbeat or a signature from the oval office in the postwar era alone , harry truman and lyndon johnson succeeded to the office upon the deaths of franklin roosevelt and john kennedy , and gerald ford had to take over when richard nixon resigned the age of terrorism , moreover , may have made presidents more vulnerable to attack in the modern political era , vice presidents also are more often using the office to promote later presidential nominations for themselves mr nixon in 1960 , hubert humphrey in 1968 , walter mondale in 1984 and mr bush this year mr bush may make it , although none of the others were successful but altogether , of the 10 vice presidents from truman to bush , 7 have become president , or a presidential nominee , or both as presidential nominees themselves have come to be chosen by their own independent efforts in primaries , they have somewhat similarly chosen their running mates by processes largely restricted to their own staffs the effectiveness of these staff processes has varied with the nominee but when vice presidents are more often becoming presidents , and in an era when only the president s hand can be on the nuclear button , the choice of a vicepresidential candidate ought not to be left to one man s whim or campaign strategy or staff preference we do n't choose presidents quite so cavalierly why should we pay less attention to vicepresidential candidates \? not even a constitutional amendment is needed for a more rational system , because one already exists in the 25th amendment to the constitution it provides that when there is a vacancy in the office , the president shall nominate a vice president , who shall take the office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of congress richard nixon used this process , devised to deal with the death of a vice president , to name gerald ford after the resignation of spiro agnew mr ford , after becoming president , used it to nominate nelson rockefeller future presidential nominees could agree not to choose running mates at all \( except perhaps in the case of incumbent vice presidents \) then , after noon jan 20 of an inaugural year , the vice presidency would become vacant , the new president could make a nomination to fill it , and congress would be required to confirm or reject the nominee that s still the choice of one person , and congress would seldom reject a new president s nominee but in the cases of mr ford and particularly mr rockefeller , congress held hearings and took its confirmation duty seriously that would provide an extra barrier against an unqualified or perhaps venal vice president , and the mere existence of the confirmation requirement would influence a president to make a serious choice presidential nominees also would be relieved of the possibility that a running mate might damage the ticket s chances , and the voters' focus would have to be more nearly where it ought to be on the character and experience of those seeking the highest office in the land
as a songwriter who got his start in the antifolk community of downtown new york performers , i have a certain snobbery when it comes to performing originals as opposed to cover songs the antifolk scene emerged on manhattan s lower east side in the mid 80s as an edgier , more creative and underground alternative to the folk clubs on the west side mainly the notoriously lame bleecker street strip , where the past glory of the 60s folk clubs had degenerated into touristtrap nostalgia joints , where folk often meant covers , in clubs that are still as likely to feature a dylan or doors or springsteen tribute band as an original act no , we acoustictoting songwriters on the east side were going to take pride in the fact that while our sounds might be less acceptable and less successful , at least we were real artists , judging each other on creativity and punky uniqueness more than on technique and musical accomplishment i knew nothing of this when i started writing and playing my songs live at the sidewalk caf on avenue a in 1998 , but i soon found myself considered to be part of this antifolk movement , which i had never heard of and i found myself taking pride in antifolk tenets , too \( ironically my recent album 12 crass songs is made up completely of cover versions of songs written by the british political punk band crass but at least they are highly rearranged covers ! \) taking pride in original songwriting however begs the question , what is an original song , when it comes to folk music \( or any genre \) \? all aspects of creativity are basically reconstituted bits and pieces of things we ve seen , heard and experienced , finely or notsofinely chopped and served in a form that hopefully blends the ingredients into something new the ancient greeks seemed to know this , expressed in their belief that the muses of creativity were the daughters of mnemosyne , titan goddess of memory perhaps we would like to think that the thoughts that go into creating a new song are purely impressions from real life , but a melody does not suggest itself as much from the impression of the 6 train ride you took this morning as it does from a melody from another song the same for chord progressions , song concepts , lyric sounds and patterns , song structures and everything else folk music is supposed to be a shared continuum after all , and as louie armstrong said , all music is folk music , i ain t never heard no horse sing a song despite knowing all this , as a supposedly creative artist i am often shocked to discover that a song i ve written has been a blatant unconscious ripoff of somebody else s song , either in its structure , or lyrics , etc if i m lucky the other person s song is not particularly popular or recognizable ! sometimes i realize this as soon as i ve come up with it oh , i can t use that great chorus i just wrote , i guess it s the same melody as that gnarls barkley song sometimes i don t realize until years later where the ingredients of a song came from discussing this with a few friends of mine , we decided to make unveiling mix tapes for each other tapes that would reveal the original songs we had , knowingly or unknowingly at the time , been inspired by \( inspired by is sometimes known as illegal infringement of copyright , depending whether or not you re in a court of law ! \) i already knew some of the songs i would have to put on my own unveiling tape i was well aware that certain songs i d written had been inspired by \( since i m not in court \) bits of other people s songs going through my music collection seeking songs for the mix tape i kept discovering examples i hadn t considered i was taken aback by just how much of a ripoff artist i really was but there they were , plain as day , song after song i had copied in one way or another perhaps i wasn t an original songwriter after all but a lousy cover act , hoping my frankenstein s monster reassembled cover versions would not be noticeable it s true that in my defense i can say that my most successful unconscious ripoff method seems to be to combine songs from various eras and genres , throwing people off the scent an example of this in retrospect i can see that if you shoot the head you kill the ghoul , my 1998 zombie tribute , and still one my my most requested live songs , is basically a mix of the horrormoviemeetsgaragerock lyric aesthetic of late 70 s roky erikson set to a chord progression i d gotten from a leadbelly song all wrapped up in the clash s english civil war time and again i realized how uncreative my supposedly creative songs were does this stop my songs from being good \? certainly some people seem to like them i ve been making my living with my music for seven years and there s even a jeff lewis message board that somebody made where people \( well , a few people , bless em \) discuss every scrap of everything i do would my fans like the songs less if i sent them all unveiling mix tapes \? if i write a song today that i think is great but suddenly realize it s a bit similar to that exuma song i was listening to yesterday , should i scrap it and start from scratch \? or course not if the greatest songwriters made unveiling tapes , they d all be revealed as crooks in the first degree dylan would need a whole 20disc box set to unveil his source materials \( see suzanne vega s recent thoughts on this , the ballad of henry timrod \) as they say , talent borrows , genius steals in fact it is great fun to try to pry apart the musical and lyrical inspirations and underpinnings of all the great songs , or better yet to stumble upon what is obviously an immediate genetic predecessor of an original song that you love i have a sneaking suspicion that the velvet underground s immortal classic heroin bears lyrical traces of their contemporary village performer dave van ronk s rendition of willie the weeper , concerning an opium addict who dreams of being a sailor on the ocean deep , just as lou reed s heroin user wishes he d sailed the darkened sea \( van ronk s recording would have been widely available in new york in 1965 via the verve label , which the velvets soon signed to \) am i right \? who cares , it s fun to guess ! van ronk himself was only reinterpreting a song that had gone through many variations over decades , a song which also spawned a huge ripoff hit in cab calloway s 1931 recording of minnie the moocher none of this takes into account that songs can also get their genetic material from movies , books , poems , even paintings as a comic book artist and comic reader , i know that some of my songs owe big aesthetic debts to comics like peepshow and eightball years ago i never realized that my favorite woody guthrie song , the ballad of tom joad , and my favorite scott walker song , the seventh seal , are both merely rhyming retellings of the entire plots of movies woody and scott had just watched they didn t even have the decency to put movie spoiler alert ! warnings on the albums \( oh well , no point in watching the grapes of wrath now i guess \) thus so many of us snobby real artists are just cover artists in disguise , taking various devious steps to confuse our listeners into praising our songwriting perhaps what i do should be called songcomposting , songmulching , songsmoothieing , something like that or you could just call it ripping off and take me to court i d probably lose was raised in new york city and is a maker of comic books , tragicomic folk narratives , and lysergic garage rock the jeffrey lewis band , with his brother jack on bass and david beauchamp on drums , mixes 1960s acoustic psychedelia and experimental artpunk jeffrey uses his own illustrations to accompany some of his live songs and stories , like his ongoing complete history of communism since signing with rough trade records in 2001 , he has released four albums , including jeffrey jack lewis city eastern songs , which was selected as one of 2006 s best albums in time out new york , the boston globe , cmj monthly and elsewhere his most recent album is jeffrey lewis 12 crass songs , a reworking of songs written by the legendary anarchist punk band crass , and his most recent comic book series , fuff , is currently up to issue no 7 his web site is

havana robert l vesco , the fugitive financier who spent most of his life eluding american justice , might even have managed to die on the sly mr vesco , who was sentenced to a long prison term in in 1996 and was wanted in the united states for crimes ranging from securities fraud and drug trafficking to political bribery , died more than five months ago , on nov 23 , from lung cancer , say people close to him if so , it was never reported publicly by the cuban authorities , who said friday that they considered him a nonissue american officials said friday they knew nothing about his death we do n't know that it occurred , an american official said if mr vesco indeed eluded the american authorities until his final day , it was the fitting end to his nearly four decades on the run he was wanted for , among other things , bilking some 200 million from credulous investors in the 1970s , making an illegal contribution to s 1972 presidential campaign and trying to arrange a deal during the carter administration to let libya buy american planes in exchange for bribes to united states officials mr vesco last made the news a decade ago when he was sentenced to prison in cuba , where he had taken sanctuary , for a financial scheme he emerged in recent years and lived a quiet life in havana until he contracted lung cancer after about a week in a hospital , friends say , he died and was buried in an unmarked grave given the controversial nature of the man , none of his friends dared be identified for fear of running afoul of the cuban authorities while word of mr vesco s death could be the final ruse of a 72yearold modernday buccaneer who had every reason to drop off the radar , it would have to be an elaborate one records at col n cemetery in havana indicate that a robert vesco was buried there on nov 24 , and photographs and videos viewed by the new york times show a man resembling him in a casket with his longtime cuban companion looking over him other photos show him coughing and clearly in pain in a hospital bed on what a friend said was the day before he died there are also photos of a small group of people attending his burial his last days , a friend said , were in marked contrast to his ebullient preprison phase , when he partied lavishly , chain smoked and talked big some of those who knew mr vesco said it would not surprise them if he had orchestrated a fake death , to slip away one more time he could have died , said arthur herzog , an author who interviewed mr vesco in cuba for a biography but bob has used disguises in the past on top of that , mr herzog said , an intermediary who lives on the island had left the impression that he was in contact with mr vesco in cuba within the last month after a criminal odyssey that began on wall street , mr vesco fled the united states in 1971 , along the way repeatedly demonstrating the power of money to overcome any ideology his associates and protectors included democratically elected presidents in costa rica , the leftwing sandinistas in nicaragua , the cocaine barons of colombia , the terrorismtainted government in libya , and , finally , the communist government of fidel castro whereas the american government considered mr vesco to be an american fugitive , he had apparently somehow gained italian citizenship a friend provided a copy of an italian passport issued in 2006 that bore mr vesco s name and photograph the friend said representatives from the italian embassy had visited mr vesco while he was in jail and had assisted with his funeral arrangements an italian embassy official did not return calls seeking comment having lived comfortably in havana for more than a dozen years , mr vesco was convicted and jailed there for fraud in 1996 after reportedly doublecrossing fidel castro s relatives in a bogus wonderdrug deal how much truth there was to the allegation was impossible to know for certain because accusations against the shadowy financier have always seemed to mix rumor and fact at the height of his notoriety in the 1970s , mr vesco looked like a tough guy out of hollywood central casting tall , craggyfaced , with a mustache , long sideburns and sunglasses he liked to burnish his image as an unpredictable rogue driven as much by perverse pride as by crass profit he also delighted in thumbing his nose at cuban agents who were on his trail they responded by suggesting that mr vesco was the mastermind behind every sort of moneylaundering , narcotics and smuggling plot in the caribbean with even a fraction of what he was supposed to have stolen he could have disappeared , wrote mr herzog , in his 1987 biography , vesco from wall street to castro s cuba , the rise , fall and exile of the king of white collar crime instead , mr vesco seemed to have a compulsion to call attention to himself from his places of exile a selfmade man , he seemed hardly able to help it a high school dropout from detroit , he lied about his age to get a job on an automobile assembly line at 21 , he moved to new jersey to work for a struggling manufacturer of machine tools he took over the company when it went bankrupt , rebuilt it and renamed it the international controls corporation by the age of 30 , mr vesco was a millionaire he later turned his sights on a switzerlandbased mutual fund company , investment overseas services \( ios \) when that , too , ran into trouble , mr vesco offered to rescue the company and was embraced as a white knight by investors terrified of losing their savings he bought ios in 1970 for less than 5 million , gaining control of an estimated 400 million in funds the accounting at the company had been so chaotic that mr vesco , by adding a few subterfuges of his own , was able to plunder its holdings at will after numerous complaints , the united states securities and exchange commission carried out an investigation in 1972 , the commission charged mr vesco and others in a civil suit with stealing more than 224 million but mr vesco had already fled , first to the bahamas and then to costa rica there , he established a close friendship with president jos figueres , plowing some 11 million into his adopted country i wish more vescos would come to costa rica we need them , said mr figueres on television in response to criticism that he was harboring a criminal mr vesco also befriended donald a nixon jr , a nephew of president richard m nixon , and gave 200 , 000 to the nixon campaign , apparently hoping the president would help quash the investigation against him it was to no avail but to the frustration of the fbi mr vesco remained tantalizingly out of reach in costa rica , where he passed himself off as a progressive dairy and cattle rancher , and an investor in hightech projects eventually , one of his hightech brainstorms a factory to make machine guns , which included president figueres s son as a partner became his undoing a public and political outcry ensued , and by 1978 he was forced to leave for the bahamas , the beginning of years of hopscotching that included stops in antigua and nicaragua , before cuba finally accepted him for humanitarian reasons we do n't care what he did in the united states , fidel castro said we 're not interested in the money he has in cuba , mr vesco grew a beard , donned a white guayabera shirt and passed himself off as a canadian citizen named tom adams he and his family lived in a suburban havana house that was modest by united states standards but lavish for cubans within a few years , allegations began to circulate about mr vesco s involvement in narcotics trafficking , and he was named as a coconspirator in the trial in florida of carlos lehder rivas , a reputed leader of colombia s biggest drug cartel mr vesco eventually ran afoul of the castro government with a scheme to produce a wonder drug that supposedly cured cancer , aids , arthritis and even the common cold he was accused of defrauding a staterun biotechnology laboratory run by fidel castro s nephew , antonio fraga castro , and sentenced to 13 years after serving most of his time in a private cell in a large prison in eastern cuba , mr vesco was quietly released in 2005 and lived so simply in recent years in havana that a friend said he did not know what had happened to his fortune
bangkok thai politics was consumed by hard political bargaining wednesday , a day after prime minister was convicted in court and removed from office after receiving money for televised cooking demonstrations his party immediately said it would nominate him to succeed himself in office when a new prime minister is chosen friday but that support has been weakening and other contenders have emerged from both within and outside the ruling sixparty coalition whatever the outcome , there was no sign that a damaging antigovernment protest that has spread to students and labor unions was ending more than an attack on the sitting government , the protests grow out of deep political and social divides that have hardened over the past three years and threaten the stability of  the protesters who are now camped in the mud at government house represent the latest turn in a longrunning struggle between democratic ideals and a traditional , hierarchical society that feels disenfranchised by democratic change this time , whatever the outcome of the confrontation , analysts say democracy is likely to suffer mr samak s government was elected last december and asserts that democracy is on its side but it is an extension of the authoritarian model of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who worked to weaken democratic checks and balances during his fiveyear tenure mr thaksin was ousted in a coup in september 2006 and is now in london , where he is seeking political asylum to evade corruption cases here that he says are politically motivated his personality and his money still dominate thai politics , even from exile , and much of the anger of the protesters is directed at him the protesters call themselves the people s alliance for democracy , or pad but in fact they are raising a cry that goes back more than a century that thailand is not ready for democracy they want to replace the country s elected parliament with a mostly appointed body in which power would run topdown , as it does in traditional thai society the pad is a variation of the deeprooted hierarchical society , said thongchai winichakul , a professor of southeast asian history at the university of wisconsinmadison in a nutshell it s a kind of distrust of the people he added you can find this idea beginning in the late 19th century , when king chulalongkorn said thai people do not want democracy , that thai people trust the king throughout all the years that kind of idea remained , mr thongchai said people are not ready' the protests began in late 2005 as antithaksin demonstrations that paved the way for the coup that ousted him two years ago they resumed in may after the current prothaksin government took office , and escalated on aug 26 with a takeover of the grounds of the prime minister s office they have been largely nonviolent and the military has pledged not to use force to disperse them , even after mr samak declared a state of emergency early last week in an editorial wednesday , matichon , one of thailand s leading dailies , warned that returning mr samak to office could touch off a new wave of anger reappointing samak will only widen the rift in society and risk leading the country into chaos and a bloodbath , it said the protesters are a mix of royalist elites , generals and businessmen with some liberal democrats , students and trade unionists , some of whom are united only by their opposition to the prothaksin government at its core , the people s alliance would move thailand away from the basic democratic principle of one man , one vote , said prajak kongkeerati , a leading political scientist at thammasat university many thai elite do n't believe in that , he said we are really a hierarchical society the people s alliance would return the country to a 20yearold model of semidemocracy in which the bureaucracy and the military have a role in politics and businessmen share a voice with elected representatives , mr prajak said this political structure has deepened the divide in thailand between those who have and those who do not , he said we can say that every government has a policy platform that has an urban bias , mr prajak said so when elections come , they court the support of the rural vote but when they are in power they formulate policy that favors the urban and industrial sector as thailand has surged forward economically over the past two decades , many of the fruits of growth and globalization have not reached beyond bangkok , perpetuating the disparity mr thaksin placed the poor at the center of his electoral strategy with populist policies like lowcost health care and debt forgiveness the underrepresented poor found their voice in voting for him , creating an overwhelming electoral majority that threatened the primacy of the bangkokbased establishment this is one reason the antigovernment forces are finding that democracy no longer works for them and are seeking other routes to power their movement amounts to a retreat from the trajectory of change of the past 15 years , said chris baker , a british historian and author of books on thailand almost absent from today s debate , he said , is a strong liberal tradition that has been the driving force for democratic change for the past century the difference now is that this protest movement does not seek to improve the democratic system but to replace it we used to chant the mantra of elections all the time , said sondhi limthongkul , a publisher who is one of the leaders of the protests now elections in thailand lead to a very shabby democracy thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932 but democracy has ridden a roller coaster of 18 coups and 18 constitutions elected governments were mostly unstable coalitions of feuding parties , and until mr thaksin s fiveyear tenure , none had been elected to a second term as the current confrontation continues , a central question is whether the military will stage another coup with a claim that it is restoring order , despite a promise by the army chief , gen anupong paochinda , that this would not happen if the situation becomes critical , many thais hope king bhumibol adulyadej will intervene as he has several times over the years to defuse confrontations the king stands above the fray of politics , but he is deeply revered and his word is the authority of last resort in a country that has still not found its political footing his personality is the unifying force of thai society and the core of thai identity no successor will be able to command the devotion and moral influence that he has built up over 62 years on the throne the king is 80 years old and in poor health , and one issue that hovers over thai politics is what will happen once he is gone
former vice president and a number of other senior democrats plan to remain neutral for now in the presidential race in part to keep open the option to broker a peaceful resolution to what they fear could be a bitterly divided convention , party officials and aides said friday officials said that in the past week mr gore and other leading democrats had held private talks as worry mounted that the close race between senators and could be decided by a group of 795 party insiders known as superdelegates the signs that party elders are weighing whether and how to intervene reflects the extraordinary nature of the contest now and the concern among some democrats that they not risk an internal battle that could harm the party in the general election but they also provided an early glimpse at the complex set of tradeoffs facing party leaders , from their desire to make their own influence felt to their worries about offending the candidates and particular constituencies not to mention the long , sometimes troubled relationship between mr gore and the clintons the issues party leaders are grappling with , they said , include how to avoid the perception of a backroom deal that thwarts the will of millions of voters who have cast ballots in primaries and caucuses that perception could cripple the eventual democratic nominee s chances of winning the presidency in november , they said a number of senior democrats , including speaker nancy pelosi and three candidates who have dropped out of the 2008 race , former senator john edwards and senators christopher j dodd and joseph r biden jr , have spoken with mr gore in recent days none have endorsed a candidate , although ms pelosi made comments on friday that were widely seen as supportive of mr obama when it came to the process the party should use to make its choice of candidate it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided , ms pelosi said in an interview with bloomberg television ms pelosi said she intended to remain neutral , though some of her closest friends and allies in the house are publicly supporting mr obama she said the nomination should not be decided by delegates from florida and michigan allocated on the basis of voting in primaries there last month , as the clinton campaign has proposed mrs clinton got more votes in both places , although neither candidate actively campaigned there and mr obama was not even on the ballot in michigan the party had penalized those states for holding their primaries earlier than the party wanted by stripping them of their delegates to the convention we ca n't ignore the rules which everyone else played by , ms pelosi said few figures are being more closely watched by democratic insiders than mr gore , the nobel peace prize winner who associates say has been lobbied hard for an endorsement by allies of mrs clinton and of mr obama although it is not clear what role their past may play in his decision , mr gore and the clintons have a complicated , sometimes intense history , and mr obama s strength in the presidential race could make it even more complicated some of mr gore s allies have complained bitterly that mr clinton concentrated more on mrs clinton s senate run in 2000 than on getting mr gore elected president for his part , mr clinton was surprised and hurt that mr gore did not enlist him on the campaign trail in the final weeks of the presidential campaign although mr gore has expressed concerns to some associates about the damage a brokered convention could cause , several associates said he was hopeful that one candidate would soon break through , sparing the party such an outcome he told a close friend recently that his decision not to endorse feels like the right thing and that he remained optimistic the race is going to tip at some point , the friend said another close ally of mr gore s , however , said he recognizes the need for a few party elders to stay on the sidelines to ensure , if needed , that the process is fair and honest it could very likely take a group of senior party people , including gore , to settle this , but the only way they can settle it is if they stay on the sidelines now kalee kreider , communications director for mr gore , said that he has no present plans to endorse a candidate , though she added , he has not ruled out that possibility prior to the convention ms kreider declined to discuss mr gore s private conversations with party leaders but four close associates of mr gore s said senior party officials had actively consulted him for his advice about what the superdelegates should do if neither mr obama nor mrs clinton amassed the 2 , 025 delegates necessary to win the nomination after the final democratic caucus in puerto rico on june 7 party leaders described mr gore as a potentially crucial mediator because the putative head of the party and the man who chose him as his vice president bill clinton , is hardly a neutral observer when it comes to his wife s candidacy because president clinton is very involved on one side , there is an opening for him to be a more neutral force and an honest broker , said a close associate of mr gore s , who like most of the associates spoke only on the condition of anonymity he s probably the only unaligned person with the kind of stature to step in to that role and have a real impact on this several allies said that because of mr gore s bruising defeat in 2000 presidential voting in florida , he would have the credibility with democrats to carry the message that the will of the people should be respected both the clinton and obama campaigns are aggressively lobbying the superdelegates , a battle that received new attention after representative john lewis of georgia , who had endorsed mrs clinton , said late thursday that he would cast his superdelegate ballot for mr obama if the battle for the nomination went to the convention the clinton camp has mr clinton making frequent calls , and mr obama s surrogates are pushing for superdelegates from states where he won primaries or caucuses to pledge their support to him but there was no sign of any wholesale shift in support toward mr obama on friday representative james e clyburn of south carolina , the democratic whip and highestranking africanamerican in congress , said he intended to remain neutral and let the primaries play out even though mr obama won overwhelmingly in his district and state if i were to only reflect my state , then that may not be good enough for a national candidate , mr clyburn said so i think we ought to use our collective judgment to do what is in the best interests of our party but the role that the superdelegates should play between now and the convention is at the heart of a raging debate mrs clinton s campaign , which is trailing in the delegate count , has taken the position that superdelegates should be free to choose the bestqualified candidate mr obama s campaign has said that the superdelegates should be bound by the voters' will several senior officials cautioned that the party elders had not yet determined whether superdelegates should be urged to cast their votes for the candidate who has the most delegates , or the one who won their state or congressional district , or the winner of the popular vote because mr obama and mrs clinton might lead in different categories , the question is a vital one at a private dinner that mr edwards , a former senator , held at his home last saturday for a dozen close friends , he said he had spoken recently with mr gore about the benefits of neutrality , someone who was at the dinner said although a number of his supporters had been urging him to endorse mr obama and mrs clinton has actively sought his backing , mr edwards said he intended to remain on the fence for the time being , the person said a senior associate of mr gore s said that surrogates for mrs clinton and mr obama had tried to lock up the former vice president s endorsement but he has steadfastly refused to even hint at which candidate he might favor
, who as an influential critic in britain and later for the new york times helped bring dance to a broad audience with an exuberant , highly personal style and who for many years was a theater critic for the times and then the new york post , died early wednesday he was 81 and lived in manhattan his death , at mount sinai hospital in manhattan , was caused by complications of cancer , his wife , valerie taylor barnes , said until a few weeks before his death , he continued filing reviews for the post , as he had for the last 30 years mr barnes , a buoyant , energetic londoner who once described himself as your typical workingclass overachiever , made his mark by waging a sustained assault on british dance criticism as it was then practiced just after world war ii it was , he argued , provincial and illinformed scribbling usually by music critics writing for several publications simultaneously , primarily the spectator and the times of london , which hired him as its first fulltime dance critic in 1961 , he exposed his readers to foreign dance companies and choreographers like george balanchine and martha graham when most british critics were ignoring them his 13 years as dance critic at the times , from 1965 to 1977 , coincided with a rapid expansion of the dance world and an explosion of new talent as chief theater critic , a position he held for nearly a decade , he championed plays by harold pinter and tom stoppard , wrote appreciatively of the young david mamet and embraced , initially with some reservations and later with none , the musical hair it was as a dance critic , however , that he made his strongest impact he witnessed and described , as he later observed in dance magazine , dance s finest hours in all its brief history , a period in which jerome robbins and balanchine were at their peak , merce cunningham and paul taylor moved from strength to strength , and new choreographers like eliot feld and twyla tharp were beginning to make a stir at the times , mr barnes made dance an art for all , taking both dance criticism and american dance out of its specialized niche his erudition , distilled into shrewdly pithy analysis , prompted not just readers but also choreographers and dancers to sit up and learn something new he was literate , knowledgeable and passionate , said lynn garafola , a professor of dance at barnard college when it came to a challenging work , he would review not just the first performance , but the second performance and third performance , and then write an analytic piece , too he also had a remarkable visual memory he was n't just seeing the ballet in front of him he had a bank of memories that went back half a century clive alexander barnes was born in london his father , an ambulance driver , deserted the family when clive was 7 his mother , a secretary for a theatrical press agent , passed along free tickets to her son , who began attending theater and ballet at an early age after attending a boarding school on scholarship , he enrolled at the university of london s medical school that did not work out he wanted to be a psychiatrist , but that was 10 years away , and he could n't stand the sight of blood , his second wife , the former patricia winckley , told dance magazine after spending two years with the royal air force , he earned a scholarship to oxford , where he joined the ballet club and became an editor of arabesque , its quarterly journal he also began writing for the journal dance and dancers , eventually becoming its executive editor he and a coterie of likeminded dance writers mounted a kind of cultural takeover bid , taking deliberate aim at the dance establishment and pushing themselves forward as the voices of the rising generation we all began freelancing , and we were all terribly mean to the established dance critics , who were all music critics , really , and did n't know a thing about dance , mr barnes told mccall s magazine in 1969 we were kind of young turks , obnoxious as hell , but it worked we wanted every paper in london to have a specialist dance critic , and we won now they all do mr barnes began writing on dance for new statesman and published his first book , ballet in britain since the war \( watts \) in 1953 in 1956 , after toiling as a planner for the london county council for several years , he was hired by the daily express , a tabloid newspaper , to review dance , theater , film and television with his left hand he turned out dance criticism for several other newspapers under pseudonyms an early marriage ended in divorce , as did subsequent marriages to ms winckley and amy pagnozzi in addition to his fourth wife , ms barnes , he is survived by a son , christopher , of london a daughter , maya johansen , of woodstock , ny and two grandchildren in 1965 editors at the new york times , which was reorganizing its cultural news coverage , asked mr barnes , who had been contributing reviews from london for several years , to become the newspaper s dance critic although undecided , mr barnes jumped at the offer of a free airplane ticket to new york , where balanchine s don quixote was about to receive its premiere once in new york , he decided to stay as a critic he stood out for openmindedness and enthusiasm dance was traditionally divided into audiences attached to a single choreographer mr barnes could champion paul taylor and merce cunningham at the same time he was one of the first to point out , in 1966 , that mr cunningham , then leaving audiences dumbfounded , was not interested in specific meaning but rather was an artist who brings something to our attention to make of it just what we will we have to meet the artist halfway , we have to bring something before we can take something away , mr barnes wrote he excelled at pithy , perceptive description the masculine style of paul taylor s company , which he supported , he called teddybear athleticism as for ballet , mr barnes extolled it to a mass audience rudolf nureyev might have attracted balletomanes from the start , but somebody had to spread the word in 1967 mr barnes became the first in the west to single out the new , 19yearold talent mikhail baryshnikov although frederick ashton , the great british choreographer with the royal ballet , was his hero , mr barnes was also an early supporter of balanchine and paid tribute to him in a typically distilled insight when the new york city ballet opened its 1972 stravinsky festival many choreographers have borrowed stravinsky , but mr balanchine has continually returned interest on the loan he could be scathing he once called the bolshoi swan lake a national catastrophe yet he was unafraid of extravagant prose reviewing a performance of kenneth macmillan s romeo and juliet , with nureyev and margot fonteyn in the principal roles , he wrote , it is the image of dame margot and mr nureyev that remains , like the bloodred shape of an instant left on a sunlit retina when the eyes are closed in 1967 , after the new york herald tribune and several other newspapers ceased publication , editors at the times , concerned that too much power was now concentrated in one critic , divided the theater job walter kerr , the daily critic , was assigned to write weekly critical essays in the sunday arts section , and mr barnes was offered the vacant slot , which he initially refused i felt that i was a firstrate dance critic and did not want to be a secondrate drama critic , he told newsweek at the time once on the job , he went at it with gusto he showed a marked taste for experimental and unconventional theater , once dismissing standard broadway fare as stage visualizations of tv dramas the criticism was punchy , chatty and quirky , with a witty turn of phrase that some found delightful , others infuriating one sure gauge i have of telling whether a play is boring me is when a telephone rings in the last act and i start in my seat and hope it s for me , he wrote of the doomed what did we do wrong \? in 1967 in the season , his chronicle of the 19678 broadway season , william goldman complained that mr barnes was biased toward british playwrights and actors and , unforgivably , had failed to recognize tennessee williams and arthur miller as modern masters the combustible producer david merrick vowed to stay on broadway if only for the pleasure of throwing his fat limey posterior out in the street in 1978 editors at the times decided that one critic could not , realistically , cover two disciplines , and mr barnes was ordered to give up the theater job he accepted a dualcritic position with the post , where for the next 30 years he was its chief drama and dance critic his last review , on the american ballet theater , appeared on oct 31 in it he heralded a new sensation , daniil simkin , a 21yearold russian appearing in his first major role his dancing , mr barnes wrote , had the glint of gold in it he also wrote the attitudes column for dance magazine from 1989 and contributed to the french magazine ballet 2000 and the british magazine the stage and he wrote or contributed to many books , among them frederick ashton and his ballets \( 1961 \) , dance scene usa \( 1967 \) and nureyev \( 1982 \) prolific and influential , he nonetheless maintained a consistently skeptical attitude toward criticism in general and his own in particular the job s impossible , he once said , and one must pray that one will be only moderately incompetent
des moines senator barack obama of illinois , a oneterm democratic senator trying to become the nation s first africanamerican president , rolled to victory in the caucuses on thursday night , lifted by what appeared to be a record turnout of voters who rejected the criticism that he did not have enough experience mr obama s victory amounted to a significant setback for senator hillary rodham clinton of new york , who just months ago appeared to be the frontrunner for the democratic presidential nomination , but has watched her position erode over the past several months the result also left uncertain the prospects for john edwards , a former senator from north carolina , who had staked his second bid for the white house on winning this state speaking to supporters after declaring victory , mr obama said they said this day would never come they said our sights were set too high they said this country was too divided , too disillusioned , to come together over a common purpose he continued you have done what the cynics said you could n't do you have done what the state of new hampshire can do in five days you have done what america can do in this new year , 2008 we are one nation , we are one people , and the time for change has come on the republican side , mike huckabee , the former governor of arkansas who was barely a blip on the national scene just two months ago , defeated mitt romney , a former massachusetts governor , delivering a serious setback to mr romney s highspending campaign and putting pressure on mr romney to win in new hampshire next tuesday with nearly 80 percent of republican precincts reporting , mr huckabee won with 34 percent of the vote to 25 percent for mr romney and 13 percent each for mr thompson and mr mccain on the democratic side , with 97 percent of votes tallied , mr obama had 375 percent , mr edwards 299 percent and mrs clinton 294 percent gov bill richardson of new mexico was a distant fourth , with 21 percent of the vote most of the other democratic efforts were rolled off the map , unable in many districts to gain the 15 percent needed to become viable , including those of senators christopher j dodd of connecticut , joseph r biden jr of delaware and mr richardson both mr biden and mr dodd later dropped out of the race competitive campaigns and compelling candidates in both parties sparked record turnouts , exceeding every previous iowa caucus and everyone s expectations an estimated 220 , 000 democrats showed up at caucus sites , compared to 124 , 000 in 2004 about 114 , 000 republicans turned out the last contested republican caucuses in 2000 drew about 88 , 000 george w bush , then the governor of texas , won among democrats that produced scenes of overcrowded firehouses and schools and long lines of people waiting to sign in mr obama s victory in this overwhelmingly white state stood as a powerful answer to the question of whether america was prepared to vote for a black person for president at the same time , the apparent surge of independent voters to his side , as suggested by polls of voters entering the caucuses , suggested his potential appeal in a general election the result sent waves of apprehension across mrs clinton s camp , and she turned her attention to new hampshire aides said that former president bill clinton would go there immediately and spend the next five days campaigning in a state where he has always been strong senator clinton , flanked by her husband and madeleine albright , the former secretary of state , congratulated senator obama and mr edwards she said the message of the iowa electorate was clear we are going to have change , and that change is going to be a democratic president in the white house in 2009 she said she was undaunted by her thirdplace showing in iowa she said she had always intended to run a national campaign and she would go forward , beginning in new hampshire on friday i am so ready for the rest of the campaign and i am so ready to lead mr edwards declared , the one thing that s clear with the results in iowa tonight is the status quo lost and change won on the republican side , mr romney had blanketed the state with television advertisements and , with a nod to the way campaigns are normally won here , built an extensive getoutthevote operation that carted mr romney s supporters to the polls all day as polls showed mr huckabee rising , mr romney responded with a monthlong barrage of ads attacking him on and taxes congratulations on the first round to mike , mr romney said on fox news mr huckabee s populist appeal powered by support from evangelicals outmuscled a political operation that mr romney spent more than a year building polls of republicans entering the caucus sites found that nearly 60 percent described themselves as evangelical christians , and by overwhelming numbers they said they intended to vote for mr huckabee a survey of democrats entering the caucus sites found that more than half said they were attending their first caucus and they divided , with about 40 percent for mr obama and about 30 percent for mrs clinton there was also a sharp generational break in support of the two candidates mr obama was backed by 60 percent of voters under 25 while mrs clinton was supported by about 45 percent of voters over 65 among democrats , nearly half of respondents said that their top factor in choosing a candidate was someone who could bring about change mr obama won the support of about half that group just 20 percent said the right experience , mrs clinton s key argument , was the main factor among that group , nearly half chose mrs clinton for all the talk about electability , barely one in 10 respondents said it was the main factor in their decision mrs clinton and mr edwards had an edge over mr obama in this area the personal quality republican voters said mattered most in a candidate was that they shared their values what mattered second most was that a candidate said what he believed mr huckabee outpolled mr romney in both of those groups the republican race was relatively straightforward mr romney and mr huckabee were the main contestants , with none of the other candidates devoting much time or money to the state mr giuliani made intermittent efforts here mr mccain at one point all but wrote off the state , but returned after he won the endorsement of the des moines register and saw , with the rise in polls of mr huckabee , an opportunity to finish third for democrats , the contest had historic overtones a battle between a firstterm senator , mr obama , trying to become the nation s first black president , and a former first lady , mrs clinton , seeking to become the first woman to occupy the oval office the democratic caucus results do not reflect the actual percentage of people who expressed a preference for a particular candidate rather , they are the percentage of delegates allocated to each of the candidates based on a complex formula the democratic party does not release the actual number of democrats who caucus for each candidate the republican results reflect a direct count of the preferences expressed by those who participated in the republican caucuses mirroring the unusual rush of the nominating calendar the primary in new hampshire is a mere five days away the major candidates planned to pick up as soon as the caucus results were known and flew to new hampshire to be on the ground for early morning rallies , television appearances and campaign stops mrs clinton s campaign plane was scheduled to leave iowa at midnight the one exception was mr giuliani , who largely skipped the iowa caucuses he started the day in new hampshire and spent the rest of it in florida the voting on thursday ended what was one of the most intense years of politicking in the history of the iowa caucuses television advertisements for all the major candidates were aired right up until the time iowans were leaving their homes or being picked up for the 7 pm start of the caucuses as the day moved on , the candidates and some spouses like bill clinton were doing interviews with iowa television and radio stations the campaigns , meanwhile , began executing the most sophisticated voter turnout operations ever seen in iowa , as campaign workers began calling people who had long ago been identified as supporters to make certain they would show up to make their preferences known the inducements included free rides to caucus sites , babysitting and food in a development that both mr obama and mrs clinton had hoped for , the day was snowfree and the singledigit temperatures of earlier in the week were gone the theory was that supporters of mr edwards were experienced caucusgoers who were used to dealing with bad

reading some of today s news , it suddenly struck me we re living in the age of the anticassandra cassandra had the gift of prophecy she saw , correctly , what was coming but was under a curse nobody would believe her today , our public discourse is dominated by people who have been wrong about everything but are still , mysteriously , treated as men of wisdom , whose judgments should be believed those who were actually right about the major issues of the day can t get a word in edgewise what set me off was the matter of alan greenspan as dean baker like to remind us , news analyses of the housing and financial crisis almost always draw exclusively on experts who first insisted that there wasn t a housing bubble , then insisted that the financial consequences of the bubble s bursting would remain contained it s even worse , of course , on the matter of iraq just about every one of the panels convened to discuss the lessons of five disastrous years consisted solely of men and women who cheered the idiocy on now , none of this is entirely new consider what keynes said in 1931 a sound banker , alas , is not one who foresees danger and avoids it , but one who , when he is ruined , is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows , so that no one can really blame him still , it seems especially extreme now and think of the incentive effects what s the point of taking the risk of challenging conventional wisdom if , even after you re proved right , only the guys who were wrong get invited to opine on charlie rose \?

arab hamadah , in one of the deadliest stretches for american troops in months , militants killed nine soldiers in the volatile sunni arab heartlands north of baghdad on tuesday and wednesday as the military began its third offensive in a year to dislodge sunni guerrillas from sanctuaries deep within the lush farmlands and palm groves of diyala province six of the american soldiers were killed wednesday at an unspecified location in diyala in part of the offensive when insurgents detonated a large bomb hidden in a house four other soldiers were wounded , and an interpreter of unknown nationality was killed a military spokesman later confirmed that the explosion had occurred while the soldiers were clearing a building the military did not release further information , but in diyala , northeast of baghdad , house bombs have long been a staple weapon for sunni fighters who try to lure soldiers inside boobytrapped buildings another house rigged to explode was discovered in the diyala village of khan bani saad on sunday warplanes destroyed it with bombs three american soldiers were killed tuesday in neighboring salahuddin province , where fighting has been fierce recently between sunni extremists and sunni militiamen who have allied with american forces the attacks were another sign that insurgents remained very strong in the sunnidominated cities and countryside north of baghdad sixteen americans have died already this year , mostly north of baghdad , and sunni militants have carried out devastating attacks in diyala against sunni militiamen who recently joined forces with american troops five severed heads were found on a road near the provincial capital , baquba , on monday the killers used blood to scrawl a gruesome warning in arabic across the foreheads join the americanbacked militias and you will end up like this while the diyala insurgents have been striking at american soldiers and their sunni militia allies , the commander of american ground troops in northern iraq acknowledged on wednesday that many of the militants who were the focus of the new offensive had fled in advance , possibly after being tipped off i'm sure there s active leaking of communication , said the northern commander , maj gen mark p hertling encountering insurgent booby traps but few evident insurgents , troops in armored stryker units advanced through the diyala river valley on wednesday during the second day of the offensive soldiers passed through deserted streets on patrols aimed at driving extremist islamist factions from their strongholds north of baquba speaking to reporters in baghdad , general hertling identified unsecured iraqi army communications as a possible reason the insurgents targets had managed to slip through the net , as may have happened before an offensive in baquba last june he noted that the iraqi forces relied on unsecured cellphones and radios however , general hertling said forces would continue to hunt al qaeda in mesopotamia , the homegrown sunni insurgent group that the american military says is led by foreigners he described the diyala offensive as part of a wider operation to kill or capture the group s fighters across the country general hertling said that in his northern command , 24 , 000 american troops , 50 , 000 iraq soldiers and 80 , 000 iraqi police officers were now involved in the hunt he said that in diyala province , 20 to 30 of the group s fighters had been killed since the start of the current operation planners said before the operation that the diyala valley was a stronghold for extremist groups , including al qaeda in mesopotamia , the islamic state of iraq and ansar alsunna but as soldiers of company i , third squadron , second stryker cavalry regiment moved in from the north on the second day of the offensive , they found little sign of the 200 or so insurgents thought to be operating there in villages near the insurgents' supposed nerve center , residents confirmed that carloads of armed and masked men operated freely until recently some residents said the gunmen left after being alerted to the operation by increased helicopter traffic the american troops say they believe that some insurgents remained , in part because residents reported that one car bomb was planted on the morning the offensive began they say they also suspect that some residents know more than they disclose but are too intimidated to speak , at least until american and iraqi forces show they are going to remain in the area near the village of arab hamadah , the stryker unit discovered an islamist leaflet bearing a photograph of an attack on an iraqi government checkpoint and threatening to kill anyone working with the iraqi army , the police and the american forces it also warned residents not to become part of the awakening , the sunni tribal movement that has turned against al qaeda in mesopotamia and begun cooperating with the americans , providing neighborhood watch patrols that are increasingly the targets of insurgents as the americans moved through vineyards and canals , first lt david moore said the dense vegetation posed the greatest threat none of us is afraid of the firefights , the guns and all that , he said it is the deepburied stuff that you ca n't see i do n't think we have lost anybody from our company in a firefight we have only lost people from explosions but even before news emerged of wednesday s deadly attack , officers voiced fears that as they penetrated deeper into insurgent strongholds , the threat of house bombs would increase

los angeles had barely nestled into his new perch , the top railing of the thirdbase dugout at dodger stadium , when dave roberts singled and took off for second base if torre had any flashbacks , to 2004 when roberts s ninthinning steal of second base started the red sox on their trip back from a three gamestonone deficit in the american league championship series , it lasted only an instant or as long as it took catcher russell martin to fire a strike to second baseman jeff kent , who tagged out roberts from start to finish , torre s debut as dodgers manager was as picture perfect as the weather on a sunkissed monday afternoon , his new team welcoming him with a 50 win over the barry bondsless and punchless before a sellout crowd of 56 , 000 kent belted a tworun homer in the first inning , brad penny pitched a flawless six and twothirds innings and rafael furcal did a fair derek jeter impression with his bat and his glove , collecting three hits and doing a 360degree pirouette on a grounder up the middle still , the 67yearold torre , who won four world series titles with the yankees over the last 12 seasons , was as anxious as third baseman blake dewitt , who made his major league debut i was nervous , torre said after leaving the field to the strains of randy newman s i love la we got three in the first and you want to score in every inning and make it as easy as possible whether it was a winter of rejuvenation or his exit from new york , torre looked far from the beleaguered figure of last fall or someone who 'd barely slept sunday night his sunken eyes were masked by dark sunglasses instead of dark circles the deep lines in his face appeared softened by a rich tan if his looks hinted that he was happy to be out of new york , his words only reinforced the suggestion torre said he exchanged good luck phone calls and text messages sunday and monday with jeter , jorge posada , the new yankees manager joe girardi and members of the yankees' training staff but that was where his nostalgia ended opening day in that situation i was in i would n't look forward to it , torre said of new york i had a wonderful time there and a great deal of success professionally , i played for 16 years and i do n't think i enjoyed or had as much satisfaction as i did in the time there but i knew i had run up against it at that point it just was n't a whole lot of fun in los angeles , torre was sought to restore credibility to an organization that had gone through three general managers and three managers in the four years since frank mccourt bought the club the dodgers have won one playoff game since their 1988 world series title , but torre said they were the one club other than the yankees that could lean on its history they have done so to begin their 50th year in los angeles they played an exhibition saturday at their first home here , drawing 115 , 300 to the los angeles memorial coliseum and before monday s game they introduced several former dodgers , including sandy koufax , fernando valenzuela , maury wills and steve garvey i had goose bumps seeing all those guys from the past , said matt kemp , the dodgers' 23yearold right fielder it is youthful talent like kemp , the no 3 hitter the 25yearold allstar catcher russell martin 23yearold first baseman james loney and 23yearold pitchers chad billingsley and jonathan broxton that has torre enthused young players bring energy , torre said torre s presence had been felt during spring training in a clubhouse that ended last season in turmoil , when prospects and veterans bickered as the dodgers collapsed down the stretch the manager at the time , grady little , appeared to do little to address the rift until it was too late intensity , the noexcuses attitude , said left fielder andre ethier , when asked what qualities torre brought with him then he considered another credibility everything happened in new york during his tenure , ethier said so when he says something , it s not one of those things where you might blow it off and say whatever' every one of his words holds value missing monday , for dodgers fans , was their favorite villain , barry bonds this season is the first since 1992 that bonds is not with the giants gone is the media circus , the specter of balcorelated perjury charges and bonds s recliner in the giants' clubhouse in their place is a giantsized hole in the lineup the giants managed just five hits , all of them singles it s a different game , penny said of the giants' lineup , which now has bengie molina as its cleanup hitter it changes the game plan for pitchers in meetings we have now , it s not do n't let barry beat you when torre returned to his office , there was a note from an old friend , billy crystal he said he planned to have dinner with the 18 members of his family who were in attendance they might share a toast , but torre reminded that it was not yet april , so it was not likely to be champagne we do n't like to do that stuff until october , he said
more than four months after collapsed in central park during the united states olympic marathon trials , the new york city medical examiner determined that his death was caused by an irregular heartbeat that stemmed from an enlarged and scarred heart shay , who was 28 when he died nov 3 in pursuit of a berth in the beijing olympics , was found to have an enlarged heart at age 14 , according to his father , joe shay the medical examiner could not determine the origin of the patchy scars , called fibrosis ellen borakove , a spokeswoman for the medical examiner , said she could not comment on the specific results of the toxicology tests as a matter of policy , nor could she reveal what chemicals were tested for joe shay said none of the toxicology tests were positive , although he did not know what tests were conducted i believe it was a fair and accurate assessment , joe shay said tuesday in a telephone interview from the family s home in central lake , mich he was informed of the results by telephone and email messages from the medical examiner s office and was awaiting a copy of the full report everything that could be done was done , he said , and it s great that they devoted so much time to this shay arrived in new york last fall with aspirations of making his first olympic team , but about five and a half miles into the race he collapsed he was taken to lenox hill hospital and was pronounced dead at 8 46 am , while the 262mile race was still under way the 2003 united states marathon champion , shay was seemingly as fit as any elite endurance athlete , leading to speculation after his death that he may have had a condition known as athlete s heart , an enlarged heart developed from training dr paul thompson , a cardiologist in hartford who specializes in heart disease in athletes , said the scars detected in the autopsy probably ruled that out with athlete s heart , you should n't have fibrosis , dr thompson said patchy fibrosis means something in the past injured the heart usually a viral infection leads to the death of some cells , and when heart cells die , they 're replaced by fibrotic tissue , which is tough , stringy stuff these tough scars can set up abnormal electrical currents if normal conductivity gets blocked , it can result in fast abnormal rhythms and a person can die joe shay said the medical examiner s office told him the scars suggested old damage but i do n't know what old is , he said could go back to when he was 14 years old , because that s when he had the pneumonia i think they 're going to archive some of the samples , because in 10 years they may be able to test right now , they do n't as the medical examiner investigated shay s death , the shay family became concerned that a genetic disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , known as hcm , was the cause hcm is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people in the united states i have a son that runs 80100 miles a week , joe shay said , referring to stephan , the youngest of his eight children and an athlete at brigham young university i wanted to know , are we going to have the same problems here \?

tbilisi , as the conflict between and georgia enters its second week , there is growing evidence of looting and ethnic cleansing in a number of villages throughout the area of conflict the attacks some witnessed by reporters or documented by a human rights group include stealing , the burning of villages and possibly even killings some are ethnically motivated , while at least some of the looting appears to be the work of profiteers in areas from which the authorities have fled the identities of the attackers vary , but a pattern of violence by ethnic ossetians against ethnic georgians is emerging and has been confirmed by some russian authorities now ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians in their enclaves , said maj gen vyacheslav nikolaevich borisov , the commander in charge of the city of gori , occupied by the russians a lieutenant from an armored transport division that was previously in chechnya said we have to be honest the ossetians are marauding the hostilities between russia and georgia started last week when the georgian military marched into the disputed territory of south ossetia , and the russians responded by sending troops into the prorussia , separatist enclave and then into georgia proper dozens of houses were on fire on tuesday in the northern suburbs of tskhinvali , the capital of south ossetia reporters saw armed men moving on the streets , carting away electronics and other household items it was not clear who the men were they did not appear to be part of the russian forces , but the russians were not stopping them we 're not a police force , we 're a military force , said a russian lieutenant colonel in response to a reporter s question it s not our job to do police work still , there was some evidence that the russian military might be making efforts in some places to stop the rampaging a column of 12 men with their hands on their heads , several wearing uniforms , were marched into the russian military base in gori on thursday afternoon the identities of the men were unclear issued a report on thursday that documented attacks by ethnic ossetians in and around tskhinvali on wednesday researchers saw a number of houses on fire in the town of java they quoted a south ossetian intelligence officer as saying that his fighters had burned the houses to make sure that the georgians could not come back the report s findings also seemed to indicate that early russian accounts of casualties , which in the first days of fighting reached 2 , 000 , were far too high in tskhinvali , where the heaviest fighting took place , the local hospital received 44 corpses and 273 wounded people from aug 6 , after clashes between separatists and georgians , to aug 12 , the report said , citing a doctor the report quoted the doctor as saying that the majority of the wounded were affiliated with the military , although it was not clear if he meant the russian or georgian armies or ossetian fighters as of aug 13 , none of the wounded remained in the hospital , the report said many were transferred to mobile hospitals in the russian emergencies ministry an elderly woman from the village of kurta who gave only her first name , elene , said she had been forced to walk three days to safety after russianspeaking men broke into her house an ossetian man was with them , she said they entered the houses , took whatever they liked , and burned everything they threatened to shoot her after taking her valuables , but her neighbor , a russian woman , intervened on her behalf she said , please do n't do this , ' said the woman the men shot at the ground several times and then left she fled five villages in her area were looted and people driven out , she said in one of them , oreti , she said she saw the bodies of two women decomposing the walk was terrifying she spent one night in an empty house she was reminded of the violence that took the life of her husband in the early 1990s , when ossetians and georgians fought an allout war i wish i 'd died soon after my husband , she said there are so many deaths a georgian official said some of the worst ethnic cleansing was in the towns of eredvi , ditsi , tirdznisi and kuraleti a man from the village of karetezhvyari said he returned to check his house on thursday , only to discover several houses on fire the man , who gave only his first name , nukri , was livid about the lootings and the russian advance they were a big empire , and they fell , he said , but they ca n't stop acting like one

this is not how it was supposed to happen it is not , at least , how things looked in virginia at the signature theater in arlington , glory days , the fourman musical about growing up , was a hit this year the reviews were mixed to positive , but the real story was the show s creators , nick blaemire , 23 , and james gardiner , 24 so young , andto have written a musical ! two relatively green new york producers offered to take the show to the big dance of broadway , and it looked like the beginning of a showbiz fairy tale but after 17 previews , a sheaf of bad reviews , meager ticket sales and one opening night , glory days closed at the circle in the square theater on broadway , most likely losing its entire 25 million investment it was the first show to close after one regular performance since 2003 , when oldest living confederate widow tells all had said everything she had to say by the openingnight curtain james and i have learned more in the last three weeks , mr blaemire said , than we 've learned in the last year closing on opening night has a long and even illustrious history \( it could be worse quite a few shows have not even made it out of previews \) it is rare producers pay some theater expenses and salaries by the week , so shuttering after just one day has less of a benefit than you might expect but it happens , merle debuskey , a veteran broadway press agent , said you save on advertising and you save on the agony of having the people put on the show and perform for nobody , or almost nobody among the names of those who have experienced onenighters are luminaries like alan jay lerner and charles strouse \( dance a little closer , 1983 \) , george c scott \( tricks of the trade , 1980 \) , donny osmond \( little johnny jones , 1982 \) and ellen burstyn \( oldest confederate widow \) perhaps none have been so young as the men behind glory days but that , in their eyes at least , may be the bright side it s all so ridiculous that we 're 23 years old and any of this happened at all , mr blaemire said stoically all of this has been icing a little over a week after the may 6 opening closing night , the two creators were recalling the experience over smoothies at say cheese ! , a regular spot of theirs on ninth avenue in manhattan until the opening they had been working on glory days for five years , and at every step the audience whether it was their friends the director , eric schaeffer , who helped them mold the show the people in the seats at the signature theater even some critics seemed to offer mostly encouragement the broadway audience , at least in the first weekend of previews , was like a brick wall in regional theater , mr blaemire said , people are more interested in finding the hit and i think here people are like , 'prove it' since mr blaemire is now in the ensemble of another broadway show , crybaby , mr gardiner was the one who saw the show night after night during previews and sensed what was going on in the audience i knew if we did n't get good reviews , we would have to close , he said still , he had no idea it would come to an end so quickly opening night passed as opening nights often do , beginning with a nervesteeling round of tequila shots , followed by a short pep talk to the young cast , most of whom were making their broadway debuts the openingnight party , a blur of family , friends , investors and theater press , was at moda , a hip restaurant at the flatotel on 52nd street hours past 11 o'clock , the time when reviews usually start hitting , no one was telling them anything then , mr blaemire said , i saw my buddy brian , who flew in from chicago , on his phone in the corner he said it s and here there was a pause good on brian s phone mr blaemire read ben brantley s review in the new york times the production manages to seem fresh , mr brantley wrote , and seriously stale at the same time it was not a good review , but one of the kindest the show would get the next morning , a hungover mr blaemire checked his email service , which he had set up to receive any news articles that mentioned him or the show the headlines were all thereprice of 'glory' 15 hours lost , read the one in the new york post and that told him enough the producers met with mr schaeffer that afternoon to discuss the next step , which was predictable , considering the weak advance sales mr gardiner was hanging out with some friends in central park when he got the call sic transit gloria mundi the next day , after a crybaby matinee , mr blaemire went to chelsea studios , where some theater majors from the university of michigan , his alma mater , were rehearsing for a presentation for agents , casting directors and other industry folks mr blaemire had done this himself only two years before in this group he was an example , the story teachers tell their classes the crowd huddled around him , offering congratulations for the last number in the showcase , the students sang a number from glory days that was the last time , for a while at least , that the song would be performed on a new york stage , but at that point mr blaemire was the only person in the room who knew it some reviews pointed a finger at the glory days producers , accusing them of bringing along the show before it was ready and setting up the creators for disappointment one producer , ricky stevens , declined to comment for this article the other , john o'boyle , could not be reached mr schaeffer , who is also the artistic director of the signature , said he saw no reason to fight back when they offered to bring it in if a producer comes along and says we want to take your show to new york , mr schaeffer said , what are you going to do \? say no \? mr schaeffer acknowledges that glory days did not work on broadway , but he does not consider the experience regrettable maybe it should have gone off broadway , he said , but it s a roll of the dice for a few days both of the glory days creators were , as mr gardiner put it , a mess mr gardiner said he was holed up in his apartment watching a lot of 'everybody loves raymond' mr blaemire had it a little easier , performing in crybaby every night , but he is still experiencing , he said , a dull ache theater people tend to embrace the wounded the walls of joe allen restaurant , the broadway haunt on west 46th street , are covered in posters of flops for the posters of successful shows you can go to tourist shops and hotel lobbies in the course of three blocks mr blaemire and mr gardiner were approached more than once by actors who hugged them , squeezed their arms and gave them the kind of looks you usually see in hospital waiting rooms but neither mr blaemire nor mr gardiner seems to be rattled both said they were not nearly as upset about the whole experience as their mothers were they are , in fact , working on their next show if you look at it from the outside , these guys were in a fast situation , moved a show that was n't ready , it flopped and they 're a failure i could see how you would think that would not be worth anyone s time , mr blaemire said but from our perspective , we got a chance to learn everything about what it takes to put on a broadway show photo nick blaemire , left , and james gardiner , creators of the broadway show glory days \( photograph by sara krulwich the new york times \)
boston has never won an ivy league title in men s basketball and has not reached the ncaa tournament since 1946 this season , the team won only 8 of its first 28 games like all the universities in the ivy league , harvard does not award athletic scholarships yet the group of six recruits expected to join the team next season is rated among the nation s 25 best this is partly because harvard coach tommy amaker , who starred at duke and coached in the big east and big ten conferences , has set his sights on topflight recruits it is also because harvard is willing to consider players with a lower academic standing than previous staff members said they were allowed to harvard has also adopted aggressive recruiting tactics that skirt or , in some cases , may even violate national collegiate athletic association rules harvard s efforts in basketball underscore the increasingly important role that success in highprofile sports plays at even the most elite universities in the race to become competitive in basketball , harvard s new approach could tarnish the university s sterling reputation two athletes who said they had received letters from harvard s admissions office saying they would most likely be accepted have described tactics that may violate ncaa rules , including visits from a man who worked out with them shortly before he was hired by harvard to be an assistant coach an ncaa spokesman , erik christianson , said the organization s rules state , should a coach recruit on behalf of a school but not be employed there , he or she is then considered a booster and that recruiting activity is not allowed in another case , amaker approached the parents of an athlete in a grocery store and urged that their son visit harvard , even though ncaa rules limit contact with potential players to happenstance at certain times of the year that athlete ended up not considering harvard yale coach james jones said he had seen an academic change at harvard it s eyeopening because there seems to have been a drastic shift in restrictions and regulations with the harvard admissions office , he said we do n't know how all this is going to come out , but we could not get involved with many of the kids that they are bringing in harvard s athletic director , bob scalise , acknowledged that amaker s staff had recruited some players with lower academic profiles than the previous staff had , but he stressed that no athletes had yet been admitted it s also a willingness to basically say , ok , maybe we need to accept a few more kids and maybe we need to go after a few more kids in the initial years when tommy is trying to change the culture of the program , ' scalise said last week it s a willingness to say that we really do want to compete for the ivy championship to be sure , programs at larger universities would be delighted to have players with the academic standing of amaker s new recruits scalise said that other ivy league programs also considered harvard s recruits harvard , he said , has chosen to remake its basketball program into a perennial contender for the ivy title and the automatic berth in the ncaa tournament that goes with it scalise said he was made aware of three or four complaints of recruiting incidents from rivals and sat down with amaker last november for a teaching moment he said he told amaker that he and his staff needed to act in ways beyond reproach but scalise said he was not aware until told by the new york times that amaker s top assistant , kenny blakeney , had traveled a long distance to play pickup basketball with a recruit during periods when the ncaa does not allow contact with prospective players blakeney said he had not been officially hired by harvard when he visited that recruit and another prospective player even if harvard did not break any ncaa rules , many in the coaching community said amaker s staff had behaved unethically on friday , alan j stone , a spokesman for the university , said we can say that any statement about someone being admitted to harvard who is not qualified would be absolutely inaccurate , as is any suggestion that our standards have been lowered for basketball harvard s admission criteria are and remain very high they have not changed at all to understand harvard s apparent change in philosophy , it is necessary to appreciate the complicated tap dance of ivy league recruiting nearly every prospective ivy player must meet a minimum on the academic index , a measuring tool that uses gradepoint average , class rank and standardized test scores for example , a student with a 31 gradepoint average and just over 1 , 560 out of a possible 2 , 400 on the sat would register roughly a 171 on the academic index , the minimum score allowed by the ivy league for athletes two former harvard assistant coaches , bill holden and lamar reddicks , said they adhered to even tougher standards under coach frank sullivan last season s team , they said , had an average of 206 , the highest in the league by a significant margin sullivan , who in his 16 seasons won and lost more games than any other harvard basketball coach , was fired after the season amaker did not rehire holden and reddicks holden and reddicks said that harvard s team index had to be 202 they said that essentially meant they could not recruit a player whose index was lower than 195 , and they characterized harvard s standards as tougher than those of other ivy programs scalise said he expected harvard to still have the highest index average among the ivy members it is not certain that all six of amaker s recruits will land on campus , and other recruits with better credentials could raise the index average the 6foot10 center frank beneze from bishop o'connell high school in arlington , va , embodies the change in harvard s basketball recruiting he orally committed to harvard over traditional powers like marquette , west virginia , virginia and penn although he and the rest of the recruited athletes have yet to be admitted to harvard , beneze is considered amaker s biggest coup , one amaker proudly mentions to other potential players beneze , a native of nigeria , has yet to receive what is called a likely letter from the admissions office , a written assurance that a player will be accepted , because he has not attained the 171 index minimum like all of harvard s applicants , none of amaker s recruits have been admitted yet but max kenyi , a 63 shooting guard from gonzaga college high school in washington , dc , and keith wright , a 67 forward at norfolk collegiate in virginia , said that they had each received a likely letter they were well below index levels that the previous staff members said they had adhered to there are guys that we could n't touch that other schools in our league could recruit , said reddicks , who is now an assistant at boston university it makes a huge difference scalise said the comments of reddicks and holden reflected the bitterness of not having their contracts renewed he added that the previous coaching staff could not lure such a talented class because it did not have the connections , charisma and work ethic of amaker and his assistants sounds like there s a lot of jealousy and also sounds like people are trying to protect the status quo for their programs , scalise said sullivan , who signed a confidentiality agreement when he was fired by harvard , declined to comment amaker , 42 , was fired by michigan last spring after failing to produce a single ncaa tournament appearance in his six seasons there but in his previous job , as coach at seton hall , he and his staff had great success in recruiting amaker beat out other wellestablished coaches for the harvard job among them were pete gillen , a former coach at xavier , providence and virginia , and mike jarvis , whose st john s program ended up on ncaa probation after he was fired harvard also interviewed mike gillian , coach at longwood university in virginia , and john o'connor , an assistant coach at georgia tech , in person those four coaches said in telephone interviews that they had been assured they would not be at a disadvantage among their ivy league peers in recruiting the bottom line was that they wanted to win , o'connor said of harvard they also thought in that room that times had changed and the big boys had come back to the pack now was the time to make the move the recruiting analyst dave telep of called amaker s potential class the best in harvard history and , perhaps , in ivy league history kenyi is a solid midmajor player who picked harvard over other ivy league members as well as holy cross , virginia commonwealth and george mason wright received interest from illinois , davidson and other ivy league members before committing to harvard wright said that blakeney had visited him when inperson contact between coaches and recruits was not allowed kenyi said blakeney , a former duke player , played basketball with him a couple of times at his high school last june or july , which is against ncaa contact rules harvard announced blakeney s hiring on july 2 , 2007 kenyi said that at first he did not realize who blakeney was but the man soon turned into his lead harvard recruiter two weeks ago , blakeney said his trips to gonzaga were to visit the basketball coach , steve turner , whom he has known for 20 years , and to stay in shape by playing the visits made an impression on kenyi he was someone i could relate to , kenyi said , someone i could talk to about anything meanwhile , coaches from other teams recruiting wright and kenyi were allowed to call only once a month he actually got to play with us , because he was n't actually on harvard s staff , wright said , adding that blakeney had gone to norfolk for one of his summer basketball team s practices he did n't sign anything yet , so he got to play with us , and we talked and exchanged numbers the practice of recruiting in person before being officially hired is becoming more prevalent among the more highprofile basketball programs assuming the coach knows exactly what he s doing , it s unethical , said jim haney , the executive director of the national association of basketball coaches blakeney denied he was recruiting kenyi and wright then i was unemployed , he said , repeating i was unemployed i do n't know if it s a gray area or anything like that i had n't signed a contract i did n't have any type of agreement with anybody how could i recruit them to harvard if i'm not employed \? craig robinson , the coach at brown , said wow when told of blakeney s pickup games with high school athletes he laughed before saying , i would say that would give them an advantage robinson added that it was understandable if blakeney happened to run across a player in his native washington but that traveling to norfolk , about 190 miles away , was a different story if he travels across a state line to play with a kid he s going to be recruiting , that smacks a little bit of breaking the rules , robinson said he added it would not be the way that we would conduct business in the long run , that hurts you there s nothing wrong with pushing the envelope , but if your attempt is to get around the rules , there s an issue amaker , who declined to respond to specific questions in person , released a statement friday through a university spokesman harvard adheres to austere standards in every area of the university and i am honored to labor within that framework , the statement said individuals with knowledge of our staff understand the high principles under which we operate we work within the spirit of harvard and the ivy league another issue arose with the recruiting of zack rosen , a 61 point guard bound for penn and sought by universities like rutgers and virginia tech amaker saw rosen s father , les , in a grocery store in trenton during the eastern invitational tournament last summer at the time , coaches were restricted only to watching recruits and saying hello to them or their parents if they bumped into each other les rosen remembered amaker saying , we really have to get zack up to harvard les rosen said he thought to himself who goes to shoprite in the middle of a basketball tournament \? it was suspicious , he said , but as much as it seemed obvious , he would n't be found guilty in court harvard looked into the rosen situation and determined that no violations occurred scalise said he and his athletic staff would look into blakeney s actions during the recruiting of kenyi and wright now that i'm aware of it , we 'll talk and try and find out what went on , he said i would like our programs to be totally above the board

broncos coach mike shanahan introduced the tactic last season , so the sample size for a definitive study is too small , fatsis said if jay feely had made the pretimeout kick and missed the rekick , people would have said cable was right , fatsis said but the opposite happened , so he was wrong conversely , jets coach eric mangini didn t ice the raiders sebastian janikowski before his gamewinning 57yard field goal in overtime , so i guess he was wrong , too the bottom line is that nfl kickers have made 64 percent of field goals of 50 yards or more this season , so coaches will do anything to try to get inside their heads \( correction as pointed out by a reader , mangini was out of timeouts and could not have iced janikowski i misread the rulebook teams get two timeouts in overtime during the regularseason , three per half in the postseason \) more from fatsis in case you missed it yesterday  misleading numbers when roy williams , the former pro bowl wide receiver , was traded to the dallas cowboys by the lions after week 6 , attention in detroit focused on how the move would affect calvin johnson , the team s other standout receiver johnson immediately became the team s only major receiving threat at first glance , johnson s 154 receiving yards and 1 touchdown against houston would indicate that things went well he averaged 77 yards a catch , setting a league record for players with at least two receptions in a game it broke the previous record of 735 set by willie gault of the raiders , who on nov 5 , 1989 , had two receptions for 147 yards against cincinnati but what should concern lions fans is that on the team s other 42 plays from scrimmage , johnson had one rush , for a 2yard loss dan orlovsky , the lions quarterback , targeted johnson only four times shaun mcdonald , the team s third wide receiver , was targeted six times but finished without a reception benjamin hoffman when a sack isn t a sack demarcus ware tied a league record with a sack in his 10th straight game on sunday , but he remains one away from the cowboys team mark how could that be \? it s because the cowboys consider harvey martin s 11game streak from 1976 to 1977 , which ended before the nfl established the sack as an official statistic in 1982 , as their team record john turney , a member of the professional football researchers association , who has done extensive research on sacks , said that to his knowledge , none of the other unofficial sack leaders , players like deacon jones and coy bacon , had had a longer streak than martin s \( according to turney s records , jones s longest streak was eight games \) but he pointed out in a telephone interview monday that a discrepancy similar to the cowboys existed with the giants it may not anymore for nearly a decade the giants media guide listed lawrence taylor as the team s career sacks leader with 142 , making it a point to include without a qualifier the 95 sacks he had as a rookie in 1981 , the year before the sack was officially recognized but starting last year , taylor s total dropped to 1325 an asterisk notes the sacks he had in 1981 , but the mathematical adjustment meant that this year he dropped to second on the team s career list behind michael strahan , who finished with 1415 pat hanlon , the giants vice president for communications , said in an email message we made a decision in 2007 to include only the official sacks totals in the media guide to avoid any confusion taylor s number is officially 1325 the only active player in the giants career top 10 , osi umenyioria , will need more than 100 sacks for the team to put the matter to rest andrew das looking for a break the bad news for the lions \( 06 \) is that they are one of the two remaining winless teams in the nfl the worse news is that their game against houston last sunday , which they lost , 2821 , might have been their best chance for a victory  detroit s remaining 10 opponents have a combined winning percentage of 612 \( 4126 \) the group includes five teams chicago , carolina , green bay , tampa bay and tennessee that are in first place or tied for first in their divisions two teams left on their schedule have losing records minnesota and new orleans , both 34 but the vikings have already beaten detroit this season and the saints have the no 1 offense in the nfl if new orleans gets reggie bush back for the week 16 meeting , it could wreak havoc on detroit s 32ndranked defense in his monday news conference , coach rod marinelli was asked if he was closer to his breaking point than he was six weeks ago he said i feel better and stronger every day i honestly do because i embrace this , and we re in the turmoil and that s me i look forward to it the other winless team , the 07 bengals , has it a little easier their remaining opponents have a 491 winning percentage \( 2728 \) cincinnati travels to houston \( 24 \) on sunday , and if all else fails , cincinnati finishes the season against the browns \( 24 \) and the chiefs \( 15 \) nailajean meyers quote of the week i m not going to change my ways if they re going to keep fining me for that , then i m going to get fined all year hines ward , steelers receiver , who was not fined after breaking an opponent s jaw with a block so far perfect john kasay made all three of his fieldgoal attempts in the panthers victory against the saints , improving to 14 for 14 this season kasay is one of five regular kickers the titans rob bironas , the texans kris brown , the lions jason hanson and the steelers jeff reed who have not missed a kick this season in fact , it has been a banner year for all kickers no extra points have been missed , and fieldgoal accuracy \( 859 percent \) has never been higher john woods around the league the washington redskins have gone 332 regularseason pass attempts without an interception , topping the previous league record of 281 , set by the raiders in 2001 ben roethlisberger improved to 110 in games played in ohio , his home state , when the steelers beat the bengals the giants have won four in a row at home , one more than they won there last season the chicago bears 48 points against the vikings was their highest total in a game since 1986 \( nyt \)

huangshi , china by the time she could walk , was already being prepared by her parents to compete in the olympics when she was 3 , her parents , both sports enthusiasts , took her to a table tennis training center here in their hometown , hoping to turn her into a championship paddler when she showed little interest in the sport , they decided to approach a gymnastics coach , who said their daughter might make a promising gymnast today , all grown up at 20 , cheng is not simply promising she is china s top female gymnast and the country s best hope of winning a gold medal in that sport at the olympic games in beijing , where she will go head to head with shawn johnson of the united states , the world champion in the allaround after failing to win a medal at the 2004 olympics in athens , and watching her team place a disappointing seventh , cheng fei \( pronounced chung fay \) has led a resurgent chinese team by capturing 18 gold medals in international competitions , making her the most decorated gymnast to come out of china she is also a threetime world champion on the vault , having performed one move so difficult that it now bears her name she s a formidable gymnast very beautiful and very powerful , said tim daggett , a former olympic champion and a longtime analyst for nbc cheng and her chinese teammates are expected to engage with the united states in what may be the most dramatic showdown of the beijing games at the world championships last year , the americans prevailed by 95hundredths of a point china s women s team has a wealth of talented young gymnasts , like he kexin and yang yilin but none are as experienced as cheng , whom chinese sports officials declined to make available for an interview for this article indeed , if she wins gold in beijing , cheng s achievement will cap an arduous journey that began when she left this depressed but bustling city at age 7 to make her way through china s grueling statedirected sports system her parents said they had anguished over their choice to sacrifice cheng s childhood in favor of creating an olympic hopeful our family was poor so we hoped cheng fei could in some way change her life , said her mother , xu chunxiang so we thought maybe being a professional athlete is good for her but now that decision is history , and all that remains in the young woman s quest is olympic gold , and the riches that come with it for every gold medal cheng wins , the state authorities are expected to reward her with more than 150 , 000 in cash and bonuses , a huge sum in a country where college graduates are fortunate to earn 500 a month there could also be lucrative marketing deals but chinese athletes are taught that they are competing for national glory , not individual achievement or future riches and cheng , puffycheeked with a penchant for reading military books , seems unlikely to pursue a career in the limelight she rarely grants interviews her parents say that in telephone conversations with her , she often responds by saying little more than yes , no and ok and after winning three gold medals at the world cup in the chinese city of tianjin in may , dominating a tournament in which the united states team did not participate , cheng pouted at a news conference and declared i think i can do better i was n't at my best friends say it was a glimpse into the character of a young gymnast who , initially driven by her parents and the state , now pushes herself to the limit cheng s road to beijing began in central china s hubei province , a bleak industrial region , where her father worked as a shipping clerk and her mother toiled in a tire factory she was born in 1988 , an only child in a nation with a onechild policy from the beginning , her parents say , she looked like a boy , so they treated her like one her father , a disciplinarian who had studied martial arts , pushed her from an early age , even pressing her to do calisthenics every morning before primary school classes began i trained her like a military soldier , said her father , cheng ligao she followed me step by step and i shouted to her , onetwoonetwo yao juying , her first coach , recalled a remarkably disciplined and focused child i cannot believe how hardworking she was at that young age , yao said i 've been doing this for 24 years and i 've never found a second one like her at 5 , cheng won her first competitive medal at a local competition two years later , her parents sent her to wuhan , the provincial capital , where she officially entered the national sports program at the wuhan institute of physical education , she joined a large group of child athletes in a sports program that required them to follow rigorous training routines the hardships imposed on athletes in china s national sports system are welldocumented under pressure to produce goldmedalcaliber athletes , coaches typically force children to endure painful stretching and musclebuilding exercises gymnastics is a really painful thing , especially for pretty young kids it s torture , said zhao hanhua , cheng s coach at the wuhan institute , where cheng s portrait now hangs on the wall as inspiration to other youngsters so we tell the kids , this is your lifetime challenge' cheng s coaches say she went through excruciating pain to make her feet turn inward so that she could perform better on the balance beam the training was pretty tough , especially during leg stretching , cheng s mother recalls she cried crazily , like she was dying her father and i accompanied her and our hearts almost broke into pieces when she cried that heartwrenchingly at one point , cheng pleaded with her parents to let her quit and return home we asked her to hold on because we had invested so much and lived so bitterly , her mother said cheng s father often traveled five hours by boat to see her practice although life was bitter , we felt happy because every time i went to the school i saw the great progress she had made , he said cheng had begun to perfect her vault , one of the most difficult and dangerous gymnastic moves because she is considered a terrific tumbler , her other strengths are the balance beam and the floor exercise , both of which require precise jumps and flips zhao , cheng s former coach , said that in 1999 a national team coach saw cheng perform on the vault and said who s that kid \? why not send her to the national team \? that year , she moved up to the provincial team , and then , two years later , in 2001 , she was recruited to join the national team at 16 , cheng made her debut in international competition at the 2004 athens games , where she was one of the few bright spots on a chinese team that endured its worst showing in 16 years her floorexercise routine nearly won her a bronze medal but a year later , at the world championships in australia , she won a gold medal on the vault and signaled her dominance of the apparatus she has excelled by performing a variation on the yurchenko vault , one of the most difficult to complete her vault , which she learned from li xiaopeng , one of china s top male gymnasts , involves a roundoff entry with a halfturn onto the vault , and then a front flip with one and a half twists in the laidout position the highly complex maneuver is known as the cheng fei vault that s about the biggest vault anyone can do , said marvin sharp , who coaches bridget sloan , a member of the united states team who will not attempt it at the olympics we 've used video of her vault to teach bridget at home , where the walls are decorated with photographs of cheng and a trophy room is filled with her awards , her parents say they realize the pressure she is under but they can see her long trek to beijing coming to an end a month ago , she came home for the first time in two years to participate in the torch relay as it passed through hubei province , her father said it was the first time she had slept in the home the local sports bureau gave the family as a reward for their daughter s performances but they say they are pleased with how it all turned out we are not only happy , we are proud of her , her father said but we hope she 'll go to college or university because a gymnastics career is so short
st petersburg , fla javier v zquez spent all the time he could to figure out how to somehow retire evan longoria longoria , the ' rookie third baseman , had already hit two home runs in his and the ' first postseason game , one of them clanging off a tropicana field catwalk 125 feet above the leftfield wall while longoria stepped to the plate as another rays rally brewed in the fifth inning , v zquez , the ' starter , conferred with his catcher , gestured to his shortstop , adjusted his cap , stretched out his arm , inhaled and exhaled deeply and adjusted his pants before finally toeing the rubber and daring to throw a pitch he could not delay what seemed inevitable longoria grounded a runscoring single to left field to give the rays a tworun advantage , and v zquez was removed from the game the rays added another run in the inning and cruised to a 64 victory before 35 , 041 raucous home fans in the opener of their american league division series longoria , 22 , a leading candidate to win the al rookie of the year award , followed gary gaetti of the 1987 twins as the second major leaguer to hit home runs in his first two postseason atbats wearing no 3 , longoria finished 3 for 3 with three runs batted in on his only three swings of the game he hit a firstpitch fastball from v zquez for a home run to lead off the second inning , and golfed a hanging curveball off the catwalk in the third to put the rays ahead to stay , 43 i was nervous , longoria said i think if you 're not nervous in this situation , you 're really not soaking in the moment he made a couple mistakes , and that s what you 're supposed to do as a good hitter , is hit the mistakes v zquez said of the second home run it was a terrible curveball he took advantage of that james shields pitched six and a third solid innings to earn the victory , yielding all three of his runs on a thirdinning homer by dewayne wise dan wheeler earned the save after giving up a solo home run by paul konerko the teams will both start lefthanders , mark buehrle for the white sox and scott kazmir for the rays , in game 2 on friday tropicana field was loud thursday , with the sellout crowd ringing cowbells , wearing mohawks and making the dome pulse as never before in its primarily dreary history several innings removed from longoria s star turn , the fans erupted during a contentious and crucial top of the seventh after shields was removed with the bases loaded and one out and the rays clinging to a 63 lead , reliever grant balfour struck out juan uribe to bring up orlando cabrera after the third pitch went far outside , cabrera , objecting to balfour s tendency to swear at himself though not at the hitter after every pitch , swiped his foot across the plate and swore back at balfour i did n't know he does that , cabrera said i just got mad a little bit balfour started jawing back and had to be soothed by the home plate umpire , joe west when balfour blew his next two fastballs past cabrera and started walking off the field , the crowd erupted and cheered wildly as balfour and cabrera continued to exchange words both dugouts appeared poised to empty the rays' bench coach , dave martinez , yelled at chicago manager ozzie guill n across the field before calm prevailed he was telling me to throw it over the plate i told him to go sit down , said balfour , a hardthrowing australian that s what i like to do when i pitch i'm never talking to the hitter i'm not trying to show up the hitter i'm just talking to myself and firing myself up if he took it the wrong way , that s it i'm not changing my ways the rays were 5724 at tropicana field during the regular season , the best home mark in the majors and they showed that their three days off since last playing on sunday were not a problem against the white sox , who entered the playoffs after winning doordie games sunday , monday and tuesday but v zquez did not enter the postseason on nearly the high note that his teammates did he had lost his last three starts , allowing at least five runs and working no more than four and a third innings each time , and had been criticized by guill n for not being a biggame pitcher v zquez s prior postseason game was for the yankees during their league championship series meltdown against the red sox in 2004 v zquez replaced kevin brown in the second inning of game 7 with the bases loaded and the red sox leading , 20 , and johnny damon hit his first pitch for a grand slam to effectively put the game and world series out of reach on thursday , longoria became the star that v zquez has failed to be you could sense that there was a different feeling about the game , you know , the energy level in the ballpark , said longoria , whose hitting coach at class aaa durham this april was none other than gary gaetti but other than that , i was able to settle in pretty quickly inside pitch the rays improved to 222 before home crowds of 30 , 000 or more rays first baseman carlos pe a left the game before the third inning because of blurred vision in his left eye , which he scratched at home wednesday night , but he was expected to start friday his replacement , willy aybar , tied the score , 33 , with a thirdinning sacrifice fly , and singled and scored in the fifth the white sox had an eightgame postseason winning streak snapped they won four straight to beat the angels in the 2005 al championship series before sweeping houston in the world series
san diego when california awarded the san diego minutemen , a group well known for its border monitoring in search of illegal immigrants , a permit last nov 21 to clean a stretch of highway including the border patrol checkpoint at san onofre , complaints from immigrant advocacy groups and hispanic lawmakers were swift and strong opponents said they feared violent confrontations between the minutemen and immigrants , and in january , the state agreed it rescinded the group s adoptahighway assignment along two miles of interstate 5 and offered an alternative in eastern san diego county but the founder of the san diego minutemen , jeff schwilk , was not to be moved the group filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month arguing that the decision violated its constitutional rights to free speech , due process and equal protection under the law the minutemen are asking for permission to work at the original site , as well as for the payment of legal fees and 50 , 000 a hearing is scheduled for march 14 in the united states district court in san diego a lawyer for the minutemen , howard kaloogian , a former republican state assemblyman who represented north san diego county , said that in removing the group and its sign from i5 , the state department of transportation gave in to the opposition and granted a heckler s veto , which has been ruled to be unconstitutional under the first amendment in most cases in a letter telling mr schwilk of the decision , pedro orsodelgado , the department s district director for san diego and imperial counties , cited questions regarding public safety because of the proximity of the checkpoint and an adjacent california highway patrol inspection center mr orsodelgado s alternative was a stretch along state route 52 , far from any border checkpoint our safety concerns revolve around the possibility of a confrontation between groups of opposing viewpoints in the i5 area and preventing safety risks for those people and motorists , mr orsodelgado said in a statement besides their border patrols , the minutemen have attracted attention for protesting at gathering sites for day laborers in san diego county the southern poverty law center , a civil rights group , in a report issued last summer , cited racial remarks toward mexican immigrants by minutemen at the sites an advocate for immigrants' rights , joanne yoon , who was among those monitoring the minutemen at such sites , filed a lawsuit last year accusing mr schwilk and ray carney , another opponent of illegal , of defamation ms yoon said the two men had widely disseminated email messages that used epithets to disparage her sex and her korean ethnicity mr schwilk denied the accusations in the law center s report , and said ms yoon s suit was based on false information he added , nothing i 've ever said in an email has anything to do with violating the adoptahighway criteria accusations of minutemen violence against immigrants were discussed on jan 22 , at a meeting with the director of the transportation department , will kempton , and three members of the legislature s latino caucus , two of the lawmakers said senator gilbert a cedillo , democrat of los angeles , and assemblywoman lori salda a , democrat of san diego , said the minutemen should be barred from the i5 site because of the adoptahighway program s prohibition against groups that advocate violence , violation of the law or discrimination ms salda a said , i thought it might not be best to put a group that brings those emotions near a border patrol checkpoint but david blairloy , the legal director of the american civil liberties union affiliate in san diego and imperial counties , told mr orsodelgado in a letter that the program s eligibility criteria might be unconstitutional advocacy of conduct , even illegal conduct , is not the same as engaging in that conduct , mr blairloy wrote the department , he said , may not disqualify the minutemen because of their viewpoints , however repugnant those viewpoints may be to many in his letter to mr schwilk , mr orsodelgado said that an agency investigation into accusations of violent behavior and or advocacy of violence by the minutemen might determine its future participation in the program mr orsodelgado , through a spokesman , declined to comment on specifics of these accusations mr schwilk said that none of his group s members had ever been arrested for violence against illegal immigrants the group s web site says that membership is open to anyone regardless of ethnicity and that the group does not tolerate racism in any way , shape or form the group s only litterremoval effort along i5 , on jan 17 , before the transportation department s decision , went off without incident , mr schwilk said
in slate , meghan o rourke pens \( pixels \? \) an obituary for hillary clinton s presidential campaign her problem wasn t that she was a feminist , she writes her problem was that she wasn t feminist enough o rourke later explains , you can t be a historic first unless you act like one , and hillary clinton has not she continues in the wellesley commencement speech that made her famous before she got to yale law school , she spoke about searching for more immediate , ecstatic , and penetrating modes of living yet clinton ran away from the revolutionary aspects of her own candidacy there s been nothing of the ecstatic in her presidential bid that mode , instead , has been embodied by barack obama he appealed to voters desire for liberation and revolution , and on the strength of that appeal won them over clinton didn t trust that the message of revolution embodied in her candidacy could animate american voters , particularly male voters and she lacked the courage of her young , ecstasyseeking self and so she sent the message that gender was not a factor presumably , she did this based on the reasonable assumption that it was politically perilous to be a woman but the paradox is that in taking the safe tack she thought made her more electable , she actually made herself less electable she presented herself as a hardbitten washington insider , running on experience when a lot of american voters , particularly young women , were looking for transformation o rourke notes that clinton embraced the rhetoric of masculinity to fend off obama s campaign it was part of acting as if she were a man inoculated against the slings and arrows of sexism , she writes in this regard , clinton never really was the first american matriarch instead , she may be best remembered as our last patriarch the more her campaign floundered as obama offered ecstasy and she didn t , the more masculine and hardnosed she made herself out to be , o rourke continues she adds , none of this was accidental , even if the source wasn t always hillary herself she was manning up and then unfortunately , a man s rules seemed to be politics as usual o rourke has sympathy for the situation clinton found herself in as a candidate , but she wishes clinton had been able to overcome it she writes in contrast to obama s matteroffact relationship to race as a subject that bore serious discussion but was hardly the beall and endall of american politics clinton s relationship to gender seemed at turns angry and deeply ambivalent of course , there s some logic behind clinton s calculation that running on gender was too politically risky race however profound an issue it is in america doesn t get in the way of the paradigm that treats ambition and leadership as masculine qualities gender does obama can still draw on the classic paradigm of leadership clinton would have had to create something new to judge by all kinds of studies of women in privatesector leadership positions , this would have been a fraught battle , strewn with double standards it s only fair to point out that many of hillary s attributes toughness , control , emotional distance are qualities that are sometimes admired in men but almost never in women we ll never know whether the traits clinton displayed in this campaign would have drawn less animus from voters had she actually been a man but if ever there were a moment to have ventured that battle , this was it

mexico brazil argentina mexico , again thailand indonesia argentina , again and now , the united states the story has played itself out time and time again over the past 30 years global investors , disappointed with the returns they 're getting , search for alternatives they think they 've found what they 're looking for in some country or other , and money rushes in but eventually it becomes clear that the investment opportunity was n't all it seemed to be , and the money rushes out again , with nasty consequences for the former financial favorite that s the story of multiple financial crises in latin america and asia and it s also the story of the us combined housing and credit bubble these days , we 're playing the role usually assigned to thirdworld economies for reasons i 'll explain later , it s unlikely that america will experience a recession as severe as that in , say , argentina but the origins of our problem are pretty much the same and understanding those origins also helps us understand where us economic policy went wrong the global origins of our current mess were actually laid out by none other than ben bernanke , in an influential speech he gave early in 2005 , before he was named chairman of the federal reserve mr bernanke asked a good question why is the united states , with the world s largest economy , borrowing heavily on international capital markets rather than lending , as would seem more natural \? his answer was that the main explanation lay not here in america , but abroad in particular , third world economies , which had been investor favorites for much of the 1990s , were shaken by a series of financial crises beginning in 1997 as a result , they abruptly switched from being destinations for capital to sources of capital , as their governments began accumulating huge precautionary hoards of overseas assets the result , said mr bernanke , was a global saving glut lots of money , all dressed up with nowhere to go in the end , most of that money went to the united states why \? because , said mr bernanke , of the depth and sophistication of the country s financial markets all of this was right , except for one thing us financial markets , it turns out , were characterized less by sophistication than by sophistry , which my dictionary defines as a deliberately invalid argument displaying ingenuity in reasoning in the hope of deceiving someone eg , repackaging dubious loans into collateralized debt obligations creates a lot of perfectly safe , aaa assets that will never go bad in other words , the united states was not , in fact , uniquely wellsuited to make use of the world s surplus funds it was , instead , a place where large sums could be and were invested very badly directly or indirectly , capital flowing into america from global investors ended up financing a housingandcredit bubble that has now burst , with painful consequences as i said , these consequences probably wo n't be as bad as the devastating recessions that racked thirdworld victims of the same syndrome the saving grace of america s situation is that our foreign debts are in our own currency this means that we wo n't have the kind of financial death spiral argentina experienced , in which a falling peso caused the country s debts , which were in dollars , to balloon in value relative to domestic assets but even without those currency effects , the next year or two could be quite unpleasant what should have been done differently \? some critics say that the fed helped inflate the housing bubble with low interest rates but those rates were low for a good reason although the last recession officially ended in november 2001 , it was another two years before the us economy began delivering convincing job growth , and the fed was rightly concerned about the possibility of japanesestyle prolonged economic stagnation the real sin , both of the fed and of the bush administration , was the failure to exercise adult supervision over markets running wild it was n't just alan greenspan s unwillingness to admit that there was anything more than a bit of froth in housing markets , or his refusal to do anything about subprime abuses the fact is that as america s financial system has grown ever more complex , it has also outgrown the framework of banking regulations that used to protect us yet instead of an attempt to update that framework , all we got were paeans to the wonders of free markets right now , mr bernanke is in crisismanagement mode , trying to deal with the mess his predecessor left behind i do n't have any problems with his testimony yesterday , although i suspect that it s already too late to prevent a recession but let s hope that when the dust settles a bit , mr bernanke takes the lead in talking about what needs to be done to fix a financial system gone very , very wrong
berlin i have seen the future , and it works ok , i know that these days you 're supposed to see the future in china or india , not in the heart of old europe but we 're living in a world in which oil prices keep setting records , in which the idea that global oil production will soon peak is rapidly moving from fringe belief to mainstream assumption and europeans who have achieved a high standard of living in spite of very high energy prices gas in germany costs more than 8 a gallon have a lot to teach us about how to deal with that world if europe s example is any guide , here are the two secrets of coping with expensive oil own fuelefficient cars , and do n't drive them too much notice that i said that cars should be fuelefficient not that people should do without cars altogether in germany , as in the united states , the vast majority of families own cars \( although german households are less likely than their us counterparts to be multiplecar owners \) but the average german car uses about a quarter less gas per mile than the average american car by and large , the germans do n't drive itsybitsy toy cars , but they do drive modestsized passenger vehicles rather than suv s and pickup trucks in the near future i expect we 'll see americans moving down the same path we 've already done it once over the course of the 1970s and 1980s , the average mileage of us passenger vehicles rose about 50 percent , as americans switched to smaller , lighter cars this improvement stalled with the rise of suv s during the cheapgas 1990s but now that gas costs more than ever before , even after adjusting for inflation , we can expect to see mileage rise again admittedly , the next few years will be rough for families who bought big vehicles when gas was cheap , and now find themselves the owners of white elephants with little tradein value but raising fuel efficiency is something we can and will do can we also drive less \? yes but getting there will be a lot harder there have been many news stories in recent weeks about americans who are changing their behavior in response to expensive gasoline they 're trying to shop locally , they 're canceling vacations that involve a lot of driving , and they 're switching to public transit but none of it amounts to much for example , some major public transit systems are excited about ridership gains of 5 or 10 percent but fewer than 5 percent of americans take public transit to work , so this surge of riders takes only a relative handful of drivers off the road any serious reduction in american driving will require more than this it will mean changing how and where many of us live to see what i'm talking about , consider where i am at the moment in a pleasant , middleclass neighborhood consisting mainly of four or fivestory apartment buildings , with easy access to public transit and plenty of local shopping it s the kind of neighborhood in which people do n't have to drive a lot , but it s also a kind of neighborhood that barely exists in america , even in big metropolitan areas greater atlanta has roughly the same population as greater berlin but berlin is a city of trains , buses and bikes , while atlanta is a city of cars , cars and cars and in the face of rising oil prices , which have left many americans stranded in suburbia utterly dependent on their cars , yet having a hard time affording gas it s starting to look as if berlin had the better idea changing the geography of american metropolitan areas will be hard for one thing , houses last a lot longer than cars long after today s suv s have become antique collectors' items , millions of people will still be living in subdivisions built when gas was 150 or less a gallon infrastructure is another problem public transit , in particular , faces a chickenandegg problem it s hard to justify transit systems unless there s sufficient population density , yet it s hard to persuade people to live in denser neighborhoods unless they come with the advantage of transit access and there are , as always in america , the issues of race and class despite the gentrification that has taken place in some inner cities , and the plunge in national crime rates to levels not seen in decades , it will be hard to shake the longstanding american association of higherdensity living with poverty and personal danger still , if we 're heading for a prolonged era of scarce , expensive oil , americans will face increasingly strong incentives to start living like europeans maybe not today , and maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of our lives
a pakistani neuroscientist who american officials say was a facilitator for was ordered held without bail on tuesday by a federal court in manhattan , on charges that she had tried to kill american soldiers and fbi agents in afghanistan the scientist , aafia siddiqui , was taken into custody last month after she was found loitering outside an afghan police station with suspicious items in her handbag , including documents describing the creation of explosives , a criminal complaint says a day later , prosecutors have charged , she picked up an unsecured m4 rifle and fired at least two shots toward one of the soldiers who was part of an american team of fbi agents and military personnel who were about to question her no one was hit , and another soldier returned fire with a 9millimeter pistol , hitting her at least once in the torso ms siddiqui , 36 , whose head was covered with a maroon scarf in court , sat quietly as a magistrate judge rejected her lawyer s request that he dismiss the charges immediately the lawyer , elizabeth m fink , told the judge that the allegation that her client , who the lawyer said weighed 90 pounds , had picked up the rifle and attacked the americans , was patently absurd is that what happened , judge \? ms fink asked but judge ronald l ellis of united states district court said he saw no reason to doubt the information in the complaint , and set a hearing for next monday to address the government s request that ms siddiqui be detained without bond pending trial ms siddiqui , who studied at the massachusetts institute of technology and brandeis university , was transferred to new york from afghanistan on monday united states intelligence agencies have said that she had links to at least 2 of the 14 men suspected of being highlevel members of al qaeda who were moved to guant namo bay , cuba , in september 2006 the charges against her , however , do not appear to be related to those allegations , but to what prosecutors say was her assault on the americans who were about to question her ms fink said after the hearing that her client was innocent and would fight the charges the hearing cleared up none of the mysteries that have surrounded ms siddiqui s case since she disappeared with her three children while visiting her parents' home in karachi , pakistan , in march 2003 her family and human rights groups have said they believe that she was being held secretly a family lawyer , elaine whitfield sharp , said after the hearing that it was in us detention the american authorities deny that assertion and say they have no knowledge of where she was for the past five years , until she was taken into custody last month sam zarifi , the asiapacific director for amnesty international , on tuesday challenged the american government s version of the events that led to ms siddiqui s detention mr zarifi said that ismail jahangir , a spokesman for the ghazni provincial governor , told him by telephone on tuesday that he had no information about the shooting and that ms siddiqui was in fine condition when she was turned over to american officials attempts to reach mr jahangir on tuesday to corroborate that account were unsuccessful in court , ms siddiqui responded to some of the judge s questions but seemed uncertain at times she is a little fragile at the moment , ms fink told the judge , adding that her client was still recovering from her gunshot wound , and that she had been without antibiotics or painkillers a federal prosecutor , christopher l lavigne , responded that when ms siddiqui left afghanistan , a physician was on the plane with her until she landed in the united states , and that she had received medical care other unanswered questions include what has happened to ms siddiqui s children , and where she says she has been for the past five years ms siddiqui s lawyers said they met with her before the hearing but lacked privacy and were unable to explore details of her case with her
beijing as beijing was starting construction on its main olympic stadiums four years ago , china s vice president and leading political fixer , zeng qinghong , warned the 70 million members of the ruling communist party that the party itself could use some reconstruction mr zeng argued that the painful lessons from the collapse of other communist parties in the soviet union and eastern europe could not be ignored he said china s cadres needed to wake up and realize that a party s status as a party in power does not necessarily last as long as the party does mr zeng , who is now retired , was alluding to the pressures of economic liberalization , political stagnation and globalization that many analysts have argued would ultimately topple oneparty rule in china the olympics also posed a pressure point as some analysts wondered whether the expectations and international scrutiny brought by the games might help crack open another authoritarian political system as happened in seoul in 1988 but if the olympics have presented unmistakable challenges and crises , the communist party has proved resilient public appetite for reform has not waned , but the shortterm byproduct of the olympics has been a surge in chinese patriotism that bolstered the party against international criticism after its crackdown on tibetan protesters in march and the controversy over the international relay economic and social change is so rapid in china that the communist party is sometimes depicted as an overwhelmed caretaker but in the seven years since beijing was awarded the games , the party has adapted and navigated its way forward , loosening its grip on elements of society even as it crushes or coopts threats to its hold on political power the party has absorbed entrepreneurs , urban professionals and university students into an elite class that is invested in the political status quo , if not necessarily enthralled with it private capitalists may be symbols of a changing china but the party has also clung tenaciously to the most profitable pillar industries and the financial system , and it is not always easy to distinguish the biggest private companies from their staterun counterparts in china s hybrid economy faced with public anger over corruption , chinese officials are now required to attend annual training sessions in a nationwide , if not always successful , program to raise competency and if officials have long since abandoned efforts at maoiststyle thought control , the propaganda machine can still stir up nationalist passions , or shut them off , depending on the party s priorities this is a very reflective party , said david shambaugh , a political scientist at george washington university and author of china s communist party atrophy and adaptation they are adaptive , reflective and open , within limits but survival is the bottom line and they see survival as an outcome of adaptation the ultimate question is whether adaptation alone is enough many analysts say that the lack of democratic reform is inhibiting china s economic efficiency and that reforms are needed to confront issues like stark inequality and environmental degradation thousands of protests erupt every year over illegal land seizures and official corruption the tibet crisis revealed chinese nationalism as a major political force , even as it exposed unresolved domestic issues about freedom of religion and minority rights to some analysts , the harsh official response to tibet revealed an insecure , defensive leadership the party does n't have selfconfidence in its legitimacy , said zhang xianyang , a liberal political analyst in beijing so the government overreacts in the face of social turbulence i think the regime is not as strong as outsiders and the common people think but they are not as weak as they feel themselves for the communist party , china s selection in july 2001 as host of the 2008 olympics was a political and historic coup a gift they could deliver to a thrilled citizenry and a new focal point , seven years in the distant future , that could be used to rally national pride inside the party , leaders were intently focused on the viability of their system the party faced no organized opposition none is allowed but the leadership , fretting about historical trends , had commissioned exhaustive autopsies of the collapse of the soviet union and the eastern european governments by june 2001 , a month before the olympic announcement , the communist party s central committee organization department , which oversees party promotions and training , had published a blunt report that revealed deep public anger and recommended system reforms to address problems of official corruption and incompetence china s economy was soaring , and the country was preparing for entrance into the world trade organization but if free trade could boost china s exports , the party report also warned that deeper integration into the world economy may bring growing dangers and pressures , and it can be predicted that in the ensuing period the number of public protests may jump , severely harming social stability the dismantling of the planned economy had already presented an ideological challenge what to do about the emerging class of capitalists who were rapidly accruing wealth \? admitting capitalists struck oldguard marxists as apostasy , but it made smart politics for a party leery of any group s emerging as a rival for power less than two weeks before the olympic announcement , jiang zemin , who was president at the time , chose the party s 80th anniversary to declare that capitalists should be invited to join its ranks reformers hoped private businesspeople might one day prove a force for democratization but today , together with the flow of party officials into the business sector , the mixing of money and power has rendered sharp distinctions about the state and private sectors less meaningful than they seem in the west businessmen have established closer links to the government and the party to get access to state bank loans and tap into the network of officials who control land and government contracts college students eyeing a career in government or academia often make the same calculation the party seems happy with that , said bruce dickson , a china scholar at george washington university and author of the new book , wealth into power the communist party s embrace of china s private sector they are not looking for diehard ideologues they want to coopt people into their system and they 've been far more successful than people realize beyond managing the rise of private enterprise , the party also faced the collapse of much of the stateowned economy the state s share of the economy fell to about 35 percent in 2006 from 80 percent in 1997 , according to a recent analysis in china economic quarterly but that declining share does not reflect declining influence the party s analysis of the collapse of the soviet bloc faulted postcommunist countries for rushing too recklessly into privatization to preserve the party s preeminence , senior officials adopted a policy of selling off small enterprises with lower profit margins while keeping a grip on the biggest industries today , the state still exercises effective control over natural resources like oil , gas and coal oil refining production of steel and ferrous metals telecommunications , transportation and power generation and the financial system arthur kroeber , managing editor of china economic quarterly , said officials had injected competition into the state sector by pitting stateowned entities against one another without surrendering control over strategic industries they have retained all the industries that have huge scale and large cash flow , he said if anything has been a change agent in chinese society , it has been the internet in 2001 , china had 265 million internet users today the figure is 253 million , the most in the world one of those millions is a software engineer named lu yunfei , who joined the crowds at tiananmen square on the night beijing won the olympics the next year , mr lu began surfing the web and soon stumbled across news accounts of a visit by prime minister junichiro koizumi of japan to a war shrine honoring japanese soldiers , including some accused of atrocities in china infuriated , he became one of the legion of the country s cybernationalists i made a uturn in my life as a result of the internet , as a result of freedom of information , said mr lu , now 33 the patriotism movement is a result of the development of the internet freedom of information always has been considered essential in liberalizing china , and the internet has disseminated amounts of information once unthinkable despite an internet fire wall and tens of thousands of censors , dissidents still post petitions that once would have gone unheard farmers post videos of demonstrations on youtube but nationalism also has flowered online into a complicated force that the party has often managed to cultivate for its own purposes in 2005 , amid a diplomatic standoff between china and japan , thousands of chinese protesters held raucous antijapan demonstrations in beijing , shanghai and other cities initially , the government condoned the outbursts , even though such protests are illegal but eventually , as the protests expanded , the police shut them down this year s olympic controversies pushed chinese nationalism onto a world stage in the days after the tibetan riots , state media carried hours of coverage of ethnic tibetans assaulting han chinese as well as television documentaries praising economic policies in tibet when western leaders began calling on china to show restraint as it suppressed the uprising , chinese nationalists rallied to the party s defense online the patriotic anger intensified in april after the ugly antichina protests that marred the olympic torch relay in london and paris voices preaching moderation , or questioning the government s responsibility in the tibet crisis , were drowned out as happened three years earlier during the antijapan protests , officials initially gave tacit approval to the fervor and even a boycott of the french retailer carrefour before reining things in to create a more harmonious image ahead of the games for the communist party , nationalism has always been a central justification of its rule schoolchildren are taught a heroic narrative of the party as the savior of china in 1949 and the savior of tibet from feudalism and economic backwardness if westerners often view china through the prism of the cultural revolution and the 1989 tiananmen crackdown , chinese are taught about the opium war and the colonialist advances into china by japan and the west nationalism and patriotism mean love your country , said mr zhang , the political analyst the communist party was so clever because they linked nationalism to loving the party they said the party was the same as the country li datong , a former editor of a top staterun magazine who lost his job after clashing with propaganda authorities , said officials in charge of mass media and the internet try to leave little to chance he said the country s army of censors dipped anonymously into the internet debate by paying parttime writers 5 mao , or about 7 cents , to steer public opinion and monitor the tone of debate online their job is to post articles on the bbs to balance public opinion , mr li said , referring to the bulletin board system where many internet users interact the netizens call them the 5 mao party if they get a post on a bbs , they get 5 mao mr lu , the cybernationalist , said chinese patriots made distinctions between country and party during the tibet crisis , he used his web site to highlight provocative postings criticizing the western news media or tibet separatism , as part of the nationalist outpouring backing the party but in recent weeks , the internet has also been filled with angry posts many later censored blaming the government for a recent energy agreement with japan when it comes to the olympics , though , mr lu s interests and the party s seem inseparable for ordinary chinese , even if they ca n't really articulate it , they feel the olympics are a very important opportunity for china to demonstrate state power , mr lu said
st petersburg , fla the top baseball operations executive under hank and hal steinbrenner in the ' hierarchy is general manager , whose contract expires after the season the more the yankees lose , and the more impatient hank steinbrenner becomes , the more speculation cashman faces on his future concerning my situation , i am completely focused on getting this team where it needs to be , cashman said in a telephone interview wednesday it s as simple as that , both on the 25man roster and beyond hank steinbrenner said in spring training that he hoped to discuss a contract extension with cashman , but cashman would prefer to wait until the offseason by then , if the yankees have missed the playoffs , steinbrenner may not want him back in an interview published tuesday , steinbrenner might have made a cryptic reference to cashman s future when he said , if it s not turned around this year , then it will be turned around next year , by force if we have to asked how he interpreted that , cashman did not answer directly his response to steinbrenner s latest broadside , which included questioning the attitude and energy of the team , was tempered agreement all i know is , i agree that we 're not performing up to our ability for this period of time , and we are better than this , cashman said every day we take the field , i believe it s the day we 're going to be closer to getting back on track right now , i believe this is just a bad stretch we 're a good team playing poorly right now , nothing more cashman said that even with injuries to alex rodriguez and jorge posada , the yankees would be fine if other hitters were producing to their career norms asked if he had intensified efforts to get help through trades , cashman said , the answers are in front of us manager joe girardi called a 30minute team meeting before wednesday s game against the tampa bay rays he said it was prompted by my own heart and not by steinbrenner s comments , but he acknowledged he was disappointed in the yankees' start we 're a better club than 1921 , there s no doubt about it , girardi said none of us in this room are happy with the results i expected us to be a lot better , and we 'll find a way girardi said the yankees naturally seemed to lack energy because they are not winning and are fundamentally different from the rays , who are younger and have better team speed we bring energy every day , but the bottom line is it has to translate into wins , and if it does n't , sometimes it does n't look like you have a lot of energy , girardi said and their club is constructed differently derek jeter , the captain , said he had no concerns about the team s effort you look at how people work , and you look at how people care about results , jeter said people here are working hard people here care about results we just have n't won games the yankees also started slowly last season , with an 1822 record through 40 games , and they rallied to capture the american league wild card with help from pitchers who started in the low minors two such candidates this season , relievers j b cox and mark melancon , are climbing the minor league ladder cox was promoted this week to class aaa scranton wilkesbarre , and melancon to class aa trenton asked if they could help the way joba chamberlain and ian kennedy did last season , cashman said if you asked me at this time last year , i 'd have been hardpressed to believe that was possible but i do n't count anybody out after what we experienced last year

more from magdalena sharpe the crowd continues to trickle in the hall desn t look jam packed , but perhaps many of us have a distorted view after senator barack obama s acceptance speech before nearly 80 , 000 people at invesco stadium last thursday a little off schedule , but full speed ahead , tucker carlson starts things off , at around 1 15 pm he ticks off three things the crowd should know about mr paul 1 he doesn t care what those in washington think his point of view is adults disagree and that s just a fact 2 he is a sincerely decent human being who is kind to people around him 3 he has absolutely zero interest in controlling the government \( we re not sure what that means , but the crowd ate it up \) 1 45 pm eastern colonial spirit is the rally for the republic also an excuse to dressup \?

1 15 pm eastern rain or shine magdalena sharpe reports from the target center the rainy weather has done nothing to stop paul supporters from coming out in large numbers to participate in the rally mr paul has not run the most traditional of campaigns , and it appears so far that his rnc counter convention will also follow its own offthebeatenpath schedule the speakers are set to begin momentarily , with tucker carlson opening things up  minneapolis here in the other twin city , the wait today is not for president bush , not for gov sarah palin , not even for senator john mccain no , the wait is for a man who until this year was a littleknown congressman from texas we speak of none other than ron paul mr paul s unsuccessful candidacy for the republican nomination from which he has since retired spawned a national movement and that movement is coalescing here in minnesota today , as paulites , libertarians and others with antiwar , lowtax and proprivacy leanings gather at a rally for the republic , at the target center here the event , which is expected to attract as many as 18 , 000 , is a counter convention to the republican doings in st paul the events are set to begin soon , with a long list of speakers , including mr paul himself later tonight the day will not end with any nominations mr paul , who is merely running for reelection to congress , is no longer seeking the presidency or any other national seat but it s sure to be filled with fiery speeches , colorful characters and rebellious rhetoric a team of times reporters will be reporting on the rally for liberty throughout the day stay tuned

of course it is ash wednesday , and john bickerson bolling has turned 30 , as fitting a day as any for us to take our leave of the moviegoer , at least here at the reading room , and for binx to get on with his life with kate , to listen to people , see how they stick themselves into the world , hand them along a ways in their dark journey and be handed along , and for good and selfish reasons yet , there s still time for a last parting view of new orleans i m glad one of our readers mentioned that movie theater out in gentilly , the one percy calls the tivoli , where binx first discovered place and time , tasted it like okra there were several movie theaters in gentilly when walker percy was writing , none of them named the tivoli it is usually assumed that percy picked the name as a hattip to copenhagen and so to his philosophical favorite , kierkegaard but he didn t have to make it up , because as rachel harris , the book review s clerk and a new orleans native , pointed out to me , there was in fact a new orleans movie theater called the tivoli it s still standing , minus those two big exterior columns , though now it is used as a funeral parlor i have no idea whether the gentilly theaters would have looked anything like this , whether this was the kind of place percy might have had in mind or whether he was thinking of something more bland the moviegoer s tivoli isn t described in any detail maybe our new orleans consultants can weigh in on this but that s one great theater and one great novel
here s a frightening statistic it s estimated that americans use 84 billion plastic bags a year these bags which grocery stores are quick to double up are an enormous environmental burden groceries spend a few minutes in the bags , moving from checkout line to car then all too often the bags spend years in waterways , where they choke sea life in trees , where they hang like miniature parachutes or in streets , where they clog grates for a website detailing some of the harm plastic bags do to the environment , look here  plastic bags now represent an estimated three percent of the waste stream and that percentage is rising it can , however , be reduced through effective recycling some municipalities already have such programs , but none is as sweeping as the measure passed today by the new york city council it would require plastic bag recycling for stores of at least 5 , 000 square feet or stores belonging to chains with more than five locations in the city considering the size of the new york market , where about one billion plastic bags are used every year , the mandate is enormous the law could go into effect by early summer what will become of these bags \? they can find new life pressed into durable composite lumber , like that used in decks and boardwalks or they could be made into more plastic bags , and presumably rerecycled indefinitely better still , the new law might just encourage people to forego the plastic and carry their own reusable bag for shopping and chores after all , from an environmental perspective , the best answer to the ubiquitous question paper or plastic \? is neither
greenburgh , ny as the end of game 4 between the and the devolved into something between a scuffle and a brawl , the rangers had , at the very least , thrown the first piece of drama into the penguins' playoff march until thursday night , pittsburgh had not lost a game this postseason everything the penguins had touched seemed coated with pixie dust in four victories over ottawa and three against the rangers so the sight of penguins center evgeni malkin kicking the skates out from two rangers players in the final minute , starting the endofgame fireworks and earning a 10minute misconduct , was the first glimpse at any frustration the rangers stifled every bit of the penguins' potent offense including the redhot malkin in a 30 victory at madison square garden maybe a bit of a dent in the armor , rangers coach tom renney said of the victory and we 're talking about pretty thick armor here so we have to keep it all in perspective and recognize we won a hockey game it is something , without question , to build on the rangers succeeded in sending their eastern conference semifinal series back to pittsburgh for game 5 on sunday afternoon they did it with spectacular performances by jaromir jagr \( two goals , one assist \) and goalie henrik lundqvist , who not only stopped a penalty shot by malkin but also made a halfdozen other amazing saves among his 29 strong performances from centers chris drury and brandon dubinsky and the team s penalty killers were less obvious drury played more than 20 minutes and won 15 of 24 faceoffs despite a ribcage injury sustained in game 3 dubinsky scored a powerplay goal in the third period to end the rangers' 0for17 streak , which began in the second period of game 1 the penalty killers , including drury and now dubinsky , kept the pittsburgh power play scoreless for the first time in the postseason , snuffing out four manadvantage opportunities by stifling the penguins' first two power plays , the rangers might have set the tone for this game , keeping pittsburgh scrambling for the puck instead of setting up booming shots we certainly did n't want to fall behind , rangers forward brendan shanahan said their power play has been very good , and it s scored some key goals in the series for them we worked a little extra on the preparation and made a few adjustments and we had a good game on the penalty kill by the end of the game , the rangers had to show some fight in other ways , too in the third period , pittsburgh center sidney crosby took issue with a hit that rangers defenseman dan girardi had made on forward marian hossa and charged over to retaliate they both received roughing penalties , but malkin rushed in as well , and that put the rangers on a power play when the penguins should have been trying to slice into a 20 deficit obviously we do n't want to be in the penalty box , crosby said afterward our job is to help our team score , but there comes a point where you have to stick up for each other at the end of the game , malkin kicked drury s feet out from under him and did the same to rangers defenseman paul mara , who then tried to pummel malkin mara drew a roughing penalty and a misconduct , but he said he was not about to let malkin s act go unpunished he did it at their blue line and then at the other end right in front of the ref , mara said , adding it was actually a full kick it was done out of frustration , a lack of class we 'll put that in the back of our minds renney said that rangers general manager glen sather had called nhl officials about the game , but he did not know if sather discussed malkin he said he was eager to hear the nhl s explanation for a penaltyshot call against the rangers the call came late in the second period , after girardi shoved malkin during a breakaway girardi had no stick at the time there is no rule against hitting a puckcarrier from behind when the players are away from the boards they 're getting back to us , renney said of sather s call to the league i'm not sure it was a penalty of some kind i do n't know it has to be a trip , hook , crosscheck , whatever clearly , these teams have cultivated some animosity in this series , from jagr s yelling at crosby to stop diving to draw penalties , to the latest issue with malkin most surprisingly , none of it has involved the player who is usually the vortex of all such controversies involving the rangers but forward sean avery spent game 4 in the intensive care unit at st vincents hospital and medical center in manhattan with a lacerated spleen sustained in game 3 the rangers said avery s condition was improving they are looking to say the same for the rest of the team and its playoff hopes after sunday

asked the first question right afterward , his father cut him off he may be our chairman , but he is my son , and he is of a tender age , the father , , told journalists his son , 19yearold bilawal bhutto zardari , did not protest it is clear that mr zardari is going to be regent while his son learns the ropes colleagues and friends of the family say ms bhutto did not intend for her son , a student at oxford , to take on such a demanding political role so soon mr zardari , a former member of parliament who served as a minister in his wife s governments and who had been jailed on corruption charges , went on to dominate the news conference , speaking on the need for democracy in pakistan and keeping the nation s fragile federation together he stressed that he would not be running for prime minister , saying that the longtime deputy leader of the pakistan peoples party , makhdoom amin fahim , was the party s candidate yet a senior member of the party , khawaja tariq rahim , predicted that mr zardari would be the kingmaker consolidating his hold on the party by creating his own clique of advisers and that some of those close to ms bhutto would fade away during the days of shock and mourning since ms bhutto s death , the pakistan peoples party has held together it has settled the succession question quickly and announced its determination to run in elections next week , if they are not delayed while mr bhutto zardari brings the muchneeded continuity and symbolism of the family name , it is his father who will be the critical figure over the next several years but his reputation and history promise a far from smooth ride for the party , with some fearing a potential split during ms bhutto s two terms as prime minister , the couple was charged with embezzling 15 billion in government funds mr zardari became known as mr ten percent for the kickbacks he reportedly collected on government contracts for the past three years , he has lived in a lavish apartment on the upper east side of manhattan ms bhutto and mr zardari denied the accusations of corruption , saying that they were politically motivated and that none of the cases resulted in convictions as part of a political agreement with ms bhutto in october , president pervez musharraf signed a decree giving amnesty to all those with pending corruption cases , and the government withdrew from several cases lodged abroad against her and her husband still , the accusations tested some of ms bhutto s most loyal political allies , much as the recent deal with mr musharraf angered several senior legislators in the party but her charisma and political vision kept the tensions from fracturing the party critics question mr zardari s ability to follow in his wife s footsteps there is a sizable antizardari contingent in the party , several politicians have acknowledged in the past he was not the least interested in governance , but in deals , said talat masood , a political analyst the party should not be allowed to split , he warned in washington , pakistan experts expressed mild puzzlement at the selection of mr bhutto zardari as party chairman he s the dauphin , and i do n't think anyone expected the son to be brought into this , said a state department official , speaking on condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly about pakistani politics the kid s too young to play in this scene but carrying on the bhutto name and legacy has some value he s the symbolic leader but not the daytoday manager of public affairs the choice may indeed prove a clever move by mr zardari to keep the party loyal to the memory of ms bhutto and her father , the founder of the party , zulfikar ali bhutto bilawal zardari added his mother s maiden name , bhutto , to his own after her death to make the point on sunday night , mr zardari explained his decision to make his son the party chairman in this country , symbols matter , he said mr bhutto zardari has his mother s good looks , and a quiet steadiness , those close to the family say he is very intelligent and very dedicated , said farooq naik , a senator and lawyer to the family he would not talk a lot , but would absorb things and then talk , he said ms bhutto was clearly grooming her son for a political career at some point she brought him to an interview with reporters for the new york times at the algonquin hotel in new york in august during the hourlong interview , he listened attentively as his mother discussed her plans to return to pakistan and her discussions with bush administration officials about a possible powersharing deal with mr musharraf dressed in casual , western clothing , he remained quiet during most of the meeting and stayed out of the political discussion entirely he and his two sisters , bakhtwar , 17 , and aseefa , 14 , had been separated from their parents and their home country much of their lives because of pakistan s turbulent politics in her autobiography , daughter of the east , ms bhutto wrote of how after her first government was dismissed in 1990 , her mother advised her to send her children away to her sister in london for their safety there had already been a suspected kidnapping attempt of bilawal in islamabad in 1989 , after ms bhutto first became prime minister it was heartrending for me to be parted from bilawal , who had turned two in september 1990 , and bakhtwar who was not yet one , she wrote by 1991 , he was attending a prekindergarten in queen s gate in london , and she decided to take her daughter back with her but leave her son he was staring at me silently and stoically with the saddest brown eyes in the world as i took bakhtwar with me and left him behind , she wrote
there are still aspects of the republican national committee s shopping sprees on behalf of gov sarah palin and her family that are murky consider , for example , the 4 , 90245 charge in september at atelier new york , a highend men s store , presumably for ms palin s husband , todd karlo steel , an owner there , said he had gone through the store s receipts for september , twice , and found no sales that matched that amount , nor any combination of sales that added up to the total because the store carries cuttingedge men s wear , mr steel said he catered to a small clientele and knew most of his customers by name , as well as the history of their purchases when mr steel was asked to check august sales also , he said he found one purchase that came close to the amount in the campaign finance reports but that he knew who that customer was and it was not mr palin nor was it jeff larson , the republican consultant who showed up in campaign finance records as the one who paid the initial bill before being reimbursed by the republican committee after more checking , mr steel did find a similar purchase in october , but it was not an exact match either the store carries expensive clothes from avantgarde designers like raf simons , yohji yamamoto and ann demeulemeester , none of whom typically create beltwayappropriate attire we have no recollection of that sale and no idea what they are talking about , mr steel said michael luo and eric wilson
tijuana , mexico eating salad in mexico is discouraged by most guide books , citing the potential threat to the digestive tract it is true that the water can be problematic south of the border , if it is consumed directly from the tap or used to wash one s salad fixings at the same time , fine dining abounds throughout mexico , white tablecloth affairs with celebrity chefs , mouthwatering menus and fancy water that comes from elegantly shaped bottles although not in that lofty league , there is one eatery with a particularly distinguished history that is relevant to the question of whether one should consume salads in mexico called caesar s restaurant , it sits in the seediest of spots , along tijuana s avenida revoluci n , and specializes in salad caesar salad , to be exact , which it says was invented in its kitchen in 1924 jorge ch vez is the manager of caesar s and the keeper of the historical flame after a waiter whipped up a salad tableside the other day in an elaborate ceremony , mr ch vez plunked down to defend his lettuce a table full of customers had recently left the premises after taking advantage of caesar s twoforone beer special but not daring to eat the food one of them had scoffed when a waiter offered her a salad she made a crack about that being a surefire vacation spoiler she has bad information , mr ch vez said when the group was gone we 're not using dirty water on our salad i 'd put our salad up against anyone , anywhere he then veered into a bit of history one day back in 1924 , caesar cardini , an italian immigrant who ran a restaurant in what was then an upscale tourist zone in tijuana , found himself low on provisions but with some hungry friends to feed as the story goes , he threw what he had some lettuce , garlic and pieces of bread , among other ingredients into a bowl and came up with a creation that has lived on ever since there are some disagreements over the details of the story was it a cook who really came up with it \? did caesar s brother , alex , first throw anchovies into the mix \? but there appears to be some support that the caesar salad was born in tijuana , or at the very least earned its worldwide reputation here none other than julia child wrote in one of her cookbooks , one of my early remembrances of restaurant life was going to tijuana in 1925 or 1926 with my parents , who were wildly excited that they should finally lunch at caesar s restaurant she recalled mr cardini himself rolling a big cart to her family s table and throwing some raw eggs into the mix raw egg yolks are still part of the recipe here also tossed into the large wooden bowl , which is big enough to bathe a newborn child , are olive oil , ground anchovies , garlic , a dash of mustard and worcestershire sauce , parmesan cheese , pepper and white wine mixed with vinegar large romaine lettuce leaves are dunked in the mixture and then laid out on a plate mr ch vez took pains to point out that each leaf is carefully cut into a diamond shape and then purified with a chemical additive to kill any microbes the resulting salad , he contends , is not only safe to eat and delicious to eat but , in his view , quintessentially mexican some of the ingredients are foreign but the hands that make it are mexican , he said another key addition are mexican limes , which are squeezed into the salad dressing to neutralize the strong flavors of the anchovies , garlic and egg yolks no flavor dominates , he said the biggest problem these days is that not enough people are digging in tourism is in the doldrums in tijuana , a result of a variety of factors , including too much crime , police harassment and the economic woes up north the restaurant has struggled through hard times before it closed for more than five years in the 1990s , and after it reopened , it installed a topless dance club in the back , which operates in the evening and supplements the paltry restaurant income there were only six people eating salads on a recent afternoon four of them were local university students who were on a research trip and were eating on the house the other two were reporting on and photographing the salads for this article you hear so much that s bad about tijuana , mr ch vez said i want people to know that we have something to be proud of and how is the salad \? well , the guy taking pictures let out a long mmmmm as he sampled the sauce the guy with the pen thought the croutons , which soak up the zesty dressing , were among the best he had sampled anywhere both of them lingered at the table , their stomachs feeling fine
as the spring season at the new york state theater ended on june 29 , many people were asking , will you be at saratoga \? city ballet plays upstate each summer at the saratoga performing arts center , and it s usually three weeks more of the same which , this june , sounded just fine the season from april to june was remarkable alexei ratmansky s new ballet , concerto dsch , was widely greeted as a major event the retrospective of 33 ballets by jerome robbins proved impressively diverse and substantial and the company showed far more stylistic sense of this 10yeardead choreographer s work than many of us had dared hope for damian woetzel , dancing ballets by robbins , george balanchine , susan stroman and christopher wheeldon , left his admirers with an impressive spectrum of memories in several ballets throughout the season , it was evident that the company was emphasizing offbalance qualities in balanchine s ballets as it had not last winter and in june several of his more fragile ballets brahmsschoenberg quartet , divertimento from le baiser de la f e , ' le tombeau de couperin were looking brighter than some of his most powerfully built had looked in april the things that were most wrong with the first brahmsschoenberg cast were largely solved by the second , and the ballet deepened with rewatching meanwhile the school of american ballet , whose students perform in city ballet productions and some of whom graduate into city ballet each year , honored both balanchine and robbins its accounts of robbins s fanfare \( britten , 1953 \) and two and threepart inventions \( bach , 1994 \) , already impressive in the school s workshop over the may 31 to june 2 weekend , grew in scale and assurance in subsequent performances as part of city ballet s robbins season at the state theater several promising graduates have now joined city ballet as apprentices perhaps the brightest , chase finlay , danced with more contrast and zeal at each performance he was in the audience at mr woetzel s farewell performance on june 18 though there is no particular likeness between them , it s not unreasonable on such occasions to hope that some torch is being passed , some lessons in stage artistry are being learned the season s most important event was the new ratmansky ballet \( as most people still refer to it , concerto dsch being too much of a mouthful \) to shostakovich s second piano concerto the slow movement begins with six dancers four of them leave the stage as the lead couple wendy whelan and benjamin millepied enter and , to the piano , start to dance an extended pas de deux that movingly suggests an unusually tender , even tentative , intimacy at first the two who choose to remain seem just chums , watching as if on a whim that changes though as piano and orchestra grow more interwoven toward the movement s close , the others return all six form a group with the lead couple as equal companions just as you 're thinking of them as a friendly social group , mr ratmansky turns them into a formal pattern three of the women are tilted toward us , so that the dancers' arms make a row of v s but one woman is not part of the pattern , and the very fact that all is not neat proves dramatically satisfying musically satisfying too i 've known and loved this slow movement in other ballets , but here it becomes far more eventful , detailed , changeful at many points \( the final tableau is another \) mr ratmansky gives us both overarching design and quietly dissenting detail formal dance structure is continually offset by human interest and by acting , nondance incident his special trick is to make his ballet s dramaturgy fit the music s changing impetus and its sound world somehow his ballet is a vivid , novellike account of an apparently optimistic soviet commune somehow it s also a revelation of the workings of the score the combination even though his dancemaking is full of features that remind me of many illustrious predecessors feels like something new , a breakthrough in choreography if i could get to saratoga this year \( i ca n't \) , concerto dsch would be my first reason but i would also like to deepen my acquaintance with most of the 33 robbins ballets \( saratoga will see 11 \) i stress this because robbins may have received more condescension than any other major choreographer in history i'm not guiltless myself by placing himself as no 2 at city ballet to balanchine , and by having had the most impressive career of all broadway directorchoreographers , robbins gave people two sterling criteria for condescension during his lifetime people kept saying , not as good as mr b , and not as good as his own broadway shows this spring these things could be heard again not , however , by many who made the whole pilgrimage through this robbinsfest by preserving 33 of his ballets , city ballet has made robbins s legacy larger than that of any other dead choreographer save balanchine himself would that we could see nearly so many works by their contemporaries frederick ashton or antony tudor this leads us to a paradox city ballet , which was founded on its commitment to the new , has become the world s best museum company this paradox has caused city ballet problems in the last 20 years and doubtless will do so again but this spring , with concerto dsch looking to be the best new ballet made anywhere in the world in years , the company could afford to be relaxed about its robbins inheritance there was a wealth of good robbins dancing , from janie taylor in afternoon of a faun \( 1953 \) , from jared angle in the goldberg variations \( 1971 \) , from ashley bouder in four bagatelles \( 1974 \) , from mr finlay in two and threepart inventions at least one ballet , opus 19 the dreamer \( 1979 \) , looked more interesting and less mystifying than with its prestigious original cast \( mikhail baryshnikov and patricia mcbride , now replaced by gonzalo garcia and ms whelan \) thanks to robbins , some dancers , like rachel rutherford , came into their own as the season closed others , like kaitlyn gilliland , began to bloom sara mearns and tyler angle kept finding new facets of themselves in robbins sean suozzi danced each robbins role as if on a mission the season illustrated many things about robbins how impressively , between fancy free \( 1944 \) and brandenburg \( 1997 \) , he built upon and then discarded the initial cartoonlike emphasis of his work how patiently he went on deepening and diversifying his craft how many forms of nonbalanchine movement and nonbalanchine theater he kept bringing into what was always balanchine s home company and how , throughout his career , he tried to return to some aspect of na vet , of innocence some of his ballets look principally as if he was trying not to be jerome robbins \( that is , the poet of narrative cuteness and adolescent intensity \) and there are a few \( dybbuk , watermill , i'm old fashioned the astaire variations \) i do n't need to see again yet almost always their craft is that of a master who knows how to hold you from one telling detail to the next , and their overall range as musical theater is an extraordinary achievement in 1984 , when he was already in his 60s , he introduced twyla tharp to city ballet by collaborating with her on brahms handel you can recognize its tharpisms more readily than any robbinsisms and when it was new , it seemed that her star , not his , was in the ascendant events proved otherwise ms tharp has made very few of her best works since then robbins , by contrast , went on , in the last 11 years of his life , to make the elegiac lifeart contemplativeness of ives , songs \( 1988 \) , the alldance reimagining of his own most historic broadway show in west side story suite \( 1995 \) and the three quite different bach compositions the intricacy of youthful simplicities in two and threepart inventions and contemplative virtuosity of a suite of dances \( both 1994 \) , and the varied ensembles and duets of brandenburg robbins does n't sustain his finest invention in any of these , but i would not wish to lose one of them and in none is he trying to escape who he is you can always recognize his hand here it is as if , at last , he kept rediscovering himself by one different light after another the critic who is satisfied is damned you could see this spring how some features that had been fundamental to robbins as well as balanchine were only occasionally present brahms handel exposed how few of the company s dancers unlike the school of american ballet s can be relied upon for tight fifth position , once a cornerstone of city ballet style perhaps even more important , if more subtle , too few city ballet dancers now arrive in a position with the musical beat they are more likely to use it as their cue and arrive a moment later in consequence the audience seldom feels the thrill of dance and music seeming to strike home at one and the same moment there are several roles the ballerina in balanchine s mozartiana is the most obvious that suffer grievously from poor style just now , though , such grumbles should not predominate there were even evenings as when fay al karoui conducted a raveldebussy quadruple bill when it was even better to listen to the orchestra than to watch the choreography between last june 2007 and this one city ballet has bid farewell to its three truest stars kyra nichols , nikolaj h bbe , mr woetzel and any dance lover must be anxious about the future without them but this spring gave us multiple reasons for present applause , and as many for hope
columbia , sc the three rivals for the democratic presidential nomination stood together on the steps of the state capitol here on monday in a brief display of political unity as they remembered the life and legacy of the rev dr martin luther king jr with a bitter chill in the air , the candidates addressed a crowd that overflowed onto a sprawling downtown plaza , vowing to complete the unfinished business of the slain civil rights leader the moment of comity was a prelude to a debate on monday evening in myrtle beach , sc , as well as the fierce competition for the state s primary on saturday we have come so far together , senator hillary rodham clinton of new york said , citing biographies of her rivals barack obama , an extraordinary , young africanamerican man with so much to contribute john edwards , a son of the south in fact , a son of and a woman all of us running for president of the united states of america ! with those words , supporters of mr obama , the illinois senator , lifted their blue signs in the air , even as disapproving murmurs spread through the crowd at mrs clinton s reference to her rival as young it was one of many reflections of the simmering tensions between the two candidates mr edwards , a former north carolina senator , also referred to mr obama , 46 , as a talented young man by the time his rivals spoke , mr obama had left the stage he won a drawing to address the crowd first as the candidates spoke , a confederate flag whipped into the stiff wind , a poignant reminder of south carolina s historic racial divide that still hangs over politics here several local politicians and members of the naacp , which sponsored the rally , denounced the flag that a few years ago was moved from the capitol roof to the outer grounds of the capitol complex none of the presidential hopefuls mentioned the flag while all three candidates were scheduled to march to the capitol , mr obama alone led a procession of hundreds that wound through a few city blocks here at the capitol , he was joined by mr edwards , and the two chatted amicably for an extensive period of time mrs clinton arrived nearly an hour later , citing a delayed plane , and spoke to her rivals briefly as cameras captured the moments the cordial exchanges , with smiles all around , belied the aggressive tone that has overtaken the fight for the democratic nomination , particularly between the obama and clinton campaigns in an interview broadcast monday on abc s good morning america , mr obama took particular aim at former president bill clinton , saying his advocacy on behalf of his wife is pretty troubling mr clinton , speaking in atlanta at a celebration for dr king on monday , was expected to spend much of the week campaigning for his wife in advance of the south carolina primary mrs clinton was planning to concentrate her efforts in states holding primaries on feb 5 , leaving the contest in south carolina as largely a fight among mr obama , mr clinton and mr edwards mr obama believes this state is critical to his candidacy democratic officials estimate that africanamericans could comprise up to 60 percent of the primary voters on saturday , the most diverse contest so far in the presidential nominating fight south carolina , unity is the great need of this hour , mr obama told those attending the rally here , reprising the words of dr king he added , true unity cannot be purchased on the cheap it starts by changing attitudes while mr obama acknowledged his outstanding competitors , he also denounced the tenor of the presidential campaign and politics in washington every day , our politics fuels and exploits divisions across races and region , across gender and party , mr obama said it s played out on television , it s sensationalized in the media , and it s crept into the presidential campaign in a way that serves to obscure the issues to the audience , mrs clinton recalled hearing dr king speak in chicago when she was growing up the dream is nowhere fulfilled , she said now we are called to rise up , speak up and finally get it done for his part , mr edwards also pointed to the diversity of the democratic candidates to be able to be on a stage at the state capitol in columbia , sc , my native state , on the stage with an extraordinary and talented young man who is running for the presidency of the united states and who is africanamerican makes me so proud of my state and my country , and it says such good things about the progress that we have made in america , mr edwards said i am also proud to be on the stage with a woman who has opportunity to speak on behalf of so many women whose voices have been left unheard , whose voices have been muffled all of these things show the progress that we have made in the united states of america , he added we have progress left to make we have work left to do
it s the week before election day do you know where your president is \? probably not , and that is by design with senator john mccain lagging behind in the polls and many other republicans fighting for their political lives , the nation s top republican president bush is intentionally lying low this week , and is likely to do so until after americans cast their ballots to pick his successor mr bush , an ardent student of politics , knows what it feels like to be down in the polls , and he is keeping a careful eye on the campaign earlier this week , he made a surprise visit to the headquarters of the republican national committee to offer thanks to those who have served him for the past eight years , and deliver a little pep talk to lift the spirits of beleaguered mccain supporters he talked about how he was never supposed to win a campaign , said one person who attended , speaking anonymously because the session was offtherecord he talked about how in '94 , 2000 , 2004 , they always said he had no chance , and he just encouraged us , to say it s just important to keep doing what we 're doing and keep working hard the message was not entirely surprising what was striking is that mr bush chose to deliver it in private presidential visits to campaign headquarters are routine business in election years the day before voters cast their ballots in 2000 , president bill clinton dropped in on democratic headquarters in little rock , ark , to buck up campaign volunteers , even as he conceded that he had no idea which way the race between vice president al gore and mr bush , then the governor of texas , would go mr bush , though , has made himself increasingly scarce as election day approaches his campaign season effectively ended on oct 21 two weeks before the election when he attended his last political fundraiser , a 1 million event for the republican senatorial campaign committee \( his wife , laura , is still on the stump on thursday she headlined a getoutthevote rally in mississippi \) with mr bush s job approval ratings at historic lows , political analysts have long said republican candidates simply do not want to be seen with him but now , with the election just days away , it seems that republican candidates do not want mr bush to be seen , period one of mccain s biggest challenges has been how to deal with bush , and he never quite got it right , said scott reed , a republican strategist who ran bob dole s 1996 presidential campaign now , the best thing is silence so the president has temporarily dropped out of sight until recently , mr bush was giving talks about the battered economy on nearly a daily basis , prompting some republicans to grumble privately that so much presidential face time was hurting their election chances this week , mr bush stepped back , holding just four public events , none with real policy implications he hosted two foreign leaders , the presidents of paraguay and the kurdistan regional government , at the white house , stepping before the cameras for a total of 11 minutes he gave the graduation speech at the fbi academy in quantico , va and he and mrs bush hosted a lighthearted celebration in honor of the 150th birthday of theodore roosevelt , complete with a bespectacled roosevelt impersonator who looked about the east room and commented wryly , well , i must say , i like what you 've done with the place joe lockhart , a former clinton press secretary , said mr bush s absence from the public stage , though brief , had consequences this has an impact , mr lockhart said the world marches on we 're in an economic crisis we have tensions at home and abroad , yet i think if you walk down the street and ask people , 'has the president already left \? ' you 'd have a lot of people saying , 'yeah , i think so' on friday , mr bush left washington at noon to spend the weekend at camp david , and he has no public appearances scheduled for monday unlike in elections past , he will not travel to his ranch in crawford , tex , to vote casting his last ballot as president in person would almost certainly have drawn the sort of news coverage the white house might not want instead , the bushes sought the privacy of absentee ballots this year , casting their votes for mr mccain by mail the couple will watch the election returns from the white house dana perino , the white house press secretary , said the public would most likely hear from her , and not the president , on tuesday night to avoid getting drawn into a discussion about the race , mr bush has steered clear of news conferences all fall ms perino would not say this week when reporters might get a chance to question him directly about the outcome if the past is any guide , mr bush will be matteroffact about the result at the roosevelt event , the president seemed sort of fatalistic about mr mccain s chances and his own place in history , said representative peter t king , republican of new york , who was there mr king said his wife grew emotional , telling the president how much she would miss him mr bush did not grow emotional in return he just said , 'yeah , yeah' he seemed like , what happens , happens , mr king said i always feel that he thinks it s his job to keep everybody s spirits up
june 9 , 2001 the running of the 133rd belmont stakes today evokes mixed emotions in many while this year s race promises to be a thriller , pitting monarchos , the kentucky derby winner , against point given , the preakness winner , a triple crown is not on the line racing fans are frustrated , a sentiment that has become an annual refrain no horse has claimed the crown in 23 years are contemporary horses simply not up to the test \? historically , horses have n't found it much easier each of the triple crown races is more than 125 years old , yet only 11 horses have managed to capture all three but after so many failures , some fans wonder if affirmed , who won the title in 1978 , was the final one there are myriad reasons why triple crown winners emerge so seldom trainer error can be disastrous the ragstoriches hero , seabiscuit , whose smashing performances made him a national icon , never made it to any of the 1936 triple crown races because his first trainer badly mismanaged him jockeys are also critical , making splitsecond tactical decisions while catapulting through an enormous field of horses at 40 miles an hour many deserving horses have lost when their jockeys misjudged the pace and gunned them into suicidal speed duels , moved too early or too late , or steered them into traffic jams other horses have been foiled by injury but it is the challenge of the event itself that fells most horses the triple crown is an ingeniously conceived test , probably the most formidable in sport , taking the fullest possible measure of every horse in three races over three distances at three very different tracks over only five weeks , contenders must reach for their deepest reserves of strength , stamina , versatility , durability and consistency courage , too , is at a premium , demonstrated most dramatically in 1937 when war admiral , unbeknownst to his jockey , sheared off the rear of his hoof while leaving the belmont starting gate , but won the race and the triple crown anyway , setting an american speed record the triple crown is a test that pits competitors against their own limitations , and a single error or weakness can prove fatal in other sporting events , like the world series , there is not infrequently the sense that the winner is merely the best of a mediocre field in a mediocre season in this respect , thoroughbred racing stands alone deserving horses have lost the triple crown , but no undeserving horse has ever won it , and none ever will in 1973 , the racing world was haunted by a mood similar to that felt today a quarter century had passed since the coming of the last triple crown winner , citation fans wondered if they would ever see another horse sweep the series then , on june 9 , a red colossus named secretariat roared down the belmont homestretch on an awesome 31length lead , winning the triple crown in worldrecord time those who worry that we may never see this again should be patient true greatness is extremely rare the next triple crown winner will be worth the wait
jerusalem there was a time not so long ago when avraham burg was viewed by many israelis as proof that the inherent tensions of zionism religious versus secular , insular versus worldly , jewish state versus state of all its citizens could be reconciled with grace here was a religiously observant jew with a cosmopolitan outlook , a decorated paratrooper who believed deeply in peace with the arabs , an eloquent , fastrising public figure accessible to a broad range of citizens widely known by his nickname , avrum , mr burg , a happily married father of six and the son of one of s most admired and longestserving government ministers , was talked about as a candidate for prime minister long before his 50th birthday , he led the world zionist organization and served as speaker in parliament but four years ago mr burg not only walked away from politics , but also basically walked away from zionism in a book that came out last year and has just been translated and released in the united states , he said that israel should not be a jewish state , that its law of return granting citizenship to any jew should be radically altered , that israeli arabs were like german jews during the second reich and that the entire society felt eerily like germany just before the rise of hitler in other words , rather than reconciling the country s complex tensions , mr burg ended up imploding from them i realized something about myself and israel that frightened me , he said recently , looking back over the past few years i realized that israel had become an efficient kingdom with no prophecy where was it going \? what is a jewish democratic state \? what does it mean that jews define themselves by genetics 60 years after genetics were used against them \? israel is no stranger to selfexamination its leaders and thinkers , indeed many of its average citizens , are aware that nearly everything about the place defies normal categorization and is subject to debate this is a source of both pride and irritation but many said mr burg , 53 , was not just asking delicate questions he was poisoning the well from which the nation and he had long drawn their water as ari shavit , a writer for the newspaper haaretz , said to him in an interview when the book was published here your book is antiisrael in the deepest sense it is a book from which loathing of israeliness emanates mr burg rejected that accusation and still does he wrote from love , he said , and if the issues he raised were troubling , if they caused a stir , that was very much his aim there is no doubt that he raises some serious questions is israel too focused on the holocaust as a touchstone of history \? can it stay both jewish and democratic over the long term , or is it time to look for another model \? what kind of future is there for israeli arabs \? less clear , however , is whether mr burg has provided any serious answers this is partly because his book and discourse vacillate between two poles congratulating jews and the zionist movement for their success so far , but warning them that they are turning into a kind of selfjustifying sparta , a warlike state on the verge of tragedy his central point is summed up in the english title of his book the holocaust is over we must rise from its ashes \( palgrave macmillan \) the nazi slaughter of six million jews , he says , has become the central theme of israeli life , dominating it in a way that distorts the country s outlook teenagers are sent on trips to auschwitz every enemy of israel \( yasir arafat , the leader mahmoud ahmadinejad , the president of iran \) is viewed as the reincarnation of hitler mr burg has shifted the title of his book over the years when he was writing it , he called it hitler won when he published it in hebrew he called it defeating hitler partly , he said in the interview , his thinking is evolving , and partly his american editors made some smart cuts and suggestions but it also seems clear that he has modified and adjusted his arguments , especially for a foreign audience the english version does not have some of his more alarming assertions in the hebrew one for example , that the israeli government would probably soon pass the equivalent of the nuremberg laws , with provisions like a prohibition on marriage between jews and arabs asked what precipitated his initial shift from mainstream public figure to more marginal public scourge , mr burg pointed to a process that began in 2001 when he ran for leadership of the labor party and lost in a tight race that he says was stolen from him through backroom deals it was not so much the loss , he asserted , as the realization that he had poured his heart and soul into trying to win something that he had thought so little about i knew how to get elected , but what was i going to do once i got there \? he recalled thinking maybe , he felt , it was lucky that he lost he took five weeks off and walked part of the appalachian trail in connecticut , new york and new jersey by himself in five weeks i met 11 people , none of them jewish , he said he realized that life here was too insular for him , that it was time to step outside the provincial concerns of the extended jewish family mr burg , born and raised in one of west jerusalem s most admired neighborhoods and a graduate of the hebrew university , comes from one of the country s iconic families his father , yosef burg , barely escaped the nazis when he left germany in september 1939 and was a government minister for nearly four decades his mother was a survivor of the arab massacre of jews in hebron in 1929 but mr burg wanted a clean slate he decided to leave politics and build an international business , stop writing bills and news releases and write books , stop taking short runs and train for marathons and so he has he is coowner of a company that takes over failing businesses and rebuilds them for sale , has published two bestselling books and is a longdistance runner he travels frequently and added a french passport to his israeli one , a benefit of his wife s origin the many friends and acquaintances of mr burg a man of great charm and wit , with a large social appetite have been left bewildered by it all , saying the soft , flowery answers he has offered to his big , tough questions have left them cold tom segev , for example , a leftwing historian and haaretz columnist , said in a review that the book was one of the most spacedout and inyourface books this country has seen in many years what are mr burg s prescriptions \? he wants a new jewish identity focused not on the particular but on the universal , asserting that if we do not establish modern israeli identity on foundations of optimism , faith in humans and full trust in the family of nations , we have no chance of existing he wants israel to dismantle the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and replace it with the headquarters for the international criminal court , making it the epicenter of international prevention of genocide in truth , he has gained almost no traction here with such recommendations yet what is perhaps most interesting of all is that mr burg continues to play a public role in israel he is invited to speak to young people , he writes occasional opinion columns , and he is greeted warmly , even embraced , in this city s cafes this may be because , despite it all , avrum burg is family and whether he likes it or not , israelis look out for family
to the editor re colleges and binge drinking \( editorial , sept 17 \) having helped compose the amethyst initiative presidential statement , we want to respond to your statement that there is strong evidence that college administrations could do a lot more than they are doing to combat the alcohol epidemic you commend a few schools that have taken sensible steps to control underage alcohol use but what you do n't mention is the fact that many colleges and universities for years have been putting into effect the very measures you cite with frustratingly inadequate results over time it is , in fact , this futility that led us to sign the amethyst initiative our efforts are circumscribed by the current law young people under 21 cannot legally consume alcohol either on campus or in most offcampus settings a vast majority of young adults , however , have consumed alcohol before they turn 21 to comply with the law , college and university presidents are limited to just say no as a result , drinking has moved behind closed doors or off campus , where detection is next to impossible it s not that we believe easier access might solve the problem access is very easy now it s that this is not a college and university problem it is a national problem you call for a dispassionate debate we strongly believe that this debate should begin with a much better understanding of the monumental efforts higher education institutions have already taken to control underage drinking and why they yield such disappointing results william durden president , dickinson college carlisle , pa , sept 18 , 2008  to the editor the idea that lowering the drinking age will solve the problem of binge drinking is unrealistic i am a high school senior i have attended very few parties at which alcohol was not present , but it is almost impossible to avoid these parties if i want to fully participate in social activities it seems many young people do not comprehend that they do not need alcohol to overcome the awkwardness they feel at high school parties as i visited colleges this summer , the attitude toward drinking amazed me most students declared that drinking is very common on campus none of them criticized it if schools are trying to minimize underage drinking , the message does not seem to be getting through to students underage drinking should be discouraged , and the responsibility for communicating and enforcing that position lies with the school as a prospective student , i would certainly be impressed by that jim reidy milford , conn , sept 19 , 2008  to the editor as someone who directed an alcoholprevention program at a major east coast university for nearly eight years , i agree that binge drinking largely results from the excessivedrinking culture on and surrounding most college campuses rather than reducing the drinking age , colleges should work to deemphasize the role of alcohol one place they could start as more than 365 college presidents have suggested would be to stop advertising beer during college sports telecasts dropping those hypocritical ads , which clutter the annual ncaa men s basketball championship tournament , makes a whole lot more sense than opening the taps for highrisk , vulnerable young drinkers tracy downs washington , sept 18 , 2008  to the editor you conclude that binge drinking on american college campuses stems from the culture of drinking at school while it is easy to blame colleges for the heavy alcohol use that takes place on their campuses , the problem of binge drinking on college campuses lies within american society itself billboards , television advertisements , pop culture icons and professional athletics all embody distorted conceptions of alcohol use with the omnipresence of alcohol in american society , increased measures of alcohol prohibition on college campuses will do little to combat binge drinking among students already conditioned to america s drinking culture i'm an undergraduate at the university of denver i believe that a reduced legal drinking age would be a more feasible step in eliminating america s culture of immoderate drinking , both on and off campus by enabling discussions between law enforcement , college administrators , parents and young adults , a reduced drinking age would show college students and teenagers a more responsible way to drink that would help counter america s glamorous images of alcohol richard anderson denver , sept 17 , 2008  to the editor as you point out , a culture of binge drinking that plagues college campuses can be blamed for , well , binge drinking indeed , as i have witnessed firsthand at dartmouth whose president is among the college presidents who have publicly questioned the drinking age it is a culture that initiates far too many lifetime alcoholics and wastes far too many opportunities but it is precisely a drinking age of 21 that is behind this culture before the drinking age was raised , fraternities held cocktail hours with professors today it is impossible to imagine even the bravest professor stepping foot in a fraternity on a friday evening because college drinking has been forced underground , it is not surprising that it is now characterized less by cocktails followed by dinner with wine than it is by beer pong interrupted by keg stands lowering the drinking age to 18 is not about easier access to alcohol , as you suggest \( getting a beer is easy enough , as any freshman learns by the second day of orientation \) instead , it is about treating students with respect and decriminalizing a widespread activity university presidents rightly hope that if the current drinking laws were changed , they could challenge the culture of illicit drinking that so vexes them stuart reid new york , sept 17 , 2008  to the editor you credit raising the drinking age with a reduction in alcoholrelated traffic deaths among those 18 to 20 but raising the drinking age to 25 would , no doubt , reduce alcoholrelated traffic deaths among those under 25 raising it to 30 would have similar results for people under 30 and banning alcohol altogether would reduce overall alcoholrelated traffic deaths we tried that once we called it prohibition we allow 18yearolds to drive , vote , marry , enter into binding contracts , fight our wars all these activities entail risk some , potentially fatal risk we accord 18yearolds all the rights and responsibilities of adulthood except one why is drinking alcohol singled out for this extraordinary taboo \? charles biblowit jamaica , queens , sept 17 , 2008  to the editor you write the 21yearold floor is not the problem it is the culture of drinking at school i agree , but we then must ask why do we have such a culture \? what , really , is the lure of alcohol \? until we can answer this question and provide , as a culture , alternatives to inebriation for recreation and stress relief , young people will drift toward alcohol and binge drinking twentyyearolds are adults , after all making alcohol illegal does n't keep it out of their hands , but rather promotes it as all the more desirable when did prohibition ever truly prohibit \? lisa calef albany , calif , sept 17 , 2008
baghdad for almost three years , ashley gilbertson , a photographer for the times in iraq , had been hearing about the makeshift graveyard in adhamiya the graveyard was divided into thirds , or so people said one section for iraqis who were killed by americans one for iraqis who were killed during the sectarian war and one for those who died of natural causes but in 2006 and 2007 , adhamiya , a sunni island in a sea of shiite neighborhoods , was a nogo zone for western journalists it was swarming with al qaeda death squads to take a trip there was to invite a beheading baghdad has changed considerably since then several reporters from other outlets had been to the makeshift graveyard but none had spoken of this rumored division of the dead so one evening ashley , myself and tariq , an iraqi reporter , decided to take a look we rode to adhamiya , which was crowded with people out shopping and sitting in cafes at least four wedding processions roared by , honking , led by flowerbedecked cars going at top speed , trailed by busloads of rowdy teenagers leaning dangerously out of windows and screaming the occasional sound of gunfire was \( most likely \) coming from one of these wedding parties we met a local contact who introduced us to the men of the neighborhood watch , who were to escort us to the graveyard these men were members of the awakening councils , sunni groups on the payroll of the americans that have turned against the insurgency a person untrained in recent iraqi history might describe them simply as a bunch of grimlooking men with ak47s they don t wear uniforms later ashley would make the morbid observation that it was certainly possible these were the same men who had been terrorizing adhamiya as part of al qaeda only months earlier but now they had taken off their kaffiyehs , you see , so we were safe in their hands they guided us to the large abu hanifa mosque , and as we drove in we saw the cemetery on our right , a large dusty field of headstones , crowded with children , idling teenagers and women who were squatting next to graves , rocking and keening in grief we were taken by a fairly large entourage of awakening men and cemetery workers to a graveyard inside the walls of the mosque it was about the size of a tennis court , and the graves were packed so closely it was difficult to walk gauzy portraits of young men leaned on some headstones on most were a few verses of the koran , etched and painted in blue women in black abayas huddled in different parts of the yard , chatting or , if alone , shaking with sobs everyone in this cemetery was killed by americans , one of the cemetery workers said it used to be a garden but just after the invasion , four syrians and three lebanese were killed in adhamiya resisting the invasion tariq later explained that these men must have been fedayeen , volunteer fighters who came to iraq to fight the americans that made sense they would be among the very first casualties of the iraq war after they were killed , local adhamiya citizens buried them in this garden relatives eventually came for the lebanese but the syrian graves were still there , in a row near the front gate , the word martyr etched on the graves in green once ground was broken , more bodies came resistance fighters and innocent civilians , iraqis , egyptians , more syrians all killed , the workers said , by americans one woman was standing over a large , weedinfested plot , holding a sad hose that coughed up not much more than a trickle of water , a chore that she performs everyday she said her three sons were killed by the americans for no reason , while fishing in the tigris or sleeping at home or stopping by the butcher tareq later pointed out the elements of her story that did not add up but a conversation with a grieving mother in a graveyard is no time for skeptical inquiry it wasn t crowded like it is now , she said of the time when she came to bury her first son ashley and i wanted to find the caretaker , or one of them one of the awakening guards gestured toward a man who appeared to be in his early 20s , wearing a baseball cap his name was fahed abdulatif mahmoud , he would later tell me , and he came from a family of undertakers that goes back generations in baghdad this cemetery was created haphazardly , but as the number of corpses grew , it became clear people were needed to oversee it fahed , who lived in the area , happened to have the right pedigree , and there was no other work to be found , he said the undertaker always makes a living fahed led us outside of the garden , across a garbagestrewn dirt road to the large cemetery we had seen when we rode in there were thousands of graves , receding in the dusk , most of them for young men the moaning and wailing of women was almost unbearable plastic bottles littered the graves cats roamed large , linked graves testified to horrific tragedy small blankets on the dirt held down by rocks signified the graves of children this was once a park , a soccer field tareq remembered the popular barbecue stand up the street but then in early 2006 , as part of the sectarian violence that raged across the country , a car bomb exploded in adhamiya twentyseven corpses the small garden had become too crowded with its 250 or so plots and it was still too dangerous to go across town for a burial at the large existing cemetery so now the soccer field was dug up and this became the graveyard for victims of the sectarian conflict twenty , thirty bodies a day whole families shot by militias or blown apart by truck bombs it was becoming clear now that the rumors ashley had heard were not exactly true the victims were not intentionally divided up by their killers the graveyard grew organically , like ivy , finding new space when the old ran out but that is how death has moved here first it came by way of the invasion , then primarily through the sectarian war the cemetery was a chronology of violence in iraq , and , like rings of a tree , you could study the forms the violence took over the years now there are not nearly as many corpses , fahed said there are still violent deaths , and occasionally there are people who die of natural causes , but they are usually buried at another cemetery that is good news , but the men here are pragmatists , not optimists just in case , the cemetery has laid claim to a nearby soccer field
the federal government issued national standards on friday that states would have to meet in order for driver s licenses they issue to qualify as identification at airports and federal buildings , setting the stage for a confrontation with states that have voted not to cooperate under a measure known as real id legislation , the states must comply by may 11 , the third anniversary of the measure s enactment , or obtain a waiver from the department of homeland security meeting the may 11 deadline is impossible because the regulations have been delayed so long , but , the secretary of homeland security , said friday that his department would issue a waiver to states that promised to comply later he laid out a very long schedule , with the final deadline in december 2017 , more than 16 years after the events that prompted the law , the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 several states have voted not to comply one is washington , where the chairwoman of the senate s transportation committee , when asked what difference the new federal rules would make , said , none the washington legislature is to begin a special session on monday but it will be brief , said senator mary margaret haugen , the chairwoman it s very unrealistic of the federal government to think that states that are not in session or in a short session can resolve this in a short time frame , she said our state has said we will not spend money on the real id unless they fund it , and i do n't see any money coming from the federal government in washington and elsewhere , state lawmakers have complained that the requirements add up to a national identification card , that it is too costly , puts privacy at risk and poses severe technical challenges the legislature in maine overwhelmingly passed a resolution last january vowing not to comply the legislature there is in its short session and can take up only legislation that all the leadership decides is an emergency , said peggy schaffer , chief of staff to the senate majority leader ms schaffer predicted that pressure from the airlines might force the federal government to reverse itself the airlines , in fact , are worried , because travelers with driver s licenses from states that do not have a waiver would have to use a passport or a military id , or face additional screening , including a patdown this has the potential to be hugely problematic , said david castelveter , a spokesman for the air transport association , a trade association of the major carriers it appears as if the department of homeland security is placing the burden on the traveling public for a state s inability to comply exactly how many states will decide not to apply for waivers is unclear arkansas , idaho , montana and others have voted against the program , which was a central recommendation of the sept 11 commission states would have to require applicants for new licenses or renewals to prove they are legally in the country , and then record and verify the documents opponents have complained that passports and social security cards are easy to verify promptly , but birth certificates , issued by thousands of jurisdictions , are not while some states are in revolt , others were moving to tighten their licensing standards even before sept 11 and some advocates say that tighter controls would help prevent identity theft and drunken driving we can kill three birds with one stone if we get ourselves on a path to a secure driver s license , mr chertoff said civil libertarians counter that the new licenses must have all the information encoded into a machinereadable bar code these will be read by retail stores , hotels and other companies , the american civil liberties union predicted , creating powerful intrusions of privacy barry steinhardt of the aclu predicted that the program would never take effect by setting deadlines so far in the future , he said , the administration had kicked the can down the road to the next one the schedule released friday calls for compliant licenses for everyone under 50 by may 11 , 2014 , and for those 50 and over , by dec 1 , 2017 the homeland security department decided this would lower costs , according to mr chertoff he called it risk management , saying older people were less likely to be terrorists

colorado city , ariz as the supper dishes were being cleared away and the rice pudding brought out for dessert , marvin wyler s two wives , along with some of their children and a group of friends , began poring over the list the 44page document , from a court in , gives a glimpse of who is married to whom in the , or flds and in the hothouse world of religious , a list like that is a sort of rosetta stone to the usually hidden relationships of power , politics and piety we are adding up the number of men who may be going to prison , said isaac wyler , 42 , the eldest of mr wyler s 34 children , who was examining the list on sunday to see which men may have had wives under the legal age when they married scenes like this have played out in recent days in polygamist communities on the  border as the marriage list and other records , seized last month from the polygamist sect in eldorado , tex , along with 462 children in an investigation of possible underage brides , have filtered west the information has families like the wylers talking about some of polygamy s bestkept secrets who would have guessed , for instance , that wendell nielsen , a highranking sect official with family here , had 21 wives in texas , too \? or that he has 35 children on top of those here \? as law enforcement officials from utah and arizona prepare for what they expect to be a capacity crowd townhallstyle meeting on polygamy on thursday planned north of here in st george , utah , before the texas raid but now proceeding with an added urgency polygamist gossip is only one of the many consequences of the raid that they are encountering rumors of an imminent texasstyle police crackdown the authorities say none is contemplated are among the new constants of life here , the historic heartland of the flds some polygamists , who had considered moving to texas , are putting down roots again here , even cooperating with the authorities others are speaking out publicly , trying to distinguish their forms of plural marriage \( no underage brides \) from what the authorities say was practiced by the sect in texas polygamy is not the problem , said marlyne hammon , who belongs to a group called the work of jesus christ , which practices polygamy in a town just a few miles from here ms hammon , of centennial park , ariz , said child brides had no place in her group s faith or practice this is about human error , not polygamy , she said fierce winds of change from national political attitudes about polygamy to new economic stress and even down to the personal decisions about where to live in a posteldorado world are buffeting the polygamist faithful recent statements by senator harry reid of nevada , a democrat and the senate majority leader , calling for toughened enforcement of laws against polygamy , possibly with an expanded federal role by the department of justice , have sent a particular shiver , with questions swirling about what the states will do under federal pressure they think they 're going to be next that there s so much pressure being brought on me that i'm going to raid them , said utah s attorney general , mark l shurtleff , a republican they hear the rumors , and they call mr shurtleff said he planned no change in tactics , and no mass raids , which he said would only destroy the trust needed to protect people , including the young girls his office is trying to help it is a point , he said , that he intends to make forcefully on thursday night on a shared stage with the arizona attorney general , terry goddard , at the meeting in st george , about 45 miles from here mr goddard , a democrat , said he too intended to continue pursuing accusations of abuse case by case , with no mass arrests or seizures in the offing i do n't know how i can make a case that all the children in colorado city are in danger , mr goddard said but some polygamist families say paranoia is only natural now even the wylers , who left the sect years ago he is 63 and his wives are 63 and 58 \( a third wife died years ago \) are anxious the 63yearold wife said she risked losing her job if her name was used in this article but as the texas raid s impact is digested here , individual flds families are making new decisions over the last month , dozens of families have come forward to cooperate with a courtappointed officer , pay their bills and sign documents that could allow them to stay in their homes here , most of which are owned by a trust once controlled by warren s jeffs mr jeffs , the flds leader , was convicted last year in a utah case of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14yearold before the raid , said the officer , bruce r wisan , people would not even answer the door when he knocked the raid shook something loose this raid in texas just totally exacerbated their concerns and solidified the idea that we 're not going to be moving out of here , said mr wisan , who is also an accountant from salt lake city it s a huge shift , from moving the whole community out , to paying and signing the flds broke away from the mainstream church of jesus christ of latterday saints , which has 13 million members worldwide , decades ago over the practice of polygamy mormons disavowed it in 1890 and now excommunicate polygamists the relationship between the sect s core settlement here and its outpost in texas called the , was complex families sent to texas by the sect s leadership were favored and said to have been identified by revelation to the leadership from god they were just gradually moving down there as things got ready , but they took the most elite and most chosen first , said shannon price , the director of a group called the diversity foundation that works to help people leaving the fundamentalist groups now there is a question , ms price and others said , about who might be coming back from texas and whether it might include a few men who do not want to be found by the police the stress rippling out from texas is also compounding economic woes a power plant built under the leadership of mr jeffs s predecessor and father , rulon jeffs , in 1997 with 214 million in municipal bonds has been in default for years as customers for the power , including the city of st george , walked away and fuel costs soared the power station was needed , the jeffs men said , in anticipation of a prophesied collapse of american society in the year 2000 that would have left the flds humming along in its rural fastness with the lights still on now , the bondholders are going to court , and last week , the utility officers began considering a 25 percent rate increase , on top of what is already some of the most expensive electricity in the west , in an effort to stave off financial disaster the city council in hildale , utah , sister community to colorado city across the border , is to vote on the proposal later this month we are in a financial cashflow crisis , said jerry barlow , the utility s manager we will not be able to pay for the power without some kind of adjustment meanwhile , in the documents from the texas court , the tapestry if not the dirty laundry of familial flds life has become the stuff of dinner table chitchat the reports hint , for example , at a network of safe houses where sect members can take refuge for reasons undisclosed in some cases , wives and children are listed as living elsewhere , in hiding or living in a house of hiding the wylers here in colorado city were also particularly astounded to learn that mr nielsen , the highranking sect official who everyone at the dinner table believed kept his wives and children in arizona , had another family cluster in texas according to the records , mr nielsen , who was 67 in august 2007 when his family information sheet was completed , had 21 wives , ranging in age from 24 to 79 , and 35 children , ranging in age from 6 months to 23 , who were living at the zion ranch until the raid the records do not include the dates of marriages , most of which would have been religious ceremonies with no state civil licenses issued so the lists are more suggestive than conclusive , for now under texas law , no girl under 16 can legally marry , even with her parents' permission
has had a rough year her current album , discipline , arrived in february to such disappointing sales that in september , with fewer than a halfmillion copies sold , she ended her contract with the label , island def jam , leaving her independent so there was an extra edge during her madison square garden show on saturday when she shouted , at the end of her song control i'm on my own , and i 'll call my own shots ! her first tour in seven years started shakily this fall , with shows suddenly canceled or postponed her spokesman said that ms jackson , 42 , suffered from vestibular migraines that could cause dizziness a problem for a performer who , in concert , is more a dancer than a singer the tour s original opening act , , dropped off the bill yet none of that weighed down ms jackson s garden show , which had been postponed from oct 16 she strutted through a fulltilt arena spectacle like those she has mounted since her multimillionselling days in the 1980s and '90s , with dancers , video screens , pyrotechnics and lipsynching \( how much ms jackson was actually singing during the concert is open to conjecture except for stage patter , her voice was rarely fully exposed as she shared lead vocals with recorded tracks \) but the foundation for all that razzledazzle was one of the most durable catalogs of hits from the musicvideo era , and plenty of them ms jackson s set list had three dozen songs , and all but the oldest and most recent ones triggered immediate singalongs her constant subject is longing for sex both tender and kinky but also for companionship and devotion to pack all those songs into just over two hours onstage , she turned them into medleys , grouped by musical style there were minisets of keyboarddriven funk like nasty , of creamy ballads like again , of upbeat pop like escapade , of hiphoptinged rb like got til it s gone \( with qtip rapping on the video screen \) and of guitardriven rock like black cat she had a costume for each one and endless variations of her familiar angular stopandstart dance moves the men in her troupe spun through gymnastics or groveled at her feet with her hair pointing skyward in a fauxmohawk , ms jackson appeared in futuristic sparkles , in a skintight red formal dress , in a maroon bodysuit with glittery epaulets and in quasidominatrix lingerie her long set piece was the title song of discipline a man taken from the audience was suspended in a leather harness above a supine ms jackson , who groped between his legs in video closeups at the end he babbled about his love for ms jackson into a convenient microphone ms jackson also reclaimed the pop she made as a teenager , before she became her own producer , with a medley from her 1982 debut album , janet jackson now they sound like the beginning of a style that would merge her brother michael jackson s melodic choruses with the synthesized minneapolis funk of mr jackson s 1980s rival , prince that fusion helped shape britney spears , beyonc , the pussycat dolls and much other current poprb ms jackson is the kind of performer who made the most of pop s blockbuster era she has always relied on every enhancement of the old star system she hired skillful collaborators , catalyzing the best work from her longtime producers and songwriting partners , jimmy jam and terry lewis \( recent songs , without them , have lacked for melody \) studio techniques polished her modest coo of a voice , and videos and photo sessions disseminated her combination of girlish smiles and sultry teases highgloss pop is her rightful medium , and it could well be endangered by the new austerities of the recording business and the world economy but in all their artificial splendor , her old songs still gleam
beijing lang ping , the coach of the united states women s team , tries to be a master of disguise in her home city she hides behind sunglasses or pulls on a floppy hat with her team , she often exits arenas at the center of a huddle , sometimes escorted by bodyguards as people clamor to get a glimpse of her or touch the sleeve of her shirt a former chinese national team volleyball star , she once wrapped all but her eyes with a scarf so she would not be recognized on a bike ride as she pedaled down the streets of beijing , lang saw people point to her and cry out lang ping ! look everybody , that s lang ping under that scarf ! i ca n't go out at all or do anything in public because i'm mobbed by my fans , she said once i bought something from a street vendor and everyone pointed to me look , lang ping eat that ! take photo of lang ping eating that !

the gold medal it will be the first appearance of the united states women in an olympic gold medal match since 1984 china will play cuba for the bronze medal , an awkward ending to olympic women s volleyball for some chinese since the olympics began , chinese newspaper editorials , stories and blogs have discussed lang s success one newspaper story s headline read , let s be proud of lang ping , urging people not to consider her a traitor others said she had forsaken her homeland she should not have turned her back on china to coach the opponents , said yang lijia , 47 , a fan at the united statescuba match on thursday i am proud that she is chinese , but if she coached for china , we would be going for the gold medal it s too bad about this cui dalin , the vice minister of the general administration of sport of china , said that the chinese sports officials were honored that lang was chosen to coach the americans we feel happy for her , cui said in an interview this spring at the chinese olympic committee s headquarters america s volleyball team will be the most popular team in beijing because of lang ping lang insists she made the right move by taking the job in 2005 because volleyball is not as popular in the united states as it is in china , she said , she could have a normal life as the us coach , living near the united states olympic committee s training center in colorado springs , colo i will always be chinese , even though i wear another country s colors , she said my fans love me , so i hope they understand that lang , who is nearly 6 feet 2 inches , was

leader of a team that won four world championships and the gold medal at the 1984 games in the 1980s , after the world watched lady diana spencer marry prince charles , china watched lang ping marry

fame until they took a trip to china in 2005 lang s photo was on a huge billboard inside the arena where they played a group of chinese fans waved an american flag and chanted lang s name mothers have thrown their children at her , the united states volleyball player nicole davis said i do n't think there s any parallel to that in the us not michael jordan not anything she is more of a historical figure , more of a sports figure i mean , she s in the history books i think that s a beautiful thing lang s father was a policeman in beijing her mother was a manager in a hotel they wanted her to be a doctor , but her athleticism got in the way life then was much harder than the chinese players have it today , she said lang said she slept on a wooden plank she had just three sets of clothes there was nothing to be happy about or not , she said of life under mao zedong life was very simple and all persons were made to be the same in the late 1970s , athletes began venturing outside china for competitions and became ambassadors for their country but they were not given much freedom , told by their federation exactly what to do and how to do it they often remained in their hotel rooms , never given any money with which to explore on their own it was a huge deal for us to travel , and we were really careful about everything we did because we were so scared people would just grab us and maybe take us away , she said lang said the team remained on its best behavior everything they said had to be positive every action was watched and judged , they were told , by every nonchinese we were trained like that to talk the same , act in a certain way , she said our mind was less open then lang received televisions or bikes for good performances , but never money , she said six years in a row , she was voted the best athlete in china and received the same bike each year now , china s best athletes receive cars , apartments and cash they often travel with laptops and cellphones if it

a gold medal her country of origin does not seem to mind , except for one caveat if we are not playing china , the chinese fans always cheer for us , davis said it s not bad to suddenly have a billion people on your side
the house of representatives is poised to vote next week on a pioneering bill that would give the food and drug administration its first real power to regulate tobacco products , much as it now regulates food , drugs and medical devices this is a critically important bill , the culmination of more than a decade of struggle to bring the renegade tobacco industry under regulatory control in the 1990s , the fda tried to regulate tobacco products under existing statutes , but the supreme court ruled that the agency had exceeded the authority granted by congress now both houses are considering bills that would write the agency s 1996 rules into law and add many other tools and powers as well david kessler , the former food and drug commissioner who led the regulatory battle more than a decade ago , called it as strong a tobacco bill as we have seen in our lifetimes the bill pending in the house would empower the fda to regulate both the content and marketing of tobacco products the agency could not ban tobacco products outright or eliminate all nicotine from them , but it could reduce the levels of nicotine , eliminate other harmful ingredients and set product standards to protect the public s health it could also restrict advertising and promotion to the extent permitted by the first amendment the bush administration has opposed the bill on several grounds none of them compelling its core objection is that the bill would heap new responsibilities on the fda at a time when the agency is struggling to enhance food safety and improve oversight of imported drugs , devices and foods of course , the reason the agency is struggling is that the administration , true to its animus against regulation , has failed to provide adequate resources during most of its tenure the solution is to provide enough money and people to perform all vital tasks , not to duck a new one the administration further frets that user fees imposed on the tobacco industry wo n't cover all costs of the regulatory effort , thus forcing the fda to cannibalize other programs to make up the difference but the bill now clarifies that only the designated user fees and no other fda funds can be used to regulate tobacco the administration also contends as do some antitobacco activists that fda oversight could leave the public with the misperception that tobacco products are safe , or at least safer , with regulation but the bill prohibits tobacco companies from implying that they have fda approval , and the agency has ample ways to remind the public that tobacco is harmful the bill has strong support from such organizations as the american cancer society , the american heart association , the american lung association and the campaign for tobaccofree kids it is supported by philip morris , but opposed by most of the tobacco industry it has strong bipartisan support in congress the legislation needs to be passed this year by vetoproof margins in both houses , lest the reform impulse dissipate next year as a new administration and new congress grapple with a host of complicated foreign , military and domestic issues
tallahassee , fla nearly two years after a congressman abruptly resigned over sexually explicit messages he sent to a teenage house page , law enforcement authorities here have concluded there is insufficient evidence to charge him with breaking florida laws commissioner gerald bailey of the florida department of law enforcement , who was asked in september 2006 to look into the conduct of the congressman , representative , republican of west palm beach , said friday that investigators were hampered by mr foley s refusal and that of congress to grant them access to congressional computer files the department was investigating whether mr foley violated florida s computer and exploitation law , and a state law banning the transmittal of harmful material to minors via electronic equipment or devices fdle conducted as thorough and comprehensive investigation as possible considering congress and mr foley denied us access to critical data , mr bailey said in a statement should additional information arise which is pertinent to this case , we will ensure it is appropriately investigated a spokeswoman for the justice department , laura sweeney , confirmed that mr foley also would not face any federal charges at a news conference on friday in west palm beach , mr foley s lawyer , david roth , read a statement in which mr foley said , i am of course relieved that after extensive and thorough investigations by the florida department of law enforcement , the federal bureau of investigation and the united states justice department , the determination has been made that there is no probable cause to believe that i committed any crime he added once again , i wish to express my sincerest apologies for the inappropriate emails i sent , particularly to the recipients i fully realize that i failed them , my family , my former congressional colleagues and staff , as well as the community as a whole as part of the state investigation in 2006 , gov jeb bush asked state law enforcement officials to look into why mr foley s electronic messages had not been turned over to florida prosecutors house officials told investigators they were constitutionally barred from granting access to mr foley s congressional computer without his consent the report said that mr roth told the florida authorities that it was not in his client s best interest to grant such access the department s 16page report , available online at , shows that lawenforcement officials interviewed 17 former house pages from florida who had worked in congress from 2000 to 2006 none reported having had any inappropriate activity or conversations with mr foley the report said that the page whose accusations led to mr foley s resignation told investigators that he and mr foley had exchanged email and instant messages in which the congressman asked about his sexual experiences the page also said that mr foley wanted to perform sexual acts with him at a reunion of pages in washington in 2003 florida s jurisdiction in the case was restricted to crimes that occurred in the state investigators also were limited by a threeyear statute of limitations in the case the florida report says that the fbi interviewed four pages who had also communicated electronically with mr foley , but that the interviews did not yield evidence that the conversations occurred while mr foley was in florida the backlash surrounding the case helped the democrats regain control of congress in the 2006 elections , including mr foley s seat
the year 2008 has brought two dance anniversaries that reflect contrasting aspects of the same subject the choreographer died 25 years ago on april 30 new york city ballet , which he and lincoln kirstein founded , gave its first performance , dancing a triple bill of his ballets , 60 years ago , on oct 11 what s strange today is that city ballet , though the world s most frequent and facile exponent of his repertory , is no longer the most serious balanchine is now a global phenomenon city ballet s version of him of his ballets has become less incisive , more lightweight , less disturbing how long does it take a genius to dominate his art \? while shakespeare was alive and for some decades after , he was simply one of several excellent elizabethan playwrights only gradually did he became accepted as england s best , and it took more than 200 years for him to become the world s mozart was established in most musicians' minds as the supreme composer within 10 years of his death , yet even don giovanni , his most immediately successful in international terms , took 48 years before it reached europe s most prestigious theater , the paris opera the equivalent process has happened for george balanchine in just 25 years he is now a growth industry his jewels \( 1967 \) , billed when new as the first threeact plotless ballet , was the specialty of city ballet alone during its maker s lifetime today it is danced by europe s three most prestigious ballet companies the paris opera ballet , the kirov ballet in st petersburg and the royal ballet at covent garden it is danced too by american ballet companies from miami to san francisco \( the pacific northwest ballet in seattle has been performing it since 2006 , and boston ballet will add it to its repertory in 2009 \) until balanchine died in 1983 , the tremendous ballerina role of diamonds \( the final act of jewels \) was danced by only four women between october 2007 and january 2008 i saw it performed by seven , and i could have seen others without much trouble many other balanchine ballets have become equally or more widespread , nationally and internationally allbalanchine programs , once the specialty of city ballet alone , are standard fare for companies across the world , balanchine remains the big adventure learning how to meet the challenge of his dances remains the greatest test between its foundation in 1948 and balanchine s death , city ballet was the undoubted leading exponent of his work later too during the four years after he died , the company danced superlatively standards even seemed to rise the ballerinas merrill ashley , patricia mcbride and suzanne farrell gave resplendent performances maria calegari and kyra nichols took roles new to them and gave them fresh glory difficult ballets like divertimento no 15 \( 1956 \) , symphony in three movements \( 1972 \) and kammermusik no 2 \( 1978 \) looked better than ever there followed a steep and harrowing decline major features of balanchine style began to erode his dancers had arrived in position with the beat now they responded to that beat , so dance and music ceased to reach the audience as one he had built his technique out of the drastic contrast between tightly closed positions and stretched open ones now this became softened , blurred dancers had stepped off balance with fulltoned audacity \( startling to european eyes and an embodiment of american character \) now they made the transfer of weight more mild and polite the corps de ballet in those years began to dance more tidily and in better unison but with a less blazing energy the change was from beauty to prettiness , force to neatness and it made some ballets evaporate altogether divertimento no 15 in 1983 had epitomized the sublime in 1992 it was small scale , inconsequential , tame works from the sparse , elemental four temperaments \( 1946 \) to the romantic , fateful la valse \( 1951 \) ceased to be heartstopping as drama during the 1990s balanchine at city ballet eroded in two fundamental ways that went beyond style he had been the most profoundly musical of choreographers , but now the company s music fell apart , in terms of orchestral playing and of sheer coordination and he had been the most radical in dramatizing women in 1975 arlene croce wrote if george balanchine were a novelist or a playwright or a movie director instead of a choreographer , his studies of women would be among the most discussed and most influential artistic achievements of our time sexual complicity in conflict with individual freedom is a central theme of the balanchine pas de deux , and more often than not it is dramatized from the woman s point of view he can make comedy or tragedy , and sometimes a blend of both , out of the conflict between a woman s free will and her need for a man he can carry you step by step into dramas in which sexual relationships are not defined by sex or erotic tension alone in the 1990s most of city ballet s leading women began to seem callow , ingratiating , even infantilized there were honorable exceptions , notably ms nichols and , among the men , nikolaj h bbe and damian woetzel they have recently retired , but wendy whelan , who still dances many leading roles , remains a decisive , vehement dancer who , despite physical and stylistic imperfections , displays a cool , adult authority she became a star , however , in an era when her balanchine roles had lost crucial dimensions in his union jack \( 1976 \) , she dances the role created by karin von aroldingen , a physically odder and technically less fastidious artist who would probably never get a job in a major ballet company today but ms von aroldingen s union jack solo was electrifying because of her rhythm , both wild and sharp with ms whelan , who has danced this role since 1993 , the solo is merely harmless it does nothing to alter the ballet s barometer there are many such examples across the repertory , many given by dancers with none of ms whelan s authority i knew all this when i began this job in april 2007 since then , the happy surprise has been to discover that some standards have improved , above all in the music provided by the company s music director fay al karoui the company s dancing has not yet become much more musically serious , admittedly , but some performers , notably ashley bouder and teresa reichlen , have made several balanchine roles into matters of real consequence i have eagerly applauded ballets as varied as tschaikovsky piano concerto no 2 \( 1941 \) la sonnambula \( 1946 \) , the nutcracker \( 1954 \) , raymonda variations \( 1961 \) , symphony in three movements and le tombeau de couperin \( 1975 \) it was exciting this spring to watch many dancers show balanchine s offbalance principle in practice yet there are central classics concerto barocco \( 1941 \) , the four temperaments , symphony in c \( 1947 \) and agon \( 1957 \) of which i have not seen the company give a single nearly greatenough performance in apollo \( 1928 \) , serenade \( 1934 \) , duo concertant \( 1972 \) and mozartiana \( 1981 \) , excellence was confined to ms nichols and mr h bbe , now retired meanwhile the school of american ballet can still be relied on for illustrating , as it did in the very opening step of concerto barocco this june , the dramatic contrast between tight fifth positions and stretched open positions the adult company it supplies with dancers cannot since this is a bedrock principle of balanchine technique , it s hard to avoid feeling that most dancers , in this respect and in matters of musical timing , are learning crucial points at the school that the company will teach them to forget without doubt the coming winter season will change my understanding of this scene it will include my first view in many years of city ballet dancing ballets like divertimento no 15 , movements for piano and orchestra \( 1963 \) and chaconne \( 1976 \) though no company dances nearly so many balanchine ballets as city ballet , the main balanchine story is now happening elsewhere it s scarcely a matter of contention that american ballet theater , miami city ballet , pacific northwest ballet , san francisco ballet , the suzanne farrell ballet \( attached to the kennedy center in washington \) and the kirov ballet of st petersburg have all danced several balanchine ballets better than the mother company or that even the royal ballet of london is occasionally better in individual balanchine ballets during the last 18 months i have seen balanchine s agon and square dance danced better by the miami and seattle companies bugaku and liebeslieder walzer by the suzanne farrell ballet the four temperaments by the san francisco and miami companies and ballo della regina by american ballet theater what were once the secrets of city ballet alone degrees of speed , precision and daring that ballet had never seen before are now becoming world property it will be fascinating to see the still young miami company dance five balanchine ballets at city center \( city ballet s home until 1964 \) in january to watch american ballet theater , the kirov and the royal ballet none of them balanchine specialists is , at least sometimes , to see how great individual dancers can still illumine balanchine ballets in october and november at city center , david hallberg of ballet theater brought to the male role of ballo della regina \( 1978 \) a blaze and finesse that give the role new dimensions we do not have to hug our memories of yesteryear balanchine is as much ballet s future as its past why \? balanchine s supremacy , as with that of shakespeare or mozart , lies in his unsurpassed ability to tap the theatrical and expressive qualities of ballet itself up goes the curtain on a balanchine tableau the corps de ballet or two leading dancers or both and this alone is often enough to cause a round of applause before any dancing has begun i know of no other choreographer whose openings regularly have this effect as the ballet proceeds , the basic ingredients of dancing to music , of man meeting woman , of ballerina amid corps de ballet , of holding a balance and stepping out of it become more powerfully charged than with the work of any other choreographer balanchine was a classicist , a radical , a romantic , a modernist , an avantgardist , and he also loved to watch charlie s angels and wonder woman on television some of his ballets contain strong elements of kitsch and oldfashioned theatricality in the nutcracker , for example , the scantily clad exotic female coffee dance seems designed mainly for all the lads and dads in the audience this happily lightweight aspect of balanchine makes it at times tempting to rate him as merely a master confectioner or an occasionally vulgar faberg but in most of the many ballets that have survived him \( he was prolific \) , not least his ultratheatrical nutcracker , those elements were just part of a transcendent mix you could follow them as fun , as drama or as philosophy the posthumous preeminence he has now achieved has its negative aspects there are a few features of balanchine s style and several parts of his surviving repertory that i do n't love during his lifetime it was standard to talk of him as one of several of the great choreographers of the day now his contemporaries frederick ashton , martha graham and antony tudor are in danger of becoming the dance equivalents of ben jonson , christopher marlowe and philip massinger , whom shakespeare eclipsed long after they had all died several of balanchine s slightest creations have been preserved , while some of the best works by ashton , graham and tudor have become endangered species or extinct when i think back to watching balanchine ballets in his lifetime , what strikes me most \? their sense of adventure many of them were difficult , challenging and those that looked funny and corny on the surface usually turned out to have unnerving twists and peculiarities \( it s no surprise to hear that , in the 1950s and '60s , there were seasons when the public failed to fill the theater , but when many of new york s intellectuals and avantgarde artists returned night after night \) and the dancing itself was risk taking , alive with the most powerful human energy i have ever witnessed it s marvelous that the rest of the ballet world is now catching up with the supreme adventure of those years there is more catching up to do
washington in the postmarbury era , however long it may last , the ' fate will ride most games on jamal crawford s stutterstep , his crossover dribble and his streaky jumper that repertory helped fuel the knicks' longest winning streak of the season this week , but it was not enough to extend that streak to a fourth game friday crawford was good , but not great , and the knicks' defense was closer to poor than fair as the ran away for a 11198 victory antawn jamison scorched the knicks \( mostly zach randolph \) for 32 points , making 14 of 20 field goals caron butler had 22 points , and the wizards shot 568 percent from the field the knicks \( 1227 \) trailed by only 4 points early in the fourth quarter but faded badly crawford , who scored 79 points in the threegame winning streak and often plays the role of fourthquarter savior , could not bail out the knicks this time he scored 19 points , but had one field goal in the final period crawford , who is routinely playing 40 minutes a game , said fatigue was not a factor but he acknowledged that the wizards had adjusted their defense after he scored 29 points against them tuesday in a knicks victory they made some adjustments , for sure , crawford said , including a scheme in which the lanky jamison shadowed him across the court crawford can expect more of the same in the weeks to come , now that the knicks are more firmly in his hands will have surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle tuesday he is out indefinitely the knicks have bigger problems , like defense the wizards \( 2117 \) had 61 points by halftime , and 92 through three quarters the knicks cut a 16point deficit in half in the third quarter , but the wizards easily pulled away in the fourth coach isiah thomas dismissed any concern over defense , crawford s possible fatigue or eddy curry s failure to dominate \( he had 17 points and 5 rebounds \) i was n't dissatisfied at all tonight , thomas said sometimes , the other team plays better than you and sometimes you run into a team that has it going quentin richardson continued his recent resurgence for the knicks , scoring 21 points 19 in the first half the knicks had 25 assists , extending their seasonbest streak to four games with at least 20 the improved teamwork has come without marbury , who surprised the knicks by shutting himself down sunday , citing pain in his ankle typically , when a franchise player is lost to injury , his team reacts with a mix of distress and selfpity the knicks have shown virtually none another sign of how irrelevant marbury has become to a team now built around crawford , curry and randolph in recent days , thomas has gone out of his way to praise crawford s shotmaking ability and his leadership , a quality thomas said marbury was lacking in november on friday , thomas practically installed crawford as marbury s longterm successor , declaring him definitively a point guard crawford has generally been regarded as a hybrid he may not be a true point , but that may be his best position , thomas said we always looked at him as a scoring guard , but the success that he s having with the basketball in his hands , we may have to rethink that that puts crawford in line to replace marbury longterm marbury s contract expires in 2009 , although he could be traded or bought out this summer team officials have done little to dissuade speculation that marbury opted to have surgery rather than play through his injury in fact , the team fueled it with a statement thursday that marbury has chosen to have surgery given marbury s difficult season he has feuded with thomas and bristled at his reduced role his decision is hardly surprising he s having surgery , thomas said matteroffactly , and we 'll continue to move on rebounds the knicks have not won four straight games since putting together a sixgame streak in january 2006 under larry brown jerome james made his season debut , in the 39th game of the season he played the final 2 minutes 46 seconds and made the only field goal he attempted playing time will be hard to find behind eddy curry , zach randolph and david lee i know i'm 7foot1 and can block shots , and we 're the last team in the league in shot blocking , james said so i know i'm going to play james had been sidelined since early october , first by a knee injury and then by foot surgery the latest insult to curry comes from his peers sports illustrated asked 242 nba players to name the player who gets the least out of the most talent seven percent chose curry , ranking him third on the list it is troubling , curry said when told of the poll that s just their opinion it s unfortunate they feel that way it 'd be good to know who said it kwame brown of the lakers drew the most votes \( 17 percent \) , followed by the clippers' tim thomas , a former knick , with 10 percent ' vince carter was fourth , with 6 percent
on sunday afternoon , many in the new york city ballet audience leapt to their feet to applaud damian woetzel s performance of the title role in balanchine s ballet the prodigal son quite right , too mr woetzel is due to retire from dancing next week , and it seems that each performance he gives is greeted by a heightened intensity in the auditorium at 41 , nothing about him looks ready for retirement he is very precise about the many signs of angryyoungman rebellion that mark the prodigal s first scene he is utterly absorbed in the strange new world of voluptuous experience he encounters in the second and where he comes into his own better than any prodigal i have seen in the last 30 years is in the long turning point of the drama , when the hero becomes an embodiment of pathos as this prodigal is left alone , stripped of worldly goods and clothes , he starts to breathe with a new force , his lower rib cage and diaphragm moving as if gasping and , taking only slow and small actions , he is compelling in the huge emotions of humiliation , remorse , despair and need that now sweep over him i do not remember the character ever seeming to have traveled so huge a distance as here when he finally curls himself up across his father s chest maria kowroski is a siren worthy of such an artist a coolly inscrutable mixture of grandeur and greed , commanding both in her spaciously offbalance steps and in the decisiveness with which she wraps her cloak around her thighs the prodigal son is the centerpiece of a triple bill called there and then , partly because each ballet evokes period and place the first song we hear in the opening ballet , peter martins s thou swell , includes the words but who knows where or when \? that s not , however , the main question about that ballet instead why so halfbaked \? the arrangement of richard rodgers s music for onstage band and orchestra in the pit is ghastly , the singing by betsy wolff and mike mcgowan vile , the choreography dismally thin and poorly structured , the view of women dispiritingly vapid the concluding ballet , balanchine s brahmsschoenberg quartet , is not satisfying as an overall structure each of the four movements introduces a different set of dancers who are never seen again , and the final rondo alla zingarese , though more flamboyant , is more trivial than the rest \( with suzanne farrell , its original ballerina , i was sometimes persuaded otherwise \) but its sense of where and when the austrohungarian empire , late19thcentury vienna , the hapsburg palace , different aspects of romanticism is part of what makes it extraordinary janie taylor \( second movement \) , though still finding her way back to full strength , seized her role and made it a statement of powerful complexity , admirably supported by jared angle megan fairchild \( third \) , with a surer technique , brought a firm definition to her movements that showed a womanliness this often girlish dancer only sometimes shows abi stafford \( first movement , stylishly supported by philip neal \) was working hard along similar lines , but her lightweight physical tone and personal manner suggest she is as yet out of her depth i find wendy whelan s physique ill suited to the fourth movement \( especially to its headdress \) , but her authority is never in question throughout this ballet how salutary after thou swell balanchine s sense of womanhood proves enthralling he creates a wide range of women , but none of them are inconsequential the ways in which his principal women both need men and at the same time need to be independent of those men take us deep into his theater
john mashey , a selfdescribed ancient unix person who worked at bell labs from 1973 to 1983 , posted some thoughts about how the labs shaped r and d efforts and investment to raise the odds of breakthroughs that could improve society they had a coding system including r2 , d2 that mr mashey describes below update 12 13 mr mashey has clarified in a comment that this was not bell labs coding system , but a shorthand he used in what he wrote here so much for my r2d2 conceit and illustration but it s a cute projector and will stay \) bell labs is important for many reasons it epitomized an era when industry played a big role in bluesky inquiry not surprisingly , steven chu , now tapped as the next secretary of energy , got the idea that led to his shared 1997 nobel prize while having lunch in a bell labs cafeteria those days are long gone \( these days , the energy industry spends a smaller proportion of its revenue on research than the dogfood industry , as nate lewis of caltech says \) some readers may see this as a detour from the core mission of dot earth , but i don t if governments and other public and private institutions don t intensify efforts to stimulate innovation and enterprise \( the exploitation of new ideas \) , particularly in the energy arena , it s hard to see a relatively smooth road toward a decent life on a finite planet for the nine billion people , more or less , who will inhabit it by midcentury here s mr mashey s comment from john mashey 1 \) there s no way we should have a department of innovation  2 \) at least in energy , dr chu has worked at berkeley , stanford , and before that at bell labs none of these are innovation slouches bell labs , once upon a time once upon a time , bell laboratories employed about 25 , 000 people in rd , and was usually considered the premier industrial rd lab in the world it was part of the bell system , when one could say monopoly money is really nice from its creation in 1925 , bell labs generated a few nobel prizes numerous important breakthroughs a truly huge number of incremental improvements modern technology has many other contributors , but an amazing amount of modern computing and communications technologies has some heritage somewhere in bell labs patents , software , or mathematics att and the federal government had a love hate relationship sometimes , and in some cases , the latter actually slowed innovation at the former because it was a afraid a big monopoly would get even stronger i worked there from 19731983 , fortunately mostly within excellent management chains and for many outstanding managers , including one who became cto of bell labs and another who became president bell labs generated many breakthroughs , but these managers always said never schedule breakthroughs why would they say that \?

old mr straight talk has become so shaky a speaker that when he does talk straight , it s startling , john mccain mustered exactly one such moment of clarity senator obama , i am not president bush if you wanted to run against president bush , you should have run four years ago thanks largely to this line , mccain s remaining base in the political press the public , not so much as with the previous debates , barack obama the winner , this time by as much as twotoone ratios obama even swept the in the onceimpregnable mccain bunker of fox news perhaps voters were unimpressed by mccain s big moment because they can figure out the obvious rejoinder why did n't run against president bush four years ago as he had four years before that \? instead mccain campaigned for bush s reelection , cheered for bush policies he once opposed and helped lower himself and america into the pit where we find ourselves today the day after the debate , mccain put up trying yet again to shake the president the last eight years have n't worked very well , have they \? he asks , as if he were an innocent bystander the entire time but no matter what mccain says or does , he still ca n't quit the guy heading from a midtown hotel to a fundraiser the night before facing obama onstage on long island last week , the mccain motorcade of oliver stone s w a black cat would have been a better omen the election is n't over , but there remain only three discernible , if highly unlikely , paths to a mccain victory a theoretically mammoth wave of racism , incessantly anticipated by the press , could materialize in voting booths on nov 4 or newly registered young and black voters could fail to show up or mccain could at long last make good on his most persistent promise follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell and , once there , strangle him with his own bare hands on hannity colmes even republicans are rapidly bailing on a mccain resuscitation it s a metaphor for the party s collapse that on the day of the final debate both and checked into hospitals conservatives have already moved past denial to anger on the kublerross scale of grief they are not waiting for votes to be counted before carrying out their first round of stalinist purges william f buckley s son christopher was for endorsing obama next thing you know , there will be a fatwa on that mccainbashing lefty , george will as the gop s long night of the long knives begins , myths are already setting in among the right s storm troops and the punditocracy alike as to what went wrong and chief among them are the twin curses of bush and the headwinds of the economy no republican can win if the party s incumbent president is less popular than dirt , we keep being told , or if a looming great depression 2 is issue no 1 this is an excuse , not an explanation it absolves mccain of much of the blame and denies obama much of the credit for their campaigns it arouses pity for mccain when he deserves none it rewrites history bush s impact on the next republican presidential candidate did not have to be so devastating mccain is n't , as he and his defenders keep protesting , a passive martyr to a catastrophic administration he could have made separating himself from bush the brave , central and even conservative focus of his campaign far from doing that , he embraced the bush ethos if not the incredible shrinking man himself more tightly than ever the candidate who believes in country first decided to put himself first and sell out his principles that ignoble decision is what accounts for both the mccain campaign s failures and its sleaze it s a decision mccain made on his own and for which he has yet to assume responsibility though it seems a distant memory now , mccain was a maverick once he did defy bush on serious matters including torture , climate change and the overthetop tax cuts that bankrupted a government at war and led to the in america since the 1930s but it is n't just his flipflopping on some of these and other issues that turned him into a bush acolyte the full measure of mccain s betrayal of his own integrity cannot even be found in that senate voting record 90 percent in lockstep with the president that obama  the bushian ethos that mccain embraced , as codified by karl rove , is larger than any particular vote or policy indeed , by definition that ethos is opposed to the entire idea of policy the whole point of the bushrove way of doing business is that principles , coherent governance and even ideology must always be sacrificed for political expediency , no matter the cost to the public good like mccain now , bush campaigned in 2000 as a practical problemsolver who could work across the partisan divide , as he put it in he had no strong views on any domestic or foreign issue , except taxes and education only after he entered the white house did we learn his sole passion getting and keeping power that imperative , not the country , would always come first one journalist who detected this modus operandi early was ron suskind , who , , induced john diiulio , the disillusioned chief of the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives , to tell all there is no precedent in any modern white house for what is going on in this one a complete lack of a policy apparatus , diiulio said what you 've got is everything and i mean everything being run by the political arm it s the reign of the mayberry machiavellis if politics strongarm everything , you end up with the rampant cronyism , nonexistent longterm planning and abrupt , partisan policy improvisations that fed the calamities of iraq , katrina and the economic meltdown incredibly , mccain has nakedly endorsed the bushrove brand of governance in his own campaign by assembling his and to run it they have not only entangled him in a , but they 've furthered cynical political stunts like the elevation of sarah palin at least bush and rove did n't try to put an unqualified hack like , say , alberto gonzales half a heartbeat away from the presidency as if the palin pick were n't damning enough , mccain and his team responded to the financial panic by offering their own panicky simulation of the bush style of crisis management in real time the sec chairman and with andrew cuomo ! a 9 11 commission to save wall street ! do n't aig ! do aig ! reacting to polls and the shortterm dictates of 24hour news cycles , mccain offered as bush offered plans for victory during the first three years of the iraq war now mccain is trying to distract us from his humiliating managerial ineptitude by cranking up the politics of fear another trademark bushrove strategy but the mccain camp s quixotic effort to turn an old washedup terrorist into a wedge issue as divisive as samesex marriage is too little , too late and too tonedeaf at a time when americans are suffering too much to indulge in 1960s culture wars voters want policies that might actually work rather than another pandering , cynical leader who operates mainly on the basis of his gut and political selfinterest the former bush speechwriter david frum has that mccain could be rescued by a 5 , 000point rise in the dow and a 20 percent jump in home prices but the economy , stupid , ca n't be blamed for mccain s own failures , any more than bush can be even before the housing bubble burst and wall street tumbled , voters could see that the seething , impulsive nominee is n't temperamentally fit to be president that s where the debates have come in there may have been none of those knockout blows the press craves , but the accretional effect has been to teach the public that mccain is n't steady enough to run the country even if the economy were sound , and that obama just might be in debate no 1 , you could put the volume on mute and see what has proved to be the lasting impressions of both candidates start to firm up in debate no 2 , mccain set the concrete he reenacted the troubling psychological cartography of his campaign suspension by wandering around the stage like a halfdotty uncle vainly trying to flee his caregiver after the sneering and eyerolling of mccain s best debate on wednesday , cnn s poll found the everserene obama on likeability , 70 to 22 percent at least mccain had half a point on wednesday night when he said , i am not president bush what he has offered his country this year is an older , crankier , more unsteady version of bush tragically , he can no sooner escape our despised president than he can escape himself
michael a cohen is a senior research fellow at the new america foundation and the author of live from the campaign trail the greatest presidential campaign speeches of the 20th century and how they shaped modern america \( \) there is a popular view about presidential campaigns that image and perception , even likability are the crucial variables , with substance usually running a distant second \( the recent vice presidential debate is possibly the quintessential example as sarah palin s connectthetalkingpoints performance was considered by many pundits a success simply because the substantive expectations were so low \) however , the second presidential debate in nashville , tenn , went a long way toward undermining this longheld perspective stylistically , barack obama certainly seemed more comfortable than john mccain , but last night it was on policy ideas and his vision for america where mr obama truly shined , demonstrating in no uncertain terms why he is opening up a commanding lead in public opinion polls and why john mccain has been unable to narrow the gap throughout the debate , mr obama maintained the substantive upper hand constantly tying mr mccain to the toxic image of president bush all the while offering a mix of policy initiatives from a middleclass tax cut and new investments in green technology to tax credits for small businesses that offer health care , increased oversight of wall street and new diplomatic overtures to iran mr obama can still be characterized as light on specifics and like many a changeoriented presidential candidate has a tendency to wallow in generalities but these faults , notwithstanding , he is far better at providing a sense of his priorities and , most important , a vision for where he wants to take the country for the first time in 18 months as a candidate , mr obama truly cast a presidential air john mccain on the other hand fell back on many of the same proposals that have done little to arrest his steady decline from attacks on earmark spending and fears of an obama administrationled tax increase to calls for more offshore drilling and a fuzzy proposal for the treasury department to buy up bad mortgages again , few of them resonated , particularly since mr mccain seems incapable of relating them directly to the pressing concerns of voters no part of the debate better dramatized the divide between the two candidates than a question about the types of sacrifices that should be expected from the american people mr mccain again dwelled on his familiar call for cuts in government spending and earmark reform considering the lovely paean to sacrifice that mr mccain offered in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention it seemed like a missed opportunity mr obama did not make the same mistake he said each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes , in our buildings and one of the things i want to do is make sure that we re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient and that s going to require effort from each and every one of us i think the young people of america are especially interested in how they can serve , and that s one of the reasons why i m interested in doubling the peace corps , making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in the community , involved in military service , so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing america that s something that all of us have to be involved with for some , such proposals may seem meager , but there was freshness to mr obama s answer that stood in stark contrast to mr mccain s rather lifeless generalities one gets the sense that during the last 18 months , mr obama has thought long and hard about the direction he wants to take the country and the policy initiatives that would form the basis of an obama administration mr mccain has not a view that i would imagine even the most hardcore gop partisans would have a hard time disputing yet , none of this should seem terribly surprising throughout his political career , john mccain has never evinced much interest in economic policy issues and it shows in an election like 2000 , where personality dominated , or 2004 , where national security was the top issue , mr mccain would be a formidable candidate , but in today s current economic environment he simply seems lost add in the electorate s exhaustion , even loathing of president bush and the challenge for mr mccain is that much greater for all of mr mccain s efforts to talk about the negative potentialities of an obama administration they ring hollow when compared to the reality of the present administration and its potential continuation voters are far more inclined to embrace change when the status quo appears much worse and this is certainly the case in 2008 but in some respects this is not completely mr mccain s fault he is the leader of a political party that has run out of steam the republican party seems more and more like a spent and rudderless force , devoid of new ideas for how to govern the country , and wedded to its unbending political orthodoxies , of cutting government spending , removing regulation and reducing income taxes indeed , more than one observer noted the contradiction of ms palin on thursday decrying overbearing government while in the next breath calling for more government oversight of wall street on tuesday , mr mccain had similar problems , as he called for a spending freeze right after pledging support for an expensive new program to buy up bad mortgages with a potential 300 billion price tag , mr mccain offered little sense of how he would pay for the plan what has happened to the republican party is not unusual in american politics a similar phenomenon befell democrats in the 1970s and 1980s as they became so tied to their liberal orthodoxies they were unable to shift course and devise policies to respond to the changing needs and desires of middle class america since the failure of the gop s contract with america in 19951996 , the republican party has flirted with political decline in 2000 a smart campaign by george w bush crafted around the notion of compassionate conservatism nabbed the white house but since then the party has moved further and further to the right , out of the mainstream of american political thought , while at the same time democrats , led by mr obama , have reclaimed the political center with new ideas and a palpable energy for moving the country forward the rising fortunes of the democratic party and the precipitous fall of the gop were on full display tuesday night at a time when john mccain needed desperately to find the masterstroke that would allow him to reclaim the initiative from barack obama , he found a gop policy cupboard bereft of ideas there are four weeks until election day , but the route for mr mccain s political revival seems to be increasingly out of his hands perhaps the capture of osama bin laden or even a major terrorist attack could refocus the race on issues favoring republicans , but barring such an unforeseen event , mr mccain will continue to sail against the political winds nothing that happened tuesday night changed the fundamental trajectory of a race that now overwhelmingly favors mr obama indeed the policy divide between the two candidates offers compelling and unmistakable evidence as to why that is the case

kentucky s senior senator , mitch mcconnell , the minority leader , addressed the gathering of the national rifle association earlier today at its convention in louisville \( senator john mccain , and his former gop rivals for the nomination mike huckabee and mitt romney are also attending \) and if you wanted to tease out lines that have not been forgotten and that will most certainly work as a general campaign theme for republicans against senator barack obama , just read this excerpt from senator mcconnell s remarks occasionally those opinions slip out , at cocktail parties in san francisco and new york reporters usually refer to these slips as gaffes or blunders maybe i m old fashioned , but it seems to me a better word for it would be honesty someone who says that americans cling to guns and religion because they re bitter doesn t say it because he misspoke he says it because that s what he really thinks and here s what i think he s dead wrong when i hear that most of the families in this country say grace before meals , i think it s a tribute to america s greatness , not a sign of its weakness and when i hear that about nine out of ten nra members show up to the polls on election day , i don t think it means that gun owners are bitter i think it shows that the spirit of freedom is alive among the millions of members of the nra i voted to put john roberts and sam alito on the supreme court because i thought they d have a deep respect for the words of the constitution and for what the framers intended , including a faithful interpretation of the second amendment hillary clinton and barack obama voted against both of them and obama went even further you might recall that as the vote on judge alito was approaching , john kerry tried to phone in a filibuster from the ski slopes in switzerland senator obama , along with a handful of other farleft liberals , opted to join him it should be no secret what kind of judges obama would like to nominate if he were president and i can guarantee you this none of them would ever be asked to keynote an nra convention since senator barack obama s bitter gunsandreligion remarks were reported , he s reached out to hunters and gun owners recently , while senator hillary rodham clinton touted her childhood learning of how to shoot a gun as she campaigned in pennsylvania and elsewhere to the point that mr obama asked if she d become annie oakley the nra convention is being held in the same state where one of two major primaries will be held next tuesday the louisville courierjournal cites estimates that 60 , 000 to 70 , 000 visitors will be in town for the convention this weekend the ultimate spokesman for the nra , charlton heston , died just a little more than a month ago and a tribute is planned in his honor which brings us to his legendary quote in 2000 from the obituary that appeared in the times paraphrasing an nra bumper sticker \( i ll give you my gun when you take it from my cold , dead hands \) , he waved a replica of a colonial musket above his head and shouted defiantly , from my cold , dead hands !
los angeles the first time the singersongwriter shawn kiehne appeared on national television , he denounced the bush administration s plan to build a wall along the mexican border , boasted that some of his best friends were illegal immigrants and declared his unequivocal love for the mexican people none of which would normally raise an eyebrow on don francisco presenta , a toprated weekly talk show on univision , the nation s mostwatched spanishlanguage network but mr kiehne \( pronounced keenee \) , who donned a black cowboy hat and rangeworn jeans crowned by an impressive silver buckle , is not your average mexican performer in fact , he is not mexican at all , but a white southwestern country boy of german stock who calls himself el gringo , a name that s as much a reference to his american birth certificate as it is his lessthanbrown skin with the mexican population of the united states on a steady rise \( according to a 2006 census survey , people of mexican origin make up nearly 10 percent of the country \) , mr kiehne might just turn out to be the face of a gradual shift in mainstream cultural taste mr kiehne , 32 , was invited on don francisco presenta to perform el corrido del gringo , a sweeping autobiographical song that explains how he went from being a middleclass rancher s son from los lunas , nm , to raising three bilingual children with his mexican wife , recording an allspanish cd , algo sucedi \( univision records \) and spending his nights singing about cantinas , ranchos and se oritas to mexican and mexicanamerican audiences across the country people always ask me how i became el gringo , mr kiehne said between bites of tacos during a recent trip to los angeles \( in honor of his surroundings , he traded his usual cowboy hat for a dodgers cap \) i wrote that song because i wanted to tell them about what i believed in i am not some manufactured record label idea this is music that i love this is a culture that i love this is me in the song , awash in the accordions and bajo sextos \( 12string bass guitars \) of mexican norte o music , mr kiehne tells his mexican listeners that he was born on the other side of the river , where he learned to love mexican music working alongside mexicans on a texas ranch but in its final minute he switches to a bold crosscultural political commentary i respect immigrants and of this i'm sure we need to be good neighbors and not build a wall to my illegal friends who live in the us as a gringo i want to tell you to keep dreaming and fighting this country needs your effort and your work when he sang the lines on don francisco presenta , the studio audience erupted in hollers and applause just like that , mr kiehne went from being a potential novelty act to being the real deal a gringo who not only chooses to sing in spanish , but is also willing to fight for the other side we ca n't control political borders , but we can control social borders , said toby sandoval , a veteran mexican composer and arranger who has worked with paulina rubio and pedro fernandez and is now helping write songs for mr kiehne s second release that s where shawn comes in as immigrants it s our responsibility to absorb this country with open arms but for a native of this country to open his arms to us , to mexico you have to respect that in the history of regional mexican music the clunky catchall for traditional styles ranging from folkloric rancheras to the honking brass of banda sinaloense there s never been a figure quite like mr kiehne while white artists like joe ely and doug sahm have infiltrated the world of texmex music and nearly every generation of africanamerican music has inspired its own cadre of white imitators , regional mexican has been hermetically sealed from outsiders it s just not normal for a gringo to be so interested in regional mexican , mr sandoval said you see it with hiphop all the time , or in world music when white artists go to africa or asia to discover themselves but it just does n't happen with mexican music the music s almost entirely spanish lyrics , its roots in rural workingclass mexico and its centurylong association with migrant labor and accompanying waves of immigrant nostalgia have kept the music in both a commercial and social vacuum factor in heated political debates over immigration policy and xenophobia , and you have one of the few genres left that seem immune to hipster trend spotting and crossover marketing campaigns regional mexican is a very jealous genre , said pepe garza , program director at la que buena , 1055 fm , los angeles s top regional mexican station it s like country if you 're not from nashville , you 're not legit you have to have the right credentials to play mexican music it has very complicated emotions and politics , and it s not easy for someone who did n't grow up with that to be able to fit right in which is why mr garza is skeptical that el gringo will spawn a legion of mainstream disciples from a marketing perspective , el gringo is perfect , because he has no competition mr kiehne s interest in mexican music began in high school he worked summers at rancho cornudas , a cattle ranch owned by his family just outside el paso he herded cattle and roped steers alongside the seasonal mexican laborers who had come north from chihuahua and durango , most of them without papers i learned to see the world through the eyes of those vaqueros , said mr kiehne , who also spent a college semester living in culiac n , sinaloa , a central hub of banda music , where he met his wife if i had five kids and could n't support them in mexico , i would do the same thing that they are doing here they were , thousands of miles from their families , sending money home , only talking to their wife and kids on sundays , only seeing them two or three weeks a year for christmas , and they never talked about being tired anyone who leaves their homeland to come here and look for a better life and work that hard should be admired , not criticized on the ranch mr kiehne received a crash course in immigrant culture his fellow workers taught him spanish and clued him into the secrets of mexican soap operas and game shows despite his prior allegiance to the country music of george strait and marty robbins , they got him hooked on la puerta negra , an influential 1980s norte o hit by los tigres del norte on weekends he was invited along to the big saturdaynight mexican bailes , or dances , across the border in juarez that s where i really got exposed to the heart of the mexican music scene , he said soon i realized that i really loved the music at first i was still quickly turning the dial to a country station but once i started to understand the songs , the music started to grow on me , and now it s all i listen to in 2003 after leading a string of local country bands in new mexico , mr kiehne began to write and sing his own songs in spanish , performing around albuquerque to mexican and mexicanamerican audiences the reception was 100 percent positive , he said people were amazed that when i sang , i did n't really have an accent they were like , are you really a gringo \? ' the initial idea was to perform using the name he earned down on the ranch shawnito but his mexican brotherinlaw convinced him otherwise he told me , man , you should be the eminem of mexican music , ' said mr kiehne 'do n't call yourself by your name call yourself el gringo people will see it on the marquee and say , we have to go see what this guy is up to' i trademarked the name before i even had any songs after winning second prize in the 2005 el gigante de ma ana contest \( univision s take on american idol \) , mr kiehne used earnings from his day job selling real estate to put out algo sucedi , his debut album as el gringo \( it has since been released through univision records with a bonus duet between mr kiehne and the regional mexican star jenni rivera \) while the original album sold 3 , 000 copies , the majorlabel version has sold nearly 10 times that , a morethanrespectable number for a regional mexican debut of the album s 12 songs mr kiehne wrote five , including his spanish makeovers of two favorite country songs , rodney crowell s making memories of us and toby keith s i love this bar my voice is a country voice , and i grew up on country music , so i could n't really hide that , said mr kiehne , who hopes to model his future sound after intocable , a leading regional mexican band that mixes norte o with rock and country for now mr kiehne is busy roadtesting el gringo , opening for intocable on its current american tour and going it solo in mostly small mexican bars , nightclubs and radio festivals throughout the country , often in cities that a decade ago would never have been on a norte o act s itinerary there are mexicans everywhere now , he said i'm playing in iowa , arkansas , kansas city , minneapolis and kentucky in these places , deep in middle america , the shows are packed , and it s all mexicans davenport , iowa \? there are mexicans in davenport , iowa \? if the latino population triples by 2050 , as a recent study by the pew hispanic center predicts , it wo n't be just mexicans listening to music like norte o in davenport , mr kiehne says bands like intocable and los tigres del norte will soon be as widely recognized as ricky martin and enrique iglesias there are plenty of anglos in this country who like mexicans and like mexican culture , said mr garza of la que buena there are almost a million anglos who even live in mexico because they love it so much el gringo represents this population he can be their voice it s a role that mr kiehne is proud to embrace ricky martin helped make it ok for white americans of my generation to like latin music , he said i want to do the same thing for norte o i want it to appeal to mainstream white america while staying true to the mexican sound a year ago my friends and family would never have gone out to buy an intocable cd , he added now they do i 'd like to think this is just the beginning
washington one of the first images primetime viewers will see of the next week is that of , who will begin the fourday introduction of her husband , and her family , on her terms like everything else at the orchestrated gala , that is by design democrats face a number of imperatives at their convention , none trickier than making more voters comfortable with the prospect of putting a candidate with a most unusual background the son of a black kenyan father and a white kansan mother , who grew up in hawaii and indonesia and his family in the white house no one , his advisers believe , makes the case better for senator of illinois than his wife , who will expand her profile by delivering one of the marquee speeches carried by television networks through four nights there will be testimonials from family members like mr obama s wife and sister who will tell his very american story , in the words of one adviser , and from party luminaries like senator edward m kennedy \( by videotape \) and former president bill clinton \( live \) who will give mr obama , the presumptive presidential nominee , the imprimatur of the party establishment at the convention beginning next monday in denver , there will be appearances by lesser known americans from all walks of life , from across the country speaking about their support for mr obama combined with a film featuring the candidate in allamerican scenes by davis guggenheim the director of an inconvenient truth whose father produced a similar biographical film for robert f kennedy aides to mr obama are using the convention to tackle what members of both parties see as his greatest vulnerability with undecided voters his otherness the introduction of a candidate is a task facing every presidential campaign , but one that carries unique challenges for mr obama because of his race and questions about his patriotism , values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit mr obama comes into the convention effectively a fournight miniseries before an audience of 20 million people or more with many of the same objectives any democrat would have in an age of global terrorism and economic hardship the need to make voters see him as a potential commander in chief and a responsible steward of the economy his aides said in interviews that perhaps the most important goal of the entire program is to define the election on the obama campaign s terms change versus more of the same from here until election day , with the second night of the convention being heavily devoted to contrasts between mr obama and senator john mccain of arizona , the presumptive republican nominee the goal of the party convention is that people leave with a clear idea of what the choices are between the two candidates and two political parties , said anita dunn , a senior strategist for mr obama but central to that choice are the candidates' backgrounds mr obama s life story , combined with his race and foreignsounding name , adds challenges no presidential nominee from a major party has quite faced before i'm asking a lot of the american people , and i know that , mr obama said in an interview last month , acknowledging that his burden to win over many voters was greater because he is black my biography is not typical of a modern american president ms dunn said a core goal of the opening night program would be to stress his american journey to get to this place , emphasizing that from his background , he has a deep understanding of what american families face with republicans pressing questions about his religious background , party planners will inaugurate the convention with an interfaith gathering of clergy with continued email attacks seeking to make hay out of mr obama s biography , the convention will include regular references to shared values with a potential first family that would look different from any that has come before it people familiar with the convention planning say those references will be front and center , beginning with the opening speech by mrs obama , in an effort to capitalize on what one strategist called mr obama s prototypical nuclear family opening up , it says , we will be your first family , and this is what we represent , ' said representative elijah e cummings , democrat of maryland and the cochairman of mr obama s campaign in that state basically what she is doing is saying we are the american story americans say get an education , give every single thing you do your best we 've done that , and now we 're ready to be a part of fulfilling martin luther king s dream' campaign aides and outside advisers , however , have grappled with how far convention speakers , including the candidate himself , should go in explicitly addressing race and the historic nature of his candidacy , particularly as mr obama accepts the nomination on the 45th anniversary of the rev dr martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech they are seeking some intimacy amid the grandiosity of mr obama s acceptance speech in the invesco field stadium before an audience of more than 70 , 000 , the sort of cheering throng mr mccain s aides have sought to use against mr obama by portraying him as presiding over a cult of personality when he delivers his speech on the last night of the convention , mr obama will not be addressing the crowd from a lone lectern at the edge of the field he will be standing at the 50yard line , surrounded by a diverse set of people he has met throughout the campaign , whose presence is intended to signal to viewers at home that people like them are ok with mr obama ten people selected by the campaign from all corners of the country will meet backstage with mr obama and be shown to the television audience , also intended to convey their comfort level with the senator by then , the convention program will probably have already established his maternal grandfather s roots in kansas and service in world war ii the film by mr guggenheim is expected to be steeped in americana parts of it were filmed while mr obama was campaigning in the rockwellesque town of butte , mont coming immediately after mr obama announces his vicepresidential nominee , the convention will give mr obama one of his biggest stages and television audiences of the year \( mr mccain has indicated his intention to run television advertisements during the coverage , and mr mccain is expected to appear on tonight with jay leno on nbc monday night \) there are two overriding strategic imperatives for the convention one is to make people comfortable with barack obama , said mark mellman , a democratic pollster who served as a top strategist for senator john kerry s presidential race in 2004 the other is to define the race clearly and define barack obama as change and mccain as a continuation of bush s policies at home and abroad ms dunn , the strategist for mr obama , said that would be accomplished by emphasizing the course of the country over the last eight years , the gridlock , and what that has meant for american families , and the specifics of where mr obama wants to lead to the country but , aides say , another important task is uniting the party after a bruising primary between mr obama , the potential first africanamerican nominee , and senator hillary rodham clinton of new york , the potential first female nominee women speaking at the convention include mrs clinton , speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator claire mccaskill of missouri none of this is to leave out mr obama s solid base of enthusiastic supporters advisers to mr obama said the gathering was built around specific tasks aimed at capitalizing on their excitement for instance , when people arrive at the stadium in the hours leading up to mr obama s acceptance speech , they will be urged to call or send text messages to their friends and neighbors back home , sharing proobama messages or asking them to watch the speech the idea is to turn the football stadium into a giant phone bank we always look for opportunities to put our people to work and not just have them sit idle and listen to speeches , said steve hildebrand , the deputy campaign manager
n mes , france mark cavendish looks simply unbeatable cavendish , a 23yearold sprinter who rides for team columbia , collected his fourth stage victory of the 95th on friday , pulling away for the second day in a row to win by several bike lengths when cavendish opens up his sprint in the final 200 yards , other riders can look as if they are standing still on thursday , during the sprint finish into narbonne , he rounded the final corner , roughly a halfmile from the finish , with at least 20 riders in front of him no matter he simply put his bike into a gear beyond what any other rider has demonstrated on this tour and swept past them all on friday , although he started a little nearer to the front and was forced to jump into high gear sooner than he would have liked , he won easily again it s unfortunate for the other guys i have to do this , cavendish said , somewhat sheepishly , when asked if he realized how his domination of the peloton must make the other sprint specialists feel i'm just doing my job , and trying to pay back my team for all the hard work they 've done , he added at the end of the day , i have four wins but i'm still not in the green jersey that shows that other guys have been more consistent than i am scar freire of rabobank finished fifth for the second consecutive day , but he held on to the green jersey , which is awarded to the rider with the most points he has 184 points are awarded at finishes and at intermediate sprint points along each day s route cavendish is now tied for second in the race for the green jersey with thor hushovd of cr dit agricole , at 156 points cavendish won the relatively flat , 1131mile run from narbonne to n mes in 4 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds , for an average speed of 255 miles per hour that was 3 mph slower than thursday s stage cadel evans , who received the race leader s yellow jersey for the fourth straight day , said he thought everyone is a little bit tired heading into this part of the tour , perhaps accounting for the somewhat slower pace evans , of the silencelotto team , held a onesecond lead over frank schleck of team csc saxo bank and was 38 seconds ahead of christian vande velde of garmin chipotle after each of his four stage victories , cavendish has been subjected to screenings for performanceenhancing drugs he was also tested before the start of the race , along with all the riders in the tour his team , columbia , closely monitors its riders' biological levels and subjects them to unannounced bloodscreening tests throughout the year cavendish has a chance for one more sprint victory , on the champs lys es in paris in the tour s final stage if , that is , he can make it over the alps , into italy and back , without finishing a stage outside the time limit on saturday , the race heads into the foothills of the alps with a 1209mile stage to dignelesbains although the stage is almost all uphill , none of the individual peaks rate higher than a category 4 climb , the lowestrated climb in length and difficulty the stage sunday is among three remaining that are likely to have the greatest effect on the contenders for the overall tour victory it climbs over col agnel , a pass rated beyond category for its 127mile length at an average steepness of 66 percent from the top of that climb , where the riders will pass into italy , they will travel more than 70 miles before climbing to the finish at prato nevoso , possibly the most difficult finish on the tour this year it is even more difficult than the fearsome finish at alpe d'huez in stage 17 the climb of prato nevoso lasts 71 miles at an average pitch of 69 percent and is rated a category 1 climb , not as difficult as alpe d'huez s beyond category rating but on alpe d'huez , the toughest parts are at the bottom of the hill , with many top portions being relatively flat on prato nevoso , the climb finishes with nearly two miles of road at a slope of 75 percent to 8 percent , and almost no flat spots after prato nevoso and alpe d'huez , the last chance for riders hoping to shake up the standings comes july 26 , with the final time trial evans is widely expected to remain the favorite for the overall victory , unless a rider enters the time trial with a healthy lead over him the saunier duvalscott team , which withdrew from the tour on thursday after its top rider , riccardo ricc , failed a drug test , announced that it had fired ricc and leonardo piepoli , the winner of the tough mountain stage that ended monday at hautacam the team said it fired piepoli for violation of the team s ethics code , but it did not elaborate
people should stop picking on vicepresidential nominee sarah palin because she hired a high school classmate to oversee the state agriculture division , a woman who said she was qualified for the job because she liked cows when she was a kid and they should lay off the governor for choosing another childhood friend to oversee a failing staterun dairy , allowing the sovietstyle business to ding taxpayers for 800 , 000 in additional losses what these critics don t understand is that crony capitalism is how things are done in alaska they reward failure in the last frontier state in that sense , it s not unlike like wall street s treatment of ceo s who run companies into the ground look at carly fiorina , john mccain s top economic surrogate if you can find her this week , after the news and her narrative fused in a negative way dismissed as head of hewlettpackard after the company s stock plunged and nearly 20 , 000 workers were let go , she was rewarded with 44 million in compensation sweet ! thank god mccain wants to appoint a commission to study the practice that enriched his chief economic adviser on the campaign trail this week , mccain and palin pledged to stop multimillion dollar payouts to ceo s of failed companies good go talk to fiorina at your next strategy session palin s alaska is a cultural cousin to this kind of capitalism the state may seem like a rugged arena for risky freemarketers in truth , it s a strange mix of socialized projects and whoyouknow hiring practices let s start with those cows a few years ago , i met harvey baskin , one of the last of alaska s taxpayersubsidized dairy farmers , at his farm outside anchorage the state had spent more than 120 million to create farms where none existed before the epic project was a miserable failure you want to know how to lose money in a hurry \? harvey told me , while kicking rockhard clumps of frozen manure become a farmer with the state of alaska as your partner this is what you call negative farming that lesson was lost on palin as the wall street journal reported this week , governor palin overturned a decision to shutter a moneylosing , staterun creamery matanuska maid when her friends in wasilla complained about losing their subsidies she fired the board that recommended closure , and replaced it with one run by a childhood friend after six months , and nearly 1 million in fresh losses , the board came to the same conclusion as the earlier one matanuska maid could not operate without being a perpetual burden on the taxpayers this is heckuvajobbrownie government , far north version on a larger scale , consider the proposal to build a 1 , 715mile natural gas pipeline , which palin touts as one of her most significant achievements private companies complained they couldn t build it without government help that s where palin came to the rescue , ensuring that the state would back the project to the tune of 500 million and let s not talk about voodoo infrastructure without one more mention of the bridge that palin has yet to tell the truth about the plan was to get american taxpayers to pay for a span that would be 80 feet higher than the brooklyn bridge , and about 20 feet short of the golden gate all to serve a tiny airport with a halfdozen or so flights a day and a perfectly good fiveminute ferry until it was laughed out of congress , palin backed it big time , as the current vice president would say why build it \? because it s alaska , where people are used to paying no state taxes and getting the rest of us to buck up for things they can t afford alaska , where the first thing a visitor sees upon landing in anchorage is the sign welcoming you to ted stevens international airport stevens , of course , is the 84yearold republican senator indicted on multiple felony charges he may still win reelection thanks to palin s popularity at the top of the ballot alaskans will get 231 per person in federal earmarks 10 times more than people in barack obama s home state that s this year , with palin as governor if palin were a true reformer , she would tell congress thanks , but no thanks to that other bridge to nowhere yes , there is another one a proposal to connect anchorage to an empty peninsula , speeding the commute to palin s hometown by a few minutes it could cost up to 2 billion the official name is don young s way , after the congressman who got the federal bridge earmarks of late , he s spent more 1 million in legal fees fending off corruption investigations oh , and young s soninlaw has a stake in the property at one end of the bridge some of these projects might be fully explained should palin ever open herself up to questions this week she sat down for her second interview with sean hannity of fox , who has shown sufficient deference to palin , as the campaign requested one question when palin says government has got to get out of the way of the private sector , as she proclaimed this week , does that apply to dairy farms , bridges and gas pipelines in her state \? i didn t think so

professional anywhere he recently joined a country club and has taken up golf but unlike anywhere else , this executive has to keep his eyes peeled on the daily commute for stonethrowing mobs when he gets home after a long day , he has to explain to his daughters why people from different ethnic groups are hacking one another to death even his own affluent neighborhood has been affected some of the mbuguas' neighbors recently fled their fivebedroom homes because of the violence that has exploded in kenya since a disputed election in december turned this promising african country upside down nobody s untouched , mr mbugua said of all the electionrelated conflicts that have cracked open in kenya luos versus kikuyus \( two big ethnic groups \) , the orange democratic movement versus the party of national unity \( the leading political parties \) , police versus protesters none may be more crucial than the struggle between those who seem to have nothing to lose , like the mobs in the slums who burn down their own neighborhoods , and those who are deeply invested in this country s stability the wellestablished middle class here is thought to be one of the most important factors that separate kenya from other african countries that have been consumed by ethnic conflict millions of kenyans identify as much with what they do or where they went to college as who their ancestors are they have overcome ethnic differences , dating between groups and sometimes intermarrying , living in mixed neighborhoods , and sending their children to the best schools they can afford , regardless of who else goes there the fighting that rages in the countryside , where men with mudsmeared faces and makeshift weapons are hunting down people of other ethnicities , seems as foreign to many of these whitecollar kenyans as it might to people living thousands of miles away but the professionals are hardly retreating three times a week , a group of doctors , lawyers , former politicians , writers , wildlife experts , business consultants and professors meet in a conference room at the serena hotel in nairobi , the capital they call themselves concerned citizens for peace , and they have taken up projects such as raising money for displaced people , organizing candlelight vigils and bending the ear of secretary general ban kimoon of the united nations , who met with business leaders during his emergency trip to kenya this month the group begins each session by standing up , holding hands and singing the national anthem mr mbugua spoke the other day at one of those meetings about the importance of reconciliation in the workplace his idea was to keep local languages , which many kenyans speak in addition to the country s official languages \( english and kiswahili \) , away from the water cooler we do n't want people to feel excluded when they 're at work , he said bethuel kiplagat , a retired ambassador , praised the meeting s openness we must put everything down on the table , he said , however painful it is many african countries are all about haves versus havenots , with millions of people toiling in the fields , barely surviving , while a tiny elite holds all the wealth kenya is different james shikwati , a kenyan economist , estimates that of kenya s population of approximately 37 million , about four million are in the middle class , making between 2 , 500 and 40 , 000 a year the number of kenyans enrolled in college has more than doubled in the past 10 years , to more than 100 , 000 there are sizable fortunes in the hands of people of all ethnic backgrounds , said richard leakey , the noted kenyan paleontologist i think the middle class will ultimately prevail on the government authority in one form or the other to just pull itself together and get on with business business is hurting vigilante roadblocks have paralyzed the flow of goods across the country vandals have ripped up miles of railroad tracks tourists have bolted from the game parks faster than the antelope in them the estimated losses are now running into the billions of dollars fanis anne nyangayi just started her own marketing company in nairobi , and she has already had to lay off staff because nobody wants to commit to marketing plans everything s on hold , she said to her , the ethnic clashes that continue to flare in the rift valley , less than 100 miles away , are disturbing and hard to understand the disputed election , in which president mwai kibaki was declared the winner despite widespread evidence of vote rigging , uncorked decades of frustrations about land , political power and economic inequalities many kenyans tend to vote along ethnic lines , and much of the violence since the election has taken on an ethnic cast , with members of groups that tend to support the opposition fighting against members of groups that have backed the president more than 1 , 000 people have been killed but ethnic identity issues are more complicated in the city ms nyangayi , 36 , said she did not know she was a member of the luhya ethnic group until she was 10 years old she was born in lamu , on the kenyan coast , moved to mombasa , a port town , and lived in nairobi and kisumu , in the far western part of kenya i ca n't even speak luhya , a shortcoming that is sometimes viewed as snobby , she said it s not that i think i'm above being a luhya , she explained i'm proud of being a luhya it s just that we moved around a lot as a kid , and i missed the bus somewhere wambua kilonzo is a lawyer , and he broke with his ethnic group , the kamba , to vote for raila odinga , the top opposition leader who is a luo many kambas voted for another candidate , kalonzo musyoka , who is now vice president to me , it was more about the issues , mr kilonzo said , pointing to mr odinga s vow to fight corruption and restructure the government mr kilonzo s emerging law practice has been hurt by the election fallout one of his top clients is the owner of a highpriced safari lodge that until recently had celebrities flying in on a regular basis the resort is now a luxurious ghost town , and mr kilonzo , 31 , does n't feel right adding to the owner s burdens how can i take money from my client when his business is like this \? he said mumo kituku is a 31yearold dentist in a clinic near a slum he pulls teeth for the equivalent of 5 and gets a cut of the clinic s profits depending on how many patients he serves but the clinic is near kibera , one of nairobi s more volatile neighborhoods , and in the past month , some of his patients have been afraid to venture out of their homes , reducing his workload and his income it s been rough , man , he said it is issues like those that have pushed business leaders into action they have struggled to be heard , with the young men sharpening machetes grabbing more headlines than the executives' quiet efforts to wage peace but the whitecollar profile has risen in the past few weeks executives from multinational and local companies recently met with mr kibaki and mr odinga to stress the economic toll that is accruing while the top politicians continue to posture and the fighting between their supporters rages on some businesses have taken out advertisements in the local newspapers urging peace kenya , read a message from a bank on monday , our unity is our pride some kenyan journalists have complained that the middle class is not doing enough they have been lulled by a false sense of security they have enjoyed sheltered in their homes and clubs , wrote tom mshindi , a columnist for the saturday nation that said , business leaders have organized reconciliation workshops and gone back to their companies with plans of action people like mr mbugua do not want to see their dreams disappear he wants to establish a financial planning organization in kenya and travel the world all my life i 've wanted to go to hawaii , he said is there ice there \? and what about deer hunting in alaska \? what s that like \?
5 a fairly sleepy afternoon in college football none of the ranked teams that lost could really be considered upsets the only ranked teams that fell to unranked teams no 18 north carolina at virginia and no 21 wake forest at maryland were hardly surprising can we just assume now that every team in the acc is bad \? oh , wait , we did that a long time ago 4 a tip of the hat to northwestern , which thumped purdue , 4826 northwestern now has six victories , which would make it bowl eligible who would have thought that could happen this season \? especially well before halloween 3 add another lowlight to the syracuse season in south florida s 4513 victory over the orange , the orange simply left bulls wide receiver aj love uncovered on his 2yard touchdown pass he lined up on the right side , and no defensive back covered him a fitting image for the waning days of the greg robinson era equally inept was the syracuse offense , which went without a first down in the second half you have to wonder if syracuse will follow clemson s lead in the next few weeks and fire robinson to start their coaching search 2 the orange isn t the worst team among bcs conferences that would be washington state , which has already had an open campus tryout for a scout team quarterback usc beat the cougars , 690 , on saturday , with mark sanchez throwing five touchdowns in the first half yikes 1 you can t kill ohio state they returned to the national scene with a vengeance against michigan state , thumping sparty , 457 beanie wells ran the ball 31 times for 140 yards and terrelle pryor threw a touchdown and ran for another , as he appears to be settling in to his starting role
hempstead , ny a day after emerged as a possible partner in the retiredunretired dance , the training camp buzz at team headquarters went from intense speculation to almost none at all on friday , reporters posed dozens of favrerelated questions to jets coach eric mangini on saturday , he answered 10 queries before hearing one about favre i thought we covered when we did carroll , mangini said , referring to ahmad carroll , the former packers firstround draft pick who signed with the jets this offseason after spending a season in the arena football league is there anything you can say that you did n't say yesterday \? someone said no , mangini replied promptly espn reported friday that the team had received permission to talk with favre mangini , who said he spoke with general manager mike tannenbaum every night about how available players would fit on the jets' roster , did not confirm or deny his team s possible interest in favre mike s a combination guy , mangini said he likes to talk different combinations we still keep those internal their discussions may be internal , but fan reaction at the morning practice saturday was public one fan held up a sign that referred to the jets' owner , woody johnson on one side , it asked johnson to cut the check , make it happen and on the other chad , we love you , but we need brett favre chad is chad pennington , the starting quarterback at the beginning of last season , who is now competing with kellen clemens for the job during a break in practice , fans yelled loud enough for pennington to hear some said they wanted favre others shouted things like , we 're with you , chad ! after which he raised his right arm toward the sky neither favre nor the packers nor the jets have commented on the possibility of his moving to new york but his presence was felt , although favre had not petitioned the nfl for reinstatement , the first step necessary for him to come out of retirement at a news conference in green bay , coach mike mccarthy said he did not know whether favre would show up sunday , when the packers open training camp nothing has been confirmed with me through the organization or the league office , he said mccarthy reaffirmed the team s commitment to quarterback aaron rodgers aaron rodgers is the starting quarterback for the green bay packers , mccarthy said that s been stated over and over again i hope we can finally understand that even when discussing the three interceptions thrown by clemens in the first four practices , favre came up for mangini was clemens pressing because of the speculation \? mangini did not directly answer the question and with that , life at jets training camp went back to normal at least on saturday extra points danny woodhead , the ncaa s career rushing leader from chadron \( neb \) state and a fan favorite , was helped off the field after injuring a knee friday the jets said he was placed on the waived injured list , which means any team , including the jets , is free to sign him
a comment from rinat , russian hockey fan came in this morning saying , greetings , guys ! how at you ordinary fans concern to transition to ufa \? which we took to mean , , ! what do ordinary fans think of alex radulov s move to ufa in the russian khl \? it s a good question and please feel free to tell rinat your thoughts either on that post or this one below in the comments section over at yahoo s puck daddy blog this morning , our friend greg wyshynski , the hardest working man in show business since james brown \( or maybe ron jeremy \) , wonders if the predators are being way too soft on radulov he read , as we did , today s story in the tennessean in which john glennon has some questions of his own would radulov s coaches , teammates and fans forgive him for trying to skip out on the final year of his contract in order to play in russia , or would they embrace the return of one of the league s top young offensive talents \? so glennon asked preds captain \( and exdevil \) jason arnott and coach barry trotz , who answered that they do want him to return to the preds , but they are aware he might be carrying some baggage to wit arnott when you back out on your deal and you let your teammates and the whole organization down like that , it s hard to swallow no question i can t sugarcoat it any better it s disappointing but if he does come back and play with us , hopefully he comes back with a good mind and be ready to play if he does that , i think guys will forget about it if he comes back with the attitude that it s his last year here and he doesn t really care , then it s going to be a long year it s going to be tough trotz hopefully he comes back and plays hard i expect him to be a pro and play hard if it s a case where he s unhappy , then we ll cross that bridge when we get to it i think alex is just a young man that gets easily influenced he is still maturing and he doesn t have a lot of patience he bounces from one thing to the next someone told him this is the best thing he could ever do and then he ll find out it s not and we ll go from there and arnott concluded by saying , we definitely need him he s a talented young guy and he could do wonders for our team to lose a goalscorer like that would be a real blow to our team , especially now that s all a bit too desperate for greg \( who also pities the preds for their dealings with boots del baggio , subject of this david climer story from today s tennessean , but we won t go there right now \) ever notice you can t see a visible backbone in the predators logo \? he asks look , i know goalscoring is at a premium and radulov has plenty of upside but just so we re clear he walked out on his contract greg s boldface , not ours to think that some statistic act of contrition will erase that fact from the memory banks is appalling and embarrassing for the predators do you think the red wings would put up with this \? how about lou lamoriello \? and greg thinks the preds should trade radulov s behind \( and the rest of him , we assume \) to some deep dark hockey outpost well , yeah , greg , uncle lou has in fact put up with it not always , but these things sorta depend on the player , the team , the time of the season , the time of year , the time of man , and probably some other considerations of which none of us are aware let s get into the wayback machine \( here we are dressed as sherman and mr peabody , walking in and here we are , inside \) and let s set it for way back in 1991  it s training camp and the devils have a mountain of problems they ve been awarded the blues tough defenseman scott stevens by judge edward houston of the ontario court of justice as compensation for st louis free agent signing of brendan shanahan \( that s how things were done back then \) scott played in the canada cup and lamoriello had stated several times that he expected stevens to report to the devils upon the tourney s conclusion now here s richard bennett , stevens s attorney , on the phone let s listen in to what he s saying scott s intention is to stay in st louis st louis is where he plans to finish his career and stevens flies home to ladue , mo , to be with his wife and kids while a mysterious source over in the corner is whispering it would be better for lou to trade stevens to another team oh , and what do you know \? here s ken daneyko , another large defenseman who isn t coming to training camp he s holding out because he s insulted since lou offered him a measly 10 , 000 raise to his 190 , 000 contract , which is in his option year and the devils captain , of all people , kirk muller , has walked out of training camp as well he s also going into the option year of his 325 , 000 contract , and wants 850 , 000 a year or to be sent to another team in fact , a whole bunch of devils are unhappy with their deals , but it s getting kind of hostile here , so let s jump back into the machine and return to 2008 , or a reasonable facsimile thereof well , you know how things turned out lou didn t deal stevens or run daneyko out of organized hockey he did trade muller to montreal by the end of the month , where he became a key part of the habs 1993 stanley cup team but both stevens s no 4 and daneyko s no 3 are hanging in the rafters at the rock and each have three gaudy cup rings to show for uncle lou s understanding lou s got rings , too the red wings , well , it would take too long to detail all the meshugass they put up with from sergei fedorov , when he was the best player on earth \( tm \) , what with his lengthy holdout after detroit won the 1997 cup \( he returned for the final 21 games of the 199798 season only after carolina submitted an rfa offer sheet , but all was forgiven \) and his brokenhearted behavior concerning his wife \( not wife \) anna kournikova and let s throw down another team with a reputation for tough dealing with rebellious players , le club de hockey canadien , whose goaltender ken dryden was so unhappy with the contract offer he got after the habs won the 73 cup that he sat out a whole season montreal welcomed him back and over the next five seasons , he backstopped them to four more cup championships that s just a few examples off the top of our balding head so some guys merit a bit more leniency than others \( muller was expendable for lou and it was a good choice for both sides the devils got stephane richer and tom chorske in return \) , and the preds have their reasons , too is radulov the sort of impact player these others were \? not yet , and maybe not ever but he s got something else going for him , and that s the crucial role he s playing in the most important moment the nhl has had in its international relations in recent memory he s a player under contract jumping to a team in a suddenly vigorous and aggressive league which has rallied other leagues in europe to press for an overhaul of the transfer and compensation system between the nhl and the members of the iihf and while everyone has said they ll respect players under contract , that does not seem to be happening in this case so there s a lot riding on what happens with radulov , and the most sensitive sort of diplomacy must come into play here nashville is doing its part by saying all the right things and not inflaming the situation and , yes , as glennon wrote , radulov has been a hungry , enthusiastic wing who notched 44 goals in his first two seasons so the predators would be quite happy if he would honor his professional commitment and return to them can detroit repeat \? this one took a while to find us , but this guy is always worth the time scotty bowman , who coached both dryden and fedorov in those turbulent moments , was in england last week for britain s first professional coaches clinic , which was run by paul thompson , britain s most successful domestic hockey coach and coach of their national team \( and while the brits are not the international hockey power they were prior to wwii , under thompson that national team has improved in the world rankings and has qualified for the 2012 olympic prequalification tournaments \) bowman spoke with stuart walker of the press association \( a top wire service \) about the difficulty of winning championships back to back in the nhl and the story was picked up by the web site sportinglifecom  backtoback is tough to win now because you have to retain your players and it s tougher to retain them , bowman said you also have the motivation factor so you have to keep adding to your roster a lot depends if you can add to your team in detroit this year we will have two or three new guys it s hard to keep that hunger going but it s all about motivation montreal was a little different in my day because of the expectation of the team the fans are fanatics i come from there and living in the offseason after a winning season is a lot of fun but after a losing season it is not as easy and you can t wait to get going again tradition is a big factor , we got a lot of young players at the same time and they grew up together the best dynasties , montreal in the 50s and 70s , then new york islanders who won it four years in a row and edmonton in the 1980s , did this and it is hard to beat it is not as easy when you are dealing with a team which has won the year before you have to come up with some innovations because it is a new season and new talent comes into the league it s not always the oddson favorite who wins , it changes these are not new observations by bowman , but clearly the red wings , for whom he consults , have followed that track , building a young core of players who are growing together , not losing them this offseason and adding a few pieces like marian hossa and ty conklin , who are most likely hungry after reaching the final and falling short with pittsburgh hossa you likely know about , conklin a bit less so here s a recent post by seth rorabaugh on the pittsburgh postdispatch empty netters blog on the goaltender who saved the penguins season as for the rest of the wings motivation , that s up to the team s internal leadership and coach mike babcock feet don t fail me now peter forsberg says he believes doctors have finally finally ! figured out what has been ailing him for five years he told the swedish paper expressen that the muscle in his bad foot is not operating correctly and the opposing muscle has taken control i can run and do anything without being hurt it is when the foot is placed in a skate which it draws it together that i lose balance when i go he does not believe he will be skating by september when training camp opens the avs doctors have discussed the issue with his swedish doctors , and he is now on a special training program i do not expect to be able to play before christmas i still feel i have more to give , he said , but if this problem cannot be corrected , i am otherwise satisfied with the career i have had still , he admits , it feels strange that a single small muscle can determine everything here s the story that runs today by rick sadowski in the rocky mountain news  none of this is a surprise to anyone , including the avs back in may , as forsberg struggled to stay in the lineup , sadowski and aaron j lopez reminded their readers that the avalanche management and coaching staff accepted the risks and hoped the 12 million investment would pay surprising dividends the writers considered it a breakeven deal forsberg averaged better than a point a game in what may have been his final nhl stint it s a strange injury to an exceptional athlete , one of the most complete players we ve ever seen but as long as foppa can walk away with some peace of mind , all s well that ends well and if he can t \? sadly , there ain t nothin he can do
l'alped'huez , france with a formidable display of climbing prowess on the toughest mountain in this year s , carlos sastre took the race leader s yellow jersey wednesday and set up a fourman showdown for the tour victory in saturday s final time trial sastre , a spaniard from the csc saxo bank team , took the jersey from his teammate frank schleck , who started the day 49 seconds ahead of him but when sastre , who started the tour as the team s designated leader , decided to attack in the first mile of the 85mile climb to this alpine resort , schleck could do little more than watch him go none of the other major contenders for the overall victory could respond , either , but for different reasons cadel evans , who is perhaps still the favorite for victory because of his superior timetrial ability , had his climbing rhythm repeatedly disrupted by the catandmouse tactics of frank schleck and his younger brother , andy , who time and again increased the pace suddenly , only to slow when evans caught up knowing that evans would track him wherever he went , frank schleck was forced to ride calmly without putting in a serious chase of sastre to do so , schleck knew , would risk helping evans up the mountain instead , he was left to watch as his yellow jersey rode away sastre , who started the day in fourth place , won the stage by more than two minutes and now leads frank schleck by 1 minute 24 seconds bernard kohl of gerolsteiner is in third place 1 33 behind , and evans is one second further back , in fourth denis menchov of rabobank is in fifth place at 2 39 behind frank schleck , who looked disappointed immediately after the stage , nevertheless praised sastre s effort sastre in turn praised his teammates for putting him into position to win the stage but , he said , the attack was not planned in advance at the beginning of the alped'huez , i decided on my own to attack , sastre said through an interpreter after the race i told frank that i felt extremely good and would give it a go and frank said , yeah , well , ok' without the help of my teammates , who did some amazing riding before and during my attack , i would n't be in yellow the schleck brothers sacrificed themselves , and that actually is the philosophy of the team sacrifice for the others , and that is really great barring a disaster by sastre , evans has one hope albeit a good one to move back into the race lead before the finish in paris on sunday that is at saturday s 33mile time trial , which travels a gently rolling route from c rilly to stamandmontrond in the 18mile time trial in this year s fourth stage , evans beat sastre by 1 16 in the final , long time trial of last year s tour , evans beat sastre by 2 33 but evans has to worry about not only sastre , but also kohl , menchov and even frank schleck evans received no help from the other top contenders as a group of 10 riders made their way up the steep slopes of the alpe when you have the 10 best bike riders in the world behind your wheel and you have a twominute gap to close on one of the best climbers in the world , it s not any situation to be in , evans said sastre , who at one point during wednesday s stage was fetching water bottles for his teammates , gained time on all seven miles of the climb after his attack long considered a top contender in cycling s biggest events , but yet to win a big multiday race , sastre , 33 , temporarily lost his title of team leader when schleck moved one second out of the lead with a strong ride in the pyrenees sastre vowed to work for schleck , which he did , even for much of wednesday s stage csc s strategy was the same on the 17th stage as it had been in the 16th and 15th ride hard at the front of the peloton up all of the climbs , push the pace and force rivals to work hard to stay abreast of schleck and sastre on the long climb of the croix de fer , the second of three big climbs on the day s route , all of which were rated beyond category in difficulty , csc had no fewer than six riders at the front fabian cancellara , the world timetrial champion , paced the climb and cut the lead of a fourman breakaway group from more than seven minutes to less than two minutes the csc riders again set a hard pace through the valley leading to the alpe , then turned the race over to andy schleck , who paced the group of race leaders up the climb and responded to several attacks from other riders when sastre was asked after the stage whether he thought his lead was now wide enough to allow him to keep the yellow jersey through the time trial and into paris , he said he was not sure and did not want to think about it i just want to enjoy the moment with the team , and enjoy the next few days in the yellow jersey , he said it will be difficult to gain time over the next couple of days i just want to focus on resting as much as possible for the time trial
bostonarea college hockey fans got to enjoy oldschool , archrivalry hockey this weekend , as no 2 boston college and no 7 boston university squared off in a pair of highly entertaining games the terriers got the best of the series , winning 31 on the road saturday night after the teams skated to a 11 tie across town on friday meanwhile , the biggest hockey rivalry in the great lakes state didn t quite live up to the expectations , with michigan sweeping michigan state in a homeandhome series bu s threepoint weekend moved them up to fifth in the hockey east standings , just a point behind the eagles and two points back of secondplace vermont as we mentioned in our preview of this series , the terriers needed a big weekend to stay in the race for a high seed in the conference tournament bu s heroes were a pair of freshman forward chris connolly and goalie kieran millan connolly scored the gamewinner saturday on a secondperiod penalty shot and had an assist on the terriers first goal millan stopped 39 of the 41 shots he faced on the weekend to improve his record to 711 boston college coach jerry york best summed up the evenly matched series to the boston globe it s an indication that both teams are going to be very , very good hockey teams we both should be vying for championships the same championship expectations could not be placed on no 14 michigan and unranked michigan state , as the traditional ccha powerhouses have both sputtered in the first half of the season as michigan coach red berenson told the michigan daily , going into a weekend series with none of the usual hype that comes with the matchup \( this weekend \) might take on another dimension , because right now , both teams are trying to prove they re not as bad as they look it s unclear if michigan proved as much with a 61 win at home friday and a 53 road win saturday , the wolverines first win in east lansing since 2004 it was a particularly brutal weekend for the spartans , who have not won a game in regulation since halloween michigan state scored the first goal friday , only to see michigan pour in six straight the loss seemed to put spartan senior goalie jeff lerg at his wit s end we ve talked and talked about it something has to change , or we may not win another game , lerg told neil koepke of the lansing state journal  but the spartans season didn t get any brighter on home ice michigan state led saturday s game by 32 with less than three minutes to play , only to see michigan take the two points right back new york rangers prospect carl hagelin tied the game on a twoonone with 2 29 left less than a minute later , louie caporusso \( ottawa senators \) buried the game winner  the sweep helped michigan climb out of a hole in the ccha standings , moving up to fifth conversely , the spartans fell further from the conference s top tier , now in 11th , one point ahead of lastplace western michigan the spartans are 15 points behind miami \( ohio \) in first place both michigan and michigan state are off until the great lakes invitational in detroit at the end of the month for scores and analysis of all the weekend s college hockey games , go to collegehockeynewscom the new rankings will be up by tonight
it s hard not to love r buckminster fuller i mean , who else would send a telegram to explain e mc that amazing document \( sent by fuller to his friend isamu noguchi in 1936 \) is one of the many engrossing bits of ephemera on display through sept 21 at the whitney museum s current fuller exhibition , starting with the universe , and it tells us volumes about fuller whenever he had something to say , he said it , often for days at a stretch his brain was constantly consumed with the serious issues of his day issues that are still very much ours fuller was obsessed with how people were housed our beds are empty twothirds of the time our living rooms are empty seveneighths of the time our office buildings are empty onehalf of the time it s time we gave this some thought he was interested in exploiting geometry for the sake of maximum efficiency much of his career was spent creating utopian systems for housing \( though he would have described them as utterly attainable \) , from the flying saucerish dymaxion \( an amalgam of fuller s most commonly used words dynamic , maximum and tension \) house to the stunningly efficient standard of living package to the geodesic dome while fuller excelled at creating magical forms , he failed miserably at gauging the public taste for them , as the headline for a 1932 article about the dymaxion house in the new orleans tribune suggested when we live in circles and eat in merrygorounds fuller was undeterred , and as this engaging exhibit reveals , he continued to devote his life to doing more with less how small could a space be and still allow people to live efficiently within it \?

has the times been tougher on john mccain and sarah palin than it has been on barack obama and joe biden \? here are enterprise investigative articles the newspaper has done on each of the four candidates since early 2007 i have previously found fault with two of these articles the first one on mccain and the fifth one on palin but i urge you to read the full body of work on all the candidates and come to your own conclusion obama  1 \) in 05 investing , obama took same path as donors less than two months after ascending to the united states senate , barack obama bought more than 50 , 000 worth of stock in two speculative companies whose major investors included some of his biggest political donors  2 \) a candidate , his minister and the search for faith members of trinity united church of christ squeezed into a downtown hotel ballroom in early march to celebrate the long service of their pastor , the rev jeremiah a wright jr one congregant stood out amid the flowers and finery senator barack obama , there to honor the man who led him from skeptic to selfdescribed christian  3 \) an obama patron and friend until an indictment antoin rezko , an entrepreneur of considerable charm who found riches in fast food and real estate , is known around chicago as a collector of politicians back in the 1990s , mr rezko s office was adorned with framed photos of candidates he viewed as upandcomers among them was barack obama , a state legislator whose first campaign donations included 2 , 000 from mr rezko s companies  4 \) in illinois , obama proved pragmatic and shrewd there was something improbable about the new guy from chicago via honolulu and jakarta , indonesia , the one with the harvard law degree and the job teaching constitutional law , turning up in springfield , ill , in january 1997 among the housewives , exmayors and occasional soybean farmer serving in the state senate  5 \) in 2000 , a streetwise veteran schooled a bold young obama the rise of barack obama includes one glaring episode of political miscalculation even friends told mr obama it was a bad idea when he decided in 1999 to challenge an incumbent congressman and former black panther , bobby l rush , whose stronghold on the south side of chicago was overwhelmingly black , democratic and working class  6 \) obama s account of new york years often differs from what others say barack obama does not say much about his years in new york city the time he spent as an undergraduate at columbia college and then working in manhattan in the early 1980s surfaces only fleetingly in his memoir in the book , he casts himself as a solitary wanderer in the metropolis , the outsider searching for a way to make myself of some use  7 \) it s not just ayes and nays obama s votes in illinois echo in 1999 , barack obama was faced with a difficult vote in the illinois legislature to support a bill that would let some juveniles be tried as adults , a position that risked drawing fire from africanamericans , or to oppose it , possibly undermining his image as a toughoncrime moderate in the end , mr obama chose neither to vote for nor against the bill he voted present , effectively sidestepping the issue , an option he invoked nearly 130 times as a state senator  8 \) nuclear leaks and response tested obama in senate when residents in illinois voiced outrage two years ago upon learning that the exelon corporation had not disclosed radioactive leaks at one of its nuclear plants , the state s freshman senator , barack obama , took up their cause mr obama scolded exelon and federal regulators for inaction and introduced a bill to require all plant owners to notify state and local authorities immediately of even small leaks he has boasted of it on the campaign trail , telling a crowd in iowa in december that it was the only nuclear legislation that i ve passed a close look at the path his legislation took tells a very different story  9 \) old friends say drugs played bit part in obama s young life nearly three decades ago , barack obama stood out on the small campus of occidental college in los angeles for his eloquence , intellect and activism against apartheid in south africa but mr obama , then known as barry , also joined in the party scene  10 \) as developer heads to trial , questions linger over a deal with obama tony rezko was obviously in trouble he was a defendant in at least a dozen lawsuits , federal investigators in chicago were poking around , and his name was in newspaper articles about corruption and fraud none of that stopped mr rezko , a politically connected developer , and senator barack obama from completing real estate deals a few years ago that resulted in the obamas obtaining their dream house and the rezkos buying an empty lot next door  11 \) obama in senate star power , minor role senator barack obama stood before washington s elite at the spring dinner of the storied gridiron club in selfparody , he ticked off his accomplishments , little more than a year after arriving in town i ve been very blessed , mr obama told the crowd assembled in march 2006 keynote speaker at the democratic convention the cover of newsweek my book made the bestseller list i just won a grammy for reading it on tape really , what else is there to do \? he said , his smile now broad well , i guess i could pass a law or something  12 \) 60s radicals become issue in campaign of 2008 on march 6 , 1970 , a bomb explosion destroyed a greenwich village town house , killing three members of the radical weather underground and driving other members of the group even deeper into hiding on wednesday night , those events emerged as the focus of a sharp exchange between senators hillary rodham

martin luther king drive on chicago s south side billed as the largest africanamerican parade in the country , the summer rite was a muststop for the city s top politicians back then , mr obama , a state senator who was contemplating a run for congress , was so littleknown in the community s black neighborhoods that it was hard to find more than a few dozen people to walk with him  14 \) obama camp closely linked with ethanol when verasun energy inaugurated a new ethanol processing plant last summer in charles city , iowa , some of that industry s most prominent boosters showed up leaders of the national corn growers association and the renewable fuels association , for instance , came to help cut the ribbon and so did senator barack obama  15 \) big donors , too , have seats at obama fundraising table in an effort to cast himself as independent of the influence of money on politics , senator barack obama often highlights the campaign contributions of 200 or less that have amounted to fully half of the 340 million he has collected so far but records show that onethird of his recordbreaking haul has come from donations of 1 , 000 or more a total of 112 million , more than senator john mccain , mr obama s republican rival , or senator hillary rodham clinton , his opponent in the democratic primaries , raised in contributions of that size  16 \) obama s 2003 stand on abortion draws new criticism in 2008 abortion , a familiar issue in elections past , has again emerged in recent days as a focus of controversy senator barack obama is coming under intense fire from antiabortion groups because of the position he took as an illinois state senator on legislation regarding the status of fetuses that survive abortion procedures  17 \) obama attacks mccain in a bid to

advertisements of his rival , senator john mccain asked by a voter in new hampshire if he would respond in kind , mr obama said , i just have a different philosophy , i m going to respond with the truth yet as mr mccain s misleading advertisements became fodder on shows like the view and saturday night live , mr obama began his own run of advertisements on radio and television that have matched the dubious nature of mr mccain s more questionable spots   mccain 1 \) for mccain , selfconfidence on ethics poses its own risk early in senator john mccain s first run for the white house eight years ago , waves of anxiety swept through his small circle of advisers a female lobbyist had been turning up with him at fundraisers , visiting his offices and accompanying him on a client s corporate jet convinced the relationship had become romantic , some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself  2 \) a developer , his deals and his ties to mccain donald r diamond , a wealthy arizona real estate developer , was racing to snap up a stretch of virgin california coast freed by the closing of an army base a decade ago when he turned to an old friend , senator john mccain  3 \) in split role , mccain adviser is sometimes a lobbyist when senator john mccain led a senate investigation three years ago of jack abramoff , the disgraced lobbyist who later pleaded guilty to fraud charges , mr abramoff s old firm turned to a former mccain campaign adviser for help the firm , greenberg traurig , which had quickly cut its ties to mr abramoff , hired randy

and owner of the new york jets , may be the biggest  7 \) ad on sex education distorts obama policy escalating its efforts to portray senator barack obama as a candidate whose values fall outside the mainstream , the campaign of senator john mccain on tuesday unveiled a new television advertisement claiming that mr obama , the democratic nominee , favors comprehensive sex education for kindergarten students the ad however , seriously distorts the record  8 \) mccain barbs stirring outcry as distortions harsh advertisements and negative attacks are a staple of presidential campaigns

obama s record and positions  9 \) mccain , on the economy ad campaign check point on sen mccain s ad on the economy  10 \) loan titans paid mccain adviser nearly 2 million senator john mccain s

end of 2005 through last month to a firm owned by senator john mccain s campaign manager , according to two people with direct knowledge of the arrangement the disclosure undercuts a remark by mr mccain on sunday night that the campaign manager , rick davis , had had no involvement with the company for the last several years  12 \) taking on the mortgage giants senator john mccain is correct he warned two years ago that congress should rein in fannie mae and freddie mac , the giant mortgage finance companies , before their financial risktaking threatened the economy , and senator barack

and his entourage emerged with thousands of dollars in winnings a lifelong gambler , mr mccain takes risks , both on and off the craps table   both obama and mccain 1 \) 08 rivals have ties to loan giants senators barack obama and john mccain each cite the mess at fannie mae and freddie mac as a consequence of the corrosive coziness of lobbyists and politicians that they promise to end but each man and his party also have ties to the fallen giants that will complicate the next president s job of reshaping the mortgage finance companies that have been essential to the economy  2 \) without offering context , some distortions checkpoint on the first debate   biden 1 \) obama aides defend bank s pay to biden son during the years that senator joseph r biden jr was helping the credit card

biden jr , democrat of delaware , has devoted much of his 35 years in the senate , including eight years as chairman of the judiciary committee , to matters of race and civil rights he has been instrumental in expanding voting rights , supporting affirmative action , passing the violence against women act , expanding the definition of hate crimes and working toward ending employment discrimination but three episodes from his senate career show how treacherous issues of race remain and have left scuff marks on what most agree is an otherwise admirable record  5 \) an everyman on the trail , with perks at home for the millions of voters getting to know him , senator joseph r biden jr , the democratic vicepresidential nominee , portrays himself at times as an average guy who takes the train to work , frets about money and basically has led a middleclass life although he is among the least wealthy members of the millionaires club that is the united states senate he and his wife , jill , a college professor , earn about 250 , 000 a year mr biden maintains a lifestyle that is more comfortable than the impression he may have given on the campaign trail   palin 1 \) account of a bridge s death slightly exaggerated gov sarah palin of alaska owes her selection as senator john mccain s running mate in part to an irresistible slogan the bridge to nowhere mr mccain and other critics of the congressional pet projects known as earmarks adopted the label to deride a 220 million allocation for a bridge to the tiny alaskan island of gravina \( population , a few dozen \) and ms palin became famous as the governor who , in 2007 , finally killed the project but ms palin s history with the infamous bridge is more complicated  2 \) palin s start in alaska not politics as usual the world arrived here more than a century ago with the gold rush and later the railroad yet one aspect of american life did not come to town until 1996 , the year sarah palin ran for mayor and wasilla got its first local lesson in wedge politics  3 \) palin s pipeline is years from being a reality when gov sarah palin of alaska took center stage at the republican convention last week , she sought to burnish her executive credentials by telling how she had engineered the deal that jumpstarted a longdelayed gas pipeline projectthe reality , however , is far more ambiguous than the impression ms palin has left at the convention and on the campaign trail  4 \) active role for palin s husband in alaska government in voting to issue a subpoena to todd palin in an investigation of the firing of the alaska public safety commissioner , state lawmakers on friday signaled that mr palin , the husband of gov sarah palin , might have played a central role in one of the most contentious episodes of her governorship  5 \) once elected , palin hired friends and lashed foes an examination of gov sarah palin s swift rise and record as mayor of wasilla and then governor finds that her visceral style and penchant for attacking critics she sometimes calls local opponents haters contrasts with her carefully crafted public image

bunny slope , a snow park with tubes , a miniluge for the kids and a chairlift to the top of a 1 , 300foot run with a 200foot drop there s also the overcautious attitude of people who are n't used to skiing an attendant at the chair s midstation chided me for not having my safety bar down moments later an attendant at the top chided me for lifting it five feet too soon but it s not a bad little hill packed powder , no wind if anything could be improved , it s the quality of the light , which is flat and blue , reflected off blue walls and ceiling one run , with a sharp dip at midpoint , is

and artificial mountain range and penguins still , i found penguinless ski dubai a pleasant enough respite from the other incongruities of this place i got on the lift next to a 12yearold boy with a snowboard and asked him where he was from palestine , he said he took my surprise as confusion did you hear of it \? he asked yeah , i said , i 'd heard of it this was the same week half the population of gaza had broken down a wall into egypt so they could buy gasoline and soap we are living in dubai , the boy said , but we are moving to canada soon better snowboarding there , i said he nodded and pointed to a jump on the slope beneath us that was closed , to his disappointment it is only open sometimes , he said in canada , it will always be open then our chair reached the top , and he jumped on his board and took off like a shot , straight down the man with the falcon did n't ski or golf or play tennis he was an emirati engaged in an emirati sport who cared about the two billion spectators \? he had his bird i had driven out from the city , beyond the endless construction , past signs promising future construction \( your spanish lifestyle villas ! \) and into the desert , where 50 or so fourwheeldrive suv s were parked for the alfazza falcon hunting championship and 50 or so men were waiting for their falcons' turn to fly the men \( with a few boys , no women \) were all emiratis this was , in fact , the first time since arriving in dubai that i 'd been in a group where local citizens were a majority emiratis comprise less than 20 percent of dubai s 14 million residents the rest are foreign workers , ranging from the middlemanagement brits and americans and australians who run dubai sports city to hundreds of thousands of indians and pakistanis who labor on construction sites and at the ends of their long workdays are bused directly to compounds in the desert the outnumbered emiratis have one solace they own the place this particular group of emiratis , however , did not own all the falcons on their arms many were falcon tenders in the service of the ruling family , whose members take falconry extremely seriously \( when president george w bush visited , he was photographed holding a royal falcon \) and who owned a substantial percentage of the birds in the competition one of those was barraqy , a brown and white gyrperegrine hybrid with an evil glare that perched on the wrist of the man sitting on the sand beside a land rover he offered me a snack of sweet dates and watery arabic coffee and showed me barraqy s passport \( yes , passport did i mention that falconry is taken seriously here \? \) the document identified the bird s owner as h h shk mohammad r almaktoum barraqy is worth 150 , 000 dirhams \( 40 , 000 \) , the man said , but he discreetly avoided answering when i asked how many falcons the ruler owns so did dr mariam hampel , a german veterinarian at the competition , who told me she works at sheik mohammad s private falcon hospital , where she sees 30 to 40 birds a day they are very sensitive to fungal diseases , she said , and parasitic diseases and they get bone fractures i have to pin dottora ! dr hampel was interrupted by a man in a white dishdasha standing by a temporary fabric fence a falcon had just been taken behind the fence to begin its flight \( the fence serving to shield it from visual distractions \) , and it was dr hampel s job to scan the bird with a handheld device that would read a microchip implanted in its chest and confirm its identity she did so , and the falcon was released some 400 yards away , a trainer was swinging a feathered lure , a crude imitation of the flight of a bird that a falcon would ordinarily hunt and kill the falcon spotted it and flew off , straight and low , to strike the lure and be rewarded with a hunk of raw meat the bird s time was captured by a laser meter and the results posted on a computer monitor near the starting line , where the men gathered to watch they chewed dates and talked on cell phones as newcomers arrived , friends greeted friends in traditional emirati fashion by leaning toward each other and bumping noses is that martina \? i look again and yes , it is martina navratilova is sitting in the front row of the press conference at dubai sports city next to a soccer player , a rugby player and a cricketer , all of whom i , being american , have never heard of but who are apparently worldfamous they have all turned up to support their good friend ernie els \( currently ranked the fourthbest golfer on earth

in navy slacks and powder blue golf shirt , is seated on the dais between two emiratis in dishdashas he says he is thrilled to be here i 've been coming to dubai since 1993 , and i 've always wanted to build something in dubai , and , luckily enough for our company , with khalid we struck up a relationship he nods toward alzarooni , the president of dubai sports city and here we are building this course , he acknowledges , was not without challenges the sand would keep moving i mean you try to put a bunker in place , and overnight there s a bit of a breeze , and the bunker has moved so we had to really work quickly if we worked on a particular hole we had to try to finish what we started plus there was the time he came for a visit in the summer and it was 117 degrees he lasted half an hour outside it is pleasantly cool on the terrace of the temporary clubhouse where the international golf press devours a buffet lunch this is the desert winter , with temperatures around 70 and occasional rain the course looks stunning intense green against the brown sand to keep it green , the course is pockmarked with 2 , 256 sprinkler heads capable of delivering two million gallons of water every 12 hours martina navratilova who , i'm told by an official of dubai sports city , might get involved with a new tennis academy here is taking a few swings on the practice range she s soon joined by the other athletic guests of honor \( for the record the soccer goalkeeper peter schmeichel , the cricketer andrew flintoff and the south african rugby star john smit \) greg letsche , one of els s designers , is standing nearby , looking with quiet satisfaction at the contours of the course basically , you 're creating 18 holes out of a virtually flat surface , he says sometimes you like a lonely oak tree or a stream to give you some inspiration to begin with at dubai sports city , he had none of that it was a blank palette i remember walking the site , and there s camels walking around lunch is completed , and the press and dignitaries all troop over to the first tee some of the imported laborers working on courseside villas put down their tools and line up to watch this little parade , which culminates in the arrival of els for the ceremonial opening drive els is a large man with deliberate movements cameras click as he places his ball on a tee and addresses it , calm and steady , like the worldclass athlete he is sort of like sayed amri when i met amri , a stocky man in a white dishdasha and gutra , he was in his sporting position the shotgun seat of a white toyota land cruiser on the track at what a sign called new camel racing city there are actually three parallel tracks at new camel racing city , a spankingnew facility on the outskirts of town there s one for the racing camels and one on each side for the owners' cars amri s camel was in the race that was about to begin , and amri was ready to ride it with her camel racing , like falconry , is an actual local sport and one much favored by the emirati elite the late sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan , the former president of the uae and namesake of dubai s skyscraperladen highway , maintained a large stable of racing camels , and dubai s current ruler , sheik mohammad , has been reported to own thousands despite this enthusiasm from the top , camel racing seems , at least on the day i visited , to be a sort of antispectator sport as amri s race approached , i glanced at the brandnew grandstand it was empty , and it stayed that way except during the races , when the barefoot workers who led camels to the starting line ran up and took seats to watch the animals' progress on closedcircuit television when the camels reached the finish line , the workers rushed from the stands to grab them and lead them away this human intervention at start and finish is required by the absence of human jockeys strapped to each camel s back is a radiocontrolled gadget with a rotating arm picture a toaster with a whip to fool the camels into thinking there s a person aboard \( or just for the fun of it i never could determine which \) the machines are dressed in jockey outfits with jaunty little caps these robots have the practical benefit of being lightweight as a bonus , they eliminate the need to use child slaves \( scandal erupted a few years ago following reports of children purchased in india , sudan and elsewhere , sometimes from their impoverished parents , for service as camel jockeys in 2005 , the uae cracked down on the practice and , with unicef , established a 27 million fund to rehabilitate and repatriate the children \) amri s camel is named mosieh , and her robot jockey was wearing a cheerful yellow jersey she and 14 other camels were led , in a bit of controlled chaos , to the starting line of the fivemile track a signal sounded , a mesh gate was lifted and the camels were off so were the owners fifteen suv s started racing down the tracks parallel to the camel run amri was chauffeured by his younger brother mohammed , who wore a black dishdasha and redchecked gutra with a pair of sunglasses tucked rakishly into its folds as mosieh ran along the rail , mohammed kept pace on the opposite side in the first halfkilometer , mosieh broke into the lead so did mohammed , even though that required a tricky maneuver to get by a massive gmc amri watched his camel calmly , holding the remote control that activated the whip and a walkietalkie that would broadcast his voice to a speaker on the camel s back he used neither , not even when mosieh began to fall behind from first to second , to third , to fourth and , finally , to seventh amri still did n't touch the whip he just looked back to see what else was coming it was one more camel mosieh was now in eighth place but amri cracked only his knuckles , and stroked his face with his left hand , waiting waiting mosieh looked calm as well the other camels were frothing at the mouth , foam flying as they ran but mosieh was foamless , loping steadily onward , her lower lip flapping in the wind then she moved up from eighth place to seventh mosieh was still on the rail , and mohammed wanted to be next to her , but a pathfinder had moved in on his left , and a nissan patrol , directly in front of him , would n't make room mohammed edged over anyway inches on the left inches on the front collision seemed imminent he made it back to the rail in the home stretch now , with perhaps a mile to go , amri finally stirred he put the walkietalkie to his lips and said shhhh ! mohammed opened his window , put out his hand and started banging on the car door hai ! amri said hai ! hai ! suddenly he shrieked into the microphone and shrieked again and mosieh moved from seventh place to sixth only then , with the finish nearly upon them , did amri activate the whip he pushed a button on the gizmo in his hand , and the robot whipped the camel and stopped then amri did it again the thwacks were audible mohammed banged on the car door mosieh moved up to fifth , then fourth she was running at a pace of 20 miles per hour chuh ! amri shouted chuh chuh chutch chutch chutch ! there was the finish , and mosieh was third which was worth 8 , 000 dirhams \( 2 , 200 \) and qualified her to move up in class it s good , amri said , and he smiled the dubai sportsman , modest in victory back on the first tee , ernie els does n't bother with a practice swing he puts his head down , takes a final breath , then pivots and lifts his club the downswing comes swift and strong , and the ball soars , slightly left , heading toward a fairway bunker but stopping short , lined up exactly with the twin chrysler buildings in the distance els moves down the fairway , and his gallery moves with him i find myself walking beside khalid alzarooni , one of the few emiratis to have followed els beyond the press conference how does he do it , i ask him how does he get such distinguished athletes to take part in dubai sports city \? alzarooni replies in perfect americanaccented english , with a pleasant smile you put the sugar and the ants will come
fairfax , va fear is ruling the financial markets billions of dollars have been lost in mortgagerelated investments the federal reserve worked madly over the weekend to engineer a takeover of bear stearns and avert a systemic meltdown but the big fear remains how low will house prices go \? if prices continue to fall , mortgage defaults will move well beyond the subprime sector trillions of dollars in losses for investors are not impossible but that does n't mean they are inevitable in 1997 , inflationadjusted house prices were close to their average levels over the previous halfcentury only four years later , the price of the average home nationwide exceeded anything ever seen before in the united states prices continued to rise for another five years , peaking in 2006 at nearly twice the average price in 1997 \( as can be seen on the graph on the bottom right , which is based on data collected by the yale economist robert shiller \) if house prices are heading back to the levels seen in 1997 , then we are facing catastrophe but there are good reasons to believe that much of the increase in prices was a rational response to changes in fundamental factors like interest rates and supply the deeper fundamentals continue to suggest strong housing prices for the future sure , speculation did run rampant toward the end of the housing boom \( the debut of the reality television show flip that house on discovery home channel , followed shortly by flip this house on ae , was a clear sign that the boom s end was near \) prices will fall further , especially in the speculative developments built on the outskirts of the major cities so yes , we overshot the fundamentals still , especially in coastal areas where zoning regulations have restricted the supply of land that developers can build on , house prices were driven up by increasing population , low interest rates and strong economic growth more and more people want to live on the coasts , but land is hard to come by in places like manhattan and san francisco cities and regions built on ideas like boston , los angeles , new york and the san francisco bay area have grown even as areas built on manufacturing , like detroit and the rust belt , have declined and of course , government is n't getting any smaller , so washington and its suburbs , another hot spot of rising house prices during the boom , will continue to grow even in places where land seems plentiful , zoning and other landuse regulations have made it scarce to meet demand , we should encourage highdensity development , but homeowners fought to restrict housing supply when house prices were increasing now that house prices are falling , the incentives of owners to restrict supply are even stronger several studies estimate that the average house prices of 2004 were close to fundamental levels , so we may see prices stabilize near that level granted , a catastrophe is not impossible it did happen in japan house prices shot up in japan in the late 1980s , and by 1999 they had collapsed the graph on the top right , of japanese and american house prices , does make for a worrying comparison \( the data come from the standard poor s caseshiller national home price index and a similar index for japan \) but the resemblance is n't as close as the graph makes it appear the japanese runup in home prices was faster and reached higher levels than the one in the united states in addition , the japanese population at the time was n't growing , and today it s shrinking \( none of the major presidential candidates favor drastic reductions in immigration , so population growth in the united states will continue \) as a result of these and other problems , the japanese economy was moribund from 1992 to 2002 , which kept housing prices low there are two very real problems for the housing market tougher credit conditions and slower growth here the united states faces a selffulfilling prophecy problem if the financial markets can predict where and when house prices will stabilize , then credit conditions can quickly return to normal , the economy can expand and house prices will indeed stabilize but if the financial markets remain uncertain about when the decline in house prices will end , then fear will tighten credit even further , which would strangle the housing market and generate even more fear we have nothing to fear but fear itself , but fear itself can be pretty scary the best way to overcome fear is to look at the long run the typical homebuyer keeps a home for 10 years or more , so there is time for those who bought in 2005 and 2006 to weather the current decline in prices those who bought at the top are unlikely to see any windfalls from house appreciation , but they will not necessarily suffer from buyers' remorse owning a home has its advantages the deduction on mortgage interest is substantial and too much of a sacred cow to ever be repealed , and there is a certain security and satisfaction to owning your own home the collapse of housing prices certainly feels painful , and for some homeowners , it will be but the houses are still there , as good as ever most of the gains going up were paper gains , and most of the losses going down are paper losses the strength of an economy comes , fundamentally , from what it can produce can america still produce homes \? yes can america still produce desirable urban and suburban areas that people are willing to pay a fortune to live in \? yes that s the real bottom line the united states has some of the most valuable real estate in the world markets should not forget that
des moines is packed with presidential candidates and hundreds of campaign aides , advisers and contributors twentyfive hundred representatives of news organizations have been granted credentials to cover the caucuses thursday night , twice as many as in 2004 rarely has a political event been so intensely anticipated as a decisive moment , at least on the democratic side but what if it is not decisive \? what if at the end of thursday , the three leading democrats former senator and senators and are separated by a percentage point or two , leaving no one with the clear right of delivering a victory speech \( or the burden of conceding \) \? a number of polls going into the final days have suggested that after all of this , the democratic caucus on thursday night could end up more or less a tie in truth , amid all the endless permutations of outcomes that are being discussed can mrs clinton , the putative frontrunner , survive a thirdplace finish , or mr edwards a secondplace one \? aides are beginning to grapple with the frustrating possibility that all the time , money and political skill invested here might prove to be for naught when it comes to identifying the candidate to beat in the primaries and winnowing the top tier it would be like a sixmonth trial and a hung jury , said david axelrod , a senior adviser to mr obama i think it is really possible rather than clarify the state of play and consolidate this crowded field a bit , an outcome like that would almost certainly muddle things further and potentially extend the time before democrats know their nominee for different reasons , iowa is not likely to determine much for the republicans , either only mitt romney , the former governor of massachusetts , and mike huckabee , the former governor of arkansas , are going allout here , and whatever happens between them , the republican race already seems likely to go on at least until the cavalcade of primaries across the country on feb 5 but for the leading democrats , an inconclusive ending here would be a much more complicated result because none of them would be judged a decisive loser , mrs clinton , mr edwards and mr obama would all be able to go on to the primary next week , no questions asked and you can bet on this the other democrats in the race senators christopher j dodd and joseph r biden jr , representative dennis j kucinich and gov bill richardson of new mexico would feel less of the morningafteriowa pressure to pull out it would be hard for any candidate to play the i beat expectations game and claim some sort of chimerical victory , much the way bill clinton proclaimed himself the winner after coming in second in new hampshire in 1992 although mr edwards , who for much of the year campaigned in the shadow of his two rivals , would no doubt try frankly , if there s a threeway tie , that changes the dynamics of what has been reported the entire year that it s a twoperson race , said jennifer o'malley dillon , the iowa campaign director for mr edwards , who has put in more than a year preparing for this week it changes the way people look at the race , and they 'll see it as a threeway race it is a good bet , in fact , that one candidate would try to claim a victory , even if it was by a single percentage point or less still , that is not likely to get him or her on the cover of time or newsweek \( that would be the oldschool way of measuring the political impact of winning in iowa \) the other two would be left fighting for the right of second place and politics being politics , it is likely there would be a campaign trying to present a threeway tie as a victory beyond that , new hampshire , which for democrats has seemed something like a stepchild in this year s nominating process given all the attention being paid to iowa , would get a chance to have some real influence over the nomination for 25 years , there has been debate and study about how the outcome in iowa affects new hampshire voters this time around , because of the decision by the new hampshire secretary of state , bill gardner , to set the primary on jan 8 , voters will have just five days to examine the candidates and make their decision one of the bedrock political assumptions of the year and certainly one that has informed mrs clinton s campaign is that winning iowa and new hampshire would set the table for sweeping the 20 or so states that vote on feb 5 , the day when many democrats believe that their contest will effectively be decided but if iowans end up being equally divided among what many party leaders view as an unusually strong cast of candidates , who is to say that voters in the feb 5 states wo n't be as well \? none of this is meant to suggest that such an outcome would mean that what has taken place here over the past year is insignificant quite the contrary watching these candidates , democrats and republicans , deliver their final speeches , take the last rounds of questions from iowans and shake the hands of supporters one more time , it is apparent that most of them are much better at campaigning than they were a year ago mr obama s campaign manager , david plouffe , an old iowa caucus hand who has moved here to help out in the final days , said as much in explaining why he would be comfortable with even an inconclusive outcome the experience here in iowa , he said , has been tremendous for the entire campaign
two hockey writers on the competing minneapolis and st paul newspapers both tackled the nhl general managers injuryreporting policy in stories this weekend brian murphy in the st paul pioneerpress and michael russo in yesterday s minneapolis startribune  it s an issue now in minnesota because of the lower body injuries to marian gaborik and owen nolan , just as it was an issue on long island a couple of weeks ago when rick dipietro went down with a knee injury \( which knee is still undisclosed \) that was made known only after his surgery with injuries to sidney crosby and other big names , the policy s effects have rippled around the league it has received an increasing amount of coverage in both the mainstream media and in the blogosphere as injuries pile up in the early going and the policy s consequences become clear we noted a few more recent articles yesterday jim kelley at sportsillustratedcom took a stand last week against the policy , and pierre lebrun on espncom had a piece on it last week and he discussed with the panel on saturday s hockey night in canada hotstove segment as well additionally , the national post picked up a piece by scott cruickshank of the calgary herald the policy , passed by the gm s last june , has elements which make it the most arbitrary and extreme in pro sports , reads as follows clubs no longer are required to disclose the specific nature of player injuries clubs are , however , required to disclose that a player is expected to miss a game due to injury , or will not return to a game following an injury clubs are prohibited from providing untruthful information about the nature of a player injury or otherwise misrepresenting a player s condition the good news was the last sentence the lessthangood news was everything that went before it the clubs are left to themselves to decide what or how much to disclose to the public the rationale , as has been stated by various gm s , is player safety and the fear that opponents will target injured players if their conditions are known just how serious that targeting problem is up for discussion jarome iginla was recently interviewed by joe haggerty for his blog on the web site of boston s allsports radio station weei , and haggerty raised the subject with iggy this is sort of a league issue i was going to talk about the new injury disclosure policy in which the league has really tightened what the teams can release publicly about injuries i wanted to just talk a little bit about the rationale have you ever been targeted by an opponent who may have known you were injured any time in your career \? did you ever feel that that was a threat \? jarome iginla i personally haven t been you know , i can see the one side where it sounds like you don t want anyone to know if a guy has maybe a bad hand and you re going to start slashing his hand but i don t think that s going to happen regularly i know when we hear a guy with an injury , we just played jason arnott we knew he came back in nashville , and we knew he came back from a finger injury we re trying to be hard on him obviously because it s his first game back and he plays so well against us , but no one made one comment about let s go slash his hands or anything like that i mean , maybe playoff time things heat up even more but no , we ve never really talked like that at all q and just one quick followup there s been some comparisons drawn with the nfl only because it s a pretty physical sport , as well , and guys try to take advantage of every piece of intelligence that they have they have the most transparent policy , in which every wednesday and friday there s a report that comes out on each injured player , where he s hurt , what he s been able to do there s a big reason for that , and that s in las vegas with the wagering and whatnot but i m just curious , if the nfl can be that transparent , why can t the nhl \? jarome iginla well , yeah , i think it s obviously a very physical sport , too i mean , we re trying to not say a guy has a shoulder injury say we re playing another team and one of their top guys has a shoulder injury well , we re probably trying to hit him anyway , but we re trying to hit him as much as we can and if it s an ankle injury , there s nothing a guy is really doing to another guy s ankle i guess it would be a hand would come to mind that you might see more , but refs are on that and see that anyway so yeah , most of them are like yeah , i m not that personally , obviously , i m not that worried about it because usually i feel like they re trying to hit me anyway , or playing against another team s defensemen and they re trying to run me into a corner whether my shoulder is good or not no , i could see why it could be more transparent murphy wrote in his pioneer press story , none of the 10 players interviewed for this story said he ever has been coached to attack a wounded player with intent to further injure him and none could recall being targeted because of a disclosed injury i don t get it , 13year veteran andrew brunette of the wild told murphy i ve never seen , never heard anybody say , let s get him because he s injured i don t buy into this thing about being targeted , murphy quoted sabres coach lindy ruff as saying if you ve got a pulled groin , are you going to target a pulled muscle \? there s always been this mystery in our league but most of the time , it s a meaningless type of injury you don t need to hide it s not the unanimous view , of course , but we strongly doubt targeting is the threat it is made out to be in fact , as lebrun points out , last season , a fulldisclosure policy was in effect from training camp onward and we can t recall ever hearing that targeting injured players was an issue until the playoffs iginla seemed somewhat concerned that playoff intensity might unleash targeting and that was the genesis of this policy last spring as tsn s darren dreger reported in october , red wings gm ken holland expressed concern that johan franzen , who was disclosed to be suffering concussionlike symptoms , was targeted by the stars and penguins during last spring s playoffs it was witnessed by the other managers who quickly adopted the sweeping policy holland told lebrun , however , that he was concerned more about the playoffs , not the regular season , when he proposed the change my feeling was , come playoff time , i don t that it s necessary for the fans to know every injury , holland said somehow , the intention of his proposal full disclosure until the postseason mutated into a seasonlong policy of selective secrecy at the club s discretion the scattershot approach makes the nhl look like less of a league , more of a collection of 30 teams all i want is some consistency , penguins gm ray shero told lebrun either we all do it , or we all don t we all know what the nfl does , but they all have to disclose i m up for either way , but as long as everyone is doing the same thing lebrun believes that the league should reexamine the policy and return it to holland s original intention and even take it a bit further he wrote , our argument would be that the policy should be amended so full disclosure still exists from midseptember \( the start of training camps \) through march 1 \( the beginning of the stretch run \) from then through the playoffs , teams can hide injury details all they want holland didn t shoot down our idea the real extent of targeting and the selective reporting of injuries are not the whole story , however there s one final piece to this issue , and that is how fans perceive it lebrun quotes an email message from nhl deputy commissioner bill daly in which daly said , while our revised policy has generated attention , and in some cases criticism , from our media , we have not received negative feedback directly from our fans making similar claims , wild assistant gm tom lynn , who decides for the team what to communicate about injures , defending the policy to russo in the startelegram our stakeholders have not given us noise on this , lynn said we get emails from our seasonticket holders , we poll them often , we talk to them suite , seasonticket holders , people that actually are the fans that we re trying to respond to they like to know if a guy s in or out or some general parameters as to when they re coming back lynn told russo the only complaints the team has received are from the media and fantasy hockey players , and there s a big difference between them and a guy buying four tickets on the glass lynn s remarks prompted one startribune reader to comment , lynn said the only complaints the team has received are from the media and fantasy hockey players , and there s a big difference between them and a guy buying four tickets on the glass well , i play fantasy hockey and i bought only two tickets on the glass to the montreal game sorry , my bad i ll make it four next time if that will make you pay attention to me another responded , please buddy can you be any more patronizing \? ! there are plenty of us wild fans who go to games and have a desire to specifically know why gabby , nolan , et al are still not playing lower body injury tells us absolutely nothing and leaves us guessing at who is going to be playing each night , which is not really fair to people paying bigbucks for tickets each week the comments to russo s story and comments we ve seen to many stories like this all over the web are fairly well divided between those who don t care support the policy think this is just an issue for hockey writers and those fans who feel the policy is unnecessarily secretive , insulting and reflective of a league out of touch with its fans , misunderstanding its marketing pr needs and lacking in leadership but the point is , there is a good amount of interest in this issue from fans and while it may not be overwhelmingly one way or the other , it is mistaken to claim fans are 1 \) silent , 2 \) in full agreement or 3 \) don t think it is an issue they may not be emailing or phoning the league or team offices , but there is sentiment out there if one truly wants to find it and to underscore the point , here are 20 examples from the hockey blogosphere not from the mainstream media who , in the last couple of weeks , have expressed opinions ranging from puzzlement to outrage at the league s injury policy michael schuerlein in islesblogger , steven ovadia in puckupdate , islanders outsider , dominik at islanders frontier , kevin schultz at aol fanhouse , faux rumors , gaspo at still drivin , islanders army , jp at japer s rink , dan at deuce by definition , greg wyshynski at yahoo s puck daddy , christy at sports pr blog , washington capitals weblog , bryan at the rivalry , ken rosenblatt at the bleacher report \( which was reposted on multiple blogs \) , the forechecker \( dirk hoag \) at kuklas korner , fly on the wall , patrick hickey , jr on the drive for five , bdgallof at yes ! islanders , jb at penguins insider  not all bloggers are opposed to the policy \( our informal search found about a quarter of the bloggers favoring it or unconcerned about it \) , but there is certainly fan opposition being expressed on various hockey blogs one can also check the fan comments on mainstream media sites like this one from sicom s fan nation , or the comments on greg logan s newsday blog posts concerning rick dipietro s various injuries and the islanders lack of news on his condition again , the opinions are divided , but the opposition is there perhaps the league and teams should take notice of it and not deny its existence
ixtapa , tibur n ! a little boy cried out , jumping up and down in the sand with his finger outstretched toward the ocean everyone around followed the youngster s panicky gaze out past the waves and into the pacific , where they spotted not a shark s fin but a buoy everybody s seeing sharks these days , said the security man at one of the giant resort hotels that has flown a black flag over its lifeguard tower in recent days , warning swimmers to beware since the end of april , the beaches north of here have experienced three separate shark attacks , two of them fatal , a rarity along this coastline needless to say , there are some jitters these days about whether the shark or sharks responsible might strike again an ixtapa lifeguard , sitting atop a tower , admitted that every shout or scream he hears these days causes his heart to race there is a fair amount of shrieking that occurs at every beach , whether caused by a hardfought point in beach volleyball , a wave splashing the face of a child or maybe someone stepping down too hard on a sharpedged shell now , though , any raised voice has him thinking someone else has been bitten the first victim , adrian ruiz , 24 , of san francisco , arrived at a hotel on the beach in troncones in the early evening of april 28 and immediately headed for the waves not too long afterward people on shore saw blood in the water i ran to the water and grabbed him , said osm n altamirano , 26 , who works at a beachfront hotel half his leg was gone he was shaking we put him in the back of a pickup but did n't get him to the hospital in time then , on may 23 , a shark mauled a surfer , osvaldo mata valdovinos , 21 , at pantla beach he also bled to death the following day , at playa linda , bruce grimes , 49 , a florida native who owns a local surf shop , had his own encounter with a shark he estimated to be about six feet long i was sitting on my board when all of a sudden i got raised out of the water , he said at first i thought it was a manatee , but then it came back and i saw it was a shark he tried to knock me off my board and then he took a bite out of me bleeding from a deep wound in his hand and forearm , mr grimes made it to shore and managed to drive himself to a local hospital , where doctors sewed him up with more than 100 stitches the resort towns of ixtapa and zihuatanejo , which prop up the economy of guerrero state , have been scrambling to respond after the first attack , officials eased normally tight restrictions on shark fishing and sent an armada of fishermen out into the ocean to strike back a number of sharks were brought back and hung as trophies , an effort to send a signal that the crisis was under control but that response not unlike the one employed on amity island in the movie jaws served mainly to rile environmental groups already concerned by the dwindling shark population along mexico s coast demonstrations were organized calling for an end to the killing even the authorities were not sure how best to respond to the spate of attacks we do n't have much experience with this , acknowledged jos leonardo castillogeniz , a shark researcher at mexico s regional center for fisheries research in ensenada after the last two attacks , they called in george burgess , a shark expert at the , who promptly declared that the quest to hunt down killer sharks was fruitless the chances of finding the sharks that actually did the biting is practically nil , he said on top of that , he said , stringing the animals up , as the authorities here did , only scares away more tourists , just as the bloody afterattack photographs that local newspapers have been printing do mr burgess , who maintains a computer database of shark attacks worldwide , instead recommended a few practical measures , including more lifeguards , faster emergency response and signs warning people of the danger mexican authorities have signed on to his recommendations they have also dispatched the navy to patrol the coastline and have sent biologists out to tag hundreds of sharks in an effort to establish why they are coming so close to the shore mr burgess said the answer might have something to do with la ni a conditions affecting the pacific this year , bringing the cool waters that sharks prefer closer to the coastline than normal the last string of shark attacks in the area , four near acapulco , took place in the early 1970s , also during la ni a conditions , he said that may be good news for local tourism officials , because la ni a conditions rarely last more than a year and a half , and then disappear for an average of about five years before reappearing mr burgess suggested that anyone who entered the water anywhere should do so with a bit of trepidation we 're still working on the precise size of the sharks by studying the bites , said mr burgess , who says it could take a year to truly understand the recent spate of attacks but suffice it to say that in all three cases , the attacking shark was large he added we need to remember that humans are visitors to the wilderness when we enter the sea it s not like going into a pool whether it s the sea or the jungle , there are risks yet , for many the risks are still worth taking at troncones beach , daniel abraham , 16 , of michoac n state , arrived for a day of swimming and found a large warning sign stuck in the sand and displaying an ominous picture of a shark is it true that there was an attack here \? he asked sergio flores , who works for wild coast , an environmental group , and happened to be around mr flores nodded i suggest you get a cold beer and enjoy the sand , mr flores said wet your feet if you want play volleyball enjoy yourself but daniel was having none of that within minutes , he and a friend were chest deep in the ocean near the spot where one of the mauled surfers had been pulled out bleeding weeks before in no time at all , there were shouts coming from the water , joyful ones though , and no signs of any shark
sau pe , brazil \( ap \) latin american nations should expel american ambassadors until the united states lifts its embargo on , president of said wednesday his proposal found little support from other regional leaders mr morales made the suggestion during a summit meeting here of heads of state from latin american and caribbean nations i want to make a proposal that many are not going to like set a time limit for the new us government to lift the economic blockade against cuba , mr morales said , using the term that cuba and its allies use for the american sanctions if the new government does n't lift the economic blockage , we are going to lift our ambassadors , said mr morales , who expelled the american ambassador to bolivia in september after accusing him of supporting violent opposition protests while many of the other leaders at the conference have said they hope presidentelect barack obama will have a friendlier approach to the leftleaning governments that now hold power in many latin american nations , few offered support for mr morales s proposal the host of the conference , president luiz in cio lula da silva of brazil , said the region should wait to see what policies mr obama will pursue we must be prudent and diplomatic and wait for obama to assume power , mr da silva said i am hopeful that american policies toward latin america and the caribbean will change the threeday conference , which ended wednesday , has been a victory lap of sorts for cuba , newly admitted into the rio group of latin american nations president ra l castro of cuba participated in the conference many latin american nations oppose the american embargo of cuba , but none have cut ties with the united states because of it
with all due deference to lipstick , let s advance the story a week ago the question was is sarah palin qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency \? the question today what kind of president would sarah palin be \? it s an urgent matter , because if we 've learned anything from the gop convention and its aftermath , it s that the 2008 edition of john mccain is too weak to serve as america s chief executive this unmentionable truth , more than race , is now the real elephant in the room of this election no longer able to remember his principles any better than he can distinguish between sunnis and shia , mccain stands revealed as a guy who can be easily rolled by anyone who sells him a plan for victory , whether in iraq or in michigan a mccain victory on election day will usher in a palin presidency , with mccain serving as a transitional front man , an even weaker bush to her cheney the ambitious palin and the ruthless forces she represents know it , too you can almost see them smacking their lips in anticipation , whether they 're wearing lipstick or not this was made clear in the most chilling passage of palin s aligning herself with a young farmer and a haberdasher from missouri who followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency , she read a quote from an unidentified writer who , she claimed , had praised truman we grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity then palin added a snide observation of her own such smalltown americans , she said , run our factories and fight our wars and are always proud of their country as opposed to those lazy , shiftless , unproud americans she did n't have to name names who are none of the above there were several creepy subtexts at work here the first was the choice of truman most 20thcentury vice presidents and presidents in both parties hailed from small towns , but she just happened to alight on a democrat who ascended to the presidency when an ailing president died in office just as striking was the unnamed writer she quoted he was in the wall street journal as the now largely forgotten but once powerful rightwing hearst columnist westbrook pegler palin , who about her own record , misrepresented pegler s too he decreed america was done for after truman won a full term in 1948 for his part , truman as a guttersnipe , and with good reason pegler was a rabid joe mccarthyite who loathed fdr and ike and tirelessly advanced the theory that american jewish immigrants from eastern europe \( geese , he \) were all likely communists surely palin knows no more about pegler than she does about the bush doctrine but the people around her do , and they will be shaping a palin presidency that they would inject not just pegler s words but spirit into their candidate s speech shows where they 're coming from rick davis , the mccain campaign manager , a whole new republican party , but what it actually did was exhume an old one from its crypt the specifics have changed in our new century , but the vitriolic animus of rightwing populism preached by pegler and mccarthy and revived by the 1990s culture wars remains the same the game is always to pit the good , patriotic real americans against those subversive , probably gay cosmopolitan urbanites \( as the sometime crossdresser \) who threaten to take away everything that smalltown folk hold dear the racial component to this brand of politics was undisguised in st paul americans saw a virtually allwhite audience yuk it up when giuliani ridiculed barack obama s only in america success as an affirmativeaction fairy tale and when he and palin mocked obama s history as a community organizer in chicago neither party has had \( 15 percent \) in the 40 years since the joint center for political and economic studies started keeping a record but race is just one manifestation of the emotion that defined the palin rollout that dominant emotion is fear an abject fear of change fear of a demographical revolution that will put whites fear of the technological revolution and globalization that have gutted those small towns and factories palin apotheosized and , last but hardly least , fear of illegal immigrants who do the lowpaying jobs that americans do n't want to do and of legal immigrants who do the highpaying jobs that poorly educated americans are not qualified to do no less revealing than palin s convention invocation of pegler was the pointed omission of any mention of immigration , once the hottest republican issue , by either her or mccain saying the word would have cued an eruption of immigrantbashing ugliness , peglerstyle , before a national television audience that would n't play in the swing states of colorado , new mexico and nevada , where obama already has a among hispanic voters \( bush captured of the hispanic vote in 2004 \) since st paul , democrats have been feasting on the hypocrisy of the palin partisans , understandably enough the same republicans who attack democrats for being too pc about race now howl about sexism with such abandon you halfexpect phyllis schlafly and carly fiorina to stage a braburning the same gang that once fueled internet rumors and media feeding frenzies over the clintons' private lives now express pious outrage when the same fate befalls the palins but the ultimate hypocrisy is that these woebegone , frightened opponents of change , sworn enemies of racebased collegeadmission initiatives , are now demanding their own affirmative action program for white folks applying to the electoral college they want the bar for admission to the white house to be placed so low that legitimate scrutiny and criticism of palin s qualifications , record and family values can all be placed off limits byron york of national review , a rare conservative who acknowledges the double standard , if the obamas had a 17yearold daughter who was unmarried and pregnant by a toughtalking black kid , my guess is if they all appeared onstage at a democratic convention and the delegates were cheering wildly , a number of conservatives might be discussing the issue of dysfunctional black families the cunning of the palin choice as a political strategy is that a candidate who embodies fear of change can be sold as a maverick simply because she looks the part her marketers have a lot to work with palin is not only the first woman on a republican presidential ticket , but she is young , vibrant and a washington outsider with no explicit connection to bush or the war in iraq that package looks like change even if what s inside is anything but how do you run against that flashy flimflam \? you do n't karl rove for once gave the democrats a real tip rather than a bum steer when he that if obama wants to win , he needs to remember he s running against john mccain for president , not palin for vice president obama should keep stepping up the blitz on mccain s flipflops , confusion , ignorance and blurriness on major issues \( from education to an exit date from iraq \) , rather than her gaffes and r sum if he focuses voters on the 2008 mccain , the palin question will take care of itself obama s one break last week was the mccain camp s indication that it s likely to minimize its candidate s solo appearances by joining him at the hip with palin there s a political price to be paid for this blatant admission that he needs her to draw crowds mccain s conspicuous subservience to his younger running mate s hardright ideology and his dependence on her electioneering energy raise the question of who has the power in this relationship and who is in charge a strong and independent woman or the older ward who would be bobbing in a golf cart without her \? the more voters see that mccain will be the figurehead for a palin presidency , the more they are likely to demand steppedup vetting of the rigidly scripted heir apparent but obama s most important tactic is still the one he has the most trouble executing he must convey a rollupyoursleeves bobby kennedy passion for the economic crises that are at the heart of the fears that palin is trying to exploit the republican ticket offers no answers to those anxieties drilling is n't going to lower gas prices or speed energy independence an increase in corporate tax breaks is n't going to end income inequality , provide health care or save american jobs in a palin presidency any more than they did in a bush presidency this election is still about the fierce urgency of change before it s too late but in framing this debate , it is n't enough for obama to keep presenting mccain as simply a third bush term any invocation of the despised president like iraq invites voters to stop listening meanwhile , before our eyes , mccain is turning over the keys to his administration to ideologues and a running mate to bush s right as republicans know best , fear does work if obama is to convey just what s at stake , he must slice through the campaign s lipstick jungle and show americans the real perils that lie around the bend

cheyenne , wyo being a democrat in this state means that one s status in political life is rarely in question and rarely that good republicans have a more than twotoone edge in voter registration or even 10 to 1 in some counties and the democrats , who are gearing up for their presidential caucuses on saturday , usually get the leftovers back in 1921 , for example , when there was one lonely democrat in the wyoming house of representatives , he would routinely announce where his caucus of one would meet , in case anyone else was interested first the telephone booth , he would say , then the men s room , then the bar on the corner i think dilution would be the proper term , said dr john millin , an ophthalmologist who serves as the state chairman but this time , democrats here say , it feels different in contrast to all the dismally attended , demoralized democratic presidential caucuses of past years , the outnumbered democrats of wyoming might actually have something to roar about as people here and around the nation digested the results of the voting on tuesday , when senator hillary rodham clinton broke a string of victories by her rival for the nomination , senator barack obama , the implication was clear race not over next stop , wyoming some democrats here say they have never seen a political mood swing so overwhelming or so fast from the status quo of irrelevance to full kisskiss campaign embrace , in nothing flat i have never had a period of compressed political intensity like these last 48 hours , kathleen m karpan , a longtime democratic activist and former wyoming secretary of state , said thursday ms karpan , who supports mrs clinton , of new york , took a week off from her law practice to help with last minute details before saturday around the state , caucus locations are being moved from living rooms to meeting halls here in laramie county , the most populous , democrats reserved the cheyenne civic center , which will seat up to 1 , 500 people for an event that in the past has drawn maybe 250 people are excited that it would actually matter , said margaret whited , the party chairwoman in park county in the state s northwest corner ms whited said all the energy and attention swirling around the caucuses could help in the fight against her biggest enemy apathy among democrats who think their voices do not count if five times the regular number of 20 or so show up to caucus in park county , ms whited said , it will send a message that democrats in her part of wyoming should not be treated as aberrational freaks of nature it will let people see , she said , that we are just regular human beings some local party leaders are playing it close to the vest in predicting turnout in niobrara county north of here , where a dozen democrats coming to the caucuses would indicate a big year in the past and four voters was tolerable , the county chairman , brad smyth , refused to be drawn into a guessing game about the numbers i might give away our strength if i tell you , mr smyth said \( his bluff only goes so far , since there are just 101 registered democrats in the county , according to the wyoming secretary of state s office \) some republicans counter that all the supposed intensity over the caucuses and their importance to the national process is nothing but hype they 're trying to make it a big deal , said leroy herdt , a retiree in cheyenne who described himself as a conservative republican the demos are trying to get a grip on wyoming and using this as part of their plan dr millin , the state democratic chairman , said that getting a grip on wyoming was probably a bit farfetched , but that the party fully intended to capitalize on the excitement and to lasso into the fold as many new caucusgoers as possible the state party has 18 national delegates to apportion 12 to be decided , directly or indirectly , by the caucus votes on saturday , and 6 more , including 5 superdelegates , who could go to the august convention in denver uncommitted we 'll make the pitch on saturday that politics and political races are n't going to end today , and then invite people to help out other candidates , said dr millin , who supports mr obama , of illinois we 'll have lists of all the people who participate , and that should make a good starting point for the future of course , democrats do get elected to office in wyoming a tradition of democratic governors in particular extends back to statehood in 1890 , with more years under democrats including the current governor , dave freudenthal than under republicans , according to phil roberts , a professor of history at the university of wyoming and for about 70 years , until 1978 , at least one member of the state s delegation to congress was a democrat \( the republican who broke the streak with his election to congress that year , ushering in 30 years since of republican supremacy \? none other than vice president dick cheney , who earned some of his first political chits here \) another historical quirk that could resonate here on saturday is that one of the worst electoral droughts for democrats in state history coincided with the years when bill clinton was president from 1994 to 2002 , not a single statewide elected official or delegate to congress was a democrat dr roberts said that was partly a backlash to democratic rule in washington and partly because the party seemed to have written off wyoming as a lost cause , a policy that he thinks has since changed what it means to even be a wyoming democrat is another question in the state s southern half , where democrats are most numerous , the label is often not much more than a historical echo of the late 1800s and early 1900s , when the union pacific railroad dominated life and unionized workers joined the democratic party by the thousands the children and grandchildren of those workers might still be democrats , scholars and party members say , but in many instances it is more because of culture and family tradition than ideology where an obama or a clinton message really fits in is hard to say in a state where a conservative though often libertarian point of view is shared across much of the spectrum a wyoming democrat is a vermont republican , said muffy moore , a former chairwoman of the state democratic party other democrats say their putupon status only makes them stronger we have a core of democrats , said ms karpan , the former secretary of state , who are democrats not for convenience or any social advantage they 're democrats by conviction we know what it s like to be beaten down dr millin said he could even imagine a time and place in which a democratic presidential candidate might actually carry his state in a general election but even then it would n't matter , he said with a worldweary tone because if they won in wyoming , it would mean they would pretty much win everywhere
ndjamena , a rebellion aimed at toppling chad s president appeared to falter tuesday as declared that it would intervene to protect the chadian government if called upon , and a darfur rebel group with close ties to the chadian government said it had sent troops to help bolster the president , idriss d by french military officials in chad said the rebels were far from ndjamena , the capital , and the streets of the city were quiet for the first time since the weekend , the sound of automatic gunfire disappeared but the streets were virtually empty many thousands have fled into neighboring cameroon , and most people who remained stayed indoors , according to french soldiers who patrolled the city the bodies that had been putrefying in the streets were removed , but evidence of the previous day s gun battles remained in the blackened husks of pickup trucks used by government and rebel fighters recent fighting in the city has left at least 1 , 000 people wounded , a spokesman for the international red cross said tuesday , citing reports from a team that visited several hospitals in ndjamena , but it could give no estimate of the numbers killed by the fighting and cautioned that many of the wounded might not have been able to reach hospitals french support , along with help from fighters of a sudanese rebel group with ties to mr d by s family , strengthened the government s position markedly responding to questions from journalists in france as to whether french soldiers would intervene to help mr d by s government , the french president , nicolas sarkozy , said if france must do its duty , it will do so let no one doubt it a commander from the justice and equality movement , a darfur rebel group that has been fighting sudan s government and its allied militias in the warravaged region for the past five years , said some of the rebel troops had left their base in eastern chad , along the border with sudan , to reinforce chadian government troops the addition of darfur rebels to the fray adds new confusion to a tangle of conflict in chad and sudan , two of the most violent african countries they have accused each other of fostering rebellions against them , and events in recent days point to evidence that both are probably right the chadian rebels once advancing on ndjamena have found shelter in sudan , something that would certainly require sudanese government approval , analysts and diplomats say the darfur rebels operate openly in eastern chad , though this is the first time they have publicly admitted to helping mr d by militarily despite what was apparently the retreat of the rebels , the situation remained tense government television and radio remained off the air , and cellphone networks that were taken down to hamper rebel communication were still off tuesday at least four leading opposition figures have been arrested in the past few days , including ngarlejy yorongar , a member of parliament who once lost a presidential election to mr d by reed brody , a lawyer at human rights watch , said government soldiers had burst into mr yorongar s house , shot and wounded his driver and hauled off mr yorongar , one the government s most strident critics three other opposition leaders were also arrested , and none have been heard from since sunday , human rights workers said these opposition leaders are at grave risk of being tortured or forcibly disappeared , tawanda hondora , director of the africa program for amnesty international , said in a statement the chadian government seems to be using the current conflict with the armed opposition as a cover for arresting people peacefully opposed to government policy up to 20 , 000 people have fled across the chari river to the town of kousseri , in cameroon , according to staff members of the united nations refugee agency , who reached it on monday the agency was preparing for the arrival of more refugees some had found shelter with relatives , others at schools , but 6 , 000 to 7 , 000 had reached a former refugee camp near the river and were the most vulnerable , most of them spending the night in the open , the agency said despite the lull in the fighting on tuesday , agency staff members said civilians were still moving toward cameroon , while others searched for food and other supplies that have become increasingly scarce and expensive the agency said it was about to airlift 90 tons of supplies to cameroon from dubai and was preparing to move people to a site that can hold up to 100 , 000 people
did n't sleep much that was just as well , since so many nights were show nights the show much more than a concert was an intricate eveninglong routine that had developed over his lifetime by the last decade it went something like this as he awoke from a nap and performed his ablutions , you could hear the splashing , singing and kvetching over the whole apartment it was a ritual for shaking off fatigue and the dread of having to push everything uphill all over again the washing helped him reconnect with the spotless servant of music persona , one of his most treasured a light supper followed , some light conversation and maybe a glance at the score as he quietly gathered strength in the limo he was starting to feel the zone of his performance , testing it with snatches of old songs or punch lines by the time he hit the stage door , he was full of cheery greetings for everyone in sight when he got his call , he would stand just offstage , saying his mantra , kissing his koussevitzky cufflinks , taking the final drags of his cigarette at the last possible second he handed it to a stagehand or cup bearer , and he was on he presented himself to the audience , welcoming it , blessing it and preparing it for the music s first sounds he turned toward the players , acknowledging them as old comrades , looking each right in the eyes he waited for the audience to settle down , then gave his upbeat those near him onstage might hear his upbeat as well as see it he was quite vocal he hummed , moaned , grunted , ground his teeth and breathed heavily he used to say , you should conduct exactly as you would play the piano it was a physical thing he immersed himself in the stream of the work , pulling all the instruments under his fingers if it was a first night , the piece , though painstakingly rehearsed , might never have been played through completely the players , unsure exactly what he was going to do or how it all fitted together , had to watch him every second he liked that he knew that musicians could get buried in their parts , looking fixedly at the same notes they had played thousands of times he wanted the whole band to be out there with him in an experience that felt more like improvisation he liked fun and a whiff of danger he thought that a performance should reveal the emotional states the composer had experienced while creating the work for him that meant being totally involved emotionally and physically he felt he was n't really doing his best unless he was swaying on the precipice of his endurance whether he was conducting mahler or playing a haydn trio , it was the same oceans of sweat , fluttering eyes , hyperreactive athleticism it s what everyone expected but none of it was put on it was his authentic essential experience of music and of life whatever he had to do to achieve it , maintain it , he did the public loved it , understanding that it was all part of the supreme sacrifice of himself that he was making for them after the final number the stagehand and cup bearer handed him a lighted cigarette and a silver tumbler filled with scotch the second he got off the stage a few puffs , a few gulps , and he bounded or staggered on again when the ovation finally died down , another performance began legions of autograph seekers thronged to him backstage he would size up his supplicants with a deftness lord chesterfield might have admired , shifting his roles among counselor , classmate , rake it took a long time , and there were usually still receptions and suppers ahead as the hour grew late , sponsors and staffers might look for an opportunity to sneak out , but he would always spot them and bellow , sit down and shut up ! his attitude seemed to be , after all i 've given , i deserve anything i can get it was all a part of an essential rite in which his sharing of himself could make his demons go away , at least for a while he knew that what he most desired to do he could only do alone but being alone was , well , lonely , and scary , and it was in the lonely moments that he realized how much it was costing him to be himself that more than anything , by his standard , he was n't composing enough he knew that his own music was his greatest gift and message there was a time when composing was easy for him , but it got harder as the years went on to write the kind of music he dreamed of required time , and there was never enough time he knew how much his music mattered to people he knew that it charmed them but what he was yearning for was reverence after all , copland , his immediate mentor and model , had managed it copland s muchbeloved populist pieces like rodeo were balanced by thorny ones like the piano variations and the short symphony their message was hard , uncompromising but for bernstein the composer , compromise and collaboration seemed essential , inescapable he thrived and suffered in his artistic partnerships jerome robbins , arthur laurents , stephen sondheim robbins , especially , could get under his defenses and make him doubt that anything he had done was worthy he put so much of himself into his writing , and when nothing came of it , it was an unbearable torture he also put a lot of other composers into his writing but however much he may have borrowed , the whole was much more than the sum of its parts it all added up to an instantly recognizable and authentic him the references came completely ingenuously , and they did n't bother him in fact they amused him he would grin , shrug and say , everybody steals , but you 've got to steal classy his music has a rightguy , rightplace , righttime quality that says even tough things with a breezy confidence he was that guy he became the presiding maestro of the free world s victory parties after world war ii it was bernstein in prague , paris , vienna , performing copland s third symphony after the sixday war , it was bernstein in israel doing mahler on mount scopus bernstein and the new york philharmonic mopped up in south america after vice president nixon s disastrous motorcade and during the cold war bernstein hugged shostakovich in moscow and performed beethoven at the berlin wall he took american music to europe he brought european music here and talk about confidence he took european music back to the europeans his festivals of mahler and nielsen caused their music to be more highly valued in their own lands i can still hear him announcing , i'm going to budapest to teach the hungarians how to play bartok and he did it was thrilling , but it fed on itself he stood at the center of a cultural empire with everyone looking to him as the arbiter of taste and acceptance for a while he felt he could do anything conduct , compose , make videos , bridge the generation gap , champion justice for radical political causes , no matter what the cost then , like the nation whose spirit he epitomized , he began to flinch he feared he was being subsumed by the trappings of his fame , by the agendas of the organizations he served by the early '70s he realized the danger that is what mass was really about he carried on , the bravest of old campaigners , never losing his faith in the ideals of his youth and thrilled to see them reborn in new generations but of himself , amid the relentless fetes , he would say , i'm at the very peak of my decline these were the years of the tours from hell where was he \? vienna , rome , tel aviv , paris , , sapporo \? why was he there \? old friendships , new projects , bigger deals , concern for a young artist or cultural organization , because white asparagus was in season , because his loden coat had worn out , because his wife and his boyfriend were dead \? and he was n't composing enough his music took a darker cast the major pieces of the last years , like a quiet place , dybbuk and arias and barcarolles largely avoided heartonsleeve confessions and flirted with the hermetic procedures of the 12tone system he treated a tone row as a game his anagram skills made lattices of notes that yielded quartets , twisted torch songs , anything he desired they sound like him , but their prevailing mood is turgid , despairing , even desperate there is a relentless search in these works for emotional honesty and intellectual rigor , and at the same time for reconciliation , simplicity and , as in the title of his last opera , a quiet place , where he could be generous , vulnerable , simple it was hard for him to let himself be simple he usually felt that he needed to put himself and everyone else through some major test before he could relax composition had become another test , an agon but writing a piece for someone he loved was a different story seeing him possessed by the perfect vision for a birthday or anniversary song was like witnessing a minor miracle it was always about people he wrote his music for them , gave his performances for them he wanted to teach them , touch them , include them he wanted them to be a part of the family he adored his own family , relishing its complex mythology , accepting the brickbats of his siblings , the challenges of his children and the love and counsel of his wife , felicia , whose warmth and easy elegance made so much of his world possible she set the standard of what was fitting when she told him pull up your socks , he did there was easy banter and brilliance at their table , and silliness and lots of love the atmosphere was yiddishkeit showbiz competitive , but the feeling was above all warm and inclusive from the moment you pulled up a chair , you felt you were at home i think he wanted you to feel the same way in the first bars of his music sometimes the pileup of responsibilities was too much to bear when that happened , he would turn night into day stay up all night , go to sleep at 6 in the morning , have breakfast in the late afternoon this way he could avoid people and stay in his own space without giving too much offense but put him back in front of an audience , and he was back on again , in search of new friends some of his greatest performances were given at postconcert parties for audiences of a few dozen he would settle himself at the piano and begin a sequence of killer numbers movie production spectacles , victorian tearjerkers , understated supper club rarities or operatic coloratura showstoppers sung in a subvocal rumble that dietrich would have envied he knew he had everyone in his power and relished it never more so than the night in washington when an esteemed critic came forward to say a wobbly good night and collapsed at his feet look , bernstein said , there he is , one of america s most distinguished journalists , passed out , helpless before me why could n't you be harold schonberg \? even in the midst of the whirlwind of his life he found time to be with young artists mostly he had to be a kind of hitandrun mentor , dispensing maxims and anecdotes in brief master classes in the back seats of limos so much of his own experience had been thinking and learning on his feet in front of a hundred or a few thousand people that he knew the drill after one of my early performances of mahler s fifth symphony the conversation went like this m t t what do you think about the adagietto \? l b what do i think \? i think that when you 've made up your mind about what it really means to you , it wo n't matter what i or anyone else thinks you 'll just know so what can you say about a guy like this \? so nurturing , so confrontational he gave so much he cared so much i once asked him , did anyone ever get so much done and have so much fun as you have \? i do n't know , he replied mozart , maybe but he always needed more in the last years he was playing a game of chicken with his spirit and his health the time ran out , and as he had feared he had n't composed enough but in what he did compose he left us a real tracing of the places his spirit had been even if you never met him or saw him , his music tells you how life tasted to him , and that s what he really wanted there was never any question of what he believed , what he

afropolitanism is the modish tag for new work made by young african artists both in and outside africa what unites the artists is a shared view of africa , less as a place than as a concept a cultural force , one that runs through the world the way a gulf stream runs through an ocean part of the whole , but with its own tides and temperatures this idea , or something like it , lies behind flow at the , a finetextured survey of 20 artists who , with a few exceptions , were born in africa after 1970 but who now live in europe or the united states before the 1980s contemporary african artists had virtually no presence in the mainstream euroamerican art world and on the rare occasions they were admitted to its precincts , they were required to show clear evidence of africanness africanness as gauged by western standards , that is in their work , like a visa prominently displayed multiculturalism , whatever its deficiencies , began to change this situation it exposed artworld apartheid for what it was and forced open some longlocked gates not only did artists once excluded by color and class gain entry , they were also granted certain options as to how they might appear there they could wrap themselves in evidence of their origins , or wear that evidence lightly , or not at all , the first option being preferred by the market the artists in flow choose among these options , which means the show has no essential look , though there are broad patches of formal common ground a lot of what s here is based on an aesthetic of assemblage and fragmentation , the piecing together or taking apart of materials and ideas , including arthistorical precedents latifa echakhch , born in morocco and now living in france and switzerland , has created her own version of richard serra s splash pieces from the 1960s rather than throw molten lead against a wall as mr serra did , she throws moroccan tea glasses their smashed remains lie on a gallery floor like the aftermath of an explosion the piece neatly pinpoints the aggression of the original , an aggression with many metaphorical and political ramifications but is ms echakhch s work topical \?

baghdad discussions among iraqi politicians on the country s longterm security agreement with the united states were under way over the weekend , but it will take many weeks and more likely months before the agreement is completed , people close to the negotiations said american officials would like a deal by the end of july , before the democratic and republican national conventions but for iraqis , who have an election law to complete in the next month so they can prepare for an election of their own in the fall , that seems like a tight deadline none of the articles have yet been agreed to , said fouad massoun , a kurd who is involved in the discussions the negotiations are in the primary stage meeting the july 31 deadline will be very difficult , said humam hamoudi , a powerful member of the islamic supreme council of iraq , a shiite party that backs the government of prime minister nuri kamal almaliki the agreement will regulate the relationship between the american military and the iraqis after the expiration at the end of the year of a united nations resolution authorizing the presence of foreign troops in the country the latest draft of the new bilateral agreement offered by the americans made some significant concessions but in several important areas did not move close enough to iraqi demands , according to several participants in the iraqi committee that is meeting regularly to discuss the pact they consulted for several hours on saturday and agreed that mr maliki should lead the negotiations the overarching question is how much control will have over the activities of the american military on iraqi soil the americans have said they will allow civilian contractors to be held accountable under iraqi law , said mahmoud othman , a member of the political council for national security he said they had also agreed to hand over to the iraqis people captured by american soldiers and accused of crimes such detainees are now held in american facilities they will also transfer suspects already held in american detention centers to the iraqis , mr othman said but that leaves many practical questions unanswered there are now roughly 21 , 000 detainees in american custody if they were transferred to iraqi custody , where would they go \? the iraqis do not have facilities for them , and it would not be easy for americans to hand over their detention centers at camp cropper and camp bucca to the iraqis the iraqis appear to have agreed to allow the americans to continue to control their airspace because the iraqis lack the extensive flight control expertise and equipment necessary , said mr othman and another member of the political council for national security when iraqis say they want their sovereignty respected , they are talking in part about having the power to set the terms of the relationship between the united states and iraq for instance , will american soldiers be able to undertake military operations as they see fit , as they do now \? the iraqis are discussing possible compromises one idea is to have a joint iraqiamerican committee that would approve all operations , mr hamoudi said although the united states has agreements around the world with countries about the behavior of american soldiers stationed on foreign soil , including those with many american troops , like south korea , japan and germany , none involve soldiers carrying out active combat operations another reason the iraqis believe it will take some time to complete a pact is that they have been visiting other countries with american bases , to look at their security agreements the iraqis want to hire european and american legal consultants to review those and their own proposed security agreement with the americans
solo , pop quiz how many kings are there now in the ancient sultanate of surakarta \? answer there is no correct answer when king pakubuwono xii died four years ago , he left six mistresses with 35 children , but no wife , no heir and no instructions about the succession here in this city in central java he might have guessed what would happen two half brothers each claimed the ancient crown , and the family split into two bitterly feuding factions the oldest half brother and his nine full siblings took control of the palace , a fortresslike complex called a kraton he barred his 25 half siblings the children of the other five consorts and evicted those who had made their homes within its walls except for one shouting match when the expelled half siblings stormed the palace and had to be removed by the police , the two factions have not spoken since now people are asking what will become of the centuriesold sultanate of surakarta also known as the sultanate of solo , it has had no political power outside of the thick , whitewashed ramparts of the palace since the republic of indonesia stripped all royal families of power in 1946 but the kraton here sees itself as a keeper of javanese tradition of purity , refinement and cosmic spirituality and has continued to perform court rituals and to hold regal processions through the city its royal family , meanwhile , continues to behave as royal families so often do palaces have many intrigues , you know , said one of the evicted princes shortly after their father died , on june 12 , 2004 , each contending brother had himself crowned king pakubuwono xiii one coronation was held inside the palace , one outside , at the mansion of a friend when the time came to commemorate their father s death , palace insiders say , the princes carried out separate tombsealing rituals two teams of masons , two teams mixing cement , two solemn ceremonies the joke here is that with all this parallel activity , there might as well be one sultan of surakarta pakubuwono xxvi or perhaps there are none when the older prince , hangabehi , 60 , expelled the younger one , tejowulan , 52 , a sister who was the keeper of the keys was exiled from the palace along with him and hid the keys , according to a historian who has made it his business to follow the palace intrigues with the keys out of reach , neither those inside the palace nor those outside could open the giant padlocked doors of the chamber where palace treasures and ritual objects are kept , said the historian , soedarmono , a professor at the state university of indonesia here as a result , neither coronation included all the rites and the relics needed to anoint a surakartan king , he said there is no king , said mr soedarmono , who has just one name , like many indonesians neither one is king when you write about them , you can just call them mister as the last king lay dying , mr soedarmono said , several of his children drew up a document in his name appointing the younger prince as his successor they entered the king s hospital room and pressed his thumb onto the document for an official print when the police examined it , they could not verify the thumbprint because it was smudged , mr soedarmono said until the mass expulsion , the seventh of the half brothers , dipokusumo , was the accountant for the royal family in an interview outside the palace walls , he said the indonesian government had remained neutral , dividing an annual stipend between the feuding princes apart from that stipend , those members of the family who have incomes customarily support those who do not , said marlene heins , a dutch anthropologist who is close to the palace one brother supports himself partly from ticket fees to the palace museum one from fees for the use of its public lavatory one from parking fees , she said in balancing the current ledger of surakartan kingship , prince dipokusumo sounded a bit like an accountant through a looking glass either prince hangabehi is king , he said , or prince tejowulan is king , or both are king , or neither one is king who has the truth \? he said the truth will reveal itself almost four years after the death of the patriarch , that truth remains obscure the prince in the palace , hangabehi , does not speak to outsiders exiled family members say they do not even have his telephone number the other prince , tejowulan , does make himself available , chainsmoking through a latenight interview but he couches his words in regal enigma maybe hangabehi should give up his position and devote himself to spiritual matters , he said but please note that i am not asking for hangabehi to step down no prince tejowulan may have let slip a hint of his strategy when he talked about the scandal of the day the disappearance of ancient statues from the museum that is controlled by the palace artifacts from its collection have appeared on the international art market , said mr soedarmono , the historian , and several statues seem to be missing the police have questioned prince hangabehi about the thefts , though so far only as a witness i am certainly hoping that the legal process does not go further , no , prince tejowulan said but i believe that the law must take its course no one is above the law

when you speak thousands upon thousands of words in public each day , some of them are bound to come out a bit twisted from time to time especially during the grueling , sleepless , whatstatearewein final days of a presidential campaign most of the time they are not so much gaffes as odd verbal hiccups so there was senator john mccain , the republican presidential nominee , on sunday in wallingford , pa , offering up a novel description of supplyside economics with his observation that keeping taxes low creates jobs , keeps money in your pants and strengthens our economy and senator joseph r biden jr in melbourne , fla , on tuesday , mangling the name of the republican vicepresidential nominee as sarah mccain , and making each day seem extraordinarily long when he said there were seven more weeks until the election time often an elastic concept on the trail also tripped up his republican counterpart , gov sarah palin , who may be hoping that none of her supporters in canton , ohio , wait until wednesday to vote on a campaign stop there sunday ms palin told them , now with just three days from the election , the time for choosing is near two hours later in marietta , she corrected herself we are just two days away from the election ! and senator barack obama , the democratic presidential nominee , mixed up his fictional dogooders sunday in columbus , ohio , as he reached for a new simile to make his argument that mr mccain has been a sidekick to president bush he is like kato to the green lantern , he said you all remember that , those of you over a certain age \? if the remark drew little crowd reaction , perhaps it was because mr obama had the wrong green guy he apparently meant to say green hornet , to whom kato \( memorably played by bruce lee \) was the sidekick michael cooper
, a vigorous critic of the united states and a vocal ally of hugo ch vez , the washingtonbaiting president of venezuela , stirred alarm in many western and latin american capitals a year ago when it proposed its candidacy for the presidency of the  but last month it won the backing of the 33member latin american and caribbean group at the united nations with hardly a voice raised , and the endorsement , by acclamation , assures it of winning election to the oneyear post in the 192member general assembly in june latin american ambassadors anxious about the choice credit nicaragua with clever diplomacy in advancing its cause quietly , but they also fault the united states for not organizing competing forces effectively what the americans do when they really want to make their case forcefully is mobilize high officials , but they did n't in this case , they just talked to us in the corridors , said a south american ambassador , one of five from central and south america who agreed to discuss the matter if they were not identified because they were talking about another country several of them drew contrasts with washington s success in 2006 in blocking venezuela s candidacy for a security council seat latin american envoys said they wanted to avoid a battle like the one over venezuela , which took 48 ballots to decide they also noted that some of the countries most eligible for offering a rival candidate had reasons to stay out this time bolivia did not want to contest nicaragua , an ideological ally the dominican republic was smarting from having lost an election last year for a seat on the security council and costa rica , winner of that contest , now sits on the council nobody wanted another confrontation within the group , particularly one that would have been ideological , in which venezuela , with cuba and bolivia and ecuador , beat up on the americans and called countries that disagree puppets of washington , a central american ambassador said a south american envoy commended the nicaraguans for lobbying in a relaxed fashion they let the basic force be inertia , he said , noting that nicaragua did not even raise the matter at the group s monthly meetings until march , when it was formally proposed and adopted it was the perfect calculation , he said had they proposed it three or four months earlier , it would have encountered resistance and opposition could have consolidated kristen silverberg , the assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs , turned down repeated requests to discuss the development benjamin chang , a spokesman at the united states mission , said , we do n't comment on elections that have n't occurred yet a senior american diplomat , however , disputed the latin american ambassadors' contentions , saying that the united states had offered strategic advice to countries that it knew were against nicaragua , but that nobody took it he compared the situation to the thirdman rule in hockey where the third person in a fight , even one who is trying to break it up , gets expelled from the game they all were suggesting possible third men , but none of them was willing to be one , he said the man nicaragua has put forward to be the new president this fall is the rev miguel d'escoto brockmann , a catholic priest who was the foreign minister of the sandinista government from 1979 to 1990 and last year became a senior foreign affairs adviser to , the first sandinista president , when he returned to office mr d'escoto , 75 , was born in california , went to managua , the capital of nicaragua , as an infant and returned to the united states as a teenager for religious training and higher education he has spoken as critically of washington as mr ortega has , particularly during the period when united statesbacked contra rebels were trying to topple the sandinistas in managua mr ortega was in robust form this fall when he addressed the opening of the general assembly , railing against the tyranny of global imperialistic capitalism and calling the united states the most gigantic and powerful dictatorship that has existed in all the history of humanity he asked how the wish of north korea and iran to build atomic weapons could be questioned by a country that had dropped atom bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki the security council has taken repeated actions to curb the development of atomic weapons in iran and north korea the united states has nothing to worry about with nicaragua s presidency , said mar a rubiales de chamorro , the country s ambassador the central america of the 1980s is a thing of the past , and the united states has to understand that there is a new spirit of solidarity in the region she said that mr d'escoto would dedicate himself to strengthening the power of the general assembly , a body with a high proportion of developing countries and a festering resentment of the power of the 15member security council and its five vetobearing permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states the general assembly controls the united nations budget , but beyond that its power is limited since its resolutions , unlike those in the council , are nonbinding the president of the body does not vote on its decisions and has a largely consultative role , ruling on points of order and convening delegations to assess differences in position and build consensus one latin american envoy said nicaragua s candidacy did not arouse the passions that venezuela s did in 2006 because you can do a lot more damage as a member of the security council eduardo j sevilla somoza , nicaragua s former ambassador , who left his post a year ago after mr ortega s return to power , said mr d'escoto would have to adapt to the position s neutrality miguel wears his antiamericanism like a badge of honor , and he will have to be very careful and tone it down when he is here , he said if you take sides or use the ga presidency as a bully pulpit , you 're going to get into trouble very rapidly
charlottesville , va despite almost 15 million bombing sorties flown against germany during the second world war , the united states and britain failed for lack of trying to destroy the system of transport that fed the gas chambers and crematoria thirtyfive years later , america did not , despite its unquestioned naval supremacy , protect the vietnamese boat people that we and our two allies capable of projecting power , france and britain , are now distracted and divided by the wars in the middle east is terribly unfortunate for the people of darfur the genocide there is thus an unattended stepchild left to wellmeaning groups and individuals who further sap the possibility of decisive action by directing attention to delicate measures of relief and equally fragile diplomacy blankets are necessary , but they will not stop the razing of villages as sudan brazenly defies , if not the world s will , then , its wishes , and the death toll closes upon half a million , the pity is that the people of darfur can in fact be saved in concert with our allies or entirely alone , we have the military potential to accomplish this the multinational troops in darfur have neither the training nor the mobility to defend the population adequately seventyeight countries , each with its own rules of engagement , are represented in what is less a rescue mission than a camping trip to the tower of babel a possibly influential force is developing in chad , where the european union , soon to be supplemented by russian helicopters , will deploy weakly to defend a line drawn across largely empty desert but why not cross that line \? violating sovereignty is a matter of immense consequence and gravity then again , so is genocide although darfur is part of sudan , it is physically distant from the country s heartland and sources of military power every inch of the 600 miles of barren territory between khartoum and the killing grounds is an opportunity for a reprieve commanded by american air power with not a boot on the ground the sudanese military in darfur can be trapped there without sustenance , to wither or retreat as the bulk of sudanese forces are kept out and the janjaweed can be denied tangible support merely by severing the few extenuated routes of supply the first requirement of a cordon sanitaire , however , would be to cut all air links , which would require carrierbased air strikes to destroy the sudanese air force s 51 combat aircraft , 25 transports , and 44 helicopters \( all figures from the international institute for strategic studies \) its fuel , munitions and maintenance facilities and the few runways capable of supporting heavy transports and fighters were chad to approve a small expeditionary force of america s a10 tacticalairsupport planes , which it probably would , just a few of these could closely suppress remnant sudanese armor and check any force of the janjaweed militia sufficiently concentrated to overcome local means of selfdefense moreover , none of this would prove necessary were the united states willing to go further and threaten or accomplish the destruction of the sudanese regime s means to power over a country that has been pulled apart centrifugally by multiple secessions one need n't be squeamish about such a proposition it pertains to a government that has long massacred hundreds of thousands of its own people in its south and west , supported international terrorism and menaced most of its neighbors the precise targeting of a substantial portion of its 1 , 200 armored vehicles and 1 , 100 artillery pieces its telecommunications exchanges and microwave towers its dozen small naval vessels its aircraft , runways , munitions , military headquarters , logistical stores , security ministries and presidential residences would be only a few days' work for longrange bombers dispatched from remote bases , and the planes of two carrier task forces hastened to the red sea which would the regime in sudan prefer \?

a whole people , no matter how wretched or obscure , must certainly be worth three days of ammunition
milwaukee the changed managers , traded for an ace , clinched a postseason berth in game 162 and fell behind by two games to none in a firstround series and then , 26 years later , they did it again robin yount is the intergenerational link between the brewers' last two playoff teams , the 1982 bunch known as harvey s wallbangers and this year s edition , which does not have a nickname quite so catchy other than that , there are no similarities , yount , the brewers' bench coach , said , referring to the makeup of the two teams the brewers cannot escape associations to 1982 for reasons other than the retro uniforms they wear for friday night home games it is , after all , a convenient point of reference and yet , as weary as they are of hearing about their forebears , if the brewers can somehow erase their 20 deficit to the , those comparisons could be taken a step further the 1982 brewers , after losing the first two games of the american league championship series to the thencalifornia angels , won three straight at home to advance to the world series , where they lost to the st louis cardinals in seven games i did not know that , milwaukee second baseman ray durham said maybe fate s on our side now would n't it be nice if history repeated itself \? the brewers are concerned with more recent history the phillies , who won the 1980 world series the last time they captured the first two games of a playoff series , have won 15 of their last 18 , including six victories against milwaukee the last two came despite scoring in only 2 of 16 innings while their nos 3 , 4 and 5 hitters chase utley , ryan howard and pat burrell combined to go 1 for 17 with eight strikeouts the brewers' showing has been worse three runs , a 115 average and a total of five hits from their thumpers , ryan braun , prince fielder \( 0 for 7 \) , corey hart and j j hardy although unlikely to sympathize , the phillies can at least relate to the brewers' plight in what was their first postseason appearance since 1993 , the phillies capped a feverish drive last season by securing the division title on the final day of the regular season seemingly worn out , they came out flat against colorado and were swept even though we do n't think it did , the bottom line is that when you have to make that push , you make it and you feel like , whoa , you did it , ' philadelphia reliever j c romero said it makes you fatigued mentally , not so much physically rickie weeks , milwaukee s second baseman , said the brewers were too young to be tired , adding the usual platitudes about drawing strength and motivation from the obstacles they have overcome it was as if he was transported back in time just as this year s brewers entered september with a substantial lead \( five and a half games over philadelphia in the wildcard standings \) , yount s team began the final full month of 1982 with a fourandahalfgame advantage on boston in the al east the 1982 brewers had replaced buck rodgers with harvey kuenn as manager and acquired a star pitcher , don sutton \( in the role now occupied by c c sabathia \) sutton defeated baltimore on the final day of the season to secure the division championship milwaukee manager dale sveum , who hired yount in one of his first moves after taking over on sept 15 for ned yost \( yost was a backup catcher on the 1982 team \) , said he was aware of the 1982 comeback but did not plan to remind his players about it to bring up something like that would be like me walking in there and talking about the red sox or the yankees , said sveum , who was boston s thirdbase coach in the 2004 alcs , when the red sox overcame a 30 deficit to defeat the yankees players do n't really want to hear that perhaps , but they do appreciate looking around the clubhouse and seeing yount , a hall of famer who has succeeded in similar circumstances yount said he did not remember many details from those three victories against the angels other than throwing out rod carew to end game 5 i just knew we had to win , that s all , yount said
at one point in trajal harrell s 80minute quartet for the end of time each of the four performers comes to the front of the stage and says , more than once , i hope there is someone that will take care of me when i die i am afraid that appearing in this production may not prove their best way to realize that hope for about the first 20 minutes the audience watches collages of film and photographs , projected now on a screen facing the audience , now on screens placed sideways so that the view is at best oblique most of the rest of the show punctuated by a few episodes during which there is nothing and nobody onstage involves the performers changing and removing their clothes , walking on and offstage , kneeling and lying down sections of messiaen s eponymous quartet are played , along with rock , choral music and recorded dialogue , none apparently relevant there is a good deal of nudity although mr harrell calls his four performers dancers , the only passage that could sensibly be described as dancing occurs when one woman , wearing baggy pants and a loose top , gyrates her pelvis and upper body it lasts a few seconds i assume this , though thoroughly deeroticized , is the hootchykootchy dance to whose history mr harrell refers in a program note she does it pleasantly it s always fun to watch a dance where the pelvis does more than the feet but its only exceptional aspect is that nothing else here is dancelike what mr harrell keeps returning to is the gettingundressed repetitions maybe he hopes they will evoke an endofday atmosphere that in turn suggests the end of life and , as in the title , the end of time but such thoughts put beckett s rockaby into my head , with its haunting repetitions of time she stopped and close of a long day that comparison made mr harrell s repetitions seem dim and dreary instead the most interesting features are the mechanics of removing , folding and picking up clothes how various body parts hang when the performer is supine and when he or she is upright the different ways in which pubic hair grows and mr harrell seems to focus most on the problems how do you remove your jeans when lying down without using your hands \? how should you pick up clothes without bending at the knee \? these things here become more exciting than watching paint dry , but not by a wide margin
bangkok the secretary general , , flew on thursday to , where he hoped to pry open the door to more international aid at what he called a critical moment in the country s slow recovery from the that left at least 100 , 000 people dead or missing aid in myanmar should not be politicized , said mr ban , as he stopped in bangkok on wednesday our focus now is on saving lives but the opening offered by myanmar appeared to be a narrow one some analysts said the ruling generals were conceding only enough to defuse international pressure in the wake of the may 3 cyclone suspicious of foreigners bearing relief supplies , the government has so far barred any major flow of aid from the united nations and western donors on wednesday it said it would not allow delivery of aid from united states navy vessels waiting offshore mr ban is scheduled to meet the leader of the military junta , senior gen than shwe general shwe had previously not responded to mr ban s messages or taken his telephone calls mr ban was also scheduled to attend a meeting on sunday of international donors in yangon , where he hoped to help coordinate aid , along with myanmar s neighbors in the 10member , or asean myanmar agreed this week to let asean to coordinate a relief program and send in medical workers that opening falls far short of the huge relief operation that the united nations says is needed to help an estimated 25 million victims who face shortages of food and water and a growing threat of disease the official government newspaper , the new light of myanmar , said wednesday that the country would not accept relief supplies carried by the american vessels that are waiting , along with french and british vessels , outside its territorial waters the strings attached to the relief supplies carried by warships and military helicopters are not acceptable to the myanmarese people , it said we can manage by ourselves myanmar has many good neighborly countries the united states has insisted that it has no ulterior motive in offering disaster relief and has promised to withdraw its helicopters and personnel after deliveries have been made they are really fearful that the united states is involved in regime change as it has said from 1990 on , david steinberg , an expert on myanmar at george washington university in washington , said of the junta as a member of asean , they feel they can control the situation he said the motives and methods of the junta have not changed over the years when it is under pressure , the junta offers promises and calibrated concessions , but holds its ground the overwhelming motive is to keep power , mr steinberg said , and in order to do that you take off bits and pieces of pressure as you see the need but you do n't help people if you are going to jeopardize your superior role a burmese exile magazine , the irrawaddy , which is based in thailand , took the analysis a step further on tuesday , saying the burmese junta is still in the driver s seat asean , the un and the rest of the world are again being manipulated by the oppressive generals in washington , the united states ambassador to asean , scot marciel , said at a congressional hearing on tuesday that the door must be opened far wider and rapidly to prevent a second catastrophe of further death myanmar has set the death toll in cyclone nargis at about 78 , 000 , with nearly 56 , 000 missing , but the united nations and relief donors believe that at least 100 , 000 have died without an adequate and independent assessment of the situation and current needs , as well as a commitment by the regime to provide the necessary access , a pledging conference is unlikely to produce the results we seek , mr marciel said speaking in new york before his departure , mr ban said that he hoped to set up a logistics hub in myanmar or nearby , and that the united nations and asean could join in coordinating relief efforts he said the government had given permission for nine helicopters from the world food program to ferry aid to survivors , a significant softening of its blanket rejection of united nations aid workers further similar moves will follow including expediting the visas of relief workers seeking to enter the country , mr ban said i am confident that emergency relief efforts can be scaled up quickly he said a major increase in aid was urgent this is a critical moment for myanmar , he said we have a functioning relief program in place , but so far we have been able to reach only about 25 percent of myanmar s people in need in its commentary rejecting american aid , the new light of myanmar vented its concerns about foreign donors , saying they were a greater threat than the cyclone our country is going through a variety of stormlike plots and intrigues that are much severer than nargis , and they are endless , it said they are none other than envy storms , criticism storms and rumor storms created by certain western countries and national traitors at home and abroad who are showing negative attitudes toward our nation and our people
after all these years , all those dead bodies and so many criminal contortions of the law , the wiretap in the wire did n't bring the bad guys to justice perfect technology and good intentions could n't win out in sunday night s finale of the wire the best and most dyspeptic police drama on television would never conclude with a triumph of good over evil victories were few , and pyrrhic truth flickered here and there , but never really came to light some people received their comeuppance , but most did n't police work faltered and recouped a tattered , tainted form of justice was meted out , sort of some people were killed or worse \( alma , an honest reporter at the baltimore sun , was exiled to the carroll county bureau \) a few deserving people came out ahead , or at least even , but nothing really changed the drug trade thrives and the system in baltimore drifts on , corrupt and selfsustaining , held together by convenience and a lie too big to bring down david simon did not end his series the way the sopranos came to a close , in a frozen tableau of ambiguity the wire went out the way it came in five seasons ago , not so much tying up loose ends , though it did , as meticulously proving that there is no end for every major character who died or moved on , a new incarnation sprang up and the most poignant was probably michael , the young prot g of marlo , the drug kingpin the boy killed as he was told , but he questioned the logic and the fairness of each hit when he realized he was the next target , michael turned not into the next marlo , but the spitting image of his boss s nemesis , omar , a hunted man turned rogue hunter , preying on drug dealers with a shotgun under his coat which does n't mean there was n't a happy ending or two thanks to the same illegal wiretap that first got him into trouble , marlo walked , but it turned out he did n't have far to go throughout this season and last it was never quite clear whether marlo the most enigmatic of drug dealers was the true heir to stringer bell , the dealer turned businessman , or to avon barksdale , the dealer who could n't leave the streets in the finale marlo walked out of a meeting of real estate developers and found himself back on a corner , confronted by minor hoodlums , no longer really welcome even there and that was a vindication for omar , whose ahabsized obsession to punish marlo rose from the grave omar died goading marlo to come back down to the street , and marlo finally did , only to be taunted by corner boys loyal to omar s legacy the wire was always a tale of symmetry and disparity in each season the unfairness and corruption of the streets was mirrored in a different layer of society the police , the port , city hall , the schools and the media all along , individuals who tried to live up to their personal responsibilities were crushed by a vast , entangled system jerrybuilt to duck accountability detective jimmy mcnulty created the hoax to make the collar , and it cost him his job only because he felt compelled to come clean in the final episode his successor was anointed in a scene that pointedly echoed the first episode of the first season then a newcomer to the homicide squad , mcnulty revealed his insubordinate streak by complaining to judge daniel phelan about murky doings in the police department on sunday night viewers watched young detective leander sydnor complain to the same judge about the murky doings he witnessed in the department , and the detective did n't even see the half of it even the smartest , most truthseeking characters never fathomed the full picture gus , the cleareyed , honorable city editor , could n't steer his selfdeluded bosses at the baltimore sun away from a bum story , one that was mostly made up by scott templeton , the rat reporter gus was the first to suspect that scott fabricated quotations and facts , but even gus never guessed that the entire serialkiller story was a hoax , invented by mcnulty to force city hall to override budget cuts and provide the cars and manhours that he and detective lester freamon , the detective in love with his wiretap , needed to get marlo maybe you win a pulitzer with this stuff , gus warns his boss , and maybe you have to give it back but the odds were stacked in management s favor corruption within the newsroom was entwined with the scams and lies of city hall and the police department as norman , the mayor s cynical adviser , put it , everybody is getting what they need behind some makebelieve there were so many characters , all richly drawn , and none of them got the last laugh , not even norman , who saw the dark humor in everything when the mayor and his men learn that the serialkiller story they pumped up for political gain was invented by their own detectives , they were aghast and ashen norman was tickled it has a certain charm to it , he said they manufactured an issue to get paid , and we manufactured an issue to get you elected governor norman added that he almost wished he was still a reporter at the newspaper so that he could write an expos of the mess little did he know that the baltimore sun propped up the lie every happy ending came with a sad coda bubbles , the former addict and pariah , was at long last invited up the basement stairs to share a family meal in his sister s dining room but , of course , young , lost duquan took his place on the street , injecting the same drugs it took bubbles much of his life to overcome the wire ended at just the right time too soon and it s not that mr simon s series was the only intelligent drama on television the difference is that most smart shows try to dazzle viewers with what they do n't know house on fox throws out the rarest diseases and most farfetched diagnostic tools to update sherlock holmes and numb3rs on cbs twists every crime to fit an advanced mathematical formula the wire worked with primary sources that anybody could grasp if they looked closely out the window on the train from new york to washington it s the same view of baltimore abandoned row houses , gutted factories and bulletpocked store fronts that mcnulty takes in when he parks his car and looks down at the city from afar it is what it is , is what mcnulty and others would say to end a conversation the wire was what it was , and that was a lot
i saw my first belmont in 1986 it was run over a sloppy track on which danzig connection became the trainer woody stephens s fifth consecutive belmont stakes winner i knew it was a big deal for a trainer to win a triple crown race even once , but i was new to the sport , and even when the crowds began chanting woody ! woody ! i didn t fully appreciate how extraordinary this record was since then , i ve heard people compare this achievement to dimaggio s 56game hitting streak it s inconceivable that another trainer will ever win the belmont stakes five times in a row even though the race itself wasn t brilliant \( it was athletic and gutsy , under the circumstances i know i couldn t have run 50 yards through that mud without falling flat on my face \) , and even though i later read that stephens considered danzig connection the weakest of his five belmont winners , it was still a remarkable event i ve loved the belmont ever since that afternoon i love it with or without the possibility of a triple crown being awarded at the end of the day winning the belmont isn t easy it s a mileandahalf race around the only mileandahalf dirt track in north america a long , tough race even tougher if you ve contested the kentucky derby and the preakness in the preceding five weeks toughest of all if you ve won the derby and the preakness so tough that only 11 horses have ever done it , none in the last 30 years will it happen again saturday \? thinking about the possibility made me wonder about being the trainer of a horse in this position of course , first you have to have the horse every trainer says that and so far , only 11 horses have won the triple crown , so just by the numbers , most of the greatest trainers of all time hall of fame trainers , with strings of champion horses to their credit never had a triple crown winner only one sunny jim fitzsimmons has had two , omaha and gallant fox so , what makes a good trainer \? i found an answer at least , an answer that works for me in a letter written by jack mann in 1996 if you ve read the turf writers of the last 50 years , you ve probably come across mann s work if you re lucky , you may have come across the man in person he died in 2000 , and over the years of our friendship he would occasionally write long letters \( always recycled on the backs of old manuscripts \) sometimes he would send me an annotated draft of a letter he had written to some fool he was not suffering gladly in a note of protest to a fellow turf writer cum editor , he points out the ways the man s editing has altered both the tone and meaning of jack s original article jack had been an editor as well as a writer at newsday , and he goes on to say i am sure your education has included the classic text garst bernstein , with its central principle of editing that insofar as possible the words of a reporter should be preserved , which can be accomplished simply by making only those changes for which there is a reason essential as that was , it gets only a tie for the best counsel i ever had on editing the other came from elston howard , the late yankee catcher neither ellie s elocution nor his rhetoric will ever be confused with disraeli s or john llewelyn lewis s , but he got a message across to me in the lobby of the ratty cleveland hotel on a rainy day in 1965 in his early years he had hit enough to justify his existence as a catcher , but by 1963 he was hitting enough to be mvp i knew he credited batting coach wally moses , and i asked ellie if he could say what , precisely , wally had done for him wally don t make you hit like him , he said he makes you hit like you that , i ve decided , is the essence of a good trainer as well he or she makes each horse run like itself at the right level , when it s ready , where it has a chance and , this year , i think denis of cork has a very good chance to win the belmont jane schwartz is author of
paris i saw it coming as soon as tim russert cornered hillary clinton into naming vladimir putin s heir she dodged , ducked and plunged into the now famous med , vay , deva , whatever nobody thought the worse of her in fact , it drew one of the few sympathetic murmurs in the debate russian names are just not something most americans can do and if the blogs and online pronunciation guides i 've checked are any indication , they never will one expert on national public radio thought that medvedev , the way russians pronounce it , is simply alien to the american tongue but admitting that is alien to the american spirit , so there are many places to seek guidance the voice of america offers this phonetic spelling mehdv \( y \) ehdyehf they also provided a voice recording by a man who tried that in all fairness , he does a pretty good yehf but it s not a sound likely to make president dmitri medvedev turn around it reminded me of advice the englishlanguage moscow times gave to an actress in boston who had to do cherry orchard and needed help with names like boris borisovich semyonovpishchik the reply from a bilingual reporter was very thorough , discussing not only specific letters \( in pronouncing t , d , n the tongue must touch the upper teeth , not the alveolus like in english \) , but the preferred mindset \( perhaps because we tend to be lazy , the mouth muscles are not so tense as in speaking english \) i speak russian and tested some of the prescriptions , and found that i never touch the upper teeth with my tongue nor anything that comes up when i google alveolus the lazy part \? slander ! i suppose experts would say that we form our tongues and mouths in a certain way in childhood , and that all but a few oral contortionists are thereby doomed to speak every language but our own with an atrocious accent everybody who watches basketball or \( american \) football on french tv knows george eddy , a sportscaster with so brutal an american twang that it takes a while to realize he s speaking fluent french one of the ways we compensate for the difficulty of foreign names is by adopting our own way of saying them i once worked with an editor who spoke pretty good french , but used only the feminine article la , never le why , i finally asked \? oh , it sounds so much more french that way , he drawled by the same token , maria sharapova has become so familiar as sharapohva that the world tennis association offers it as the official pronunciation when i pronounce mr putin s first name the way russians do vludeemeer people look at me as a huddling mass still yearning to be american in english , of course , it s vlahdemeer and it s boris , not buhrees , as the russians have it \( remember that great exchange in young frankenstein \? frankenstein you must be eegor igor no , it s pronounced eyegor frankenstein but they told me it was eegor igor well , they were wrong then , were n't they \? \) russians have their own problems with american names , but the current presidential candidates do not pose a major challenge obama leaps the language barrier , and kleenton and makkayn are easy luckily , none have a th in their name , a sound russians eschew remember margaret techer \? with time , we will learn to cope with medvedev we overcame khrushchev , adopted rostropovich and cheer hockey players , ballerinas and tennis stars medvedev is as elemental as medved , russian for bear so launch with med as in he s off his med put the accent on the veh as in venomous , and trail off with a lazy dev with just a hint of z and i dziev altogether now medvehdziev whatever
i think the wind created me , says nicky gottlieb , the subject of today s man , a documentary that has its television premiere on tuesday night on most stations mr gottlieb , who in the film offers his theory of how the world was formed , has asperger s syndrome , a form of , and his sister , lizzie gottlieb , spent six years committing his life to film she depicts a highly intelligent man addicted to television , socially inappropriate , selfaware about his condition and negotiating the world with both humor and bewilderment physically , i'm a man , mr gottlieb says at the beginning of today s man , which tracks his quest , beginning at 21 , to hold a job , get an apartment , make friends but mentally and emotionally , i'm a boy i'm still a child his mother , the actress maria tucci , has to remind mr gottlieb to shower , for example we see his father , robert gottlieb , a dance critic for the new york observer and a former editor in chief of the new yorker , lovingly shaving a son who is often too distracted for that task in another scene the younger mr gottlieb , now 29 , confides to his sister that he likes the perks of living at home what is our future going to be like \? ms gottlieb , 36 , asks him , her only sibling i mean , what are you and i going to do when mommy and daddy are n't around \? what do you want your life to be like \? ms gottlieb and her parents are haunted by that question about her brother s future , she said in a recent interview his life and the intensity of their family journey pushed her to make the film , casting light on an adult with asperger s , a neurobiological condition people with the syndrome show a wide range of intelligence some are brilliant but characteristically have intense , narrow interests odd speech patterns and few social skills , among other symptoms often they seem to lack the ability to bond with others mr gottlieb is highfunctioning , bright enough to give italian lessons and tutor students in math he was a late talker , but at around 4 or 5 he would ask people their birth dates and instantly tell each of them the day of the week on which the date fell as a child , i thought i had this magical brother , ms gottlieb said we assumed there was no one else in the world like him it s harder now , as it became clearer that there is no magical answer to nicky s problems he still lives at home , she said , but is now seeing a young woman with asperger s ms gottlieb , a theater and film director who was a founder and producer of pure orange productions , a theater company for new off broadway plays , has taken today s man to several film festivals \( margaret mead , nantucket , mendocino \) mr gottlieb has accompanied her to about 20 screenings today s man , part of the independent lens series on pbs , can be seen in new york on friday pbs s web site has information about the film and links to resources the gottlieb family coped without such help asperger s syndrome was not diagnosed until mr gottlieb was about 20 , following years of various therapies , schooling arrangements and medication his parents , sophisticated people in a sophisticated city , did not even hear the word asperger s until he was 20 , ms tucci says in today s man still , she says , she knew within days of his birth that her son was different he nursed oddly , she says , could not bond , had and later developed  the doctor calls and says , mrs gottlieb , it s the worst it s very bad , ' she recalls in the film he may never talk , he may never walk he may become blind , deaf and dumb none of the worst came to pass mr gottlieb s parents watched as he began hitting developmental milestones and when his sister was making the documentary \( stopping for the birth of and a bout of now vanquished \) , she even found an old film of nicky saying his first word , bread , a piece of history relegated to a cupboard in her parents' manhattan home lynda geller , the clinical director of the asperger institute at the new york university child study center , said that today s man called much needed attention to the problems of adults with the syndrome the institute treats children and adults with asperger s , and dr geller said she received calls frequently from adults with the syndrome who have not yet received a diagnosis we need a lot more creative solutions for independence , she said to me , looking at the job world and independence later in life are critical asperger s syndrome was added to the american psychiatric association s diagnostic reference in 1994 and although the centers for disease control estimate that there are 560 , 000 people under age 21 with autism in this country , there is no good data on adults a few weeks ago tina brown , another former editor in chief of the new yorker , was host of a screening of today s man in midtown manhattan the audience included journalists and parents of people with asperger s ms brown introduced lizzie gottlieb and nicky gottlieb mr gottlieb said jokingly that he was bored from seeing the film over and over but was proud of his sister for making it ms brown fielded questions from the audience members , who wanted to know what mr gottlieb did for a living and if he was aware of his limitations ms brown asked mr gottlieb if he declared his disability in social situations most of the people i meet have been warned about me , he said in his tongueincheek way , making the audience laugh ms gottlieb ends her film with mr gottlieb singing , offkey and unselfconsciously
i start my survey of what to look forward to with one regret it s my loss that i 've scheduled my vacation during new york city center s annual fall for dance season in late september , a festival that is an education in itself this year s six programs make an ideal mix dances new york is known to love \( the paul taylor dance company in esplanade , the merce cunningham dance company in sounddance \) dances admired in new york that i have yet to see myself \( twyla tharp s sweet fields as danced by aspen santa fe ballet \) dance productions that i have admired outside new york but have not seen here \( the suzanne farrell ballet in balanchine s rare pithoprakta , oregon ballet theater in christopher wheeldon s rush , the dayton contemporary dance company in asadata dafora s awassa astrige ostrich solo \) dances seen too seldom here or elsewhere \( jane dudley s harmonica breakdown as danced by sheron wray \) and companies or dancers of which tantalizingly little is known here \( like the pichet klunchun dance company of thailand and the lombard twins from argentina \) if there is one dancer among the many who would tempt me to rush back from my holiday , it is madhavi mudgal , the glorious exponent of the indian odissi style when i first saw her several years ago in edinburgh and london , i thought that she was one of the most poetic dancers of any genre in the miraculously full length of her phrases , the variety of her rhythm , the beautiful arcs shown by her arms and the focus of her eyes , she seemed to be indian dance s counterpart to margot fonteyn the year 2008 continues to enjoy its anniversaries the antony tudor centenary reaches its climax in american ballet theater s fall season , with six of his ballets \( jardin aux lilas , judgment of paris , pillar of fire , the romeo and juliet pas de deux , continuo , the leaves are fading \) revived in whole or part the jerome robbins anniversary likewise continues \( a robbins tribute as part of fall for dance on sept 26 and 27 , on the town in november , both at city center \) and the alvin ailey company celebrates its 50th anniversary with a fiveweek christmas season , including several performances of live music , with appearances by jessye norman and wynton marsalis must new york be surpassed by other american cities in commemorating the centenary of the creation of diaghilev s ballets russes in 2009 \? join us , says the web site for ballet west in salt lake city , to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of a company that brought together some of the greatest composers , artists , choreographers and librettists ever assembled if salt lake city can stage an adventurous diaghilev triple bill \( the fokineborodinroerich polovetsian dances from prince igor , the balanchineprokofievrouault prodigal son and the nijinskapoulenclaurencin les biches , in late march and early april \) , and if the joffrey ballet in chicago and boston ballet are also honoring diaghilev , you have to wonder what will new york s ballet companies do in his name \? so far , zilch there will be diaghilev exhibitions in boston \( 808 gallery at boston university \) , hartford \( wadsworth atheneum \) and new york \( donald and mary oenslager gallery of the new york public library , diaghilev s theater of marvels the ballets russes and its aftermath \) and a boston festival will include a diaghilev symposium , diaghilev concerts , diaghilev ballets and other special events is new york to be outdone \? probably after all , new york is often outdone by other american cities when it comes to its own choreographers this year , let one example suffice merce cunningham s xover \( pronounced crossover \) was the outstanding new work of 2007 , with the last stage designs ever made by robert rauschenberg before his death in may london will see it in october , berkeley , calif , in november new york may never if you like this city s best choreographers , you have to keep traveling out of town to see their work i end with another regret in early october , when i will be reviewing abroad , rachid ouramdane performs diptyque with pascal rambert at performance space 122 i predict nothing , but i state that of all the choreographers whose work i 've discovered since starting this job in 2007 , i have found none more strangely , painfully eloquent or imaginative than mr ouramdane new york does n't do justice to the choreographers who live and work here , but it remains the best place to see the spectrum of those who do n't
won the heisman trophy in 1996 and led the florida gators to the national championship that season he played in the nfl for six seasons before becoming involved with desire street ministries , which is devoted to causes in the inner city he is now the chief executive of the nonprofit desire street , which is based in atlanta first thing is he wins football games people love winners second , he combines several aspects in a football player that usually do n't end in the same person he throws the ball accurately , like a dan marino , but he also runs the ball powerfully , like a mike alstotttype of fullback he plays with the emotion of a middle linebacker , which inspires teammates and fans , but he also plays levelheaded as a quarterback rarely do you find a player who can be an emotional spark plug for their team and play the role as the calm , collected quarterback none every now and then i feel a little spark , then i will notice guys like kurt warner getting concussions the other reason is i am just so passionate about what i am doing now that i could not imagine going back there was a point several years ago when i was with desire street in new orleans when peyton manning broke marino s record for touchdowns , and i was visiting with a kid and i saw this picture of peyton manning i looked at the kid and i looked at the manning picture , and there was no question i would n't have changed places with peyton when you work in the inner city , it takes a very long time to develop trust with the people you work with , so you have to be involved in the community and working in the community for a long time the other challenge is these are underresourced communities , and the resources to get the job done are very scarce
ten years ago the japanese rock band boris made a record called amplifier worship some much less serious band was bound to come up with that title , so it was good that boris claimed it first , as a perfect twoword poem of intent this band deals out volume in striated , fuzzedout clouds there s a lot going on in there , if you can take it and it transmits a feeling of transparency and piety toward its sources on thursday night at webster hall , boris was often a vessel , seemingly transmitting some other band or performer blue cheer , keiji haino , the melvins the show could be taken as sweet , abrasive , studious , solemn , weird , a greasy gift for the senses all those things and possibly none in the end , wellhandled , nearly unbearable volume was the show s ultimate meaning , its deep agenda boris sinks into its work in different ways wata , the small , slight guitarist , looked down at her guitar and the effects and volume pedals , making vast and edgeless tones , powerchording with minimal hand movement takeshi , the singer and bassist , stayed both central and invisible , hiding behind a basically characterless but pitchaccurate rock croon the drummer , atsuo , was an elegant cartoon of rock charisma as ritual flamboyance he wore a white satin shirt and white gloves he played translucent orange drums and a large gong on a slow , sad song , he ceremoniously raised a stick high in the air between downbeats , closing his eyes and pointing to the ceiling instead of incense , there was dry ice , shot out from the sides of the drum kit boris usually tours and records as a power trio , blue cheerstyle , but the band has recently had an onandoff fourth member , the great guitarist michio kurihara of the band ghost , who plays on parts of boris s new album , smile a lot of smile , and thus a lot of thursday s show , is almost ironically basic music fast or slow metal and punk with simpleminded riffs wata maintained those riffs through the songs , and throughout them mr kurihara played expressive , original leads , using tone and texture instead of metal s standard paganinishred language in a fast thrash song , buzzin , he swept a metal slide up the neck , devastatingly slowly in others he played stinging , attenuated high notes , detailing them with his whammy bar , making them leap above the noise and dive back into it he was full of ideas , even when others played dumb
east rutherford , nj it seemed a complicated question , but r w mcquarters had a oneword answer if so many nfl wide receivers are tall , he was asked , why are so many cornerbacks not even six feet \? hips , said mcquarters , a veteran defensive back football is a game of inches , the axiom goes , but that usually refers to distance , not height yet one of the most anticipated oneonone matchups in football , a wide receiver against a cornerback , is often decided by who is taller some of the league s top receivers , including several in this weekend s games , are unusually tall randy moss of the patriots is 6 feet 4 inches sunday s national football conference playoff game will feature giants receiver plaxico burress \( 65 \) and cowboys receiver terrell owens \( 63 \) they are players that opposing defenses build game plans around none of the players covering them is nearly as tall increasingly rare is a receiver under 6 feet and just as rare is a cornerback taller hips that is one answer , and probably the best covering a receiver is mostly a horizontal endeavor , not a vertical one to stay close , a cornerback must mirror an opponent , with little warning of directional shifts and he must often do it running backward it s hard for those guys to copy routes when you 're tall and gangly , giants general manager jerry reese said and it s hard to change directions when you 're going backwards it s easier when you 're going forward but when you 're backward , smaller guys are more apt to be able to copy the moves of the receiver that is why cornerbacks are often built more like gymnasts and sprinters than receivers the ability to move is more important than the ability to reach you gotta have hips , said mcquarters , a 10year veteran who is 510 all the short guys got the hips the tall guys , they do n't need as much hips to run routes but in order to cover , because if you open up and he goes this way he swung his hips one way and pointed the other then you got to open your hips back up some of the top receivers including the patriots' wes welker \( 59 \) , who tied cincinnati s t j houshmandzadeh \( 61 \) with a leaguehigh 112 receptions are small and shifty the colts' reggie wayne \( 60 \) , the seahawks' bobby engram \( 510 \) and the packers' donald driver \( 60 \) led their teams in receptions height is usually not a factor until a ball is thrown high , and then it becomes a big one , especially near the end zone of the six wide receivers in the league to catch 12 or more touchdowns , five are 61 or taller they include moss , owens , burress , houshmandzadeh and cleveland s braylon edwards the sixth is green bay s greg jennings , who is 511 eli manning has made many big plays when he lobbed a pass that only burress and not his shorter opponent could reach we 've been able to take advantage of some of the mismatches that i have had , burress said going down in the red zone , or maybe just a short field , where you do n't necessarily have to be that fast , just be in the right position where you can get your hands up on the football burress will face cornerbacks terence newman \( 511 \) and anthony henry \( 61 \) owens , if his sore ankle does not keep him from playing , will mostly be covered by the giants' tallest cornerbacks , corey webster and aaron ross each is 6 feet webster , talking about his height , asked how tall owens was hearing it , he smiled i think it would be good to be a little taller , he said size is one reason why the giants chose webster in the second round of the 2005 draft and ross in the first round last april it is also why webster , who has drifted up and down the depth chart , has been granted so many chances to play corey is ideal , reese said wednesday as he stood on the sideline at practice he looks exactly like you want a corner to look he s a prototype pro bowl corner , actually , him and aaron ross they 're similar in their build you get a guy 6 foot , 200 pounds , that s a really nice size for a corner outstanding size ideal size the only thing better is an anomaly like san diego s antonio cromartie , who is 62 cromartie had 10 interceptions and was named to the allpro team when you can get a tall guy who can do what cromartie does , that s unusual , reese said you get the best of both worlds when you get a guy with length well , that and hips extra points center shaun o'hara \( knee \) showed steady improvement all week and will probably play sunday cornerback sam madison \( stomach \) did not practice , but will go to dallas with the team coach tom coughlin said he was happy with practices all week , and with the team s chipper attitude to realize the situation that they are in , to be excited about it , to have fun with it , coughlin said of his message to the players
san antonio danilo gallinari reacquainted himself with the inside of a magnetic resonance imaging machine on tuesday , hoping to get a clearer picture of his nba future gallinari is still bothered by a bulging disk and has been unable to show off the dazzling play that prompted the to make him the sixth pick over all in the last june he stayed in new york for more tests while the knicks tried to extend their best start in eight years they have won four of their first six games their best start since the 20001 season entering tuesday s game against the spurs his back just flared up again , coach mike d'antoni said he was making progress , and then one morning he said he could n't put his pants on test results were not immediately available team officials are hopeful that gallinari can avoid surgery , but they cannot rule it out i'm worried about it at this point , d'antoni said we 're just going to do what s best for him he s 20 years old we 'd love for him to play in the next two or three weeks , we 'd love for him to play in the next two or three months but he s got to be 100 percent well the knicks had relatively few concerns after their quick start gallinari injured his back in the knicks' first summer league game , in early july , and has never fully recovered he missed most of training camp and has played only 11 minutes this season , none since the second game in practice , gallinari has hardly resembled the fluid , quickfooted player the knicks saw in milan , italy he sees things , and he sees the ball , and his body just wo n't respond , d'antoni said when he does play , he s tough , he puts his nose in , so there s a lot of great things that we like there is plenty of time for gallinari to make an impact , but it appears more likely that his rookie season will be devoted to simply getting healthy the frontcourt rotation is solid , with zach randolph , david lee and wilson chandler jared jeffries could return by the end of the month , leaving few minutes at the two forward spots i'm not ready to say he s not going to play this year i'm not ready to say that in a month or two he wo n't be ready , d'antoni said but realistically , i do n't think anybody really knows i'm not worried about it i think the only thing we 're worried about is get him 100 percent well and if it takes all year , it takes all year but we 're not going to push him if there were any lingering doubts that stephon marbury has no future with the knicks , mike d'antoni dispelled them tuesday with one subtle roster move eddy curry , who cannot play because of a sore knee , was activated to take gallinari s spot on the roster marbury was left on the inactive list , where he has been since the second game of the season i just think it s better that i'm going to play my guys and that s who s going to play , d'antoni said so there s no reason to change course right now marbury , who has refused to negotiate a contract buyout , is making nearly 22 million this season , making him the league s highestpaid spectator it is an awkward situation , but spurs coach gregg popovich seemed sympathetic to d'antoni s position nobody wants to be in that situation , he said my feeling on what i may or may not do with the team is always based on what s good for the group i owe more responsibility to the group than i do to any one individual so there s never going to be one individual that s going to make my decisions for me david lee has a bone spur on his left ankle , a painful injury that might have something to do with his slow start to the season lee , however , is not speculating on cause and effect i'm playing in some pain , but i'm able to still contribute , lee said for now , i'm not really too worried about anything lee collected only seven rebounds over a recent threegame span , then lost his starting job to wilson chandler he bounced back with an eightrebound , eightpoint effort against utah on sunday and said the ankle felt better in the second half of the game lee said the pain was manageable and that he does not expect to need surgery but , he added , i'm sure it s not going to be real comfortable at times
orlando , fla perhaps no state in recent presidential politics is more resonant than , which democrats would love to recapture after two straight defeats that included the bitter recount of 2000 and florida is a state that senator must win to seize the presidency but after coasting through the summer , mr mccain , the republican nominee , is falling behind in many recent polls emblematic of the challenge was the experience of two republican canvassers who appeared at beth moriarty s door in orlando on thursday looking for her husband s vote her response was blunt y'all are totally at the wrong house , ms moriarty said my husband , he s 62 , he has never voted for a democrat in his entire life until tuesday senator , the democratic presidential nominee , has a litany of structural advantages to help him with only days to go , the obama campaign has more of just about everything offices \( 100 to mr mccain s 80 \) , advertising money \( outspending the mccain campaign four to one in some weeks \) and voter registrations \( a 660 , 000 democratic edge over republicans , up from 280 , 000 in 2006 \) none of this is destiny , of course , in such an unpredictable state every poll since sept 12 \( 50 of them \) shows a gap of single digits between the candidates , which could be closed by any number of lastsecond surprises mr mccain , who spent time stationed here in the navy , has recently revived what had been a flagging effort on oct 23 , he crossed florida from daytona beach to sarasota , hammering energetically on an economic theme , telling audiences that obama s tax increases would put even more people out of work with unemployment in florida at its highest rate in 14 years , the message will no doubt be heard the state and national republican party have also amplified the argument with television advertisements and one particularly blunt mailer that said , barack obama s solution is to take more of your money ! but , according to analysts and voters , the shift toward economic issues amounts to mr mccain playing on the democrats' turf , putting florida once again in the crosshairs of both campaigns we need to bring our best game these last couple days before the election , said george lemieux , the former campaign manager for gov charlie crist , a republican he expressed hope that the republican field operation would prevail there are a lot of republicans who have been through a lot of battles before , he said they know the game

beijing it was so surreal to be here , to listen to people debate whether he is the greatest athlete in olympic history after he passed a group that included the runners carl lewis and paavo nurmi to become the one with the most gold medals phelps is a selfdescribed klutz , a real fish out of water on land , and he has a surgical scar on his right wrist to prove it in october he took a nasty stumble that imperiled his pursuit of s single games record of seven gold medals phelps , 23 , slipped on a patch of ice and fell while climbing into a friend s car in michigan and broke his right wrist it made for a tough start to the training cycle that carried him through these beijing games , but the climax was perfect on sunday morning , phelps swam the butterfly leg on the united states 4x100meter medley relay that held off australia in a world recordsetting victory , giving phelps his eighth gold medal of these games and his 14th over all i wanted to do something nobody ever did , phelps said this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing  spitz s record lasted 36 years , and it figures to be even longer before the world sees phelps s successor in 1972 , spitz swam two strokes , the freestyle and the butterfly , and none of his swims covered more than 200 meters phelps swam all four strokes , at distances ranging from 100 to 400 meters , and faced three rounds in each of his five individual events , one more round than spitz had i think it s probably one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen , said brendan hansen , who swam the breaststroke leg in the winning relay sunday the shame of it is other athletes are n't going to realize how hard it is the world is fast in swimming right now the world was not fast when mark spitz did his seven how fabulous was phelps s feat \? at sunday s start , the person s republic of michael would have ranked fourth in gold medals and been ahead of all but 14 countries in the medal count phelps s longtime coach , bob bowman , has been preparing him for this since phelps made his first olympic team , in the 200 butterfly , as a 15yearold in 2000 in the beginning it seemed foolhardy , sending phelps out to swim 17 races over nine days as time went on , one could see bowman s vision crystallizing at the 2004 olympics in athens , phelps won six gold medals and two bronzes swimming the same program at the 2007 world championships , he won seven golds , missing a shot at an eighth when a relay he would have raced was disqualified in a preliminary heat every time phelps dived into the water for a final here , the ripples extended into every corner of the water cube on saturday , the andrew lauterstein of australia won the bronze medal in the 100 butterfly standing on the medals podium alongside phelps , lauterstein said , he was thrilled to have had a cameo role in this recording of history i was saying to myself , this is pretty special , ' he said look around and try to remember this moment' lauterstein s countrywoman , liesl jones , who won two golds and a silver here , said i just feel very privileged that i got to watch michael phelps win eight gold medals that s been the highlight of my olympics these games produced many unforgettable swims with phelps contributing to seven , 25 world records fell , 10 more than were broken at the 2007 world championships in melbourne , australia the pool was conducive to fast times it was three meters , or 10 feet , deep , with two empty lanes on either side serving as buffers to keep waves from ricocheting the new corsetlike suits , which shoehorn the swimmers' bodies into more streamlined positions , also had a role in the record assault not to be overlooked is the psychological component when one swimmer achieves what was once unthinkable , be it phelps breaking 1 minute 43 seconds in the 200meter freestyle or 4 04 in the 400meter individual medley , it makes every barrier suddenly look vulnerable when you come out and swim fast times , people realize that it can be done , grant hackett , a threetime medalist in the 1 , 500meter freestyle , said you set that bar a bit high and people are going to come with you as the meet went on , the otherworldliness of phelps s performance found expression in other swimmers' tales in the men s 50 freestyle final on saturday , the goggles of eamon sullivan , the australian worldrecord holder , filled with water on his dive and he never recovered , finishing sixth in the third of phelps s five individual events , the 200meter butterfly on wednesday , his goggles were leaking so badly he could not see the ends of the pool counting his strokes to gauge where the walls were , he won and shaved sixhundredths of a second off his 17monthold world record katie hoff came to beijing billed as the female phelps because she , too , had qualified in five individual events at the united states olympic trials after performing well below expectations and collecting one silver and two bronze medals , hoff said her program had been too ambitious michael is doing what he s doing , she said , and it kind of makes the rest of us look like if we do n't win a gold medal hoff s voice trailed off swimmers who , by any yardstick other than phelps , were wildly successful here , were among the awed the individual medley specialist stephanie rice , who became the fifth australian to win three gold medals in a single olympics , said , i do n't even know how he does it rice , who , like phelps , competed in the 200 and 400 individual medleys and the 4x200 freestyle relay , became worn down from the stress and got sick i just do n't even know how he holds himself together , she said there was one night when phelps s spirit felt weak on friday night , after winning the 200 im and racing in the semifinals of the 100 butterfly , he said , i was absolutely to the point of where i was like , oh my gosh phelps was absolutely to the point of despair after the fracture was discovered in his wrist last fall bowman said that when they talked immediately after the accident , phelps was as upset as bowman had ever seen him he was devastated , bowman said he kept saying , it s over i'm finished' the bad circumstance ended up doing phelps a world of good for a few weeks after the surgery , phelps was confined to kicking in the pool with a kickboard while his teammates swam all that kicking strengthened phelps s legs , which was like a fish growing more gills phelps was already blessed with a killer kick , but his added strength was evident on the turns in his races here and at the finish of the 100 butterfly , his seventh event in the last five meters , an exhausted milorad cavic was dragging his legs while phelps used a strong kick to get his hands to the wall first , by a hundredth of a second with his victory in the 100 butterfly , phelps tied spitz s record swimming the third leg of sunday s relay , phelps propelled the americans to first place from third , adding to his legend the team of aaron peirsol , hansen , phelps and jason lezak was timed in 3 2934 , 134 seconds faster than the 4yearold world record , set by the united states at the athens games , and 070 of a second ahead of australia on the freestyle leg , lezak s split of 4676 070 of a second slower than his gallant effort in the 4x100 freestyle was enough to hold off sullivan with 16 overall olympic medals , phelps is behind only the former soviet gymnast laryssa latynina , who has the most , with 18 over three games this is all a dream come true , he said doing all best times winning every race everything was accomplished that i wanted to do it s been one fun week , that s for sure throughout this journey , phelps has insisted he was not following spitz s footsteps but forging his own path i want to be the first michael phelps , not the second mark spitz , he has said repeatedly before traveling here from baltimore , phelps s mother , debbie , received a letter from barbara kines , who had taught phelps in the third grade before he found an outlet for his abundant energy in swimming , phelps had immense difficulties concentrating and sitting still , leading one of his gradeschool teachers to wonder if he would ever be able to focus on anything kines , recalling those days , wrote about how proud she was of phelps and how , perhaps

brian bassett , the leader of the popular , which is a partner with , will help us analyze the jets after each game readers are welcome to submit their grades and opinions after the season is over , i think many of us jets fans will look back at this loss to the raiders as a watershed after looking at many of the players faces in the postgame news conferences and in interviews elsewhere , it s clear that this team was humiliated and demoralized by losing 1613 in overtime to a 14 raiders team that puts the fun in dysfunction what remains to be seen is what way the water will flow will the jets rally around one another and prove the pundits , the press and their fans wrong , over the course of the rest of the season \? or will the jets roll over for the remaining 10 games , trying to avoid injuries , with many of the players enjoying the much larger checks that the johnson family was kind enough to start cutting for their players as of last march \? quarterback is favre being transformed into chad pennington with dink and dunk passes before our very eyes \? last year favre averaged 78 yards per passing attempt , good for sixth in the league six games into this season , he s averaging a tepid 68 yards per pass , 21st in the league are you ready for this \? it might sting chad pennington is having his best year as a starter in yards per attempt with 81 , good enough for 4th best in the league among active starters favre threw two more interceptions , one which was not all his fault the second i lay at favre s feet after getting sacked at his own 11 , favre hauled back on the next play and let er rip down his right sideline into the waiting arms of a raiders defensive back the nearest jet was at least 15 yards away the legend of favre s game against the cardinals might become his worst enemy after a rough first month , favre rallied and delivered a sixtouchdown performance in rainy conditions the expectations of many fans were raised after an ugly win at home against cincinnati and now an ugly loss on the road against the raiders in which he fumbled three times \( none lost \) , it s hard to know whether good brett bad brett will show up on any given day the only touchdown drive was one in which favre only threw one pass coincidence \? whichever favre shows up seems to be a key factor in whether they win or lose in his postgame presser , favre looked crushed good now he knows how i feel today grade d wide receivers the raiders cornerback duo of deangelo hall and nmandi asomugha shut down jerricho cotchery , who only grabbed one catch for zero yards amidst a number of dropped passes by jets receivers , laveranues coles and chansi stuckey had a decent days , but the only real bright spot among the receivers was brad smith , who did his best work rushing the ball , and had four catches for 59 yards grade c tight ends chris baker got involved early when the jets went into a spread and caught four passes on the first drive , but quieted down after that with one other catch bubba franks was injured late in the game and dustin keller had another quiet day at the office , catching one pass for six yards the unit did a good job in supporting the run blocking , but might have been better helping out against the pass rush grade c running backs i have to give credit where credit is due , thomas jones had the second best day of his career , running 24 times for 159 yards because of that , the jets were able to use leon washington effectively he ran 3 times for 19 yards and a touchdown both runners averaged over a whopping six yards a carry the team totaled 242 yards on the ground , one of the very few bright spots of this offensive unit grade a offensive line conventional wisdom going into this game was that the jets had good pass protection but bad rushing results in oakland , the converse was true the line was opening holes the size of the holland tunnel , but favre got hit early and often and came up favoring his arm and shoulder more than a few times all told , the line allowed three sacks , many quarterback hits and five tackles for a loss toward the end of the game , the jets used wayne hunter frequently as an extra tight end in pass protection , which seemed to work better grade c defensive line this line controlled scrimmage much of the game with five tackles for losses and numerous disruptions into the backfield , the defensive line held oakland rb justin fargas to a 28 yard per carry average this is a good defensive line , the best that mangini has coached so far in new york i love both the starters and sub package on passing downs , but they didn t didn t get pressure to the quarterback late in the game once jamarcus russell got into a rhythm i don t hold the line responsible , because it appeared to me that the jets weren t sending extra blitzers often enough to really help out grade a linebackers the linebackers played a quiet game , and were unable to disrupt the raiders with turnovers , quarterback hits or sacks they often dropped into coverage but it didn t seem to help , as darren mcfadden and zach miller accounted for more than half the team s reception yards on just seven plays grade c secondary the corners and safeties had an easy assignment this week javon walker and chaz schilens didn t provide much of a real threat even so , the jets corners and secondary only accounted for three passes defensed on russell s 30 passes , compared with the raiders seven on favre s 38 passes eric smith , back from suspension , and abe elam are outdoing each other to prove the point that the jets need to draft or sign a safety this offseason and kerry rhodes is still on the milk carton when it comes to creating impact plays grade c special teams the jets faced one of the league s best special teams units , and this was a large part of the loss with a kicker with incredible range , and a punter with the league s best average , if the game came down to field position \( as it did in overtime \) , it was a matter of time before the jets would lose \( which they did \) let s start with the good part when the kicks counted , jay feely hit all his , including a seasonbest 52yarder to put the game into overtime , that after tom cable tried to ice feely and he missed it the bad news the normally surehanded leon washington muffed a punt at his 16 that turned into three raiders points on the next possession the punt return unit blew an unforgiveable fourthdownandtwo fake punt to the upback , who ran , not just for the needed two yards , but twenty more before being tackled the continued drive put the raiders up by three with five minutes to go in the fourth quarter the jets were not able to create yardage on specials , normally easy yardage for this team grade f coaching for the first two years of mangini s regime , i didn t mind it when the team lost to a much better team like the colts , bears or patriots i thought that someday mangini would have the team he wanted and those tough losses would change now in his third year , mangini is still losing to good teams and can t seem to beat bad teams either the raiders committed 14 penalties , allowed the jets to run for 240 yards , and the team still lost because of turnovers there were penalties at the worst times , a bad pass rush and terrible special teams play jamarcus russell might have all the tools , but he s just not a good quarterback yet somehow , the jets made a guy who was completing 56 percent of his passes look good by continuing to rush just three or four players , which burned the jets on the raiders last drive to allow russell to have so much time to find open receivers was mindboggling grade d
with a look ahead to valentine s day and a nod to rodney dangerfield , the classical music critics of the new york times find themselves in a confessional mood and have decided to reveal some of their secret musical passions works and performances they listen to for sheer pleasure but perhaps not loudly when neighbors are around to hear they may be works deemed trivial by the lofty daytoday standards of the art , performances that are dated and thus scorned or condescended to , manifestations of musical personalities that attract a fascination bordering on unseemly obsession in any case , these are items that get no respect from the critics' highminded colleagues , their families , even their pets or at least not enough respect but it is hard to be highminded all the time and as much as critics may bristle at all those wrongheaded compilations of movements or snippets from timeless masterworks billed as music to relax by , sleep by , slip into a coma by , a sort of musical comfort food or sweetmeat is not a bad thing none of this is surprising or controversial now that classical music has begun to reaccommodate itself to popular music and culture but pops are another matter the various light classics waltzes and marches , bonbons and trifles , schmaltz generally that used to be the mainstay of pops concerts before even pops purveyors got too hip for much of it this fringe repertory gets little respect from pop or classical devotees so anthony tommasini , in particular , is putting himself on the line with his choice of leroy anderson fiddlefaddle indeed ! the absolute master of the light orchestral piece was leroy anderson , born in cambridge , mass , in 1908 in its way the syncopated clock is as rhythmically supple as anything by prokofiev the typewriter makes me happier than the overture to rossini s barber of seville you can keep vivaldi s four seasons i 'll take anderson s threeminute fiddlefaddle want to make something of it \? the art of composing short , popular pieces for orchestra used to be a thriving concern churning out stylish waltzes was the profitable family business of the strausses in 19thcentury vienna brahms , among others , was green with envy today , sadly , composers and conductors tend to frown on the light orchestra piece anderson , who died in 1975 , showed a knack for the genre early on when he was a student at harvard , his music professors did n't know what to make of him his sober compositions were a little hamhanded , and he wasted time , his teachers thought , conducting the harvard band and playing the accordion but arthur fiedler , the young conductor of the boston pops , heard some anderson arrangements of harvard songs and put him to work as an orchestrator in 1938 anderson wrote jazz pizzicato and jazz legato , which became immediate audience favorites some 50 such pieces would follow blue tango , written and recorded in 1951 , sold a million records , the first orchestra work to reach that position on the hit parade blue tango is a perfect example of the anderson art the music is breezy , tuneful and smart there is something american about it optimistic , nonchalant , tender this tango is not sad it s blue with a jazzy cast similarly , anderson s ticktock clock is mischievously syncopated in the waltzing cat anderson takes the schmaltzy string sighs that are standard fare in strauss waltzes and irreverently turns them into plaintive meows anderson is most admired for his melodic writing , but his harmonic sophistication is overlooked if you have never heard the typewriter \( more pity to you \) , just try to anticipate where each of the four phrases of the theme is heading harmonically i bet you 'll be stumped to perform that piece today in its originalinstrument version , a conductor has to track down an old manual typewriter this year is the centennial of anderson s birth , so there will be retrospectives and performances fortunately there are plentiful recordings , including new releases from naxos i'm listening right now to belle of the ball what an infectious , churning tune ! we worry too much about greatness and too little about what reaches out and touches our hearts my fatal attraction , flying in the face of all the great symphonies , operas and masses of the world , is for the tiny , unassuming piano pieces of federico mompou the outline is basic song form the melodic lines have a simplicity that only inspired composers could think of there is a juncture in almost all of his pieces where a single harmonic turn lights up our imaginations mompou was a catalan from barcelona born in 1893 , he lived well into his 90s and spent 30 years in paris , going home in the midst of war in 1941 france and the iberian peninsula have always experienced a musical crossfertilization the civility and elegance of one refreshed by the raw colors , rhythms and exuberance of the other debussy , ravel and chabrier wrote important spanish music while being fully french mompou s nine impresiones intimas , his first published work and very near my favorite , was , he said , a response to the music of faur yet mompou is anything but faur his music represents uncomplicated though carefully made directness , while faur s conveys a deeply reflective selfexamination lovely examples of impressionist tone painting do exist in mompou s music one of my favorites is el lago , with its watery repeated arpeggios and soft singing voice from underneath this piece , like most of his piano music , is not hard to play and given the riotous technical complications of granados and alb niz , you can almost be grateful that mompou was not more of a virtuoso my introduction to his music was on a 1950s angel lp , with mompou as pianist if you are lucky enough to find it , you will hear playing more secure and satisfying than that on the fourcd complete recording mompou made in 1974 , now on the brilliant label i first heard the impresiones intimas as an afterthought tacked on to alicia de larrocha s early lp recording of granados s goyescas if some audiophilearchaeologist can find these performances , let me know it is reassuring to learn that mompou s magic infects others the pianist stephen hough took time off from more complicated things to record a lovely cd for hyperion mompou also wrote songs , and some match the piano pieces in quality , especially the threepart combat del somni that turns up in various recorded song collections i make no apologies for the fact that some of my favorite performances are so completely at odds with my usual tastes and preferences as to seem inconsistent , if not perverse when i hear a concert or a new recording , i expect the performance to be in today s style informed by current understanding of a composer s expressive idiom and sound world , conscientiously adherent to the letter of the score and played with a modern veneer of hightech virtuosity but those expectations go out the window when i hear recordings of , say , thomas beecham s handel , willem mengelberg s mahler or early violin recordings by the likes of mischa elman , jan kubelik and fritz kreisler those musicians took deeply personal approaches that even in their day had scholarly listeners looking askance but scholarly propriety was not yet the norm emotional assertiveness was , even if it meant taking liberties with a composer s intentions or casting off the composer s sound as archaic my favorite recording of handel s messiah is christopher hogwood s , with its spare textures , period instruments and a boys' choir but i find the devotional weight and the unbuttoned joyfulness of the beecham recording which uses eugene goossens s expansive reorchestration , with lots of bright woodwinds and brasses deep , rich basses and percussion a true thrill i would probably cringe to hear a young pianist play scarlatti the way horowitz did , but horowitz s eccentric twisting and rebalancing of scarlatti s ecosystem sounds just right when he s the one doing it and say what i otherwise might about heartonthesleeve , emotionally manipulative violin playing , i cannot resist elman s honeyed tone , swooping portamento and plangent doublestops in bonbons like schubert s ave maria and chopin s d flat nocturne and no one can touch elman s tchaikovsky s r nade m lancolique at times these old recordings give a listener reasonable grounds to question our modern fascination with composers' intentions mahler called mengelberg his favorite interpreter of his symphonies , yet if you follow a mengelberg recording \( say , mahler s fourth symphony \) with a score , you will quickly lose count of the times he countermands mahler s expressive and dynamic markings so should we demand this kind of cowboy interpretation from modern players after all \? i do n't think so these are different times , and today s interpreters reflect them as much as beecham , horowitz , elman and company reflected theirs bless me , reader , for i have sinned i have become obsessed with the german soprano simone kermes ok , obsessed is probably an overstatement but i ca n't think of another performer who has so captured my imagination , nor one who has lured me further outside my usual comfort zones of listening i first encountered ms kermes in a performance of handel s opera siroe by andrea marcon and the venice baroque orchestra at the brooklyn academy of music in 2004 in pasty white makeup and a vintage gown , she was part norma desmond , part rocky horror but her wounded portrayal of laodice , the spurned consort of the king of persia , was deeply moving , and her sound was keen and gripping also in 2004 , the archiv label issued a recording of andromeda liberata , a pasticcio credited in part to vivaldi , which featured ms kermes , mr marcon and his scintillating venice players in fiery arias like lo so , barbari fati , ms kermes demonstrated exceptional technique but it was in madre , lascia ch'io senta in prima il core , an aching , slowmotion aria in which andromeda struggles to choose between love and duty , that i was swept away by her ability to speak directly to the heart i 've tracked down nearly all ms kermes s recordings naturally , not everything works she is a highlight of the conductor alan curtis s uneven version of handel s rodelinda , as well as of his useful recording of a lesser handel rarity , lotario singing in english in a series of handel oratorios conducted by peter neumann on the german label mdg , she can sometimes sound uncomfortable or affected still , ms kermes is never less than intensely committed , and there are things i cherish about all her recordings , even the obscurities like leopold kozeluch s 1787 oratorio mois in egitto and johann friedrich reichardt s 1793 singspiel erwin und elmire in thomas hengelbrock s stylish version of haydn s creation and christoph spering s disc of beethoven s christ on the mount of olives , ms kermes is outstanding amor profano , a disc of vivaldi arias due on tuesday , is a timely reminder that mr marcon brings out the best in ms kermes now , if only i could track down the privately issued bachfest leipzig 2004 , the one recording that continues to elude me some old recordings of baroque music are so stodgy that it seems as if orchestras used to perform in a valiuminduced daze since the periodinstrument movement matured and rescued early music from the soporific sludge of lugubrious interpretations , playing with a historically informed approach has now become standard it s hard to imagine that anyone would want to reverse the clock and sacrifice the fleetfooted tempos , clear textures and bristling musicmaking of conductors like ton koopman , trevor pinnock , christopher hogwood and john eliot gardiner but there is a certain perverse pleasure in reveling in the sumptuous power of otto klemperer s 1962 recording of bach s st matthew passion with the philharmonia choir and orchestra though many of its attributes a heavy slowness , thick textures and a rich vibrato of modern instruments are now considered wrong , this is a magnificently stately and powerfully intense performance klemperer s tempos sound astoundingly slow and take a moment s adjustment from the regally spacious and earthshattering orchestral opening and entrance of the thunderous chorus , this is a full , fat treat throughout the recording features a wonderful cast of singers , including peter pears , dietrich fischerdieskau , elisabeth schwarzkopf , christa ludwig , nicolai gedda and walter berry , who all sing with richly expressive operatic voices fully in character with the majestic grandeur of this reading klemperer coaxes luxuriantly expressive phrasing from singers and instrumentalists , and retains a sense of buoyancy in tempos that could otherwise become sluggish there are many aweinspiring moments , including mr pears s heartfelt recitatives as the evangelist and fischerdieskau s powerfully expressive performance as jesus another such pleasure from 1962 is herbert von karajan s politically incorrect rendition of the mozart requiem while he does n't quite match klemperer for stately majesty , karajan also allows tempos to unfold with what now seems like decadent spaciousness , conducting the berlin philharmonic and vienna singverein in a romantically rich , thunderously heavy and at times almost gooey interpretation the soloists , including mr berry and wilma lipp , sing with full operatic fervor you would get indigestion dining on steak and red wine every night , and these fullcream performances are best taken in moderation after indulging , hop on the musical treadmill and refresh your palate with a historically apt recording
ashburn , va joe gibbs was wondering how in the world he had ever won three super bowl titles and earned a place in the pro football hall of fame , and he wanted his to know it he had just called backtoback timeouts to ice buffalo kicker rian lindell , not knowing it would warrant a 15yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct instead of facing a 51yard field goal , lindell moved up to boot a 36yarder through the uprights with four seconds left to give the visiting bills a 1716 victory it was washington s fourth loss in a row , and in the opening weekend of december , the 57 redskins were not a very good team worse , the loss came five days after sean taylor , the team s pro bowl safety , died from gunshot wounds sustained in a burglary in his home near miami it came four days after taylor s father , pedro , had exhorted the team to make the playoffs in memory of his son now , gibbs was standing before his team , looking every bit his 67 years and taking the blame not only for the loss , but also perhaps for another lost season it was the worst moment of my career , gibbs said this week , and i get kind of emotional talking about it mark brunell , the redskins' veteran backup quarterback , was having none of it he stood and parroted gibbs s golden rule we win and lose as a team so did defensive tackle anthony montgomery and middle linebacker london fletcher , and soon calls of do n't worry about it , coach echoed in the locker room the next day , the team flew to miami for taylor s funeral gibbs offered a touching eulogy it was on tuesday , dec 4 , however , that gibbs delivered to his team his best guess at what could be wrought from tragedy he said he was looking for clarity , not trying to issue a clarion call sometimes in life , maybe some of the best things happen to you after you have been kind of crushed , gibbs recalled telling his team in the weeks since , the redskins \( 97 \) have won four in a row , earning a wildcard playoff berth and a meeting against the seahawks \( 106 \) on saturday in seattle in a national football conference firstround game not only are they playing well , but they are playing for one another you look at his r sum , and you watch him in practice and you pay attention to how we prepare , and you know joe gibbs knows football , fletcher said what s happened since sean and the buffalo game shows you that joe knows people he had the pulse of this team , and told us hey , it ca n't get any worse but i'm here to help us hold it together if you want to' it is why joe gibbs is a great coach the redskins , indeed , wanted to hold it together two days after gibbs s speech , the team that faced the chicago bears resembled the washington squads of 1981 to 1992 , the ones that gibbs coached to a 14065 record \( including the postseason \) and four trips to the super bowl earlier this season , in a 2417 home loss to the giants , the redskins squandered a 14point halftime lead and failed to score from the goal line in the final seconds because they had no timeouts in november , the redskins were at home and up by 9 points against the philadelphia eagles with 12 minutes left but lost , 3325 against the bears , despite losing quarterback jason campbell in the second quarter , washington played aggressively behind the backup todd collins and clung to a 1713 lead with seven minutes left when collins capped a 70yard drive with a 16yard touchdown pass to ladell betts to help secure a 2416 victory , players understood something cathartic had occurred we had blown games because we were playing not to lose , receiver antwaan randle el said we had been asking joe to open it up , and he did right there he showed us that he was listening and that he trusted us gibbs has shown remarkable trust in collins , a 13year veteran who had not started a game since 1997 he compiled an nfcbest 1064 passer rating during december , completing 67 of 105 attempts for 888 yards and 5 touchdowns with no interceptions he has great character , and he is extremely tough , said gibbs , who is the only coach to win three super bowl titles with different quarterbacks joe theismann , doug williams and mark rypien he was thrown right in the battle quarterbacks lead by getting it done , and certainly todd has gotten it done beyond entrusting an amped offense to collins , gibbs has demonstrated that he has his team s best interests in mind the redskins are among the most bangedup teams in the nfl , having lost 6 of their original 22 starters after taylor s death , the team s veterans asked gibbs to adjust their practice schedule now , they have fewer repetitions in practice , and on wednesdays they have a walkthrough in place of a full practice in the past , we were going to pound it until our brains fell out on the field , gibbs said this team has been one that lends itself to that , because it s so conscientious and works so hard no matter what happens against the seahawks or beyond , joe bugel , gibbs s assistant head coach for offense , said this season was one for the history books for an illustrious franchise last january , doctors diagnosed leukemia in gibbs s grandson taylor , now 3 in october , the former nfl player ron springs , the father of redskins cornerback shawn springs , fell into a coma he remains on life support then there was taylor s fatal shooting just before christmas , bugel s daughter holly , 35 , had her left arm amputated at the shoulder after it was discovered she had a rare form of bone cancer bad times is when joe is best , said bugel , who developed the redskins' offensive line , the hogs , during gibbs s first tenure he is as steady as a rock me , the guys , we love and respect him because he tells the truth gibbs is not afraid to speak highly about this group of washington redskins they are as special as the teams he took to the super bowl in team sports , it s rare where all of a sudden a team gets a feeling where as a coach you can actually go to practice relaxed because i wo n't have to find a way to do something , he said this team has it when that happens , what you generally find is that they quit worrying about

before the confetti fell at staples center last thursday , a chant swept through the arena we want boston ! one night later , 2 , 986 miles to the east , the response came booming back beat la ! as the two cities stretched their vocal cords , a thousand images flashed wilt vs russell , west vs cousy , magic vs bird , kareem vs parish , kurt rambis s neck vs kevin mchale s forearm baylor and goodrich , worthy and scott havlicek , the jones boys , johnson , ainge the and the are happily bathing in history as they open the finals thursday in boston the franchises have wrestled for the championship nine times since the lakers moved to los angeles the rivalry has enough chapters to fill the smithsonian it began so much more subtly four decades , three arenas and many , many hall of famers ago they barely knew each other a rivalry \? when the lakers and the celtics first met for the title , in 1962 , there was none to speak of boston had won three straight nba titles and four of the previous five the lakers had just landed in los angeles and were practically begging fans to fill sports arena i do n't think it was a big rivalry at all , said frank selvy , a lakers guard from 1960 to 1964 we thought we had a good team we were quite young i think i was the oldest guy on the team at 29 hatred \? there had not been enough exposure to generate any there were only nine teams then four in the east , five in the west and they played most of their games within their divisions the celtics had far more animosity for the syracuse nationals i never remember feeling a real hatred for the lakers that might have existed for some of the other teams back east , said bob cousy , the celtics' hall of fame guard the celtics and the lakers had met once before for the title , in 1959 , when the lakers were based in minneapolis but the dna for the rivalry as we know it formed in april 1962 there was tension and heartbreak , mostly for the lakers , who lost the series , 43 the games in los angeles were graced by celebrities , including doris day and pat boone but the greatest attractions were on the court the celtics featured seven future hall of famers cousy , bill russell , k c jones , sam jones , frank ramsey , tommy heinsohn and coach red auerbach the lakers had two jerry west and elgin baylor in many ways , the modernday celtics and lakers reflect their forebears kevin garnett , a fierce and towering defender , has stepped into russell s place in the paint kobe bryant , is the nba s most feared clutch performer , a label long attached to west , whom bryant counts as his greatest mentor the celtics of the 1960s won eight straight titles without a scoring champion , and in 1962 they did not have a single player in the nba s top 10 in scoring today s celtics feature three supreme talents garnett , paul pierce and ray allen who similarly sacrificed to return the franchise to glory the lakers in 1962 had a strong cast of supporting players to back up west and baylor the lakers today have a solid costar in pau gasol and a roster of willing role players to support bryant , their one sure hall of famer similarities beyond the court are almost nonexistent in 1962 , there was no players union , no salary cap , no video scoreboards , no blaring music , no mascots and no cheerleaders \( the laker girls would not shimmy for another 17 years \) players were paid in tens of thousands , not tens of millions , and several held second jobs the fun of the rivalry is , as heinsohn recently summed it up , the clashing of cultures the grit and history of boston versus the glamour and transience of hollywood la is a different approach to the world , he told the boston globe i do n't think there s a freedom trail out there in la yet when the lakers moved to los angeles in 1960 , there was nothing glamorous about them the dodgers , who had arrived three years earlier , owned the city their arrival was greeted by fans at the airport , a tickertape parade and a reception at city hall the lakers rolled into town after midnight , by car , via san bernardino nobody knew we were there and nobody cared , said tommy hawkins , a lakers forward in 196062 and 196669 to promote their games , players were dispatched in sound trucks the sort once used by politicians and read prepared pitches over the loudspeakers hello , this is tommy hawkins of the los angeles lakers coming up friday , the new york knicks ! we went up and down the streets reading these messages , hawkins said , chuckling when the celtics made the finals that year , they took it as a birthright for the lakers , it was a breakthrough and a painful initiation they split the first two games at boston garden , the celtics taking the opener , 122108 , and the lakers bouncing back with a 129122 upset in game 2 west led a late comeback at sports arena to win game 3 , 117115 but the celtics took game 4 in los angeles , 115103 baylor scored 61 points then a finals record for a 126121 lakers victory in game 5 boston crushed the lakers again in game 6 , 119105 a pattern had been set the lakers and the celtics met nine times between 1962 and 1987 , with four of the series going seven games four others went six games the celtics , however , dominated the final tally , winning the title seven times the defining moment of 1962 , the one that set the tone for decades to come , came in the final seconds of game 7 boston held the lead for most of the fourth quarter , but selvy twice drove the length of the floor , the second time tying the game at 100100 with two seconds left , selvy shot a baseline jumper that bounced high off the rim and was grabbed by russell at the buzzer the celtics won in overtime , 110107 today , they all ponder what could have been cousy , who was late getting to selvy on the shot , mused about how close he came to a bill buckner moment , which would have haunted me for the rest of my life poor frank , he said i feel so bad for those guys selvy , now 75 , said he got over the moment long ago i surely wish i made it , but it has n't haunted me , he said i worry about my golf game more than that it took 10 years before the lakers won a title in los angeles , with a 1972 victory over the knicks it took 23 years before they beat the celtics in the finals , in 1985 they had lost six more finals to the celtics before that breakthrough we were one shot away from changing the entire history of pro basketball , hawkins said and it did n't happen for us
akron , ohio for all his golf achievements , still has about as many holes in his r sum as he does gap wedges in his golf bag three or four none of the missing credits have the prestige or significance of his united states amateur title , his three professional majors , his 34 tour victories , or even his gulfstream jet purchased with some of the nearly 50 million , excluding endorsements , he has earned playing golf for the past 16 years as difficult as it might be to fathom , mickelson , 38 , has never won the pga tour money title he has never been ranked no 1 in the world he has not won the player of the year trophy or the vardon trophy for lowest scoring average he has never even won a world golf championship event , although he has an opportunity to address that this weekend after adding a secondround 66 to his opening 68 at the wgcbridgestone invitational at firestone country club , mickelson is one stroke behind the leader , singh shot 66 friday and is at 133 , seven under par trailing singh by two at 135 was the foursome of sean o'hair \( 67 \) , peter lonard \( 66 \) , zach johnson \( 68 \) and lee westwood stuart appleby , who shot 66 , headed a group of five at four under that included miguel ngel jim nez \( 66 \) , stewart cink \( 68 \) , d j trahan \( 67 \) and rory sabbatini \( 67 \) the round of the day was shot by the champion trevor immelman , who oneputted 11 greens en route to a 64 that left him six back at 139 happy about his play , and ecstatic about the condition of the golf course and the setup at firestone , mickelson appears to be in one of his scoring moods he is enjoying watching the ball roll into the hole , which he has not seen for a while his putting is back on track his short game is honed his long game is reasonably under control and his timing is good with 4034 million , mickelson trails only tiger woods \( 5775 million \) and kenny perry \( 4456 million \) on the money list he is playing for an 8 million purse this week , and purses totaling 44 million await in the five events he is expected to play between now and the tour championship that concludes sept 28 that does not include the 10 million cash bonus to the winner of the fedex cup points race , in which mickelson , no 2 in the world , now trails only perry and woods , who is out for the year we 've got a lot of big events , and so i want to pace myself , said mickelson , who has bogeyed one hole and birdied seven in two days i want to be excited about the tournaments that we have coming up i'm excited that the course setup here is so great for all the players as we end the season next week with the pga , with our next major , and also heading into the fedex cup essentially , the season s biggest prizes are all on the table without woods around to scrape off the lion s share mickelson starts his sprint to the line this weekend , with singh in the final pairing it is fitting that they should square off at this point with woods out of the picture , the tour has not only been missing its best player and its top draw but also its sizzle if nothing else , the mickelsonsingh pairing should inject some dramatic tension into the weekend although roughly the same height , singh and mickelson do not see eye to eye while there appears to be no lingering hostility from the 2005 masters , when they nearly came to blows during a heated exchange in the champions locker room over spike marks singh accused mickelson of leaving on the greens with long \( but legal \) spikes , they are hardly close it is safe to say there will not be any philvijay buddy movies or a joint appearance in one of the pga tour s feelgood advertisements anytime soon singh s impassive expression did not change when he was asked about being paired with mickelson in the last group i mean , i'm going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does , singh said he s going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day singh , 45 , seems to have found his putting stroke winless since last year s arnold palmer invitational at bay hill , he had two good chances to win this season at bay hill , where he led after 36 holes and finished third , and earlier at the att pebble beach national proam , where he lost in a playoff to steve lowery after leading most of sunday mickelson has won twice one stroke now separates them there are others in the picture , but the focus will be on mickelson and singh
phoenix the nfl investigated rumors last year that the had videotaped the final walkthrough by the st louis rams before the 2002 and found no evidence that the taping had occurred , the league said saturday the patriots told the nfl that the rumor was not true and on saturday denied a report in the boston herald that quoted an unnamed source saying the taping had occurred the suggestion that the new england patriots recorded the st louis rams' walkthrough on the day before super bowl xxxvi in 2002 is absolutely false , the patriots' executive director of media relations , stacey james , said any suggestion to the contrary is untrue on saturday , the herald reported that the day before the patriots defeated the heavily favored rams to win their first super bowl title , a member of new england s video staff remained behind in the louisiana superdome after attending the patriots' walkthrough and filmed the rams' walkthrough during a walkthrough , a team practices in slow motion plays to be used in a game a tape of a walkthrough would provide a distinct advantage to an opponent , almost certainly greater than the interception of coaches' signals would provide that super bowl was played a few months after the sept 11 terrorist attacks , and security was extraordinarily tight but the cameraman , the herald reported , was never asked to produce a news media credential the nfl said that the patriots among them , coach bill belichick and other former and current members of the patriots' staff were asked specifically about the super bowl rumor as part of the investigation that began after the patriots were caught videotaping coaches' signals in the season opener against the jets belichick denied to the league s investigators that the walkthrough had been taped as part of its investigation , the nfl also spoke to former and current patriots staff members , plus independent experts on videotaping , said greg aiello , the nfl s senior vice president for public relations the league said it also reviewed the six tapes that were handed over by the patriots \( which commissioner roger goodell said friday went back only to 2006 \) and notes that the team kept about coaches' signals that dated back a few seasons before 2006 the nfl would not be more specific the league also examined all of the relevant taping equipment , aiello said matt walsh , a former employee of the team s video department and now a golf professional in hawaii , said last week that he had never been contacted by the patriots or the nfl about his knowledge of the patriots' videotaping , although he has indicated he knows more than has been made public if i ever got brought in for a deposition or something , then i would just face the whole gauntlet of questions , walsh said last week there would be things i 'd be forced to answer that some people have n't taken responsibility for walsh could not be reached for comment saturday when asked last week , though , about the possibility that the patriots had videotaped the rams' walkthrough in 2002 , walsh said it was not in his best interests to confirm or deny any specific allegation left to wonder about it all are the rams i would n't be surprised , adam timmerman , an offensive lineman on the rams at the time , said saturday in a telephone interview i 'd like to see them evaluate it a little bit further just to see if there s a good chance of it being true , he said yet timmerman , who is now retired , also said he was not sure how much the patriots would have benefited from taping the walkthrough at most , the rams ran 30 plays in walkthroughs , he said we do n't do anything earthshattering , he said we 're pretty watered down in that walkthrough what they would actually learn , i do n't know how beneficial that would be the things they would learn from that film would be marginal he added we do n't do signals in the walkthrough they just send the play in it 'd be very limited if it was me and you gave me the film from the walkthrough , would i think it really had an advantage going into the game \? probably not if the patriots did have the walkthrough footage , it would have been most advantageous for the rams' goalline and shortyardage plays , timmerman said after the super bowl loss , timmerman said , none of his teammates complained that the patriots knew their plays they were more upset that the patriots defenders had held wide receivers isaac bruce and torry holt near the line of scrimmage , he said something like this is real comparable to steroids or someone gaining an advantage in that way , timmerman said that sort of stuff does anger me because i think it s not respecting the game and keeping a level playing field for all the competitors it s not like they 're going to give us a super bowl ring , timmerman said
forty might be the new 30 but while social attitudes about chalking up 480 months and 350 , 400 hours have changed , it is still a big deal , big enough for its own television show the big 40 , a new reality series that begins on wednesday night on tv land , documents people turning 40 in the age of , , fatsucking surgery and life coaches not that there s anything wrong with those little tweaks along the way you just wo n't find them front and center in these big 40 profiles , which include a former football player , a father of quadruplets who uses a wheelchair , a woman facing divorce the six people in the sixpart series all showcase moments of challenge , crisis or transformation and fun too it was just this moment in life , which is so important , said j d roth , a producer of the big 40 with todd a nelson of 3 ball productions their credits include the reality shows beauty and the geek , the cw competition series that pairs dumb beauties and smart geeks , and the biggest loser , the nbc weightloss contest mr roth promises the musings and the festivities of his crop of celebrants are in marked contrast to mtv s my super sweet 16 , the hit reality show about the elaborate birthday bashes of often spoiled teenagers it s not like turning 16 , where you 're showing off , said mr roth , who turns 40 this month forty is about family and friends , he said , and it is often a time with more questions than answers we picked people searching for something anyone born in 1968 or thereabouts who wants to share the big 40 experience can do so via the internet has photographs of the show s participants and message boards to discuss birthday plans mr roth said he figured there was enough angst and wisdom out there for 100 episodes the show s first episode follows derrick moore , a former running back for the atlanta falcons and detroit lions mr moore , a family man in suburban atlanta , is now the chaplain and developmental coach for the athletes at georgia tech but facing 40 , he wants to prove that he still has the stuff , physically speaking he sets up a football game with some of his former nfl friends facing off against georgia tech players it s an incredible achievement , he said in an interview , meaning his experience , on screen and off our culture and society has changed greatly over the years , so the potential of so many things that can happen has changed greatly he added , now at 40 , you can meet that person you dream about , you can start a family , you can go back to college i 've done all those things , mr moore said , so i can only imagine the potential i have for the next 40 years immediately following his profile on wednesday \( a night of backtoback episodes \) is the story of lisa custard , a former model who is now a wife and mother in los angeles her 11yearold son , dylan , wakes her up the morning of her birthday , singing , yo , yo , yo , while her husband , kevin , records it all on a video camera ms custard , the usual reality tv extrovert , plans a party at a beverly hills club that will culminate with her popping out of a cake her issue she so worries about being hot and sexy at 40 that none of her friends know her age her other bit of baggage is a twoyear estrangement from her mother and her husband and son have cooked up their own surprise for the big party i was really scared about turning 40 , ms custard said in an interview there s this double standard when men get that shiny gray hair , they 're sophisticated us , it s uhoh , you 're getting old but times change , and she has changed too , ms custard said filming her birthday adventure was cathartic , she explained , adding that she hoped that that upbeat message would come across to viewers are you going to be 40 and fierce \? is how ms custard put it or are you , i'm 40 and my life is almost over \?

i think any fairminded person would agree that wolfe shows neither prejudice nor favoritism toward any of the ethnic groups found in bonfire at least when it comes to their moral qualities the blacks , the jews , the irish and the anglosaxons all come off equally badly still , i think wolfe could be accused of portraying the races in a way that is both false and , ultimately , unfair to blacks the problem is not with any suggestion that one group is more or less admirable than another rather , it arises from the way wolfe shows how power is distributed among them if a martian read bonfire , he would think that in this world it was the blacks who had all the power in the book s very first episode , the jewish mayor is shouted down by a black crowd in harlem he is frightened , beleaguered , and allows himself to be hustled away by his security detail , a decision he instantly despises himself for making sherman and maria take a nightmare ride through the bronx dark faces dark faces more dark faces and have a terrifying confrontation with the elemental enemy , the hunter , the predator in the bronx courthouse , even though the white judges , assistant district attorneys and cops have the official power , they seem like the oppressed and beleaguered ones they are oppressed by their jobs and by the endless flow of black defendants they are too scared to leave the building and are forced to wagon train their cars at night meanwhile , the defendants , with their pimp rolls , are cocky the perpetrators are the ones who act in this world the judges , assistant district attorneys and cops are reacting and just trying to keep up with them after he s arrested , sherman has a frightening and humiliating \( and very realistic \) encounter with a black man in the holding pen in the book s last episode , judge kovitsky is just about to confront a demonstration by blacks outside the courthouse , but the court officers try to prevent him , and he loses heart overall , it is hard to find a single encounter between a white and a black in the book that the black does not win even the black man who shines sherman s shoes takes advantage of him the person with by far the most power in the book , and the one who also has the most personal strength , is rev bacon he always wins when he is dealing with a white person the mayor , the bronx district attorney and the media all dance to his tune he is the book s main actor everything that happens to sherman , larry kramer \( the prosecutor \) and peter fallow \( the english reporter \) results from the actions that rev bacon takes personally , he is shown to have none of the insecurities found in those other three unlike sherman , rev bacon doesn t panic because he is talking to his wife his wife ! at a party unlike kramer , he doesn t feel he has to show off his neck muscles to impress women unlike fallow , he doesn t have to fasttalk his way through any conversation with his boss while wolfe recounts to the penny the obsessive money worries of sherman , kramer and fallow , rev bacon seems to be fat and happy and to be getting fatter and happier all the time going by money , indeed , the most powerful person in the book should be gene lopwitz , the 25 millionayear head of the mighty investment house of pierce and pierce but lopwitz is portrayed as a fool , attending cricket matches and furnishing his office teaattheconnaught style in order to make up for the pedigree he lacks rev bacon , meanwhile , is no fool at all tough , resourceful , a winner , and having a lot of fun along the way , he is the only character in the book with the right stuff the balance of power wolfe presented fit with my own perception of the world , and there was certainly some truth to it but when i step back a bit , it seems highly distorted wait a minute didn t the white people have vastly more wealth , political influence and institutional control \? didn t racism persist \( even if racemongers exaggerated it \) and weren t many blacks desperately poor , fearful , frustrated and powerless \? with perspective , the power relations in bonfire begin to look like the product of a white feeling of victimization and fear that probably goes back hundreds of years \( othello \? \) the fact that it does go back so far and persisted during the times when whites unquestionably held almost all the power makes its validity highly suspect , even though by 1987 the objective power relations had certainly changed there is a long tradition in comedy in which those on the bottom get the best of those on the top , but the assumption is that those on the top really do have the power and are in no real danger of losing it that assumption doesn t seem to be operating in bonfire , so in an important way the real condition of blacks at the time seems to me to be misrepresented i suppose that the record over the past twenty years is mixed , but when you read that one out of nine black men between the ages of 18 and 34 is in prison , a statistic that recently appeared in the times , you get the impression that in terms of power , control and social success , whites relative to blacks are holding their own
st paul is the host of this year s republican convention , and the city will have just a fraction of the hotel rooms that new york city had for the 2004 convention so many delegates and news people will be staying in the sister city of minneapolis or in the suburbs , with just a few lucky delegations staying within walking distance of the convention who gets to stay in the city s choice historic hotel , the st paul , which is just a few blocks from the convention center \? none other than the delegation from arizona , home to senator john mccain it will be joined in the st paul by the delegation from nevada convention hotel assignments are often read like tea leaves that signal the political fortunes of a particular state and its politicians the minnesota delegation is also staying in downtown st paul , and the state s governor , tim pawlenty , is often mentioned as a running mate to mr mccain but the delegation from florida , whose governor , charlie crist , is in the running for the ticket , is staying about 10 miles away at the minneapolis airport marriott , despite the state s importance in the november election
some russians declared that the kremlin had a right or even an obligation to bar opposition politicians from the nation s television networks others described such a practice as nothing more than blatant censorship that harked back to the old days those two strains of opinion dominated the responses from russian bloggers to a version of the accompanying article that was translated into russian the article was posted on friday on a russianlanguage blog run by the new york times on the most popular blogging platform in russia , livejournalcom the post generated more than 850 comments here is a sampling , translated by the moscow bureau of the times as a journalist , i can tell you yes , such lists exist and not only on the federal level , but at the level of the provincial press as well not only does the electronic mass media break off all contacts with the opposition , even the printing houses refuse to print things for them it s better to do that than to face the pressure padonak1983 there is room on tv only for those who work to strengthen the country if your actions are destructive , ie , you do not support the unidirectional progression of your country , then there is no place for you there i really want to say write in newspapers and on the internet , but tv is too strong a tool to hand over to everyone cruza it s awful what is going on with freedom of speech in our country putin and co are busy brainwashing people , just like stalin and brezhnev did it s a shame that people accept it and agree zagrebchanka i believe that such lists do not exist and they are not needed marginal figures and idiots are not interesting for a modern audience the time of those people was in the '90s wizary russia needs to participate in the propaganda war if it does n't , then the fate of the ussr will repeat itself vitalid it s a fine article , the stop lists exist , no matter what they say it s not possible to explain all this disgrace on tv in any other way i am against other countries' interference with our affairs , but it is kind of stupid to consider our country a democracy imfromjasenevo a group of colleagues and i have for two years been involved in a project , telekritikaru , in which we have reported on the state of political programming on tv the results have been unambiguous television has provided extremely onesided coverage of the political landscape there are blacklists , but they are not just for individuals , but for particular issues as well sergmitron i have long been irritated by the fact that the west harshly criticizes russia , while easily forgiving itself censorship , or rather , selfcensorship , is everywhere marginov it is necessary to protect russian citizens from destructive american propaganda ! having read the earlier comments , i see that many have been brainwashed already and are now in unison whining about a free press in russia attackerx i doubt that there is a welldeveloped system of censorship , but selfcensorship in the mass media definitely exists , and this is very good russian television is calm and correct that members of the opposition are not invited only increases ratings because not many people want to see them , because for the most part they only criticize and never do anything dvorobiev regional tv channels , radio channels have their own stop lists' that is , they in advance filter out people who are out of favor with the kremlin and , additionally , those who are out of favor with provincial overlords commentator40 the problem with the opposition is not in censorship , but in the absolute , total incompetence of these people none of these fearless 'freedom fighters' have said a word about the solutions for our economic or social problems texconten i think that stop lists are quite a widespread phenomenon in all of the civilized world i doubt that irish republican army spokesmen regularly appear in great britain on their central television so why should we show kasparov , who even at his meetings shouts in english \? \? \? numrik selfcensorship and censorship coming from the government have always existed , do exist and always will exist in russia and this is often very beneficial in their quests for ratings , our journalists often cross permitted ethical boundaries and abuse freedom of speech bzzzzzzzzzzzzz it is no secret to anyone that putin has suffocated freedom of speech all of my acquaintances listen only to one radio station , the echo of moscow even gullible pensioners do not consider television a source of truthful information those of my generation , who grew up under brezhnev , understand the regime created by leonid ilyich putin well cheralpa

bulldozers and water trucks aviation , in particular , has been an area in which federal officials have depended on the private sector , arguing that because of the seasonal nature of fires it is better to contract work out than to pay for yearround staffing but the increase in ground crews , and the lengthier fire season , has left some firefighter advocates wondering if taxpayer money would be better spent improving federal resources when someone s facing a wildfire , and their property is impinged on , they do n't care about the cost and they do n't care what agency , said casey judd , business manager for the federal wildland fire service association , an employee association representing firefighters but at some point in time , they have to realize they are footing the bill marc rounsaville , the deputy director for fire and aviation at the forest service , said that there had been an increase in crews working on the ground and often close to fire , cutting fire breaks , known as cutting line , and putting out spot fires , just as the grayback team was before the aug 5 crash mr rounsaville said the increase in private hand crews was due in part to fewer federal timber crews in the field such crews , who do a variety of tasks including reforestation and preparation for timber sales , are also used to help fight wildfires but as the forest service s timber harvesting declined , so did its number of crews we lost those people , he said so they were n't available on a callwhenneeded basis the result was the miniboom over the last decade in the number of contractors , particularly in the pacific northwest , where the decline in the lumber industry has also stripped many communities of jobs today , the national wildfire suppression association , a trade group for private contractors based in stayton , ore , counts more than 200 business members , representing more than 10 , 000 firefighters , with nearly 100 companies in oregon alone some oregon community colleges have started to offer classes in wildland firefighting , complete with onthejob training during which students cut fire lines , slash brush and lay fire hose over steep terrain debbie miley , the wildfire association s executive director , said that about 75 percent of the nation s private firefighting services come out of the pacific northwest , even higher than that for ground crews , she said because many fire assignments for contractors were in years past awarded because of proximity to fires and the company s price , such rapid growth initially also led to some unscrupulous practices , including ghost operations , said rod nichols , an information officer with the oregon department of forestry at one point we had more than 300 crews , and so we had companies that would claim dispatch locations that did n't exist , mr nichols said one of our contracting officers would go out to inspect a location and it would be a parking lot , or a restaurant but in 2006 , the pacific northwest wildfire coordinating group , an association of federal and state fire agencies in oregon and washington , began ranking crew companies bidding for government contracts on new criteria , including their performance and safety records california , another fireplagued state , also has socalled best value contracts for hand crews , and other regions have similar stipulations for private contracts on water trucks and fire engines ms miley said her trade group had pushed for the changes in contracts , and the winnowing out of shady contactors you 're getting a change from quantity to quality , ms miley said exactly how much is spent on ground crews varies from year to year , depending on the extent of fires in 2006 , considered a bad year for wildfires , about 87 million in federal and state money was spent on crews , water trucks and engines , according to the forest service for prospective firefighters , meanwhile , the appeal of privatesector jobs is easy to see while the starting salary might be only 10 or 11 an hour , overtime quickly kicks in as firefighters log 12 to 16hour days fire crews also receive the similar training as federal firefighters , often taught by retired federal employees , giving them a valuable leg up for other firefighting jobs moreover , working on a wildfire means that food and housing , even if it is a tent , is taken care of jolin loleit , 26 , said her summertime work with gfp enterprises inc , a private company in sisters , ore , allowed her freedom to travel the rest of year it s very addictive , ms loleit said you work four months and then take the rest of the year off now in her third year , ms loleit has graduated from work on the fire line to logistical support but for those still in the wild , the work is undeniably hard crews use shovels , axes and hoes to cut line some crews are spiked at certain locations , far from base camp , meaning they live in the wilderness for days at a time , eating premade meals , lugging water and heavy equipment , and sleeping in small tents or under the stars scott posner , who was the task force leader for the crew that crashed , said there was little differentiation made between federal firefighters and private workers on the fire line you 're all in yellow and green , said mr posner , referring to the protective yellow shirts and green khaki pants usually worn in fire zones at the memorial here on friday morning , several hundred private firefighters walked singlefile into an amphitheater alongside forest service and bureau of land management fire officials at the memorial s conclusion , members of a federal honor guard passed folded flags and other mementos to grayback firefighters and a carson helicopter official , who passed them along to the victims' families such camaraderie and community appealed to scott charlson , said his mother , nina , who said her son had wanted to write a book about his time on the fire line after the first two weeks , and after talking to the crew , i think he was bit by the bug , she said because it was so much more than he ever thought it was

newport , mich senator toured a nuclear power plant in michigan on tuesday to highlight his support for the construction of 45 new nuclear power generators by 2030 , a position that he said distinguished him from his democratic rival , senator  mr mccain , an arizona republican , portrayed his support of nuclear energy as part of an alloftheabove approach to addressing the nation s energy needs at a time of 4agallon gasoline he called it safe , efficient , inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil if we really want to enable new technologies tomorrow like plugin electric cars , we need electricity to plug into , he said in a statement after touring the fermi 2 nuclear plant , its twin cooling towers spewing vapors used as a backdrop we need to do all this and more both mr mccain and mr obama see expanded use of nuclear energy as a way to reduce dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels , although mr obama has cautioned that the government must first consider issues like the disposal of nuclear waste and the security of nuclear materials even before mr mccain left south dakota , where he campaigned at the freewheeling sturgis motorcycle rally on monday night , and headed to the plant in michigan , mr obama s campaign had put out a statement rebuffing what it called mr mccain s misrepresentation of mr obama s position on nuclear power barack obama supports safe and secure nuclear energy , bill burton , a campaign spokesman , said in an emailed statement nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however , before an expansion of nuclear power is considered , obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste , waste storage , and proliferation those concerns , as well as the near meltdown at the three mile island nuclear plant in pennsylvania in 1979 , and the ability to generate electricity cheaply in other ways , left the nuclear reactor construction business moribund for decades more than 100 reactor orders were canceled in the 1970s , including all those ordered after 1973 , and billions of dollars of work was abandoned but market conditions have improved as demand for power has risen and the price of natural gas , a competing fuel , has jumped lately some environmental groups that had been critical of nuclear power have embraced it , seeing the technology as a way to meet the nation s growing energy demands without contributing more heattrapping gases in addressing the nation s energy demands , mr obama has focused on alternative energy sources like wind and solar , as well as conservation , which would apparently also be the main beneficiaries of the decadelong 150 billion government investment effort he promises if elected he barely mentions nuclear power , usually just alluding to it in a sentence here or there i think we do have to look at nuclear , he said in an interview this spring on meet the press , and what we 've got to figure out is can we store the material properly \? can we make sure that they 're secure \? can we deal with the expense \? in his appearance at the nuclear plant , mr mccain expressed none of those doubts or concerns , asserting in his statement that the construction of the 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 would create 700 , 000 jobs , a figure that many experts find to be inflated he also said his experience serving on the nuclearfueled aircraft carrier enterprise had convinced him of the safety of nuclear power mr mccain took no questions and limited his appearance to his statement and a tour of the plant with a single reporter and a photographer , part of a recent campaign strategy to limit his availability to the news media during the tour , while standing in the center of the plant s control room , surrounded by elaborate panels and consoles crammed with switches and green and red lights , he asked several questions related to the plant s safety what would give you great cause for concern \? he asked phillip skarbek , the shift manager , and anthony f earley jr , the chief executive of dte energy , the owner of the plant , who conducted the tour the plant has had a troubled history , with its original generating station , fermi 1 , which opened in 1957 , suffering a partial fuel meltdown on oct 5 , 1966 no outside contamination occurred , but fermi 1 was taken off line in 1972 and decommissioned in 1975 the nuclear regulatory commission says it expects to receive applications by the end of 2010 to build 34 nuclear plants , although only a handful are likely to be finished in the next decade if demand for electricity continues to rise , as seems likely , it will be hard for the industry to maintain market share , much less displace the main carbon dioxide emitters , plants that burn coal to try to jumpstart the nuclear construction business , congress in 2005 gave the industry three incentives it provided loan guarantees of up to 185 billion , which would cover up to 80 percent of the value of a new reactor it offered financial credits for producing electricity and it offered a form of insurance to compensate for regulatory delays still , the socalled nuclear renaissance is moving slowly the energy policy act of 2005 was signed by president bush on aug 8 of that year and has yet to produce a plant order
argel sgazost , france when cadel evans crashed halfway through sunday s first stage in the pyrenees , cracking his helmet and ripping open his jersey , shorts and skin in several places , he thought his was over one day later , evans earned the yellow jersey for the first time in his career , hauling a body covered with scrapes and bruises over two punishing mountain peaks just fast enough to take a onesecond lead over frank schleck of the csc team leonardo piepoli of the saunier duvalscott team won the stage , followed by his teammate juan jos cobo acebo , making the 10th stage of the 95th tour another standout day for the team saunier duvalscott won its third stage as its two riders easily rode away from the pack on the ninemile ascent to hautacam , the finishing climb of a 969mile stage that began in pau piepoli and acebo climbed the mountain , which rises 3 , 507 feet at an average grade of 72 percent , in 37 minutes 16 seconds , for an average speed of 144 miles per hour schleck finished 28 seconds behind piepoli , then it was a long wait to see if evans would keep any of the 1 50 lead he held over schleck when the day began it could hardly have been any closer , with evans accelerating to the line behind christian vande velde to barely grab the lead vande velde , the american who leads the garmin chipotle team , moved up to third place , 38 seconds back kim kirchen , who held the race leader s yellow jersey for four days , finished 4 19 behind the stage winner , piepoli , and dropped to seventh over all , 1 56 behind evans although the rider who has held the yellow jersey after the three previous stage finishes at hautacam has worn it each time all the way to the finish in paris , evans conceded that that would probably prove a much more difficult task for him i have to admit that we are not the strongest team in the race , he said of his silencelotto team one thing the team is pretty good at is riding at the front but as for trying to protect the yellow jersey against schleck or other rivals , we 're going to have to think about it tomorrow , evans said schleck has previously won at l'alpe d'huez that peak will end the 17th stage , and will be preceded by two more days of difficult climbing in the alps before the tour heads to paris just how vulnerable evans remains was demonstrated monday when he had no teammates with him on the climb of hautacam csc , meanwhile , started the climb with four men in the same group as evans in addition to schleck , there was schleck s younger brother andy carlos sastre , who finished alongside evans and is in sixth place , 1 28 behind the leader and jens voigt , who set a torrid pace on the descent from the tourmalet to chase down the breakaway stage leader , remy digregorio of fran aise des jeux evans rode well enough , however , to keep sastre and denis menchov , the rabobank team leader , from gaining any time it was an attack by sastre roughly seven miles from the finish that , once it was caught , allowed frank schleck to counterattack and get away from the group of about 23 riders who began the climb of hautacam together menchov tried to raise the pace about halfway up the final climb , but evans had none of it , marking him closely enough that menchov , who started the day less than a minute behind evans , never seriously threatened to get away again menchov is in fifth place , 57 seconds behind evans bernhard kohl of gerolsteiner is in fourth , 46 seconds back if either sastre or menchov has designs on the victory in paris , he will have to attack much more fervently in the alps , because he is likely to lose time to evans in the long final time trial on the nexttolast day of the race sastre lost more than a minute in the first time trial , which was only about half as long as the 33mile second time trial evans said he believed that , in addition to schleck , menchov was the biggest threat over three weeks , history shows that he is the stronger , more solid performer , evans said despite the strong performances by the saunier duvalscott team so far two stage wins by riccardo ricco , and monday s stage victory piepoli said the team did not expect to challenge for the yellow jersey instead , it will focus on helping ricco , who is ninth over all , to keep the polkadot jersey designating the best climber he took it monday from a teammate , david de la fuente tuesday is the first of two rest days for the riders and will most likely be a welcome break for evans , who said he was in pain monday going uphill and down , at every speed evans , who could become the first australian to win the tour de france , has finished eighth , fourth and second in the last three french tours he said that standing on the podium in the yellow jersey for the first time monday was an unmatched experience yesterday was my tour low , and today , until this point in the tour , is my tour high , he said seeing the aussie flag and boxing kangaroo at hautacam is kind of nice too
we live in a great country despite all our problems , this is still a nation where parents believe that if their child works hard and plays by the rules , some day he or she may grow up to be a superdelegate the democrats are feeling a little blah right now true , a sixandahalfweek slog to the pennsylvania primary is not the ideal way to spend the spring but the good news is that voters who are intrigued but a little dubious about barack obama will get to see how he performs under pressure admit it , people when you try to envision how the politics of hope would play out in the real world , things go a bit fuzzy how s obama going to get republicans to work with democrats on national health care when republicans do n't want national health care \? how s he going to run a positive ship in a sea of negativity \? the latest crisis , in which samantha power , an obama foreign policy adviser , got quoted calling hillary clinton a monster in an interview with the scotsman is the sort of thing that happens all the time in a hot presidential race \( although we 'd like to know why talking to members of the british commonwealth seems to make this campaign go gaga \) and it s a good sign that obama dumped the poor woman the last thing we need is another president with a loyalty hangup but it did n't necessarily feel like a yes we can ! kind of moment so we 'll see if barack looks good after his fifth trip to wilkesbarre , then he s the one if not , there s still hillary and here s the rundown on saturday , all eyes turn to wyoming , where democrats are choosing presidential delegates , using the popular caucus system , which worked so well in texas that they still do n't know who won this year , democratic caucuses around the country have been imploding with huge crowds , long lines and massive numbers of large adults forced to sit for hours on teeny tiny chairs in elementary school cafeterias the good news is that you wo n't get that kind of problem in wyoming unless every single democrat in the state decides to participate and then reproduces several times on the way to vote trees will bud grass will grow babies will learn to walk easter , opening day and the first use of a baseball analogy to describe the presidential race will come and go then , at last , on april 22 , pennsylvanians will tell the country whether they like hillary clinton or barack obama better it will have almost no effect on the critical delegate count still , we need to find meaning in our lives somewhere , and it s all up to pennsylvania for all its awesomeness , pennsylvania s only contribution to the presidency was james buchanan he was in office at the onset of the civil war and is celebrated mainly for holding down the bottom of the worst presidents lists historians often describe him as our only bachelor president , although buchanan did live for many years with william king of alabama , who later became our only bachelor vice president we do not hear much speculation about whether buchanan was our first gay president because , frankly , most gay americans would prefer to start with somebody who did n't preside over the secession of the south the good news is that this really has nothing to do with the democratic primary but i do think a little bit of history can liven up a dreary morning here we have a classic election 2008 quandary equal parts intense controversy , great importance and utter incomprehensibility in \( very \) brief , florida and michigan moved their primaries to january , breaking the parties' rules the democratic national committee took away both states' presidential delegates as punishment so what about the voters \? in florida , although none of the candidates campaigned and there were no delegates at stake , 17 million democrats still turned out for the primary , which clinton won we will refrain from making obvious references to florida , disenfranchisement , presidential elections , etc in michigan , where obama was n't even on the ballot , clinton beat her only major opposition , the fearsome uncommitted , by an underwhelming 5540 percent michigan and florida say they 'll only accept a doover if somebody else pays for it to the tune of around 28 million we will refrain from making the obvious references to iraq , purple fingers , several trillion dollars , etc , etc some people are proposing a compromise in the form of costcutting caucuses clinton says the party should just forgive and forget , and hand over her delegates the good news is while barack may understand the audacity of hope , only hillary really gets the audacity of audacity
port st lucie , fla on nov 28 , marcia l dedert , finance director of this rapidly growing city , called the administrators of s staterun investment pool to ask whether it was still safe to park her

could not have been worse the city is trying to recreate itself as a center of the biotech industry and had just issued 155 million worth of bonds to lay roads , water pipes and sewer lines in a planned jobs corridor , where it hopes to house the companies it is courting from out of state these are projects that we ca n't afford to stop dead in their tracks , mayor patricia p christensen said the pool s managers said they had been compelled to freeze the pool to save it until the run , it was the largest of more than 100 such pools around the country , with 32 billion in investments because of withdrawals , it now has about 14 billion the pool has not suffered any actual losses on its investments in securities tied to subprime mortgages because it has not sold them while it is unclear how much money , if any , the fund may lose from subprime investments , state officials say they have quarantined over 2 billion in assets from the fund because they no longer meet the pool s investment guidelines or have some other problem the state has hired an interim investment manager to restore stability to the pool , and gov charlie crist has called for a review of the pool s operations by outside lawyers the problems rippling out from the investment fund are the latest in a series of economic setbacks for florida , which is already coping with a weakening housing market and slowing population growth the economic malaise forced lawmakers in the fall to trim 11 billion from the state s 71 billion budget , and economists are predicting that the state might have to cut an additional 25 billion over the next 18 months given those cutbacks , local officials said they do not expect the state to bail out the investment pool , meaning they are likely to bear the losses none said they were facing imminent financial collapse mercifully , the freeze occurred just as endoftheyear property tax revenues were starting to come in but officials in many places said they were still scrambling for alternative sources of cash for the coming months and burning with indignation at officials in tallahassee , the state capital i get the impression that they do n't see this as the taxpayers' money , mayor christensen said of the state board of administration , which operates the pool , along with florida s 140 billion pension fund and more than two dozen other big blocks of public money the threemember board consists of the governor , the treasurer and the attorney general the chief financial officer of the leon county school district , merrill wimberley , said he was in the hospital recovering from surgery on the day of the freeze and was shocked to emerge and find the district s 46 million out of reach i tell you , i felt like rip van winkle , mr wimberley said the school district had to borrow 10 million the same day to pay its 4 , 600 teachers and other staff members , a costly stopgap we do n't relish the thought of having to pay 13 , 000 in interest , mr wimberley said leslie rocha , who oversees finances for the small town of oakland , said that with the freeze , her town had to shift money from other sources to cover a bond payment of about 200 , 000 for a new school it s even a bigger burden since we 're so tiny , ms rocha said hillsborough county left 871 million in the pool , fearing it would worsen the run if it withdrew such a big amount its comptroller , pat frank , said that the county could tap reserves elsewhere for the time being , but that its budget would go out of balance because the pool had stopped paying interest on the frozen money many officials said they believed they could get through the coming months but were bracing for crippling shortfalls should the pool remain frozen well into 2008 , as they expected ms dedert , the port st lucie finance director , said that by revising the budget and realigning sources of money and payments , the city would stay ahead of its bills for the next few months but unless the restrictions on the money in the pool are loosened , she said , the city will run out of cash by summer june 1 is when i start crying , she said at that point , she said , the city would be forced to consider borrowing money or paying the 2 percent penalty for withdrawals many local officials expressed outrage at the penalty they said they were dutybound to protect their communities' principal and resented being expected to pay for what they consider inappropriate risktaking at the state level i ca n't afford a mistake with the public s money , said monti larsen , chief operations officer for the children s services council of broward county , which has 17 million frozen in the fund this is not the first time the state board of administration has had to explain unusual investment losses after the collapse of enron in 2002 , it came to light that the state pension fund had acquired big blocks of enron stock just as other investors were dumping it the fund lost 280 million coleman stipanovich , then the board s deputy executive director , blamed an outside investment adviser , alliance capital management we did n't understand why they were buying it , he told a congressional hearing even my mother was watching on tv and knew about enron now angry depositors are asking much the same questions about mr stipanovich , who was promoted to executive director in 2002 by thengov jeb bush , and who worked closely with lehman brothers , the firm that sold florida more of the subprimetainted securities than any other firm some of the purchases were in july and august , after the risks of subprimemortgage related securities were widely known and most investors were shunning them the timing of florida s purchases was first reported by bloomberg news service mr stipanovich resigned on dec 4 and has declined to discuss his decisions some local officials said in interviews that they were also eager to learn what role mr bush might have played a month after finishing his second term as governor last january , he formed a consulting firm , which in june was engaged by lehman brothers mr bush also sits on the board of lehman brothers s private equity unit spokesmen for mr bush and lehman brothers said mr bush s consulting work had nothing to do with the sales of the securities to the florida investment pool the state board of administration has begun an investigation of the pool s internal decisionmaking the inspectors general of the governor , the treasurer and the attorney general have said they intend to hire outside lawyers and auditors to conduct the investigation government investment pools operate much like moneymarket mutual funds , but they are specifically exempted from the federal laws that cover mutual funds the last time such a pool made headlines was in 1994 , when one in orange county , calif , blew up , causing the county to file for bankruptcy the disaster set off talk of whether the pools should be subject to federal regulation but the idea faded after state and local officials promised reforms now local officials in florida are again wondering whether selfregulation is adequate , and whether federal oversight might be better florida is not the only government investment pool to have acquired assets linked to subprime mortgages , but it is the only one to have suffered a run , for reasons unlikely to be clear until the investigation is completed nor did florida s pool officials move swiftly to stem the withdrawals after the orange county debacle , some governments imposed restrictions on withdrawals arizona , for example , requires five days' notice for withdrawals over 10 million but florida did not have any such restrictions calls for accountability are particularly loud in port st lucie city officials are pressing for a federal investigation into the state s handling of the fund and what they regard as deception in the advice they say ms dedert received from michael lombardi , the pool s manager , to deposit the 135 million he assured me that it was solid , she said roger orr , the city attorney , said , it s bad faith at best and fraud at worst but michael mccauley , senior corporate governance officer for the state board of administration , said there had been no discussion about freezing withdrawals until an emergency board meeting at midday nov 29 we had no idea it was going to be frozen , mr mccauley said in a telephone interview the board members decided to act after a morning of enormous withdrawals it was a particularly bad day , mr mccauley said
, the ' ace , was asked to pitch the first game of saturday s doubleheader against the because that is what starters of his ilk do they set the tenor , they apply pressure on opponents , they win jon niese , the rookie , was asked to pitch the nightcap because he is the undercard he gains comfort and reaps experience he does his best the mets left shea stadium having achieved the expected a split in a quite unexpected way after losing a santana start for the first time in six weeks , 32 , they rallied behind the superior niese , who pitched eight scoreless innings that fueled a 50 victory instead of lamenting a missed opportunity to improve their playoff positioning , the mets ended the day having lost only a halfgame in the standings and scratched two more off the schedule they lead secondplace philadelphia by two and a half games with 15 remaining and have none other than niese to thank i think when we woke up this morning , i said if we could get a split with johan winning , we 'd take that , manager jerry manuel said we got a split , that s the bottom line johan pitched a good game but this kid here was obviously a little better and we were better offensively we have to feel good about that afterward , niese fiddled with the game ball and the lineup card , mementos from his first major league victory there were no special notations that signified the importance of what he did other than the basics 6 hits , 7 strikeouts , 2 walks and 116 pitches befitting a 21yearold making his second career start , niese awshucksed his way through an interview , playing down his emotions and accomplishments i really do n't pitch to where we 're at in the standings , he said i just go out and execute a pitch and hope everything goes right and according to plan his teammates were a little more effusive jos reyes and carlos beltr n remarked how impressed they were at his curveball and his composure , particularly after how overmatched he looked in his last start , sept 2 in milwaukee i just got to say that we 're still in the lead , said beltr n , who homered and went 3 for 4 in the second game to raise his september average to 447 that s what it s all about we have three games we said , well , we should have won the first one , we did n't win it , now we have to win the second one' we ca n't afford these people to come here and take two games like that we went out and we took care of business players are conditioned to say that , with few exceptions , no one game is more important than any other , that they all count equally in the standings however true this may be , that notion is repackaged at this time every season , when the postseason picture comes into focus players know what they must accomplish and how much time is remaining to do it santana is scheduled to make three more starts this season , and should the mets' postseason hopes ride on it , the last one will be the regularseason finale one way to prevent such discussions from advancing beyond the hypothetical stages is to win on days when he pitches manuel bemoaned the lack of offense in the first game the same lineup that collaborated to score 23 runs in a twogame sweep of washington failed to truly capitalize on two basesloaded , noout rallies but , with further elaboration , it was clear that he was speaking about the pitching manuel used four pitchers in the eighth inning , searching for the appropriate matchup , and three of his most reliable pitchers as of late did not produce santana allowed singles to the first two batters scott schoeneweis gave up another one , loading the bases brian stokes surrendered a tworun single to jeff francoeur and the gamewinning sacrifice fly to omar infante you know the game is on the line , said santana \( 137 \) , who is tied with three other starters for the most potential victories \( seven \) blown by their bullpens this season , according to the elias sports bureau like i said , you cannot afford to lose any games , especially at this point of the season because we 're contending and trying to make it to the playoffs the mets had not lost a game started by santana since aug 2 in houston , but santana had yet to lead the mets past the braves in two previous starts against them this season even though they are eliminated from postseason contention and had been swept in their last visit to shea , the braves still tend to frighten any mets fan whose memory goes back further than 2005 they are the only team in the division that owns a winning record \( 86 \) against the mets this season santana overcame a lack of fastball control to arrive in the eighth holding a 20 lead , but with two runners on and no outs , and at 114 pitches , he was pulled casey kotchman , who had reached base on all three plate appearances , was due up in case atlanta called for a pinchhitter , manuel called on schoeneweis , a sinker pitcher who is more adept than pedro feliciano at retiring hitters from both sides of the plate kotchman snuck a single to left , loading the bases with no one out for francoeur in came stokes , whose first pitch to francoeur scooted back up the middle for a tworun single with one out , infante s sacrifice fly scored kotchman , and the mets were left disappointed until niese lifted their spirits baseball is just a funny game , manuel said you expect to do something with the other guy , and then he comes back and flips the script on you
officials are investigating email messages that included racist jokes about presidentelect and were circulated on state government accounts by state employees officials say that the messages apparently originated in a private account but that about 10 state employees appear to have taken action on them , like forwarding them to others bill mcallister , a spokesman for gov , said thursday that none of the 10 employees worked in the governor s office and that to his knowledge no one in the office had received any of the messages , which , he said , ms palin condemns they violate state policy at least that s the prima facie view of things , mr mcallister said in a telephone interview they 're not state business , and obviously they are offensive , and clearly she does n't support that and she does not support racism , and she does not support attacks on the presidentelect the messages were first reported by the associated press , which did not say how it had learned of them the news agency said it had obtained five messages with racist comments , including one that summarized the significance of mr obama s election victory as another black family living in government housing annette kreitzer , the state commissioner of administration , told the ap that the employees who forwarded the messages could be reprimanded but that it was unlikely they would be dismissed ms kreitzer did not immediately respond thursday to requests for an interview

rirkrit tiravanija s solo show at the drawing center is ambitious it is made up of some 200 small , highly detailed graphite drawings of political protests and demonstrations from around the world most of the images have the onthespot look of reportage and all were derived from news photographs printed in the international herald tribune in 20078 ganged together in tight , salonstyle groupings , the drawings have no captions and are presented in no discernible order the global scope of the events is evident in the many languages that appear on placards and banners , though recognition of specific subjects will depend on the political and cultural knowledge viewers bring to them a different kind of discernment may lead you to detect slight differences in drawing styles from one image to the next , though the variations are not a result of mr tiravanija having a good or bad day with a pencil in fact , none of the drawings are from his hand all were commissioned by him from young artists in thailand , some of whom were his students much of mr tiravanija s art in the past has been as much about distribution as collection , about giving things away he has made music in museums , cooked meals in galleries , let people crash in his home , handed out instructions on how to transmit pirate radio broadcasts at the drawing center , he is redistributing world news through art and specifically through drawing , a medium that , in an aggressive marketing push during the past few years , has been heavily promoted as the sine qua non of real art here , symbolically at least , real art meets real world , and genius resides in many anonymous hands not that there is anything pure about the project the drawings are already bought or for sale the unnamed artists have been paid a lump sum for their work mr tiravanija will collect whatever further profit the market yields but exactly because the standard commercial mechanisms are in operation , the show returns yet again to the question of the divide , if it exists , between art s vaunted relevance and its luxuryitem status and it posits another , broader contradiction between the truth of history and the truth of the recording hand with their sharp shadows , pulpy imagery , explicit sex and random violence , raymond pettibon s drawings have been likened to film noir , which preceded them , and southern california punk rock , which developed parallel to them focusing on the latter symbiosis , this exhibition examines mr pettibon s circuitous path toward art his public exposure began in 1978 , when his brother , greg ginn , the guitarist for the punk band black flag , published mr pettibon s first zines while using images from them for black flag fliers , album covers and gift items \( tshirts , stickers and skateboards \) all were published by sst records , founded when mr ginn was 12 as a mailorder company for world war ii surplus radio parts and converted into a record label when no one else would work with black flag sst records became central to the development of american indie rock , releasing albums by groups like the minutemen , h sker d , the meat puppets and sonic youth assembling most of mr pettibon s sst output 44 zines , 120 fliers and a full complement of album covers this show suggests an excellent match of visual and musical sensibilities also displayed are the five offset prints that were mr pettibon s first signed works \( sold by sst for 175 each \) and the announcement for his first solo exhibition , at the semaphore gallery in the east village in 1986 your progress through this material will be aided or hindered by the sounds of songs by black flag and other sst bands , which alternate with henry rollins , the former black flag front man , reading his 1994 memoir , get in the van on the road with black flag , which won a grammy for best spokenword recording for his first new york solo , demetrius oliver fills the walls of the gallery with fisheyestyle photographs shot in the interiors of places he has recently lived or worked , including a hotel , an artists' residency and his brooklyn studio he turns each into a kind of stage holding a fixed set of props pickaxes stand , handles upright , on a bed a glistening lump of coal sits like a monument in a room a camera stares out at us , as if photographing itself the artist appears in some pictures , arranging objects his casual presence suggests the improvisatory , lowtech spirit of the project he is making technical adjustments , not performing there is no narrative shifts in locale suggest that what s happening could be happening anywhere the pictures themselves feel almost accidental some are made from reflections caught in the convex surfaces of a light bulb or a tea kettle opposing this impression of the happenstance is an overriding image of astronomical order the circular photographs hang like planets in formation a slideshow displays the image of a single wave , presumably pulled upward by the moon the repeated fisheye perspective suggests an omniscient gaze taking everything in , like emerson s egoless transparent eyeball seeing unity in all things in earlier work , mr oliver used his body as a subject , transforming it in various ways now that body is barely present , making this show a radical selfdeparture for a young artist some people become writers when they are crazed enough about the state of the world , and some become collectors when they are crazy enough about a certain kind of artifact the two extremes converge in scrawl , an exhibition of homemade posters , broadsides and other communiqu s culled from the streets of new york by harley spiller , the administrator of the franklin furnace archives , an independent curator and a collector of some ambition this show , which he has organized , represents but one of his 80 collections it features messages from 40 people conveying varying degrees of outrage about the government , corporations , politicians and people unlike themselves each person is represented by two or more efforts , usually more you soon know them by their handwriting , their choice of paper and writing implements and , of course , their trigger points one writer using mostly blue and green markers promoted bill bradley for president in 2000 and 2004 , and mr spiller has the written proof another warns of the danger of aids with small buttonlike circles with the word gay crossed out a third has typed and copied lists of black inventors and their inventions several sheets \( one and twosided photocopies \) covered with finely scribbled equations resemble an ancient manuscript one person likes to annotate copies of articles about the christian right with a selection of markers and pens , resulting in colorful patchworks that vibrate with anxiety especially prominent are three white foamcore sheets covered with large black letters whose lack of total sense does not compromise their passion or eloquence one begins due to repeating infamous unjustified searches following fatality of persons as subjects of the reflex for deadly force operating somewhere between screamers on the subway and postings on the internet , these scraps offer evidence that the death of the author is greatly exaggerated the most basic in the way of words , handwriting and materials can sustain an individual voice what took him so long \? andres serrano was making stylish , provocative photographs involving body fluids blood , urine and semen back in the 1980s now that he has gotten around to feces , it feels like too much too late each of the 18 monumental photographs in the show , whose title ca n't be printed here , pictures a heroically enlarged heap of brown stuff against a celestial background of glowing color including their heavy black frames , they measure about 8 by 6 feet some of the subjects are semidry like burnt sausage some are gooey like cake frosting robinsize flies perch on two examples titles indicate that some were made by animals like rabbits and dogs which ones might be of human derivation ca n't be determined except in the case of one parenthetically titled selfportrait attractionrepulsion is the main effect the pictures are luridly beautiful if you do n't think about what they represent big as they are and hanging close together on walls painted black , they create an imposingly theatrical , even ecclesiastical or satanic ambiance but it is all so heavyhanded , obvious and predictably shocking you can talk about equating feces and money , but freudian analysis seems beside the point when it comes to such blatantly attentionseeking work on the other hand , hanging in a separate room with walls painted intense red is the famous 1987 image of a small , white plastic crucifix immersed in urine it is still a beautiful , ethereal , luminous and curiously sad picture , and the installation is so compelling you might want to say a little prayer viewers expecting new works by vik muniz , the master of tricky photography , will think they 've wandered into the wrong gallery standing on padded blocks is a group of old paintings , their fronts to the wall but these are not just any old paintings labels on stretchers and backing panels identify them as major monuments of modern art history , including seurat s sunday on la grande jatte , picasso s demoiselles d'avignon and matisse s red studio they are , in fact , fakes replicas based on close study of the backs of the actual paintings mr muniz created them with the assistance of expert craftsmen , artists and forgers who reproduced not only the carpentry , canvas and labels of the originals but every stain , scratch , dent and pencil mark in the rear gallery small works on paper replicate the backs of famous photographs from the new york times archive at the museum of modern art , including , for example , the winner in the broad jump , jesse owens and view of astronaut footprint in lunar soil covered by handwritten notations , rubberstamp marks , pieces of tape and newspaper clippings , they look so real it s hard to believe no pictures are on the other side it s paradoxical what you take for the back is really the front , and what you imagine should be the front does not exist it s as though you had encountered a hole in the fabric of reality to meditate on these philosophically intriguing and impressively designed works is to wonder about our habits of seeing and believing larissa bates was n't included in dargerism contemporary artists and henry darger , now ending its run at the american folk art museum , but she might as well have been the lederhosen boys and mothermen in her small inkandgouache paintings are guysonly versions of darger s impish , militant vivian girls in the derivative but beautifully described world of ms bates s paintings , male desire runs amok in the mothermen series , centaurlike creatures give birth in the woods the lederhosen boys , young scamps with chubby limbs and blond curls , perform mysterious s ances on rocky bluffs the landscapes in most of these paintings are at least as interesting as the figures their sources include nicolas poussin , the northern renaissance artist joachim de patinir and persian miniatures paintings by the contemporary artist hernan bas , of dandyish young men in lush , windswept landscapes , also come to mind if the paintings combine these diverse influences , the large mixedmedia installation in the center of the gallery teases them apart a lifesize , goldpainted plaster figure of a headless motherman and three smaller papierm ch lederhosen boys flank a mirrored platform embedded in this structure is a video monitor showing highlights from wrestling matches , as well as actors costumed to look like characters from the paintings this diagrammatic piece is a wrong turn in an otherwise compelling fantasy world

during his lifetime no one knew that \( 18921973 \) had been secretly producing in his cluttered chicago apartment one of the 20th century s great works of visual art at his death he left behind , in addition to voluminous writings , almost 150 largescale watercolor paintings \( or nearly 300 , counting both sides of each sheet \) illustrating a hairraising epic adventure called the story of the vivian girls , in what is known as the realms of the unreal , of the glandecoangelinnian war storm , caused by the child slave rebellion originally bound in volumes as wide as nine feet , darger s scrolllike paintings have since been recognized as the works of a selftaught genius , and this outsider art has been inspirational for many academically trained professional artists the influence of darger s work on insider artists is the subject of an enlightening but problematic exhibition at the american folk art museum called darger contemporary artists and henry darger organized by brooke davis anderson , curator and director of the museum s contemporary center , the show presents 12 darger paintings from the museum s permanent collection alongside works by 11 contemporary artists who have been influenced or inspired by darger it is the first and one hopes not the last exhibition of contemporary art at the museum it s a promising idea for a show , especially considering darger s emergence in recent years as a kind of popculture mascot \( he has been referred to in songs by numerous rock bands \) a problem is that none of this exhibition s contemporary artists , although worthy on their own merits , are in the same league as darger yet this turns out to be a good thing seeing darger among other artists brings into focus what makes him so singular that can be summed up in a word amplitude darger s art has a breadth of technical , formal , narrative and symbolic imagination rarely encountered in today s professional art world in an eccentric , oldfashioned children s picturebook style \( william blake meets l frank baum s wizard of oz \) the darger paintings show how seven sisters called the vivian girls attempt to rescue children enslaved by men known as the glandelinians they depict panoramic landscapes populated by often naked , prepubescent , sexually ambiguous children \( they look like girls , but have penises \) and by soldiers who menace , pursue , abuse and kill them the paintings envision a cosmic , erotically charged struggle between good and evil , innocence and experience , freedom and captivity how the paintings are constructed is also fascinating darger traced his images people , trees , flowers , birds , mountains and clouds from books , magazines , comics , children s books and other sources he transferred images into his paintings using carbon paper , and if the size of a source was n't right , he would have it photographically enlarged at the corner drugstore because of this process , the paintings have a jumbled , collagelike look yet at the same time they cohere into expansive , atmospheric , lushly colorful , sometimes hallucinatory worlds teetering between order and chaos , the paintings formally reflect the terrific narrative and symbolic tensions that animate them the exhibition s professional artists have more modest goals in justine kurland s staged photographs , teenage girls hang out in pastoral landscapes like vivian girls but there is no broader story line similarly , in amy cutler s finely made painting of longhaired girls in dreamlike situations anthony goicolea s photographs and paintings of boys in wilderness settings and robyn o'neil s oversize pencil drawings of tiny people in vast landscapes their mythic narratives are implied but not developed \( though not very dargeresque , mr goicolea s two short , surrealistic videos might start you fantasizing about a vivian girls movie directed by , say , terry gilliam \) paula rego s big canvases from the early 1980s are the exhibition s most surprising inclusion these brushy , cartoonish paintings picture vivian girls in various exotic situations , but mainly they look like a classicist s illadvised attempt to hop on that era s neoexpressionist bandwagon yunfei ji and trenton doyle hancock are closer to darger in their ambitions and techniques but while mr ji s complicated , fauxantique inkonpaper paintings illustrating the chinese opium wars and the displacement of chinese villagers by the three gorges dam project have narrative sweep , they do not have the peculiar psychological urgency conveyed by darger mr hancock s drawn , painted and collaged works are based on a humorous cosmology revolving around furry , striped creatures called mounds they have some of darger s storytelling flair and technical inventiveness , but a goofy absurdity limits the sort of emotional poignancy found in darger the british ceramicist grayson perry , whose vases are covered by roughly handdrawn imagery and photographs , may be close to darger too , but it is hard to tell how expansive his vision is from only the two vases on view jefferson friedman s 15minute classicalmusic composition sacred heart explosion , which is based on a particularly violent darger painting and plays three times an hour in the museum s cafe , raises the question of how darger might have scored his heroic tale two artists , one could argue , do n't belong in the show michael st john s small sculpture of a darger character called a blengin simulates a movie souvenir toy it may be an hommage , but as a popconceptualist object it is far from darger s romantic , visionary spirit the same is true of justin lieberman , who digitally inserts the bodies of nude girls from jock sturges photographs into landscapes copied from darger paintings , and gives them photographic heads of preteenage beauty queens on the other hand , the exhibition suggests the possibilities of an even more inclusive show completely unknown as an artist during his lifetime , darger is now a widely beloved figure of almost van goghlike mythic stature a show exploring all the ways he is seen and thought about by his artistic followers and fans could be revelatory
on the back patio of an east village apartment , natasha kouri sat on a bench surrounded by plastic bottles and bags she picked up a bottle from the woman on her left , who chopped its bottom off at the poland spring label ms kouri wove a handful of bags through the opening and handed the work in progress to her right a bearded man taped the bags to the bottle , fluffed the bags into petals and tossed the results into the growing pile of plastic petunias 775 down , only 1 , 225 to go we 're the art minions , ms kouri , 21 , said with a smile last week what the directors tell us to do , we do with reggaetrance music as a soundtrack , this sixperson assembly line cut , stuffed , fluffed in the building s central courtyard another team built funhouse mirrors out of mylar , and max darby , a product designer and one of the masterminds behind this group artwork , put together vinyl street signs to be attached to an 18foothigh , 60footlong mural that was still in pieces in the courtyard s nooks we had no money , ms darby , 41 , explained , so we 're basically making art from garbage four hours a night , three nights a week , for the last three months , about 80 people have rotated through this basement apartment for craft sessions none will see the final presentation of their work until it is assembled in the black rock desert in nevada , where the annual burning man art festivalravelovein takes place the week before labor day about 48 , 000 people are expected to haul everything they need to survive tents , water , fakefur costumes for this experiment in commercefree , creatively wild community thousands of them will come from new york and set up camps with names like smoochdome , disorient and rubber chicken ms darby and her craft workers are part of kostume kult , a camp known for giving away 2 , 000 pounds of sparkling , sequined , saucy costumes to attendees this year the camp wanted to make a more artistic contribution as well , so members friends , friends of friends , and others who found the group through its web site , , or through the event itself came up with a new york interpretation of the festival s 2008 american dream theme it s a coney island theme , ms darby said , pointing to a sketch of the mural with roller coasters , balloons and skyscrapers the left is all candy floss , childlike colors then it turns into grimy gotham city , all gray and dark the mural will serve as a giant doorway to the camp , which they 've dubbed kkoney island visitors who wander through the middle of the boardwalkdowntown split will arrive in central park , a chill space with carpets , cushions and a canopy of plastic flowers a critical element of the project , ms darby said , was having everyone contribute to its creation i wanted to come up with something that would n't intimidate people , she said i was watching a kid do a coloring book , and thought , that s it , paint by number' once the mural was designed , the group projected the final drawing onto the mural panels , traced it , then colored it in even those whose artistic training ended with crayolas felt a sense of accomplishment i worked on a piece of the , shuli passow , 31 , a foundation program director , said a few days after the camp s fundraising party this month , where some of the panels were previewed it felt really gratifying to help set up those pieces that i had contributed to and see how everyone s contribution had come together to create this amazing scene some of those contributions are more practicalminded since late april , julie ziff sint , 27 , a nonprofit consultant and a kostume kult manager , has spent about four hours a day dealing with logistics organizing meetings , managing the 24 , 000 camp budget \( which covers kostume kult s expenses , not individuals' \) , counseling people who have never spent time in the harsh desert environment one newbie asked what the accommodations were like , she said , her eyes wide my answer was , if you bring it , you can sleep in it nothing is for sale at burning man except ice and coffee campers are responsible for everything they need for survival and comfort , and that can pose difficulties for east coasters the last three times jeff cacossa , 33 , a graphic designer and new kostume kult member , went to burning man , he was living in san francisco we just jumped in the car and threw everything on the roof , he recalled now it s a lot more planning many transcontinental participants ship their supplies or buy them in reno on the way to the site for years some groups have taken turns organizing a huge rail shipment for new yorkers last weekend they filled three tractortrailer containers with makeshift kitchens , bicycles and desert art sculptures we ca n't all be artists , said alex kalmanofsky , 37 , a drugindustry researcher who organizes the shipment so you have to find a way to become part of the art for me that s getting it out there there s the art , there s the planning , and then there s the performance several members of kostume kult are also part of a fire dancing troupe , nyc sparkworks , that will perform underneath the 40foot figure of the man just before he goes up in flames this chaotic conflagration , the festival s namesake , is the symbolic and energetic climax of the event throughout the summer , the dancers have rehearsed on a rooftop in williamsburg , brooklyn when the sun set a couple of weeks ago , the group dipped their hoops , staffs , fire darts and fire rings in an ammo box filled with white gas and lamp oil they lit up in shifts , the darters shooting jets of fire between one another s legs , then sprinting upstage for a dosido , the flame spinning in a lasso over their heads the hoopers gyrated inside cylinders of fire , inching the flames from their hips up to their necks sean stogner , a member of both kostume kult and nyc sparkworks , deftly maneuvered his fire ring , spinning it around his wrist in a frenzy , passing it around his back and under a leg mr stogner , 21 , has been fire dancing for just a year , but his girlfriend , ms kouri , calls him a prodigy i do n't have a spiritual connection to it , mr stogner said i do , said ms kouri , an avid hula and fire hooper mr stogner said , people call me a techie , demonstrating a righthand full extension and a lefthand antispin ms kouri observed he s concerned with how visually it looks , as opposed to how kinetically it feels i go for the feel of hooping the couple , new york university students who met during orientation three years ago , will be trekking to their second burning man this year in addition to their kostume kult responsibilities , they 've been making and selling nonflammable hoops to raise money for their trip , which mr stogner estimates will cost them 2 , 600 in airfare , gas , camp dues , supplies and costumes but they say the investment is worth it being involved in something bigger than yourself , ms kouri said , describing the experience you get there and you see what you 've made and you feel so proud
des moines as the most visible link to the greatest era of drake university basketball , the radio analyst dolph pulliam wears his bulldogs heart on his sleeves , his back and everywhere else it is all in the suit a blue leather suit for almost three months , through 20 of drake s teamrecord 21 consecutive victories , pulliam who starred on the 196869 bulldogs team that nearly upset ucla and lew alcindor in the final four stretched his 6foot4 frame into the eyecatching suit to his surprise , it became the ultimate talisman at drake s home court , knapp center , fans gravitated to pulliam as if the suit had magical powers , touching or rubbing it for luck , even as he sat at the broadcast table which is kind of weird , said the senior point guard adam emmenecker drake s streak ended thursday with a 6562 loss at southern illinois pulliam ditched the leather for a gray jacket and black slacks for the bulldogs' game saturday at northern iowa , but drake made pulliam s sartorial choice irrelevant the 16thranked bulldogs \( 232 \) pulled away late in the game to win , 6555 , and clinch drake s first missouri valley conference regularseason title since 1971 that was also the last time drake , a private university with about 5 , 300 students , qualified for the ncaa tournament it s been an amazing year , said the firstyear coach keno davis , who succeeded his father , tom davis it seems like when we come away with a victory , it s the first time for something in december , drake beat iowa in iowa city for the first time in 40 years last month , drake appeared in the associated press rankings for the first time since march 1975 , at no 22 going into tuesday night s home game against bradley , drake had the conference s leading playmaker \( emmenecker \) , rebounder \( jonathan cox \) and 3point shooter \( josh young \) emmenecker and cox are the third and fourth walkons recruited by tom davis to start and earn scholarships even drake s one loss since nov 10 said something about the season after that game , southern illinois fans chanted overrated , which made keno davis shake his head i never knew we 'd get to the point at drake to say we 're overrated , he said it really shows how far we came in one year and that thrills pulliam drake fell from national basketball prominence after coach maury john left for iowa state in 1971 , after three consecutive 20win seasons and ncaa tournament appearances the 196869 team , led by pulliam , a sixthround pick of the boston celtics in 1969 , and the future nba players willie mccarter and willie wise , was john s best the bulldogs lost to ucla , 8582 , in the ncaa semifinals , then routed north carolina in the consolation game but none of the seven permanent coaches who followed john had winning career records crowds dwindled so much that the team moved from veterans memorial auditorium downtown , which held more than 12 , 000 , to the 7 , 002seat knapp center , which opened on campus in december 1992 i 'll tell you , this place was like a morgue in here , said pulliam , the university s director of community outreach , as he sat in knapp center on friday morning most folks had given up hope that s how low the confidence level had gotten before tom davis came here davis , forced out at iowa in 1999 after 13 seasons , was still living in iowa city when drake approached him in 2003 he took the job because keno , then an assistant at southeast missouri state , said he wanted to coach with him reviving the program seemed problematic drake had no scholarships available when the davises arrived , and keno davis said the program had so little visibility that in airports , some people mistook the blue athletic gear and capital d logo for duke s but the staff kept finding and developing overlooked players last season s 1715 finish was drake s first winning season in 20 years davis felt the program was ready for keno to run , though the bulldogs lost four starters and were later picked to finish ninth in the 10team conference you 'd have to be kidding yourself to say you saw it coming to the degree that they 've won , tom davis , 69 , said in a telephone interview from iowa city but we had a good foundation here of great shooters the coaches encouraged players to ignore the shot clock and shoot whenever they were open , even far beyond the arc drake leads the mvc in 3point baskets a game \( 932 \) after finishing last a year ago it s not my coaching style , but it s the makeup of this team , keno davis said i 'd be stubborn to try to fight it drake s smarts nine players had 30 gradepoint averages last semester and familiarity also set it apart led by the savvy emmenecker , who has a 394 gpa while carrying four majors in drake s demanding business school , the bulldogs communicate by eye contact , subtle gestures and sounds and they hustle despite having only one starter taller than 65 , drake ranks second in the conference in offensive rebounds maybe in a halfdozen games this year , we 've gone completely away from our game plan and put in something we had n't even practiced , keno davis said i would n't even try it with most teams i 've been associated with , but our guys can pick it up and they understand what we 're trying to do and then there is pulliam s suit , which he bought from a catalog three years ago and occasionally wore to games in november , keno davis asked pulliam to wear it to a nonconference game at wisconsinmilwaukee after drake s 8059 victory , davis went on his postgame radio show and badgered pulliam into wearing it to games until the bulldogs lost i'm thinking in my mind , oh , maybe three or four games , and then we 'll get a loss and then i 'll be out of the leather suit , pulliam said little did i know pulliam said he would continue to wear it at knapp center , where the bulldogs have won 16 straight since last season and sold out the previous six \( the final two home games are already sellouts \) and he will break it out next month for the mvc tournament in st louis , which drake has never won some people predicted it 'll never get out of the grave , dolph it will never become as good as your team , ' pulliam said of the bulldogs' program and here we are
location atlanta nickname yellow jackets quick facts while a number of teams chose to make a coaching change this offseason \( seven thus far on the countdown \) , perhaps no program opted for wholesale change as much as georgia tech , which will introduce a new coach and a strikingly different offensive mentality this fall gone is chan gailey 4432 in six years with the yellow jackets doomed by his inability to get the yellow jackets beyond mediocrity and a negative relationship with the tech fan base though gailey never experienced a losing season in his six years in atlanta , only once did tech finish with more than seven wins , and his teams were 24 in bowl games a former nfl coordinator and head coach , gailey ran a prostyle offense to decidedly mixed reviews with the jackets while the team had its moments offensively \( especially starring calvin johnson in 2006 \) , it was crippled by ineffective quarterback play throughout his tenure to reverse the trend of middling play the university went in a different direction \( and then some \) with the hiring of the former navy coach paul johnson , who brings to georgia tech the optionbased offense he ran to great effect with the midshipmen and division iaa georgia southern it is an intriguing experiment , for lack of a better word while critics call the triple option outdated , johnson showed at navy that it can work against more athletic teams just ask notre dame those bemoaning his hiring seem to have already forgotten the recent success of option teams like nebraska and air force when it s on , the option is as hard to defend as any offensive system in football tidbit though the team has had three coaches this decade \( five if you count two interim coaches \) , the georgia tech program had only three coaches from 19041966 john heisman \( 104297 from 190419 \) , william alexander \( 1349515 from 192044 \) and bobby dodd \( 165648 from 194566 \) tidbit \( oh , how georgia tech hates the

division head coach paul johnson \( 79 western carolina \) , entering his first season with yellow jackets johnson has been extremely successful at both his previous stops , leading georgia southern to a 6210 mark and two division iaa national championships from 19972001 and navy to a 4529 record from 2002 through last fall his time at navy was among the most successful in program history he is one of five navy coaches with at least five years experience with a winning percentage over 600 , and his stretch of five consecutive seasons with at least eight wins was the first in the program s history johnson has shown he can make a quick turnaround he inherited a navy team coming off a twoyear stretch of 120 ball , and after finishing 210 in his initial season , went 4319 the rest of his tenure in 2003 , johnson led navy to an 85 mark and a trip to the houston bowl , helping the midshipmen become only the sixth team in ncaa history to go from a winless season to a bowl game in two years or less while many maintain his system won t work when facing the talented athletes of the acc , johnson s resume does the talking the system works , and given time will be just as successful at georgia tech as it was at navy 2007 record 76 \( 44 acc \) the season was a step back from 2006 , when the yellow jackets finished 95 and won the coastal division , but proved par for the course for tech under gailey despite outscoring its opponents , 341271 \( allowing only 208 points per game \) , tech was unable to do better than a 76 record most of the blame can again fall upon inconsistent quarterback play bennett completed less than 50 percent of his passes , with seven touchdown passes and nine interceptions despite troubling play under center , the tech running game and its overall defense was strong all season , helping the yellow jackets land their 11th consecutive bowl appearance high point winning four of five in the midseason helped propel tech into bowl play , but none of the victories \( over miami , army , duke and unc \) were particularly impressive the fall s best win was a 133 victory over clemson , a game the tech defense dominated , allowing only 228 yards of total offense a 333 win over notre dame to open the season felt great even after the irish were revealed as one of the nation s worst teams low point a few close losses \( 2823 to virginia , 2826 to maryland \) kept the yellow jackets from repeating as coastal division champs a 3117 loss to georgia was tech s seventh straight loss in the series , dating back to a year before gailey s hiring tech

goal attempts as a senior , scoring a teamleading 108 total points brooks , the only punter taken in the draft , was a firstteam allamerican as a senior he leaves with the highest career punting average in acc history on defense , among the seven lost starters are the team s four leading tacklers , led by the standout linebacker philip wheeler the first yellow jacket taken in the draft \( third round to the colts \) , wheeler led the team with 89 stops \( 9 for loss \) and added 6 sacks also gone at linebacker is gary guyton , whose 78 stops \( 135 for loss \) was good for second behind wheeler the defensive end pairing of adamm oliver and darrell robertson combined for 22 tackles for loss and 13 sacks players to watch the sophomore running back jonathan dwyer was spectacular as choice s backup in 2007 , rushing for 436 yards and 9 touchdowns dwyer should be salivating at the idea of playing in a rushing offense potent enough to feature seven players with more than 460 yards rushing last fall the senior left tackle andrew gardner is one of the best in the nation a threeyear starter , gardner was a firstteam allacc performer as a junior and is a potential allamerican as a senior tech returns its two leading receivers in the junior greg smith \( 37 receptions for 588 yards \) and the sophomore demaryius thomas \( 35 for 558 , teamleading four touchdown catches \) they will also be asked to run the ball out of the slot in the option offense the strength of the tech defense will be on its line , where the senior defensive tackles vance walker and daryl richard combine to form one of the best interior duos in the acc walker was a firstteam allacc choice last fall after finishing with 45 tackles \( 14 for loss \) and a yellow jacketbest 85 sacks the senior defensive end michael johnson is poised for a breakout season after posting four sacks as a junior the leading returning tackler is the sophomore morgan burnett \( 57 stops \) , who also led the team with three interceptions position battle to watch it s got to be at quarterback , where bennett s untimely departure leaves the position wide open the leading candidates are the sophomore josh nesbitt and the senior calvin booker nesbitt , the primary backup to bennett last year , has the athleticism to run the demanding position booker , an auburn transfer , played well in the season finale and the bowl game the battle will come down to whether nesbitt can grasp the intricacies of the option offense if not , it will likely be a platoon situation regardless of who starts in 2008 , the position is likely a prime target for johnson and his staff in the upcoming recruiting cycle two incoming freshmen jaybo shaw and tevin washington will get a look in the fall , though the highly regarded quarterback prospect sean renfree , a tech commitment prior to johnson s hiring , opted out of his verbal commitment and will instead attend duke  2008 schedule aug 28 jacksonville state sept

lateseason conference games from clemson through miami are all intriguing season breakdown prediction this has the potential to be a rebuilding year for georgia tech , as it may take the yellow jackets a year to find their rhythm in johnson s option attack losing 14 starters off an already underachieving team intensifies an already difficult situation , as does a frontloaded schedule after the season opener against jacksonville state the yellow jackets go on the road for boston college and virginia tech , a rude opening to acc play for johnson and his staff tech fans should look at this season in two parts the first half as a building process , as growing pains are certain to occur , and the second half as a harbinger of things to come the team will certainly improve as the season moves on , but unfortunately , it may be too late by that point for the yellow jackets to get into their 12thstraight bowl game i love the johnson hire and believe he will do great things at georgia tech but this yellow jackets team is not prepared to go bowling i predict a 57 finish , with enough improvement down the stretch for fans to consider consistent bowl appearances and potential acc championships a reality beginning in 2009 dream season everything clicks right away under johnson , as the option attack proves indefensible the jackets finish the regular season 93 and beat georgia for the first time since 2000 nightmare season nothing seems to go right for johnson and the yellow jackets in his first season at the helm , and they win only three games though they lay the groundwork for the future where yellow jacket fans congregate tech fans should check out sting talk and gojacketscom , the school s scout site fans looking for a no holds barred discussion of georgia

the tony nominations are in , and it would be difficult to come up with a season that presented a clearer portrait of where broadway is headed and where it has been the creative team behind in the heights , a musical with a hiphop , rap and salsainfused score that led the field on tuesday with 13 tony nominations \( including shots at best musical and best direction \) , is about as young as you get in a broadway production 6 of the show s 11 individual nominees are under 33 the show received good , but not glowing , reviews when it made its debut off broadway last year and raised eyebrows when it moved to broadway , but may get the last laugh when the tony winners are announced at the ceremony at radio city music hall on june 15 the success of heights is due largely to the talent and charm of its creator , the 28yearold linmanuel miranda , a broadway newbie who has achieved the rare honor of being nominated both for leading actor and for composer lyricist but in a sign of just how unconventional this season has been for new musicals , stew , the singlenamed cocreator and star of the rock musical passing strange also making his debut pulled off a similar feat his show was nominated for seven awards he was nominated for four in the categories of acting , book , score and orchestrations , the last two with his writing partner , heidi rodewald even the presumed favorite in the play category , which is sometimes the province of the theater lions , was written by a writer new to broadway , tracy letts , whose august osage county , a twofisted , pulitzer prizewinning melodrama , leads the category with seven nominations , including three for acting and one for direction when xanadu opened last summer , broadway insiders would have blanched at the thought that douglas carter beane s campy , rollerskating paean to the famously awful 1980 movie of the same title , would be in the running for best musical , but there it is the fourth slot went , in something of a surprise , to crybaby , the lukewarmly received and at times rather bawdy musical based on the 1990 john waters movie it picked up four nominations , including one for the score , written by two young men making their broadway debuts adam schlesinger , the bassist for the rock band fountains of wayne , and david javerbaum , an executive producer and writer on the daily show the singing talent is new too three of the five nominees in the leading actor in a musical category mr miranda , stew and paulo szot , a rising opera star nominated for his turn in the lincoln center theater revival rodgers hammerstein s south pacific are broadway firsttimers it s remarkable because the nominators tend to skew much older , said rocco landesman , president of jujamcyn theaters , none of whose tenants were nominated for best musical i guess they want to be young and hip this is more surprising than usual but the old broadway , the broadway of the big , lush , traditional rock'emsock'em musical , made a convincing statement of its own the ravedabout south pacific was nominated in 11 categories , and the revival of gypsy in seven , including a nod for its director , the 89yearold arthur laurents , who is also the show s book writer he has directed it three times and has won tony nominations for two of them it also happens that stephen sondheim , who wrote the lyrics for gypsy , will receive a lifetime achievement award , while a special posthumous honor will go to robert russell bennett for his orchestrations , including those for south pacific in 1949 those two productions set up what many around the industry see as an oldfashioned showdown between the lead actresses kelli o'hara , nominated for her role as nellie forbush in south pacific , and patti lupone , for her role as mama rose in gypsy \( a role that has picked up a nomination for its actress every time it has appeared on broadway \) that category is a tough one anyway other nominees are kerry butler from xanadu , faith prince from a catered affair and jenna russell from the roundabout theater company s production of sunday in the park with george while the production of sunday is not as expansive as that of gypsy or south pacific , it was celebrated by the critics and picked up nine nominations , including acting nods for its two stars , daniel evans and ms russell kathleen marshall s financially successful but critically panned production of grease , the only other eligible musical revival , was also nominated august is the sole american work in the best new play category , though it shares one thing with its competitors it did n't come out of new york , having been originally produced by the steppenwolf theater company in chicago \( mr letts aside , five members of

philadelphia no other reliever in baseball was as dominant this season as brad lidge he converted all 41 save opportunities and did not lose a decision , going 20 and helping to lift the to their second consecutive national league east title put simply , they would not have advanced to the world series without him here , though , is the catch the phillies will open the series wednesday night in the city of the american league representative boston or tampa bay in part because of lidge s performance in an exhibition game the lone stain on his spectacular season came in the allstar game on july 15 , when he gave up the winning run in the 15th inning of the nl s 43 loss the defeat once again rewarded the al with homefield advantage in the series at the time , the impact was felt only in his right shoulder lidge warmed up six times , throwing about 100 pitches before he was summoned but when the phillies clobbered milwaukee in the division series and blasted the dodgers in the nl championship series , they were reminded , to paraphrase fox s incessant stream of commercials , just how much that game counted i had n't really thought about it , the utility player eric bruntlett said friday afternoon before the phillies worked out at citizens bank park to me , it s bizarre that s how we decide homefield advantage , but we 're ok with that if that s going to be brad s one time , that s more than fine with me the leagues used to alternate homefield advantage in the world series but that stopped in 2003 , when commissioner bud selig , mortified that the 2002 allstar game ended in a 77 tie because managers had misappropriated their pitching staffs , rewarded an extra home game to the winning league and so , a new , if not universally adored , tradition was born benefiting most from the new rule was the al , which has won each of the six allstar games since but none of those world series reached a seventh game when that extra home game would come into play and having that advantage does not always guarantee success ask phillies reliever chad durbin he played on the 2006 tigers , who split their first two games in detroit but lost the next three to st louis if you think about it , those three games can play just as big of a factor , too , durbin said it s all relative since 2003 , no losing pitcher in an allstar game had reached the world series in the same year one , though , came close in 2004 , had roger clemens won game 7 of the nlcs against the cardinals , his astros would have opened the world series in boston because of his allstar game meltdown in his home ballpark durbin , asked about the bizarre juxtaposition with lidge , just shook his head and shrugged as the nl s premier closer , lidge had been told that he was going to be the last pitcher used nl manager clint hurdle had told him so lidge , who was not in the clubhouse friday when reporters were given access , had been battling stiffness and soreness in his right shoulder , though he did not disclose it until later the nl was leading by a run with two outs in the eighth inning when billy wagner gave up the tying run lidge said at the time that he had never warmed up so often without getting into a game after he surrendered two singles and a walk to load the bases with one out , michael young lofted a ball to right field corey hart caught it , but his throw was late , and justin morneau scored the winning run on a fly ball that half the outfielders in baseball would throw the guy out on and hart s got a good arm , durbin said he was probably tired , too he probably played catch for 10 innings straight he must have been worn out philadelphia manager charlie manuel seethed , feeling that lidge had been abused , and in early august , he was forced to rest lidge for about a week because of an inflamed right shoulder he returned on aug 15 and has had no problems since he has saves in five of the phillies' seven postseason victories bruntlett played with lidge on the 2005 astros , who were swept by the white sox in the world series , and he said that playing the first two games in chicago had little effect on the outcome more often , he said , things like pitching matchups prove more important when you 're going into a series , if you do n't have homefield advantage , it s not like you 're going into it , going , oh , we 're in trouble here , bruntlett said we have to win on the road we won two on the road in the last series and clinched the last series on the road this team does n't have trouble playing on the road the phillies had the best road record in the nl this season , 4437 maybe that is how homefield advantage should be determined , durbin said , laughing but he quickly added that he did not think the phillies should have it both tampa bay \( 9765 \) and boston \( 9567 \) had better regularseason records let s look at it that way , durbin said
dana point , calif kenny williams craned his neck to steal a peek at the lobby bar television , hoping to see if his friend was about to become presidentelect of the united states all 30 general managers at baseball s annual executive meetings here at a southern california resort spent tuesday distracted by more than arbitration seminars and beckoning golf holes like many other citizens , they sat around televisions expecting to watch the national election returns deep into the night but williams , general manager of the , followed the coverage with a keener sense of anticipation than any of his contemporaries not only is he one of just two africanamerican general managers the los angeles angels' tony reagins is the other but as a fellow prominent member of chicago s black community he has known for almost 10 years , and considers him a friend they have hung out at mutual friends' barbecues , shot hoops at a local health club as recently as this summer , and with williams intrigued by publicpolicy issues and obama a longtime white sox fan discussed each other s jobs far more than their own i'm interested in all these questions of foreign policy and national security , williams said in between his games , shooting a couple of baskets , he asks me , what about your pitching \? ' i said , excuse me , you worry about national security , i 'll worry about the pitching' williams said he was invited to obama s electionnight event tuesday in chicago , but could n't go because of these meetings so williams watched from afar with his fellow general managers williams voted for obama via absentee ballot , which is how most baseball executives choose to vote when these meetings which kick off the winter hotstove season in early november overlap election tuesdays the last time they fell during a national election was 2000 , when they were held in as if anyone present could forget none other than florida on that night , the current mets general manager , omar minaya , then the team s assistant gm , also was wondering if a friend of his would become presidentelect minaya worked as a scout for the texas rangers in the 1990s when george w bush was the club s general partner , and the two became close like most executives watching returns in the hotel bar , minaya returned to his room that night under the impression that al gore had beaten bush i went to sleep thinking that one guy won , minaya recalled on monday , laughing , and i wake in the morning like , what \? what s going on \? ' williams said that irrespective of tuesday s election results , obama s rise in national regard had already changed his outlook on race in america that perspective was forged long before he spent most of this decade as baseball s only africanamerican general manager a native of san jose , calif , williams , 44 , said that his mother was one of the very few female black executives at pacific gas electric in the late 1960s and early 1970s before that , he said , his father had to file suit to become one of the first black firefighters in san jose kenny williams s godfather is john carlos , the united states olympian , who , along with tommie smith , caused great controversy at the 1968 mexico city games by raising a closed fist as a gesture of black solidarity in their medal ceremony regardless of what happens tonight , it s heartwarming to me that people in places like the south have clearly embraced new ideas guys on tractors down there are saying they voted for barack obama , williams said just his becoming the democratic nominee , the ability to tell my children and my grandchildren you can be anything you want and really mean it is very special i did n't think i would see it in my lifetime when he saw fox news declare that obama would carry pennsylvania , williams reasserted that he was taking nothing for granted i feel like this is onerun lead in the second inning williams said he first met obama as an illinois state senator in about 2001 , at a barbecue hosted by a mutual friend , the chicago banker jim reynolds at the time , obama was probably less of a big deal than williams , a former white sox player who had just become the team s general manager i was n't introduced to him as , hey , this is a future potential president of the united states , ' williams recalled he was a guy who was impressive , out there helping people with obama living on the south side of chicago as a diehard white sox fan , he and williams began to meet increasingly often obama threw a ceremonial first pitch during the 2005 american league playoffs , when he told the chicago tribune , the white sox have been my team when they 've lost now i'm gloating obama could gloat even more when the white sox swept the houston astros in the world series , giving the team its first championship since 1917 when williams and the rest of the team was invited to the white house to meet president bush , williams said obama was one of the first people to greet them at the door with his white sox hat on it did n't take long for obama to bring up the primary topic he always has with williams he asked about pitching then , too , williams said it s always about pitching
jim grosfeld , the former chief executive of pulte homes , and a board member at blackrock , the investment firm , has become one of my regular correspondents along with a small handful of others , he has spent much of his time recently trying to come up with ideas to help homeowners avoid foreclosures , which remains the country s most pressing economic problem until the rate of foreclosures slows , the crisis simply will not come to an end \( though you would never know that from the government s appalling lack of urgency \) continued foreclosures hurt housing prices for everyone and that , in turn , will mean continued multibillion writedowns on wall street , further jeopardizing the financial system and the gnarliest problem when dealing with struggling homeowners are those who hold mortgages that are trapped in securitizations as i wrote in my column on saturday , because of the ironclad contracts that exist between the mortgage servicers and the bondholders , it is usually impossible to modify mortgages without violating the contract that is why servicers have done so little to help homeowners , despite the jawboning of congress and the administration and yet it is precisely the mortgages held in these toxic securities that are the most likely to default because that is where the majority of subprime and alta mortgages are held there are ideas floating around that would solve this problem one is dan alpert s freedom recovery plan , which i ve discussed many times in this blog and a few days ago , mr grosfeld sent me a plan that he has devised for dealing with the securitization problem he sent it in an email message , which i am reprinting here sheila bair , the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation , is right when she says that there are 3 , 000 , 000 homeowners in trouble she agrees that most have risky mortgages subprime arms , option arms and alta loans the fdic program uses reductions in monthly payments , not principal reductions , in order to make mortgages more affordable and thereby reduce mortgage foreclosures and stabilize house prices however the fdic program involves mortgagebymortgage qualification and will therefore take years to implement this is precisely the same flaw in all the loan modification programs announced in recent days by a number of banks loanbyloan modifications only after requalification procedures , which will take a long time to implement , and deny more affordable mortgages to millions of homeowners i ve thought about an alternative program this program can be easily and quickly implemented because there is no new qualifying or underwriting procedures , and no principal reductions it costs taxpayers very little , especially in the context of rescuing 3 , 000 , 000 homeowners it can be easily understood by congress or treasury it provides mortgage relief to homeowners by reducing monthly payments it increases the value of bonds and whole loans held by investors and it provides affordable mortgages to homeowners whose mortgages are trapped within securitizations without violating contractual obligations to bondholders congress or tarp should provide this entire class of 3 , 000 , 000 distressed homeowners with risky loans subprime arms , option arms and alta loans a fiveyear interest rate subsidy , which homeowners will experience as five years of reduced monthly payments this program can be implemented simply and quickly all that happens is that a servicer receives a monthly payment subsidy from tarp or congress that subsidy is used to reduce a homeowner s monthly payment the homeowner continues to pay but at an amount reduced by the subsidy for example , if the original monthly payment is at a 7 percent yearly interest rate , and the subsidy is at a 2 percent rate , then a homeowner pays 5 percent and congress or tarp pays 2 percent this program can be swiftly implemented because existing mortgages are not modified , just subsidized there is no need to qualify homeowners to receive these subsidies and no need to reduce the principal amount of mortgages other than to eliminate any negative amortization accumulated in option arms so that homeowners only pay interest on the original mortgage amount the program only works if it is implemented on a mass basis to promptly reduce monthly payments for homeowners burdened by these risky loans it will not provide broad mortgage relief if homeowners have to qualify for these subsidies , or if new appraisals are required , or there are reductions in the outstanding principal amount of mortgages those conditions requirement mortgage by mortgage treatment which entails endless work and delay the subsidy is inexpensive , especially in the context of helping millions of homeowners the subsidy amount can vary but it must be enough to substantially lower monthly payments in order to reduce foreclosures let s assume that taxpayers provide a 2 percent interest rate subsidy for all 3 , 000 , 000 homeowners with these highly risky mortgages , and that the average outstanding principal amount of these mortgages is 150 , 000 the annual cost to taxpayers is only 9 billion 450 billion of mortgages x 2 percent each the maximum cost over five years would be 45 billion assuming the worst , namely , that all mortgages stay outstanding for 5 years that is unrealistic since there will be homeowners who move or refinance their loans the cost can be reduced further if the subsidy is reduced in the latter years , such as lowering the subsidy to 1 percent in years fourfive again many of these homeowners will refinance their mortgages over time as property values rise the idea is simple to understand a 2 percent subsidy for a fiveyear period to help up to 3 , 000 , 000 homeowners at a minimal cost to taxpayers of 9 billion per year the subsidy helps to keep these distressed homeowners in their homes , and thereby reduces foreclosures for example if an existing mortgage has a 7percent interest rate , a 2 percent subsidy reduces the monthly payment from approximately 875 to 625 a 29 percent reduction a subsidy of 3 percent reduces that payment from 875 to 500 and 43 percent reduction , and costs approximately 135 billion annually moreover , it increases the value of whole loans as well as bonds issued as part of securitizations whole loan and bond prices will go up immediately upon the introduction of this program and they will rise quickly and substantially , thereby creating , for the first time , liquidity for a market that has had none why all these benefits \? because better mortgages produce fewer foreclosures and lower pool losses that increases the value and the prices of whole loans and bonds accordingly this program is a winwin for both homeowners and investors simply put , there is no risk , inexpensive and powerful leverage from reducing interest rates this program provides relief to all homeowners who are burdened with these risky mortgages it helps those whose mortgages trade as whole loans it helps homeowners whose mortgages are collateral for mortgage backed securities , and therefore are trapped within securitizations the latter are the loans congress and regulators have been complaining about , but unable to modify due to existing contracts for the benefit solely of bondholders and to the detriment of homeowners mortgage subsidies offer an inexpensive method of providing affordable mortgage financing to homeowners whose mortgages are otherwise trapped within securitizations and it does this without modifying mortgages and without violating contractual obligations to bondholders mortgage servicers as a group would obtain these subsidies for homeowners , and they would not be violating any contractual terms by doing so bondholders would receive exactly the same interest rates that they would receive in the absence of these subsidies the only difference is a benefit to bondholders , namely , that they own more valuable mortgages homeowners who pay lower monthly payments will be less likely to default bondholders should welcome these subsidies to summarize , we need to give lower monthly payments , at least for an extended period , to distressed homeowners burdened by the most risky and unaffordable mortgages ever issued , and which were issued by reason of an admitted and catastrophic regulatory failure and we need to give this relief on a broad scale and quickly if we are to avoid further declines in home values , lower consumer spending , and a very deep recession , or worse it s inconceivable that congress and financial experts all agree that declines in home prices are at the core of our financial calamity , and yet nothing of substance on a mass scale has been done to help homeowners as a nation , we can do better

managua , somebody raped and strangled doris jim nez in her tiny clothing boutique 14 months ago ever since , nicaragua s justice system has found itself on trial the case has become both an international dispute and a political spectacle and it has proved not who killed ms jim nez , but that justice here is a nebulous concept , subjective to the point of abstraction nicaragua s president has weighed in on the jim nez case , as has the united states state department nicaragua s supreme court has become enmeshed in it and a judge who ruled on it is watching his back out of fear that he might be killed , too last february , a nicaraguan judge convicted eric volz , an american who is now 28 , of killing ms jim nez , 25 , a nicaraguan whom he had dated on and off mr volz , a native of nashville , who sold real estate and ran a magazine in managua , the capital , insisted he had a solid alibi and bore no grudge against her but after a threeday trial , the judge , ivette toru o , said she was convinced that he and another man were guilty whether mr volz really was the culprit , however , has never been clear he presented evidence that he was in managua on nov 21 , 2006 , when someone entered ms jim nez s boutique near rivas , about 55 miles to the south , and strangled her friends and acquaintances backed up his account so did cellphone records that traced his phone to the capital around the time ms jim nez was believed to have been killed and computer records that showed he was communicating by instant message around that time none of that swayed the judge , or the community although no physical evidence tied mr volz to the crime , one witness did , a local surfer , nelson l pez mr l pez was initially arrested in the case but was later granted immunity for his testimony , pointing his finger at the american and the local population clearly viewed mr volz as the killer when he was being transferred to the courthouse in rivas during the trial , the police had to keep back angry residents who appeared ready to attack him mr volz received a 30year sentence and began serving it while his lawyer challenged the conviction from his cell , mr volz told whomever would listen that the courts had the wrong man back in the united states , his family and friends started a campaign to win his release , selling free eric volz tshirts , bracelets and bumper stickers for a legal defense fund and setting up a web site \( \) to spread word of what they called an unjust conviction then , on dec 17 , an appeals court in granada , a city southeast of managua , ruled that mr volz and his supporters were right two members of a threejudge panel decided that he was probably not the killer and that local passions probably had prompted the conviction they ordered him released the third judge , norman miranda , a member of the ruling sandinista party , found deficiencies in the case that merited a retrial but did not order mr volz freed all three judges agreed that the nicaraguan codefendant in the case , julio mart n chamorro , ought to remain in jail roberto rodr guez , the judge who wrote the decision in mr volz s favor , said in an interview late last month that he initially presumed mr volz to be guilty but after reviewing the record of the trial , he became convinced that the evidence indicated that the young american could not have been the killer , he said his ruling was not enough to get mr volz out of jail right away the trial judge , ms toru o , delayed releasing him for days , raising excuse after excuse another judge , mr miranda , temporarily lost mr volz s case file the state department called on nicaragua to follow its own laws and release him meanwhile , prosecutors appealed the release order and sought to keep mr volz behind bars but mr volz was somehow released and left the country , which shocked julio centeno , nicaragua s chief prosecutor how he got out , i do n't know , mr centeno said in an interview on dec 27 , four days after mr volz left rushed through the streets of managua under high security , mr volz entered the airport through a private entrance and hopped on a private plane government officials stamped his passport and ushered him out we 're not celebrating , mr volz said friday in a telephone interview they continue to persecute me mr rodr guez , the judge who ruled in mr volz s favor , said he knew that his ruling would be controversial but even he was surprised by the uproar that followed nicaraguans of all walks of life condemned the ruling , lashing out at mr rodr guez and his colleague alejandro estrada sequeira in many nicaraguans' eyes , a rich american had been freed through his clout , and a poor nicaraguan had been left behind to suffer this killer had the money to pay the judges , said sylvia s nchez , a friend of ms jim nez president daniel ortega , who regularly criticizes washington , weighed in , pointing out with scorn that the two judges who released the american convict had been appointed by parties who oppose his governing sandinistas mayra sirias , coordinator of nicaragua s network of women against violence , called mr volz s acquittal the product of a corrupt judicial system that let a killer and rapist go free mercedes alvarado , the victim s mother , told reporters that mr rodr guez ought to be arrested and serve the rest of mr volz s term others called for him to be thrown in the ocean many questioned his patriotism because he carries dual nicaraguan and united states citizenship i'm going to fight for my integrity , vowed mr rodr guez , who nonetheless said he was afraid because of all the threats against him i want to be very clear i could n't live with my conscience if i kept someone in prison for 30 years for something i do n't think he did this case unlike any other then attracted the attention of the nation s highest court ordering an investigation into the two judges who freed mr volz , two sandinista members of the supreme court said they intended to question everyone involved to find out whether any malfeasance had occurred mr volz , now in the united states but still lying low because he fears for his life , condemned the inquiry into the judges who freed him it s a continuation of the same injustice , he said mr volz contends that a prominent nicaraguan family with ties to the ruling party , whom he declined to name , is behind ms jim nez s killing he portrays all the legal wrangling since his departure as part of a coverup those who are certain that mr volz killed ms jim nez and those equally insistent that he did not agree on one thing the case has laid bare the deficiencies in nicaraguan justice decisions are believed to be bought and sold politics infiltrates judges' chambers confidence in the system is as low as it can be our justice system had a bad reputation before , said jaime morales , the country s vice president , and this case did n't help

republicans have gone into high dudgeon over senator barack obama s suggestion at a townhallstyle meeting this week in georgia that americans might profitably emulate the european dexterity with language \( many europeans speak more than one foreign language , while americans tend to know none , aucun , ningunos \) you know , it s embarrassing when europeans come over here , they all speak english , they speak french , they speak german and then we go over to europe and all we can say is 'merci beaucoup , ' mr obama said to laughter from the crowd mr obama , who does not speak french , has been known to speak some spanish and bahasa , the national language of indonesia he emphasized that immigrants here must learn english , but his opponents were quick to jump the weekly standard featured his comments in its obama snobbery watch \( is he embarrassed by immigrants to the united states who ca n't speak english \? a blogger for the magazine asked \) and former mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york opined , i mean , the reality is that this is a country that should speak english mitt romney of massachusetts said this week on hannity colmes on the fox news channel , i do think that , frankly , barack obama looks toward europe for a lot of his inspiration mr romney , below , added , i think john mccain is going to make sure that america stays america but hold the nativism and pass the parlezvous mr romney also let sean hannity in on a secret i'm proud to say i can say a little bit more than 'merci beaucoup' and he understated it as the washington post reported in 2005 , mr romney met a french speaker in new hampshire and promptly broke into french , noting that he had lived in paris , which he said was foremidahb \( translation so cool \) during the republican primary season , mr romney and mr giuliani inveighed against cracks in the facade of english as the country s first language until they alighted in florida and ran spanishlanguage commercials michael powell photo
yes , it was a tough crowd but with his main republican rival now standing down , it was a relievedlooking senator john mccain who tried to assuage the fears of conservatives with a speech thursday to the conservative political action conference  he mentioned his opposition to abortion , and his support for the troop escalation in iraq , and his votes against banning assault weapons he cited edmund burke and ronald reagan he called for making the bush tax cuts he once opposed permanent but he did not paper over his differences over the years with conservatives , either we have had a few disagreements , and none of us will pretend that we won t continue to have a few , he said but even in disagreement , especially in disagreement , i will seek the counsel of my fellow conservatives if i am convinced my judgment is in error , i will correct it and if i stand by my position , even after benefit of your counsel , i hope you will not lose sight of the far more numerous occasions when we are in accord there were some boos when he mentioned immigration , the issue that put him at odds with so much of the conservative base , especially the talk radio hosts who have been skewering him of late but there were also cheers for a speech in which mr mccain tried to argue that he and the conservatives have more areas of agreement than disagreement , and noted that he attended his first cpac conference as a guest of ronald reagan he used humor to try to defuse some of the attention as with this oblique reference to his conspicuous absence from an earlier conservative confab you know , we should do this more often , he said i hope you ll pardon my absence last year , and understand that i intended no personal insult to any of you i was merely preoccupied with the business of trying to escape the distinction of preseason frontrunner for the republican nomination , which i m sure some of you observed i managed to do in fairly short order but now i again have the privilege of that distinction , and this time i would prefer to hold on to it for a little while he noted that he had spoken to mitt romney , who suspended his campaign earlier in the day and he asked for the conservatives to unite behind him in november i know i have a responsibility if i am , as i hope to be , the republican nominee for president , to unite the party and prepare for the great contest in november , he said i am acutely aware that i cannot succeed in that endeavor , nor can our party prevail over the challenge we will face from either senator clinton or senator obama , without the support of dedicated conservatives whose convictions , creativity and energy have been indispensable to the success of our party that it has had over the last quarter century
milwaukee the good folks in this sportsmad town will be confronted with quite a predicament at about noon local time on sunday what to watch on television green bay football or playoff baseball \? sundays in october here have long been dedicated to all things packers , but the rejuvenated will be competing for the region s attention after avoiding postseason elimination with a 41 victory over the in game 3 of their national league division series if the boisterous atmosphere inside a closedroofed miller park on saturday was any indication , another rabid capacity crowd will be back here for only the brewers' second home playoff game in 26 years like that 1982 team , this bunch is trying to rebound from a twogamestonone deficit to win its firstround series not that anyone remembered i think i was like 8 years old eating froot loops and watching the wonder twins' or something like that , said mike cameron , who reached base in four of five plate appearances and scored twice being oblivious to past and present has been sort of the brewers' mantra over the last three weeks this was , oh by the way , just another mustwin game for a team that has played one seemingly every day , bill hall said they trailed the mets in the wild card standings by two and a half games entering the final week , but won six of their final seven to sneak in they lost the first two in philadelphia , but their starting pitching and offense two previously deficient elements reappeared saturday night david bush stifled his favorite childhood team for five and a third innings , charged with only a sixthinning run he was backed by a lineup that had 11 hits four more than in the previous two games combined and worked several deep counts in knocking out philadelphia s starter , jamie moyer , after four innings and 90 pitches asked if he and his teammates have any gas left in their tanks , the closer salom n torres shrugged and said , i'm going to bp right now to fill it up for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow maybe cameron will join him after the team charter arrived at 1 30 am friday from philadelphia , cameron said he woke up three hours later to find 15 or 16 missed calls on his cellphone , most from his pregnant wife , labreka , but no voice mail uhoh , he thought he called back and learned that her water had broken so he found the next flight to atlanta , where his family lives , and landed just as his newborn daughter , lily christina , was born cameron s return flight was delayed , and he did not land in milwaukee until 1 15 pm nearly four hours before first pitch in a strange way , he said , being tired forced him to concentrate even more cameron played with moyer for four seasons in seattle and relished patrolling center field behind a pitcher who did not issue many walks it was , at least on the surface , not a favorable matchup for brewers manager dale sveum s band of freeswingers , and he said he was somewhat concerned that they would hack at moyer s specialty , the tantalizingly close pitches off the plate instead , moyer fell behind each of the six hitters he faced in a 34pitch first inning , walking cameron on four pitches and bill hall with a full count before opening his showdown with ryan braun with a wild pitch that advanced both runners into scoring position moyer nearly escaped by retiring braun and inducing a sacrifice fly from the dangerous \( if still hitless in 10 atbats \) prince fielder , but j j hardy lashed a single just beyond the reach of shortstop jimmy rollins to extend the brewers' lead to 20 and generate a nearly deafening din inside for me , it was probably the first night i 've ever really understood homefield advantage , hardy said like moyer , bush grew up in suburban philadelphia rooting for the phillies no need to question those allegiances now , naturally he is loyal to the team that , after a miserable april , banished him to the minor leagues he rebounded and , according to sveum , pitched the best of any brewer not named c c sabathia after the allstar break i do n't think i would have envisioned this , but as i said , keep doing what i know works for me , bush said that was to continue to mow down a phillies lineup that has scored in only three of 25 innings so far , and whose middle of the order chase utley , ryan howard and pat burrell have combined to go 4 for 28 bush allowed the leadoff man to reach four times , minimizing the damage until the sixth , when howard knocked in jayson werth with a groundout philadelphia loaded the bases with no outs in the ninth off torres and thought they scored on pedro feliz s doubleplay grounder but the umpires ruled runner s interference on shane victorino , who barreled into the second baseman craig counsell , and the run was taken off the board we 're supposed to hit and when we do n't , yeah , i'm concerned about it , phillies manager charlie manuel said but i do n't know what you can do right now tune in again sunday joe blanton will start for philadelphia , jeff suppan for milwaukee , trying to keep the channelsurfing at a minimum i'm sure they 'll be flipping back and forth , but this is a playoff game for us , hall said tomorrow s our day
florham park , nj the trailed , 63 , with 13 minutes 10 seconds left in the third quarter sunday the home crowd , sensing the perfect opportunity , rose to its feet and released a roar that put an entire stadium on vibrate mode every nfl game has its defining moment , and here it came at quarterback , against the new england patriots , who were playing without tom brady here the jets could reverse the fortunes of this onesided american football conference east rivalry here they could send a message to the team that one year earlier they caught cheating in their stadium and then everything fell apart there were too many selfinflicted wounds , coach eric mangini said he was speaking in general about the jets' 1910 loss to the patriots he could just as easily have been talking specifically about his team s first drive in the second half the jets took seven snaps during that possession they were whistled for three penalties two plays went backward it ended , awkwardly , with favre s first interception as a jet it s the disappointment of a missed opportunity , right guard brandon moore said we really did n't put it all together for all the money the jets spent last offseason on offensive improvements , for the additions of left guard alan faneca and right tackle damien woody and fullback tony richardson , and of course favre , a future hall of famer , this remains an offense in transition never was that more evident in the first two games than during the first drive of the third quarter it was a drive that started buoyed by the momentum of two sacks by the jets' defense on the patriots' first possession on first down , running back thomas jones ran right and backward , eventually stepping out of bounds 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage the loss was negated , though , after woody was called for holding yes , the jets managed to lose 10 yards twice on the same play at least only one loss counted the firstand20 that followed called for improvisation , the kind most have come to expect from the quarterback wearing no 4 and improvise favre did , avoiding the rush and firing left across the field to receiver chansi stuckey for a 10yard gain one problem favre was past the line of scrimmage when he threw the pass two plays , two penalties , and it got worse from there favre did complete a 28yard gain to stuckey on another play that broke down before he rescued it but on the next play , favre lofted a deep pass down the right sideline for receiver jerricho cotchery , who tangled with defensive back deltha o'neal and still managed to come down with the ball another play , another yellow flag , this time for offensive pass interference the jets disagreed with the call on monday , but stopped short of blaming the officials a heck of a throw and a heck of a catch , mangini said of the reception that was not , to which cotchery added , it s just one of those calls you have to live with , man despite the 28yard reception by stuckey , the penalties left the jets only 6 yards farther upfield than where they started favre s next pass , to tight end bubba franks , lost 5 yards favre s pass after that , intended for franks again , was a forced offering intercepted by safety brandon meriweather on the sideline , mangini could only shake his head center nick mangold said we let things get away those little mistakes and the penalties really hurt us the drive had a little bit of everything that can be expected of the jets' new offense as it transitions favre , football s king of improv , made good on a 28yard pass play , nearly made good on the ball he threw over the line of scrimmage and made an errant throw that turned into an interception the jets knew what they were getting there they also know it will take time to mesh three new starters , while running backs like jones and leon washington and receivers like cotchery and laveranues coles adjust to new roles in the new offense how quickly they improve will determine the early course of this young season the opportunity was there , moore said extra points eric mangini again defended the jets' decision to run three times from the patriots' 3 none of the plays produced a touchdown we 're not calling plays in a vacuum , mangini said on the status of kicker mike nugent , who missed sunday s game with a thigh injury , mangini said he was not sure of the 31yard miss by nugent s replacement , jay feely , mangini said , those are kicks we should make mangini left open the possibility the team would be looking for another punter after ben graham struggled sunday linebacker bryan thomas notched his third sack of the season against the patriots , more than he had last season \( two and a half \) the jets started 11 in 2006 , the year mangini led them to the playoffs
paris when youssoupha , a black rapper here , was asked the other day what was on his mind , a grin spread across his face barack obama , he said obama tells us everything is possible a new black consciousness is emerging in france , lately hastened by , of all things , the presumptive democratic nominee for president of the united states an article in le monde a few days ago described how mr obama is stirring up high hopes among blacks here even seeing the word noir \( black \) in a french newspaper was an occasion for surprise until recently meanwhile , this past weekend , 60 cars were burned and some 50 young people scuffled with police and firemen , injuring several of them , in a poor minority suburb of vitrylefran ois , in the marne region of northeast france americans , who have debated race relations since the dawn of the republic , may find it hard to grasp the degree to which race , like religion , remains a taboo topic in france while mr obama talks about running a campaign transcending race , an increasing number of french blacks are pushing for , in effect , the reverse having always thought it was more racially enlightened than strifetorn america , france finds itself facing the prospect that it has actually fallen behind on that score incidents like the ones over the weekend bring to mind the rioting that exploded across france three years ago since it abolished slavery 160 years ago , the country has officially declared itself to be colorblind but seeing mr obama , a new generation of french blacks is arguing that it s high time here for precisely the sort of frank discussions that in america have preceded the nomination of a major black candidate this black consciousness is reflected not just in daily conversation , but also in a dawning culture of books and music by young french blacks like youssoupha , a cheerful , toothy 28yearold , who was sent here from congo by his parents to get an education at 10 , raised by an aunt who worked in a school cafeteria in a poor suburb , and told by guidance counselors that he should n't be too ambitious instead , he earned a master s degree from the sorbonne then , like many welleducated blacks in this country , he hit a brick wall i found myself working in fastfood places with people who had the equivalent of a 15yearold s level of education , he recalled so he turned to rap , out of frustration as much as anything , finding inspiration in n gritude , an ideology of black pride conceived in paris during the 1920s and 30s by aim c saire , the french poet and politician from martinique , and l opold s dar senghor , the poet who became senegal s first president its philosophy , as sartre once put it , was a kind of antiracist racism , a celebration of shared black heritage n gritude and c saire are back when c saire died in april , at 94 , his funeral in fortdefrance , martinique , was broadcast live on french television the french president , , and his rival s gol ne royal both attended just three years ago , mr sarkozy , as head of a centerright party and not yet president , supported a law \( repealed after much protest \) that compelled french schools to teach the positive aspects of colonialism the next year , c saire refused to meet with him now here was mr sarkozy flying to the former french colony \( today one of the country s overseas departments , meaning he could troll for votes \) to pay tribute to the poet laureate of n gritude that said , as a country france definitely sends out mixed messages n gritude is a concept they just do n't want to hear about , youssoupha raps in render unto c saire on his latest album , chaque fr re \( to each brother \) a regular short feature on french public television , citoyens visibles , hosted by a young actress , hafsia herzi , celebrates french artists with foreign origins at the same time , it s against the rules for the government to conduct official surveys according to race consequently , nobody even knows for certain how many black citizens there are estimates vary between 3 million and 5 million out of a population of more than 61 million can you imagine if french officials said , well , we 're not sure , the population of france may be 65 million , or maybe it s 30 million' \? declared a somewhat exasperated patrick loz s , founder of cran , a black organization devised not long ago partly to gather statistics the government wo n't when he sat down to talk the other morning , the first two words out of his mouth were barack obama the idea behind not categorizing people by race is obviously good we want to believe in the republican ideal , he said but in reality we 're blind in france , not colorblind but information blind , and just saying people are equal does n't make them equal he ticked off some obvious numbers one black member representing continental france in the national assembly among 555 members no continental french senators out of some 300 only a handful of mayors out of some 36 , 000 , and none from the poor paris suburbs to this may be added cran s findings that the percentage of blacks in france who hold university degrees is 55 , compared with 37 percent for the general population but the number of blacks who get stuck in the working class is 45 percent , compared with 34 percent for the national average there s total hypocrisy here , l onora miano said she s a black author , 37 , originally from cameroon , whose recent novel tels des astres teints \( like extinguished stars \) is about race relations as seen through the eyes of three black immigrants for me it was really strange when i arrived 17 years ago to find people here never used the word race , ms miano said over coffee one afternoon at caf beaubourg outside , african immigrants hawked sunglasses to tourists french universalism , the whole french republican ideal , proposes that if you embrace french values , the french language , french culture , then race does n't exist and it wo n't matter if you 're black but of course it does so we need to have a conversation , and slowly it is coming not a conversation about guilt or history , but about now the black condition an essay on a french minority by pap n 'diaye , a 42yearold historian at the school for advanced study of the social sciences , is another muchtalkedabout new book here we are witnessing a renaissance of the n gritude movement , mr n 'diaye declared the other day the surge in popularity of mr obama among french blacks partly stems from the hope that his rise will highlight our lack of diversity and put pressure on french politicians who say they favor him to open politics up more to minorities , mr n 'diaye said we in france are , in terms of race , where we were in terms of gender 40 years ago he laid out some history french decolonization during the 1960s pretty much pushed the original n gritude movement to the back burner , at the same time that it inspired a wave of immigrants from the caribbean to come here and fill lowranking civil service jobs from subsaharan africa , another wave of laborers gravitated to private industry the two populations did n't communicate much but their children , raised here , have grown up together mutually discovered discrimination , as mr n 'diaye put it , has forged a bond out of which n gritude is being revived the watershed event was the rioting in poor french suburbs three years ago among its cultural consequences aim c saire started to be rediscovered by young people who found in his work things germane to the current situation , mr n 'diaye said youssoupha is one of those people he was nursing a coke recently at top kaf , a lubavitch texmex restaurant in cr teil , just outside paris , where he lives nearby , two waiters in yarmulkes sat watching play tennis on television beneath dusty framed pictures of las vegas and rabbi menachem m schneerson a clutch of arab teenagers smoked outside in modest neighborhoods like this , france can look remarkably harmonious c saire is in my lyrics , and i was upset when people misinterpreted what i wrote as antiwhite because n gritude is the affirmation of our common black roots , youssoupha said ms miano , the novelist , made a similar point there is no such thing as a black community' in france yet partly because we have such different histories , she said an immigrant woman from mali and another from cameroon view the world in completely different ways you also should n't think there is n't racism among blacks in france , between west indians and africans there is but ultimately we 're all black in the face of discrimination then she smiled too bad i forgot to wear my obama tshirt
omori , japan home to a silver mine whose production peaked nearly four centuries ago and finally closed in 1923 , this tiny rural town in western japan once seemed doomed to suffer the fate of so many former boomtowns perhaps one day , after the last of the diehards had moved away and the town s abandoned wooden houses had been ground to dust , the surrounding thick forests would have simply swallowed up omori but after intense lobbying by japan , the iwami silver mine here , which many japanese had never heard of , was improbably named a unesco world heritage site last year having joined the ranks of the pyramids , the taj mahal and angkor wat , omori population 413 has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of tourists on some days , the mostly elderly residents , used to leaving their doors unlocked and stepping outside in their pajamas , have been unable to cross the town s one long , narrow street , so dense are the crowds of tourists one 90yearold man even woke up one day to find three tourists relaxing on a sofa inside his house the world heritage designation has been a godsend for omori s home prefecture of shimane , which , like most other economically depressed areas in rural japan , has been trying to raise revenue through tourism not surprisingly , some regional governments are now pushing 40 of their own world heritage contenders , which include mount fuji but also sites of varying degrees of obscurity still , the designation of this relatively unknown site has raised eyebrows , not least among locals and visitors it is also likely to deepen the larger debate over whether the world heritage label is being diluted through an ever growing list of locations now standing at 878 worldwide and whether inclusion can do more harm than good in singling out a place unprepared for the inevitable influx of tourism on a recent sweltering day , junichi shiba , a 62yearold salaryman from tokyo , and his wife were among the hundreds of tourists who walked up the lone street and hiked to the site s main attraction a 518footlong mine shaft mr shiba said they came here even though they had never heard of the iwami silver mine until its world heritage designation and even though a friend , who had visited , told them not to bother but a world heritage site was a world heritage site , after all so we decided to come , mr shiba said shortly after coming out of the shaft , complaining that there was little to see here compared with other world heritage sites he had visited in japan and thailand our friend was right like other tourists , mr shiba did not see the extensive network of mine shafts and pits , smelting and refining facilities , and the remains of settlements and fortresses , since most of the area has been blanketed by forests in its heyday , the mine is said to have employed thousands of workers , produced up to two tons of silver a year and accounted for nearly 7 percent of the world s production of silver though japan was closed to the world back then , much of the silver is said to have been smuggled out to asia from three nearby ports but by the early 1970s , decades after the last ore of silver was extracted , omori had emptied out so rapidly that it was featured as a quintessential ghost town in japanese magazines in 1971 , the silver mine drew 15 , 000 tourists , mostly curious locals \( by comparison , in the 12 months after its world heritage designation in june 2007 , 925 , 800 tourists came here \) some locals began thinking of ways to rescue omori , especially toshiro nakamura , who founded a prostheses company called nakamura brace here in 1974 and eventually built it into a multimillion dollar business my father used to say that though this was a worldfamous silver mine , there was barely anybody left , and that it would keep declining and become a ghost town , said mr nakamura , 60 , whose family goes back generations here but then my father would wonder , even though everyone was leaving , whether one person would rise up and cherish and take care of his hometown mr nakamura made that his life s mission , establishing his business here and continuing to live to this day in his family s modest house over the years mr nakamura personally spent more than 9 million to refurbish some 30 old houses and to establish a small museum filled with maps , ingots and other artifacts from the mine s glory days if mr nakamura became the biggest champion of the iwami silver mine as a world heritage site , his goals dovetailed with those of the prefecture , which had close ties to japanese diplomats entrusted with making the case for iwami at unesco s world heritage committee not everyone here , though , was in favor omori , after all , had almost no tourism infrastructure just one familyrun inn with eight rooms places like lijiang , china , and even the historic villages of shirakawa , in japan , had suffered from the rapid development and other effects resulting from world heritage status also , others were not sure that the iwami silver mine was , well , of world heritage caliber other sites , like the pyramids or china s terracotta warriors , are old and impressive , and take away your breath at first sight , said daikichi matsuba , 55 , owner of a company making handmade clothes and crafts the iwami silver mine is a little hard to understand mr matsuba , who had led the opposition to the designation , was now focusing on limiting the damage from mass tourism by lobbying to restrict the number of fumespewing large tourist buses and making sure that new businesses' storefront signs adhered to local regulations early last year , it appeared as if the opponents would win a world heritage site candidate in the cultural category has to meet at least one out of six criteria to be listed , and an advisory group investigated and found that iwami met none in a lengthy report , the group said that japan had not offered evidence that iwami was an exceptional case that had influenced the development of mining outside japan and concluded that iwami was not of outstanding universal value but japan pressed ahead with the application , which , after strong backing from allies , particularly from africa , was approved by the world heritage committee in june of last year if tourism has benefited the prefecture , the benefits have yet to trickle down to omori , according to small business owners here most tourists came aboard buses and left after visiting the mine shaft , locals said they go quickly up to the mine shaft , take a look , then get back on their buses , said minoru umehara , 71 when i ask them what they saw , they say , 'we just saw a hole , ' mr umehara said , laughing then there was suetaro ishiga , the 90yearold omori native who found the three tourists sitting on his sofa to tell you the truth , this used to be a good , quiet town , mr ishiga said , answering a knock on his door and stepping outside in the pajamalike long underpants that most locals wore only indoors since the world heritage designation i ca n't say i'm happy , he said but for the sake of my ancestors , i have to believe it was a good thing photos tourists headed into the iwami silver mine in omori , japan in 1971 , the mine drew 15 , 000 tourists in the 12 months after its world heritage designation in june 2007 , 925 , 800

dublin on tuesday evening , here on a grassy terrace behind the old royal hospital kilmainham , with the sun still high in the sky and his heart full of joy , brian o 'doherty attended his own wake after 36 years he put to rest his alter ego , patrick ireland sometimes culture and politics intersect in subtle , serendipitous ways in 1972 mr o 'doherty , an irishborn artist who has lived in new york since the early '60s , wanted to do something to protest the events of bloody sunday that year on jan 30 when british soldiers killed 14 unarmed irish civilians in londonderry , northern ireland he decided to stage a small ceremony here , a kind of performance , before 30 witnesses , at which he swore to sign all his artworks patrick ireland until the british military presence is removed and all citizens granted their civil rights it was a token gesture , and not many people noticed , but it was heartfelt i felt a great sense of impotence , he said on tuesday morning , sitting with his wife , barbara novak , an american art historian , over a full irish breakfast the name at least became a reminder every work i did after that gained a political context for me and for anyone who may have wondered who patrick ireland was mr o 'doherty was born in 1928 into a family of doctors in county roscommon i was always searching for an identity , he recalled his family had a fractured sense of identity two uncles joined the british army , another uncle fought the british and helped capture a british general mr o 'doherty trained as a doctor , then after emigrating to the united states in 1957 , quit medicine and became an art critic , a television presenter , an arts administrator and an artist his artwork conceptualminded installations , drawings and language games , whose subtexts were frequently ireland and identity sometimes entailed aliases the work leaned heavily on marcel duchamp \( he once took an electrocardiogram of the elderly french artist , then exhibited it as a duchamp portrait \) he wrote books , too , under his real name the deposition of father mcgreevy , a 1999 novel , was shortlisted for the and involved another of his aliases , william maginn , who happened to be a reallife 19thcentury irish poet , who had used o 'doherty as an alias an essay from the '70s by mr o 'doherty , inside the white cube , became famous in art circles for describing how modern art interacted with the gallery spaces in which it was shown in retrospect , like everything else he did , the essay dealt with identity how people and the works of art they make , once decoded , show themselves inextricably entwined with their origins and locales meanwhile , the bloodshed in northern ireland continued the degree of antipathy and hatred was such that this seemed like one of those struggles with no end , mr o 'doherty said it s a miracle it s over and so , now satisfied that the peace had taken root , he held a funeral on tuesday to celebrate this time a few hundred friends , relatives and others turned up at the irish museum of modern art , in the former royal hospital , which was built during the 17th century to comfort soldiers it happens that at the national gallery of ireland , not far away , there is a painting on loan by joshua reynolds , a portrait of a young polynesian named omai , which an irish collector bought at auction in london some time ago the collector wanted to bring it to ireland , but the british objected it s here for the moment thanks to a temporary export license , a truce , a brokered peace in the same museum is a room of baroque paintings by rubens and others that were acquired under british rule during the 19th century , when the museum was allowed to collect pictures with roman catholic themes because the british considered them not worthy of london art , in other words , can speak to social conflicts , and not always how you might think yvonne scott , a professor here at trinity college , remarked before the wake that in 1972 the invention of patrick ireland was hard for people to grasp because for a long while conceptual art was n't understood here she added , times have changed for which reason mr o 'doherty , dressed all in white with a white stocking pulled over his head like the one he wore for the ceremony that brought patrick ireland into existence , trailed six pallbearers into a garden behind the museum , where a fresh grave awaited charles simonds , an artist , had cast a death mask from mr o 'doherty s face , an effigy that would be buried in a pine coffin has the passing of a life ever caused more joy \? michael rush , a former jesuit priest and an american museum director , began his eulogy several of mr o 'doherty s friends read poems one was by st phane mallarm \( and i die , and i love whether the glass be art or mysticism to be reborn , wearing my dream like a diadem \) next , the irish artist alannah o'kelly keened the day before , mr o 'doherty had told her he imagined a minute or two of keening she told me , oh , no , two minutes of keening wo n't do , ' he said so she keened for several glorious minutes , her amplified voice echoing across the garden , into the city finally , mr o 'doherty stepped forward , threw a handful of dirt on patrick ireland s coffin , tossed his stocking mask into the grave and said , simply thank you thank you for peace decades on , a small private act of protest had ended quietly five irish musicians seated on plush redandgold chairs beside the grave struck up a tune it s the completion of a vow , ms novak said afterward , redeyed mr o 'doherty had objected at breakfast when she suggested that his artistic cast of mind was distinctly irish he did n't want to be pigeonholed none of us wants to be put in a box , he said then the pine coffin came to mind except today , he said , laughing now , here he stood , a little disbelieving beside the grave , talking about the chance , literally , to bury hatred he shook his head you do n't always get to do that in life
the question about why lincoln is so fascinating is a dangerous one for me right now , since i m finding very little about him that isn t when i was a child , before i even knew who lincoln was , i remember being posed one of those brain teasers how many lincolns can be found on a penny \? one , obviously but no , look at the lincoln memorial on the tail side there between the central pillars can be glimpsed an outline of the imposing statue two it s a bit like this whenever i start to look more closely at lincoln there are the clear and obvious things , the things we all know or were once supposed to know he was the great emancipator , the savior of the union , a man of sterling character whose stature only grows as time passes but where , in the midst of that monument do we glimpse the human figure and how did the man turn into something more \? every nation has its myths about its founding figures and lincoln really must be considered a founding figure of the modern united states because of his redefinition of the essence of its union during the civil but in lincoln s case , the more we know about him , the more powerful his image becomes in four years , in the midst of trials we can only begin to imagine , he reforged not only the country , but himself he was a bit of a fanatic , i think , rigorous and ruthless in his demands or goals , but what prevented him from being a tyrant is his sure knowledge of people , his sure sense of their fallibility , his tolerance for their errors , and his acknowledgment that he too was flawed he let gen george b mcclellan indulge in military passivity far longer than he should have , he tolerated the cabinet machinations of his onetime political rival salmon p chase with far more restraint than many would have shown , and in the face of the tempestuous and irrational outbursts of his wife , he learned , according to many reports , to show a calm forbearance mixed with affection his gradual moves against slavery inflamed the abolitionists for their slowness , but he never let his ideals get too far ahead of his abilities or those of the people around him , and ended up succeeding and while no one but a determined fighter could have waged the civil war as he did , rejecting the growing sentiment that compromise should be pursued , the same vision also led him to call for malice toward none and charity for all as the end drew near who knows what might have been had he been alive to prevent the tragedies of reconstruction \? these are not just historical questions they are human ones inevitably studies about lincoln become studies about how he learned to be who he became so why am i fascinated \? because of the unusual nature of this selfmaking man because of the ways in which his personal character transformed the public realm because of the ways in which he combined compromise and idealism and because his legacy , in our own polarized times , is a way of thinking and acting that transcends the political categories into which we now order the world
fort lauderdale , fla \( ap \) before chris colwill strolls out toward the edge of the board , he cuts his eyes toward the referee they exchange subtle nods only then does colwill know he is cleared to dive he never hears the whistle colwill was born with a 60 percent hearing loss , but hold off on all those sympathetic oohs and ahhs he does not want them , does not need them he has lived 23 years refusing to be treated like someone with a disability , and just look where it has gotten him he recently graduated from the university of georgia with a degree in speech communications he is a top contender for a spot on the united states olympic team this summer it s not terrible , colwill said i do n't think of myself as someone who has hearing loss away from the pool , he wears a hearing aid in each ear and is an expert at reading lips , always making a point to look directly at anyone talking to him colwill cannot wear any devices when he is diving , which takes him into a whole new world atop the board , he might hear a hodgepodge of noises that sound far off , but for colwill it is largely silent he does not pick up the misbehaving child being hushed by his parents or the inappropriate ring of a cellphone or the cars whizzing by on a nearby road i would never say i wanted to lose my hearing , said jevon tarantino , a longtime friend and colwill s synchronized diving partner , but it lessens the distractions for him it s really an advantage for us he does n't have to hear everything going on around him colwill , a junior world champion at age 14 , had to overcome a bit of burnout in high school but he bounced back to win three ncaa titles at georgia \( in addition to being national runnerup five times \) , and was a member of the last two united states world championship teams since teaming with tarantino a year ago in the threemeter synchro , colwill has put himself in strong position to claim his first trip to the olympics our chances are good , colwill said we 've just got to keep working at it those around him have learned to make small concessions before every meet , colwill asks the referee to make sure he nods his head when it is clear to dive , instead of just blowing the whistle tarantino always gives his partner an extra glance , to make sure they are on the same page in an event that demands teamwork colwill s coach , georgia s dan laak , is able to multitask with most of his divers , giving pointers to one while watching another go off the board or platform not so with colwill , who must see what his coach is saying probably the biggest adjustment was to make sure we did have eye contact when i was coaching him , laak said sometimes , i have to put other divers in timeout situations they have to wait to dive because i ca n't watch them while i'm talking with chris but they adjusted to it otherwise , colwill is treated like anyone else just the way he likes it i never limited myself , colwill said , taking a break during a recent grand prix meet in fort lauderdale i never thought of myself as someone who needed extra help i just wanted to do it the right way , i guess when his parents got the devastating news about their only child s hearing loss , they naturally leaned toward enrolling him in school programs that would help him keep up with children who heard everything colwill wanted none of that i wanted to try classes with the regular hearing world , he said i did pretty well until i got to middle school then i started getting behind it was not because i could n't learn the materials , it was just the staff and teachers making it difficult for me to learn i guess by my junior year of high school , i started figuring things out i started making good grades again he stuck to that philosophy after signing with georgia , choosing to stick with the mainstream the university offers help to those with learning disabilities whether it be extra study time or assigning someone to take notes but colwill , as far any anyone knows , never took advantage of those programs it made him a much stronger person and , in some ways , a much stronger diver , laak said he has n't used that as a crutch he takes it for what it is , and just keeps plugging along laak has noticed a change in his star pupil s demeanor colwill arrived at georgia a bit shy , as many freshmen are , and reluctant to discuss his hearing impairment now , he s much more willing to talk about it , knowing his story might help others i think he s accepted the situation a lot more than he did before he came in , laak said he s a lot more open as a person , too i used to see him just sitting in the background now , he s definitely having a lot of fun he s one of the leaders rather than one of the followers colwill started out in gymnastics but was quickly enamored when he saw someone dive into a pool it took a year to persuade his mother to let him give it a try he was only 5 when he dived in for the first time she was worried about me , he said she did n't want to see me get hurt i was pretty rambunctious as a kid within four years , colwill had won the first of his eight junior national championships but his path toward becoming the next greg louganis hit a roadblock i 've had my ups and downs , colwill said i was really strong when i was a kid in my youth days , i was winning the junior worlds then i became a teenager and it went downhill from there what happened \? i just got a little burned out , he replied i started at a very young age i needed a little time to recuperate colwill got back on track in college he was the ncaa diver of the year in 2006 after winning ncaa titles on the one and threemeter boards he claimed the award again as a senior , taking another onemeter championship and finishing second on the threemeter and platform now , he is eyeing a trip to beijing for this summer s olympics the pairing with tarantino has given him a boost the duo finished a respectable sixth at the world cup , and laak said only one other team could match the quality of their dives they merely need to work on their consistency assuming he makes the team , laak said , i think he and jevon have an excellent chance of medaling in the synchro event the two are florida natives who have been friends since colwill was 7 , though they did not team up for synchro until a year ago we played around doing synchro when we were kids , but we never took it seriously , colwill said we have a really good relationship on and off the pool deck we both like to joke around a lot and have fun i think our attitude when we 're diving is to have fun , and that s why we 're doing pretty well and rest assured , if colwill does win a medal in beijing , he will be able to soak up the cheers just like any other diver , which is all he ever wanted to be it s pretty quiet until i do my dive , colwill said after i do my dive , especially when i do it well , i can hear the crowd it s not like it s completely quiet
nearly three years ago , the billionaire oilman donated 165 million to s athletic department so it could remake its facilities into a shangrila for cowboys sports , complete with an indoor practice center and new facilities for baseball , equestrian , soccer , tennis , and track and field pickens was so true to his school that he also allowed oklahoma state to take out a 10 million insurance policy on his life those funds , along with 37 million from other donors , were invested in bp capital management , a hedge fund controlled by pickens at the time , it looked like a windfall that would keep on giving instead , pickens recently acknowledged that his investments had lost 1 billion this year amid the financial crisis now , building on oklahoma state s athletic village has been held up , and the athletic director , mike holder , said the project would have to wait until pickens s financial situation improved holder and a spokesman for bp capital declined to disclose the current value of the university s investment in pickens s hedge fund oklahoma state is hardly alone in watching its soaring ambitions crash back to earth with the fortunes of some of its biggest benefactors when aubrey k mcclendon , the chief executive of chesapeake energy , recently announced that he had to sell some 32 million shares , or more than 5 percent of the company he founded , worth nearly 600 million , athletic officials at the university of oklahoma were rattled the bankruptcy proceedings of another energy company , semgroup , has brought unwanted attention to the university of kansas , where the company s ousted cofounder , tom kivisto , had pledged 12 million for a recently opened football complex like the chief executives on wall street , leaders of collegiate athletic programs must acknowledge that the boom days of fundraising have given way to belttightening adjustments have to take place and look bleak in the short term , said joe castiglione , oklahoma s athletic director in 20067 , for example , the nation s largest athletics departments and booster clubs raised more than 12 billion , according to a survey by the chronicle of higher education some programs have more than tripled their annual gifts over the past 10 years from 2002 to 2007 , colleges in the six bowl championship series conferences raised more than 39 billion through capital campaigns for new facilities , according to the survey last may , mcclendon and his wife , kathleen , pledged 7 million to build a boathouse on the oklahoma river for the women s rowing team and a housing facility near memorial stadium castiglione said he had spoken with mcclendon , but he declined to say whether mcclendon had given oklahoma the money or intended to through a spokesman , mcclendon declined to comment it makes us concerned for everybody , castiglione said it s something that we have to watch for everybody , because it s hitting people in ways they could have never predicted even the university of texas , which has the nation s topranked football team , is bracing for a downturn despite raising 35 million last year through annual giving , suites and premium seating it also has a 29 million athletic endowment deloss dodds , the university s longtime athletic director , recalled the perilous times that followed the 1987 stockmarket crash we worked with people , he said we absolutely worked with them on whatever commitments they were making or had been making when things go bad and things get tough , people have to do realistic things , and we help them do that it is perhaps never as bad in texas than it is in the rest of the country , because love for the longhorns runs deep and backing them conveys a tremendous status so dodds said he was in no hurry to call in the commitments currently on the books , and he had a pretty good idea of how the pennypinching would play out we 'll probably see it first in baseball , maybe , and then maybe in basketball , he said we 've lost a couple of suite holders in basketball , and i think the economy is part of the reason there i think people will hold on to their football stuff as long as they can beyond patience , the ensuing months and years will also require diplomacy from athletic fundraisers as they soothe the bruised egos of deeppocketed donors , many of them who are enduring public embarrassment not all of the nation s major boosters have the financial wherewithal or the lan of pickens , whose book , the first billion is the hardest , is a national best seller his spokesman , jay rosser , said pickens had so far given more than 700 million to a variety of causes in the past five years he looks forward to having a party to celebrate giving away 1 billion , rosser said unfortunately , the economic downturn has hit everyone hard , and boone has n't been immune the chance of a party this year is next to none hopefully , the markets will improve soon and boone can get back to the business of giving serious money boone likes making money , and he likes to give it away kivisto , a former basketball star for kansas , was removed as the chief executive of semgroup in july and put on leave last week , louis j freeh , the former fbi director , was appointed by a bankruptcy court to sort out how the company lost 24 billion on the new york mercantile exchange and to look into allegations that kivisto s personal trading company in the oil futures market incurred 290 million of the losses it is unclear , however , if kivisto has made good on the 12 million commitment to kansas athletics in 2006 , the athletic department acknowledged that kivisto had contributed 4 million and committed an additional 8 million to a new football complex it coincided with an announcement that the field inside memorial stadium would be renamed in his honor lew perkins , director of athletics at kansas , said it was his policy not to publicly discuss the specifics about donors or donations i will say that tom has been a friend of this university for a long time , he said he has done everything for us and beyond ultimately , however , it takes trust and toughness on the part of the benefactor and the athletic department to weather tight times in the case of oklahoma state and t boone pickens , a sense of humor helps sure you 're concerned about your investments , but i like the person we 're investing with , holder said i guess the good news is he had a billion dollars to lose
in a rematch of last season s american football conference championship game , the san diego chargers host the new england patriots but the game finds the two teams much different from last winter first of all , they have each lost to miami in recent weeks the chargers were a popular pick to reach the super bowl , but as they did last season , they have started slowly at 23 they have even lost the coin toss in all five games coming off its lowestscoring game since week 17 of the 2005 season , san diego has not received the usual production from running back ladainian tomlinson and tight end antonio gates , neither of whom are completely healthy the top receivers chris chambers and vincent jackson are also banged up but the chargers biggest problem is their defense , particularly a porous secondary ranked last in the nfl , allowing 2658 passing yards a game that is good news for matt cassel , playing in his native southern california for the first time as the patriots starter , and randy moss , who got involved in the offense again last week the chargers badly need to win , not only to stay in the afc west race but also to prove they can beat the patriots \( 31 \) , who have won their last four meetings after playing new england , san diego heads on as difficult a trip as there is , flying east to buffalo , where two west coast teams have already lost this season , then to london to play new orleans line chargers by 5 panthers \( 41 \) at buccaneers \( 32 \) buccaneers by 15 carolina has not received as much attention as the nfl s other top teams , and the next two weeks will be a test of its legitimacy as it faces its division rivals tampa bay and new orleans after playing musical quarterbacks last season , carolina has the steady jake delhomme back , and he is 71 against the buccaneers receiver muhsin muhammad has resurrected his career , and deangelo williams and jonathan stewart are a formidable rushing duo , though tampa bay s run defense is particularly tough at home but the panthers do it with defense they have not allowed a touchdown in nine quarters and held larry johnson to 2 rushing yards a week after he had gained 198 linebacker jon beason has been all over the field , and julius peppers already has more sacks \( three \) than he did last season the task of facing that defense will probably fall to quarterback jeff garcia instead of the injured brian griese watching film of the carolina defense was not fun for buccaneers coach jon gruden i had to turn the film off and go for a walk , he told reporters i got a little nervous , you know what i mean \? cowboys \( 41 \) at cardinals \( 32 \) cowboys by 5 the scoreboard operator could be quite busy in this game , which features the nfl s two highestscoring teams but dallas s offense has been disappointing recently tony romo s completion percentage is dropping and he has five interceptions under ken whisenhunt , the cardinals are 82 at home and averaging 293 points a game jaguars \( 23 \) at broncos \( 41 \) broncos by 35 when these teams met in denver last season , jacksonville neutralized denver s highflying offense by taking the ball and not letting go the jaguars rushed for 186 yards and dominated time of possession by more than 17 minutes that would be an effective strategy again , even though the jaguars are 19th in rushing after being second last year ravens \( 22 \) at colts \( 22 \) colts by 4 the colts defensive weakness plays to the ravens offensive strength the running of le ron mcclain and willis mcgahee but the potential hole in the ravens otherwise dominant defense is a bangedup secondary , which can be exploited by peyton manning indianapolis is still looking for its first victory at lukas oil stadium dolphins \( 22 \) at texans \( 04 \) texans by 3 miami was not expected to be this good houston was not expected to be this bad but certain things are expected matt schaub is expected to be back at quarterback for houston and the dolphins are expected to keep using the wildcat formation , which has been a showcase not only for ronnie brown , but also for the no 1 overall draft pick jake long eagles \( 23 \) at 49ers \( 23 \) eagles by 45 brian westbrook is out for philadelphia , but the eagles are motivated and frustrated , perhaps none more so than donovan mcnabb and the former cal star desean jackson facing a blitzhappy defense , jt o sullivan may want to wear some extra padding he has been sacked 20 times , and he has six turnovers in his last two games raiders \( 13 \) at saints \( 23 \) saints by 7 jamarcus russell returns to the state where he was loved during his days at louisiana state as tom cable makes his debut as oakland s coach new orleans is coming off a sloppy loss on monday night and is in last place in the surprisingly competitive nfc south the saints are 27 against afc teams since the start of the 2006 season bears \( 32 \) at falcons \( 32 \) bears by 3 a tale of two running games chicago s matt forte has rushed for only 79 yards the past two weeks , and atlanta s michael turner could struggle against chicago s no 4 run defense rams \( 04 \) at redskins \( 41 \) redskins by 135 st louis , in its first game under the new coach jim haslett , could really use a pickmeup , but playing against one of the nfl s hottest teams is not the easiest way to get one lions \( 05 \) at vikings \( 23 \) vikings by 13 detroit has not won at the metrodome since 1997 with jon kitna injured and adrian peterson facing the 30thranked run defense , the lions are unlikely to stop that losing streak packers \( 23 \) at seahawks \( 13 \) seahawks by 2 these teams have been plagued by injuries seattle on offense and green bay on defense the seahawks may have to start their thirdstring quarterback , charlie frye bengals \( 05 \) at jets \( 22 \) jets by 75 ryan fitzpatrick replaces the injured and outofsync carson palmer fitzpatrick started sept 28 against cleveland , throwing three interceptions but leading the team in rushing giants \( 40 \) at browns \( 13 \) giants by 75 cleveland is playing on monday night for the first time in almost five years , but the browns , especially the struggling derek anderson , may wish there were not so many people watching
how do you think of your self as a conservative do you think of yourself more as a goldwater conservative or reagan conservative or george w bush conservative a teddy roosevelt conservative , i think he s probably my major role model , we could go back to lincoln , of course in the 20th century teddy roosevelt i think teddy roosevelt he had a great vision of america s role in the 20th century he was a great environmentalist he loved the country he is the person who brought the government into a more modern into the 20th century as well he was probably engaged more in national security slash international affairs that any president ever been i understand that tr had failings i understand that every one of my role models had failings tr became embittered at the end , we all know that if you look at his presidency , if you looked at his reformist agenda from the time he was the police commissioner in new york city would you consider roosevelt a conservative \? did n't the modern conservative movement began with senator goldwater \? i think there s always been tensions within the republican party david halberstam s book was the coldest winter really gives a good demonstration of the tensions within the republican party long before goldwater i think what goldwater was able to do is he kind of wrenched the control of the party out of the hands of the quote eastern establishment of the party and sort of moved it into a longterm more populist kind of and more well ronald reagan was able to turn it into a majority , even though barry turned it into one of the major landslide defeats in american history now those barry goldwater followers like me would say it was because the tragedy of dallas but still , you know i think there s always been tensions within the republican party there s a more isolationist wing , a more protectionist wing , there s been the more internationalist  roosevelt was n't really a small government person he saw an active role for government what thing in your record in your record would you say are in a similar vein of using government to do things that campaign finance reform obviously he was a great reformer is one of them climate change is another he was a great environmentalist you do n't believe in small government , the sort of classic conservative view of minimal government is not one you would necessarily share i guess my view is i believe less governance is best governance and that government should not do what the free enterprise and private enterprise and indidividual entrepreneurship and the states can do but i also believe there is a role for government if there is abuses , tr was the first guy to enforce the sherman antitrust act against the quote trusts that were controlling the economy of america because i believe his quote was unfettered capitalism leads to corruption so there certainly is a role for government but i want to keep that role minimal and i want to keep it in the areas where only governments can perform those functions government should take care of those in america who ca n't care for themselves that s a role of government it s not that i'm for no government it s that i'm for government carrying out those responsibilities that otherwise ca n't be exercised by individuals and the states that s the founding principles of our country and at the same time recognizing there s a role for our government and society to care for those who ca n't care for themselves , to make sure there are not abuses of individual rights as well as the rights of groups of people and to defend our nation and national security is obviously no 1 so i count myself as a conservative republican , yet i view it to a large degree in the theodore roosevelt mold now there are some people who are republicans who think that tr overreached there certainly were in his time , that s why they kept telling him to run for other offices still i think that history judges him extremely well because of his view that there is a role of government but it should be limited as much as possible what is your view of the health of the conservative movement today \? my view of the republican party today and the conservative movement , whether you are talking about social or economic or other movement i think have been very disappointed they 've been disappointed by the outofofcontrol spending and it has dispirited them and the tipping pint in our republican , fiscally conservative base was the bridge to nowhere in football games there s the fumble or the field goal in political campaigns it is the event , in the process of passing legislation or failing in everything in life there is kind of an event you can point to and say see , that was it the bridge to nowhere the bridge to nowhere we let government grow by some 60 percent over the last seven years we let spending get completely out of control and our base said , enough so our republican base we have to give them the confidence that we will carry on in the traditions of our party ideologically , do you think the conservative movement know where it should be going i think we are in agreement on most basic issues i do n't think the problem , the debate within the republican party is about our principles i think the debate within the republican party is how can we best enact those principles into government and policies in other words , we can say we are for restrained spending but if we vote for an appropriations bill with 9000 porkbarrel projects on it , we 're not doing what we said i do n't think the republican party s problems is with its principles i think the republican party is its adherences to its principles and beliefs do you consider yourself an evangelical christian \? i consider myself a christian i attend church , my faith has sustained me in very difficult times but i think it depends on what you call a quote evangelical christian because there are some people who may not share my views on i mean , that covers a lot of ground but i certainly consider myself a christian how often do you go to church \? um , not as often as i should when cindy and i are in phoenix , we attend we 've been fortunate enough the last few weeks to be in phoenix during the primary before that we were not back in phoenix much so again , not as frequently as i would like i do appreciate the pastor of the north phoenix baptist church , his name is dan neary \( sp \) , and i talk to him frequently on the phone and i appreciate his spiritual guidance he s a great believer in redemption president bush believes that gay couples should not be permitted to adopt children do you agree with that \? i think that we 've proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so , no i do n't believe in gay adoption even if the alternative is the kid staying in an orphanage , or not having parents i encourage adoption and i encourage the opportunities for people to adopt children i encourage the process being less complicated so they can adopt as quickly as possible and cindy and i are proud of being adoptive parents but your concern would be that the couple should a traditional couple yes do you think religious organizations that get federal funding to deliver social services faith based organizations should be permitted to take faith into account in deciding who to hire you saw obama s proposal i support faithbased organizations and i support a lot of the things that the president did i was in new orleans after katrina and i went to their resurrection baptist church and i saw volunteers from all over america working and helping in the cleanup , and the work that they did and talking with people like governor jindal , he said they did great work i would continue along the model of what the president has done and i certainly applaud senator obama s , what i heard of his position basically the same i think the one difference is whether or not as a condition of getting these monies , that these organization say they will not take into account religion or other factors in hiring decisions obviously it s very complicated because if this is an organization that says we want people in our organization that are baptists or vegetarians or whatever it is , they should not be required to hire someone that they do n't want to hire in my view listen , this is the kind of the issue that goes on with the boy scouts , it goes on with a number of other issues i think the president s faithbased organization has been successful and i support what he has done i guess the way opponents describe it means that these groups are allowed to discriminate in hiring i can only answer it to say that i think faithbased organizations have been one of the more successful parts of the bush administration and i would continue it when do you think the united states has an obligation to intervene to prevent genocides when it goes on and we can find an effective way to stop it or even , if we can , if have the prescience we can try to stop it before it happens that s not very easy , obviously we have to have effective ways of addressing genocide i know what you are leading to and that is darfur , where colin powell , a man who i admire as much as any man in the world , person in the world , declared genocide in darfur several years ago i think our challenge has been and i think from my conversations with secretary powell that this is accurate , that because of the complexities of the situations and the inabilities to identify exactly what courses of action need to be taken , coupled with the other problems either the inability or unwillingness of other african states to be as involved as we 'd like them to be in this very complex situation but i think we should not give up our efforts to stop the genocides that is going on in darfur and i would exercise every possibility and consult with whoever it is and try to address the issue of genocide finally , let me add one other aspect to this you 've got to have the support of the american people in whatever you do as well i think americans would support action i know americans would support action but it would have to be explained to them and tell them exactly how we 're going to succeed in stopping genocide and that is a plague not only the united states but our european friends allies and the world how do you effectively address the situation in darfur part of your view of government would be that if it sees an ongoing genocidal situation and believes there is a way to end it and it has the support of the american people , you believe it is part of our obligation to do something about it if you can address it effectively in other words , the unfortunate the downside could be that you send in a force , they do n't succeed in stopping the genocide , americans than say look , it s not working get out , than the ultimate situation is worse than if went in that is what i have concern about in the scenario look , republican , democrats , liberal , conservatives have all announced unequivocally that we will never allow a second holocaust that has been a public statement of every president since harry truman was it a good idea for the federal government to intervene in bear stearns \? i think we had to american is in extremely difficult economic times i agree with literally every expert on the economy if bear stearns had collapsed it would have had a ripple effect in the market and that s why this latest mortgage crisis with freddie mac and fannie mae , are , excuse me , with the home loan mortgage people , is that we worry of the ripple effect of their collapse and so , we 're going to have to contemplate what needs to be done now , we have a worsening economy and i agree with paulson , i agree with literally every economist in america that said that bear stearns , if they had collapsed , would have had a ripple effect , would have been very harmful to the american economy do you think the government is ultimately on the hook for fannie and freddie \? if the worstcase scenario materializes i do n't think the question is so much , is it on the hook , as much as it is , could we afford to have a collapse and i keep being asked about a quote , government bailout i do n't know if a government , quote , bailout is necessary now because there are other courses of action that are being explored in order to ensure their survival but i do n't believe we can afford to have them fail because of their impact on the overall economy , and the housing situation which we already know is in dire straits , and i 've head that there is various options i also note with sorrow that their stock continues to go down , and the situation becomes more and more severe so whether the government is legally responsible is not so important because ultimately the nation ca n't afford to let it collapse \? yeah i'm not so sure that the government s legal obligation is that clear i would leave that up to people who are more expert than i am but i do know that if they collapse , that the effects would be of enormous consequences so we have to try to find ways to shore up their stability and stop this slide that is going on now one of the things i heard a lot covering the hillary clinton campaign against obama is that it is difficult to run against an africanamerican because every charge , every use of a word was flyspecked , for signs of potential prejudice it just made things very complicated and constraining i guess they felt vaguely there was some doublestandard there have you found that \? i 'd like to make a joke , but i wo n't i think that senator obama has run an effective and admirable campaign he has literally come from people who did n't believe that he had much of a chance for the nomination to , with his eloquence and his effective campaigning , has not only secured the nomination of his party but he s gotten the interest and the involvement of millions of people who otherwise might not have so i think in any campaign , that you have to stay on your message , my message , rather than worry about the message of the campaign of the opponent we are in a situation today where all words are parsed , all comments are diagnosed , and looked for whatever effect they might have we have to feed the beast , the hourly cable shows , the instant news in the blogs , and all that that is just the situation that we 're in , and i'm not complaining about it , because that would be both foolish and a waste of time but i believe that it s not anything to do with senator obama , per se , or my campaign , per se , i just think we are in an hourly news cycle there s the spokespersons' back and forth , there s the phrase taken out , there s the you know , i mean , it s just the nature of campaigns today and i was in the 2000 campaign , as you well know , and the difference i think between 2008 and 2000 is that everything is just accelerated it used to be what s the story of the day \? now it s what s the story of the hour \? it 'll be what s the story of the next five minutes \? but i do n't think it has anything to do with the candidates as much as it does with the dramatic increase in telecommunications that would be true even if you were against senator clinton \? i think no matter who i was running against do you ever sit there and think , pull back a word \? no , no , because i have to base my approach to senator obama as one of respect as long as i do that , then i do n't have to worry about any language i might use , because senator obama deserves respect , number one , but people want a respectful campaign i know we get into the back and forth , our spokespersons and all that , but i think they still want respectful campaigning and i respect him remember when biden got yeah , yeah i 've never had that happen i 've been asked about him a million times , and i 've always said basically the same thing i admire him and respect him , because he s waged an incredibly successful campaign you know , i also admire and respect senator clinton you might say , as i said earlier today , she s motivated , she s proven , particularly , that a woman is capable of qualifying in a very effective fashion for the highest job in the land i think she s a role model to lots of young americans all americans oops all americans do you think obama has drawn unfairly favorable media coverage \? easiest thing for me to do in my life is to complain about the media that s the easiest thing to do , i enjoy it , it makes me feel so much better , and i feel persecuted , and picked on no ! look , this is n't beanbag , this is a tough business i 've just got to go on with my campaign and put one foot ahead of the other the media in america , i think , at the end of the day , is going to judge all of us as fairly as possible because i think most of the media of course not all , look , not all politicians are honest , not all mayors are good mayors , ok , but i think at the end of the day most journalists , particularly those are involved in national campaigns , are interested in journalistic standards and reporting the facts to the american people'' what i used to hear from the clinton people and your own supporters now that there is sense of , not bias , but the sense of excitement resulting in more positive stories about him and more negative stories about her and now about you no , we 've got 116 days i believe it is , and i 've got to spend my time in those 116 days , how can i better communicate with these people , how can i learn more about what s going on in the stock market today , what can i john taylor s an economist how can i better shape my economic message it s just a waste of time to worry about whether michael cooper is a jerk or not we all know that he s a jerk everybody knows that ask the other journalists on the bus ask anybody so i just do n't , not only do n't do it , i 've learned long ago that you 've got to , you 've just got to keep working and do the best you can , and at the end of the day rely on the good judgment of the american people' what websites if any do you look at regularly \? brooke and mark show me drudge , obviously , everybody watches , for better or for worse , drudge sometimes i look at politico sometimes realpolitics , sometimes \( mrs mccain and ms buchanan both interject meagan s blog ! \) excuse me , meagan s blog and we also look at the blogs from michael and from you that may not be in the newspaper , that are just part of your blog but do you go on line for yourself \? they go on for me i am learning to get online myself , and i will have that down fairly soon , getting on myself i do n't expect to be a great communicator , i do n't expect to set up my own blog , but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need including going to my daughter s blog first , before anything else do you use a blackberry or email \? no he uses a blackberry , just ours i use the blackberry , but i do n't email , i 've never felt the particular need to email i read emails all the time , but the communications that i have with my friends and staff are oral and done with my cell phone i have the luxury of being in contact with them literally all the time we now have a phone on the plane that is usable on the plane , so i just never really felt a need to do it but i do could i just say , really i understand the impact of blogs on american politics today and political campaigns i understand that and i understand that something appears on one blog , can ricochet all around and get into the evening news , the front page of the new york times so , i do pay attention to the blogs and i am not in any way unappreciative of the impact that they have on entire campaigns and world opinion you read newspapers then i read them most all every day you and obama are both newspaper and book readers do you read them in the old paper version or do you read them online \? i love to read them in the print form , and the reason why i do is because so much , the prominence of the story matters if i read a story and say , oh my god , did you see this \? but it s back on a26 , it does n't have the impact of what are still even though it s declining what are still , what are hundreds of millions of american picking up an looking at today and that s why i really think that reading it is , it helps me more than , now , because i do n't read all the newspapers i do n't see , for example , the la times every day , or the san francisco chronicle , or the arizona republic when i'm away so we go then , of course , online , and look at them' if california wants to legalize gay marriage , should it be permitted to do so \? i respect the rights of the states to make those decisions i obviously am personally in favor of preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman and i also would point out that we passed a thing called the defense of marriage act , which i know you 're familiar with , where we said that states were not required to recognize in their states the decision that other states made in other words , if the state of massachusetts recognized marriage between man and had allowed samesex marriage , that does not mean that that decision can be imposed on the state of arizona the state of arizona will make that decision but if the state wanted to do it on the own , you would not support taking action to stop it \? if the people wanted to amend the constitution in order to support the unique status , affirm the unique status , i certainly would support that but if they decide not to , that s a state decision that s made by the state' how do you feel about teaching evolution in schools \? i think , first of all , it s up to the school boards that s why we have local control over education so my personal view is that children should be exposed to as much as they possibly can so that they can make their decisions and be the best informed but i really believe that school boards are elected in order to make a lot of those decisions , and i respect their decisions unless they are unconstitutional in some way or , you know if you were on a school board , how would you vote \? i do n't know , adam i 'd have to see the proposal , i 'd have to see where it lies in the curriculum , i 'd have to i ca n't i'm not running for school board do you think the economic policies of the last 8 years have led to an accumulation , a concentration of wealth in too few hands \? i think that because of our spending practices we have mortgaged all of our children s futures and i believe that every american should have the chance to become wealthy , and i want to provide them with that opportunity and i want to keep their taxes low , and i want to provide them with a lower price for a gallon of gas , because it s lowest income americans who are suffering the most so , as you know , i had my own proposal for tax cuts , and those tax cuts , i think , were important but they also were associated with spending i think spending out of control spending has harmed all americans but i think it s harmed low income americans and our failure over 30 years to address the energy issue who is paying the most today \? it s the lower income americans driving older automobiles that s who is bearing the majority of the burden of our failure to act to become independent of foreign oil and address the energy issue to what extent do you think your campaign has been hurt by infighting \? well , i go to town hall meetings all the time and i have them all the time and i love them and i 've yet to have a town hall meeting where someone stood up and said , who s managing your campaign , who s doing this , or what role someone played they obviously want to know what i'm going to do about energy , about taxes , about healthcare , about education , etc so i just will continue to focus on their concerns , and with respect , i say , i have not had them voice their concerns about how the individuals in my campaign , what role they play except i will continue to say that we are a collective leadership we do n't always agree i'm proud of my friends , i'm proud of mark and rick and steve and , and charlie and all of the people that are part of our campaign , and i'm proud of what we 've been able to do , i'm proud of where we are , and i'm confident we 're in a position to win this election is if fair to say that if you look at the way your campaign goes , and you look at the difficulties that it had just managementwise , that that gives us some insight into what a mccain white house would be , for better and for worse \? well , i think the proof is in the pudding the one thing i have noted , and i read all the books , the making of the president , from going all the way back every book i 've read about a campaign is that the one that won , it was a perfect and beautifully run campaign with geniuses running it and incredible messaging , etc and always the one that lost , oh , completely screwed up , too much infighting , bad people , etc so if i win , i believe that historians will say , way to go he finetuned that campaign , and he got the right people in the right place and as the campaign grew , he gave them more responsibility if i lose that campaign , always in disarray well it s already happened , a year or so ago , when we were done we were finished we were toast and history so you know , i'm sorry we did n't stick to their script i apologize for that , because too many of them predicted that we were finished but i am confident that we have the team , and the message , and the organization and as we have expanded from me , last summer i believe it was , flying group c on southwest carrying my own bags , to a staff of 300 people , i'm confident that we will be just fine over time and i love these people that are with me , i am grateful for them , they 've given up on lives with their families , and with their friends , and their normal lives , and i will always be very grateful to them , and what they 've done for me and our campaign do you like organizations with competing circles of influence what did they used to call it at the washington post \? competitive tension \? i think that when jack kennedy went to see president eisenhower , president eisenhower kind of rattled him a little bit , because he said , you know , none of the easy decisions will reach your desk only the hard ones those are the ones that you 're going to have to make the decision all the easy ones will have been , decisions will have been made before it gets to your desk and so you 've got to have competing views you 've got to have a circle of people who you know and trust john taylor s future is not dependent on my campaign but he is a noted economist in this nation , and if he thinks that i'm wrong , he s going to tell me i'm wrong if henry kissinger thinks that i'm wrong , he 'll pick up the phone and he has , several times and say you 're wrong on this , you should n't be so hard on the russians , ok \? ' you 've got to get competing opinions , and you 've got to do that in campaigns as well , in my view so i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of differing views because the bubble that a president is in , and the bubble that a candidate is in , sometimes you find out afterwards , oh boy , i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so so i appreciate and want some of the tension , i do n't want too much of it , obviously , because we have to have certain efficiencies but i think there is a balance there i hope that that explains it when i was commanding officer of a squadron in the navy , i would call in other people and i would say , ok , what s your opinion \? how do we best do this \? buckley v valeo how do you square views on campaign finance with wanting to appoint conservative jurists who do n't have a history of backing up that view \? i think the important thing is that you trust their overall approach to being the ones who enforce the constitution of the united states of america and one of the reasons why i think we do n't ask nominees or perspective nominees for their specific views on specific cases is because i do n't think that we should i think we should look at their overall philosophy , and their overall record and i really believe , and it s one reason i guess why i'm a conservative , i think that the role of the supreme court is to strictly interpret the constitution of the united states of america and i think roberts and alito are individuals i'm glad supported , even if they may take contrary opinions their position is supreme court justices mine is a legislator so i do n't expect them to agree on every issue is buckley valeo correctly decided \? i think their decision upholding mccainfeingold which was a decision obviously i supported , that decision that was our legislation
to the outside observer , my miracle swimming class does n't look all that miraculous one student floats facedown like a mafia victim another grips the poolside ladder i'm floating like a channel buoy , bobbing up and then back under the surface the miracle is that we 're all in nine feet of water , a place none of us would have gone two classes ago though the instructors at the transpersonal swimming institute \( which runs this class \) excel at many strokes , they do not teach them to beginners their methods teach one thing comfort in water of any depth from that , they maintain , the movements to propel oneself will follow spontaneously which is perfect , because i do n't care about form all i want is to be one of the people who can jump gleefully into deep water and remain there , splashing and laughing not being able to swim has marked me as an outsider my whole life are you one of those women who hates to get her hair wet in public \? asked a woman at a pool party last summer no , i'm one of those women who hate to drown our class meets in the charmingly derelict berkeley \( calif \) high school natatorium \( natatorium means that the structure houses swimming facilities high school means that we arrived today to find a chair and a fire extinguisher submerged in one of the pools \) what we 're learning are simple physical facts for instance inside your chest are a pair of unsightly but highly effective pool floats called lungs provided they are n't empty , they will dependably rocket you to the surface of the water , should you fall or jump in you need only lean your head back , and you will float for as long as you want , face in the air adult swim classes that focus on technique do n't give students the chance to explore these basic , lifealtering truths i propel myself to the bottom of the pool , bend my legs and spring to the surface , enjoying myself and generally feeling like the tsi logo , a hybrid of a human and a dolphin \( the transition line on the logo runs unsettingly lengthwise , rather than across the waist , mermaidstyle a dolphin with a head of black hair and an arm growing out of one side is shown frolicking in the sea , coping well with its disfigurement \) i reserve the word miracle for religious references , but the institute is to be excused for applying it i was raised in a sedentary household my father s sole concession to fitness was a precocktailhour stroll to the end of our road , with stops along the way to chat with anyone who happened to be out raking the yard or unloading groceries my mother had a set of chintzy bicycle pedals mounted on a small stand , enabling her to exercise while watching tv i do n't think it ever occurred to her that it might be nice to purchase an actual bicycle and take it for a spin in the new hampshire countryside accordingly , my parents raised a pair of academically accomplished but dismally uncoordinated paperweights my brother nearly drowned as a toddler , at newfound lake , where my parents would occasionally go to set up lawn chairs and read and sip martinis and generally lose track of their offspring my mother , suitably chastened , carted me off to swim lessons i threw a tantrum there was no second lesson over the years , the occasional wellmeaning friend tried to teach me to swim i remember my gradeschool pal martha launching herself into waistdeep water and creating a thrashing churn that suggested she had been the victim of a rare new england piranha attack just do this ! came a voice from somewhere inside the chop years later , my college roommate steph tried to show me how to tread water her arms and legs whirled at eggbeater speed in a complex , contrapuntal fashion i once saw a man on the ed sullivan show spinning plates while simultaneously hulahooping rings on his ankles what steph was doing seemed no less improbable i gained the impression that treading water entailed a series of frenzied but intricately coordinated moves if you faltered , if you dropped one of your plates , you would sink to the bottom and drown it s almost time to get out of the pool the instructor is saying something i ca n't make out , as one of my ears is underwater i raise my head to ask her what she said as i do this , without thinking , i move my legs and arms in a manner that creates some push to keep me from sinking with no forethought given , i am treading water big deal , you are thinking and you are right
port st lucie , fla the statistics compiled by carlos delgado during 14 years in the major leagues particularly his 434 home runs offer ample evidence that he knows how to hit a baseball contrary to popular belief , he did not forget how last season , the worst of his career but he returned home to puerto rico feeling he had to do something radical nevertheless i kind of broke it down and started from scratch , like if i was learning to hit for the first time , he said at first , delgado concentrated only on his swing mechanics , practicing with a tee so his muscles would remember how it felt he moved on to a hitting machine and then took batting practice shortly after arriving here monday morning , delgado entered a batting cage with the process committed to memory stay back , recognize the pitch , step with the front foot the right foot and swing just as he once did it was a nice , friendly reminder , delgado said delgado said he was certain that his forgettable statistics in 2007 career lows in home runs \( 24 \) , batting average \( 258 \) , onbase percentage \( 333 \) and slugging percentage \( 448 \) over a full season were a result of his stubbornness and a mechanical flaw , not the start of a decline or slow hands he said , without a trace of sarcasm , that he wished he could attribute his downturn to the elbow and wrist operations he had before last season it s harder to hit 240 than to hit 300 in a funny kind of way , delgado said it s one of those things to forget manager willie randolph said delgado looked leaner this year and that he had a real good vibe about him but a hunch is a hunch , nothing more , and the first few months of the season could indicate whether delgado s days of being a top power hitter have passed or if he still has a few productive years left if it s consistent , if it happens a year or two in a row , that s how you tell , randolph said when asked how he could tell if a player s skills were diminishing i 'll get a better feel this year how he looks , what adjustments he s made and give you a better answer later he s made some adjustments in his career just last year he did n't do them quick enough or realize them or adjust to them rapidly enough delgado s struggles prompted randolph last may to drop him to sixth in the batting order , the first time delgado had started and batted that low in more than 10 years he alternated brief hot stretches with longer slumps but it was not until the final weeks of the season that delgado enjoyed sustained success , batting 389 with four home runs during a threecity trip in august and september but a strained hip flexor toward the end of the trip , in cincinnati , cost him nearly three weeks i told him many times he did n't dictate the atbat , randolph said it seemed like i watched this kid for years and years and i know that he s the one that s in control but he did n't show that consistent control he was being dictated to i said many times , you be the one to dictate , you really want to take control of the atbat i'm sure that great hitters always go back to the drawing board they break things down at stake is delgado s future with the team this could be his last season with the , considering his age \( he turns 36 on june 25 \) , his 16 million option for 2009 and the club s possible pursuit of mark teixeira , the braves' slugging first baseman teixeira will be one of the top players on the freeagent market after the season the moment i step out onto that field , i'm going to play like it s my last year , delgado said i do n't play that freeagent game or that i'm looking for a contract i would like to continue to play i feel very comfortable here in new york it would be nice to come back , but if you start playing this year thinking of next year , chances are you 're going to mess up somewhere along the way in some ways , there is less pressure on him this season unlike last year , when he began the season as the mets' cleanup hitter , delgado will almost certainly bat lower in the order , behind carlos beltr n , david wright and , if healthy , moises alou delgado fractured his left hand when he was hit by a pitch in the final game of the season , putting , he said , a horrible end to a horrible year the injury has healed , allowing him to concentrate on what he has always done well hit a baseball inside pitch the reserve outfielder endy ch vez said his left ankle , which he injured in december while playing winter ball in his native venezuela , had not returned to full strength but ch vez said that he expected to be ready for the mets' first exhibition game feb 27 ch vez pulled his right hamstring he missed nearly three months after straining his left hamstring last season while trying to score , and then the spikes on his left cleat caught in the dirt , injuring the ankle my ankle s worse than my hamstring , he said but i was working hard back home and i'm almost ready duaner s nchez attracted the most attention in the bullpen monday none of the other nine mounds were being used , and a crowd including the principal owner , fred wilpon , willie randolph and general manager omar minaya watched every pitch
los angeles it was another warm sunny morning in southern california on thursday as 1 , 800 people died , 53 , 000 fell injured , schools , hospitals and apartment buildings collapsed , and fred tarkanian ordered a grande iced coffee at a starbucks on ventura boulevard mr tarkanian was not aware that the big one had hit , though in this case it was a simulation , part of what was promoted as the largest earthquake drill ever tried in the united states probably worse for disaster relief planners , mr tarkanian s level of concern about earthquakes and that of those around him did not register high on the richter scale , either we have some bottled water , some crackers , but honestly i do n't think much about it , he said , seconds after the shaking supposedly began at 10 am we have had earthquakes before , and we will have them again to stir southern californians out of complacency , scientists and engineers organized the great southern california shakeout , pulling together emergency agencies , schools , businesses and individuals to stage a drill unlike any other people taking part in the drill were told that a magnitude 78 earthquake had hit along the san andreas fault , something scientists say has a high probability of occurring in the next 30 years it would be 50 times more powerful than the last major temblor , the northridge earthquake that hit los angeles in 1994 and registered a magnitude of 67 , killed 57 people and caused billions of dollars in damage taking a page from annual largescale drills in japan and mexico , organizers developed a multipronged approach , including a web site , , with video and audio simulations and a forum for people to share planning tips and experiences some 53 million people registered on the site and pledged to drop , cover and hold on at 10 am or participate in other exercises , though it was not determined how many actually followed through a rally was planned for friday at a big entertainment complex downtown , along with other events over the weekend while not quite a war of the worlds moment , one radio station , kfwbam , got into the act , breaking in with updates like one about firefighters considering an urban water drop to douse burning buildings it also played specially recorded earthquake sounds to help in role playing at a school in the san fernando valley that was destroyed in the 1994 quake , gov arnold schwarzenegger , who said he had awakened his staff for the drill five hours before the scheduled start to catch them off guard , admired the gusto of bloodied and batteredlooking students i think the students know my background in acting and hollywood , mr schwarzenegger said i think they wanted to do an audition such a broad , interactive campaign , said lucy jones , a federal seismologist who helped organize it , could ripple out to people who , according to surveys , have grown blas and less prepared over the years , probably because of a lack of big quakes after a 54 jolt in july , ms jones said , she watched aghast as television news images showed people running out of buildings \( a major nono because of falling debris \) and crouching next to desks instead of under them we recognized a lot of holes in the general public s knowledge and preparation for earthquakes , she said , lamenting how few people know they must have enough provisions to last at least three days after a quake denial and disaster fatigue wildfires , mudslides and smaller tremors regularly visit southern california always pose challenges at a beverly hills school , a student , jonathan agam , 13 , captured the day s mix of anxiety and complacency as only an adolescent could i guess i'm supposed to say ow , ' jonathan said , lying on the ground with a laminated sign that indicated he had an abdominal injury i said ow' earlier , but everyone just kept walking a veteran of these kinds of drills even many preschoolers here have earthquake kits in their classrooms and practice evacuations he summed up his corner of the disaster the laidback people , the slackers , do n't take it seriously , he said i take it serious i get all a s in math , so far , i 've gotten 100s on every test but , he added , this is better than science class glitches emerged here and there mental health workers had to reschedule a planned early morning evacuation at a downtown clinic when they realized it would conflict with the distribution of medicine these are people on medication , a spokesman said , and we do n't want to alarm them in the coming days , officials will evaluate the drill , but , as mayor antonio r villaraigosa put it , by virtue of putting this effort together , we 're a step ahead , a giant leap ahead meanwhile , back in reality , the hot , dry santa ana winds were due over the next few days earthquake weather in local lore and most definitely fire weather , as californians know very well that , said edward bushman , a los angeles fire battalion chief watching a searchandrescue demonstration at a valley fire station , is what i am worried about right now
nawa , many of the problems frustrating afghanistan s efforts to secure its dangerous eastern and southern provinces were evident in the bizarre tour of duty of shair mohammad , a police officer who spent 18 months in an isolated swath of steppe until december , when a colonel arrived to replace him , mr mohammad , 30 , had been the acting police chief in the nawa district of ghazni province the job gave him jurisdiction over hundreds of square miles near pakistan that the had used as a sanctuary since being ousted from power in 2001 but his ability to police his beat was severely compromised mr mohammad had no rank , no money for food and not enough clothing or gear to operate in cold weather two of his six trucks were broken the ammunition the pentagon provided him came in cardboard boxes that immediately crumbled , exposing cartridges to the elements on his storeroom s dirty floor compounding his woes , the possibility of mutiny was on his mind it was a natural worry , he said , because since april none of his men had been paid my commanders always just give me promises , he said they never send the money in its simplest distillation , the strategy driving this americanled war is straightforward western troops are an interim force to provide security , spur development and mentor indigenous security forces until the afghan leadership can govern alone but in the past two years , the insurgency has blossomed , making control of many provinces a contest the afghan army , under american tutelage , has made considerable progress , american officers say the police lag far behind lightly equipped , marginally trained , undermined by corruption and poor discipline , they remain weak , though their expected role is daunting they are not asked merely to police a country that lacks the rule of law they are being used to fight a war the american and afghan governments say improving the police s capabilities is a priority american financing has sharply increased to do so if you look at how the afghan army has changed for the better , and project that kind of change for the afghan police , there is reason to be optimistic , said lt col timothy j mcateer , who commands the second battalion , 508th parachute infantry , the principal american unit working in ghazni province but mr mohammad s tour , undermined by mismanagement from above and the poor discipline that surrounded him , suggested how difficult any transformation might be as his tour ended in middecember , he spent his last evenings crouched by a hissing space heater in a mudwalled fort , sipping tea and waiting for his government to provide the help the police needed mr mohammad himself , and his sense of commitment , provided reason to be hopeful , american officers said tiny , bearded , wildeyed and bedecked with long strands of unkempt black hair , he led with a style that was variously whimsical , pragmatic , resolute and cunning he is a true patriot , said first lt mordechai sorkin , a platoon leader who worked alongside him he has been here almost all alone , trying to make afghanistan better in the deadpan lexicon of infantry life , several soldiers nicknamed him charles manson , to whom he bears a slight resemblance the name was meant in good humor the soldiers said mr mohammad was a character of his own he managed a gentle and wry demeanor , but never declined to join them on patrols and was courageous under fire in a taliban ambush in october , they noted , one of his officers was killed and four others wounded mr mohammad survived and tried to rally his penniless ranks he was also steadfast in the face of intimidation another day , the mutilated body of an elderly man who had spoken against the taliban was found on the road the man had been beheaded afghanis , the national currency , had been stuffed in his nose on patrols with americans through villages that harbor the taliban , mr mohammad gathered elders and gave speeches against the insurgents and such behavior , telling villagers that siding with the government was the surest route away from barbarism to a more secure life resolve was not enough as his tour ended , mr mohammad said , his own government had failed to match his sense of duty his district had long been a transit corridor for insurgents between pakistan and afghanistan , and had had almost no government presence since 2006 the area had been covered only by mr mohammad s detachment and one american platoon , roughly 40 soldiers many villages in the district had never been visited by either the military or the police in early december , colonel mcateer , the american commander , augmented the firebase with most of his battalion s company b more than two more platoons the company commander , capt christopher j demure , moved to nawa with a detachment of afghan army soldiers and about a dozen afghan police officers , including a colonel to relieve mr mohammad the officers in nawa , the only government representatives that had ever entered much of nawa , were surviving on donations some might call it extortion from a local bazaar when captain demure arrived , mr mohammad told him the government s logistics system was such a failure that he owed 3 , 400 to shopkeepers for goods he had commandeered to keep his police station fed and supplied the sum equaled roughly three years of his salary lt col amanuddin , the police supervisor who arrived with new officers , appeared to be just as disappointed as mr mohammad \( like many afghans , colonel amanuddin has only one name \) i need 20 good police officers , and could use 100 , he said good people not any hashish smokers and i need sleeping bags and mattresses and a generator for power without more officers and better equipment , he said , it would be impossible to conduct night patrols with american soldiers but there were signs as well that mr mohammad , for all of his courage and sense of loyalty , lacked other fundamental leadership traits the station colonel amanuddin was inheriting was a picture of disorder and filth its front yard was a junkyard of scrapped vehicles and broken artillery pieces inside was a garbage pit the garbage was not confined to this hole it was everywhere the courtyard was overrun by dogs that fed on it at least three unexploded rockets littered the grounds , and the police had taken to using a guard tower as a toilet human waste covered its floor seeing the depth of the problems , captain demure contacted a provincial coordination center that supervises the police he hoped to get more gear , wages for the officers and more officers for the district he also organized the police into patrols , led by americans , to search for taliban fighters and meet villagers for introductions but on dec 6 , mr mohammad s fear of mass desertion came true destitute and dispirited , most of the officers under his command abandoned their posts at sunrise it was not the first time , he said , that such a thing had happened nine of colonel amanuddin s officers announced that they were leaving , too only one new officer remained amir mohammad , a driver with only one arm the only other officers to agree to work were three of mr mohammad s relatives cheerful but largely untrained men at one point , mr mohammad had commanded more than 15 men captain demure urged the new chief to ask the men to keep working it was no use none of the officers have been paid , the colonel said if we force them , they might kill us mr mohammad nodded knowingly captain demure was soon back in contact with ghazni , asking for police officers again the patrols he had organized had been encouraging many villagers had seemed friendly and said they wanted the government to move into the district there are people here who welcome the government and the change it can bring , he said but we need the police down here to help make that happen a few days later , at the captain s urging , eight more officers arrived to work with colonel amanuddin more were expected soon , he said mr mohammad s tour was over at last earlier , he had said that when he was relieved he would confront the supervisors he suspected of embezzling his officers' wages but even this wish showed how much work was ahead he would have to travel in an american convoy , he said , because if a police officer risked driving to the capital alone , he would almost certainly be shot this looks like a fortress , he said , gesturing to the compound where he had lived for a year and a half really it is an island the taliban is all around
washington in a highly unusual admission of error , the justice department acknowledged on wednesday that government lawyers should have known that congress had recently made the rape of a child a capital offense in the military and should have informed the supreme court of that fact while the justices were considering whether death was a constitutional punishment for the crime it s true that the parties to the case missed it , but it s our responsibility , the department s public affairs office said in a statement we regret , the statement said , that the department did n't catch the 2006 law when the case of kennedy v louisiana was briefed in that case , decided june 25 by a vote of 5 to 4 , the court ruled that the constitution prohibits the death penalty for the rape of a child justice anthony m kennedy s majority opinion was based in part on the conclusion that because child rape was a capital offense in only six states , and not under federal law , the death penalty for the crime did not meet the evolving standards of decency by which the court judges capital punishment justice kennedy s conclusion about the absence of federal law was mistaken not only did congress add child rape to the military death penalty in 2006 , but president bush , in an executive order last september , added the new provision to the current version of the manual for courtsmartial the solicitor general s office , which represents the federal government before the supreme court , did not file a brief in the case , and none of the 10 briefs that were filed informed the justices of the new federal law a civilian air force lawyer , dwight sullivan , mentioned the omission over the weekend on his military law blog the new york times reported the oversight in an account that first appeared tuesday on its web site speaking to reporters on wednesday morning , the white house press secretary , dana perino , said the administration was disturbed by the new york times report that the court s decision might be based on a mistake the justice department is looking into what happened and what steps may now be taken , ms perino said the justice department elaborated in its statement , which it issued in late afternoon the department informed the court of the omission shortly after learning of the law on tuesday , the statement said as the department s statement noted , only parties to a case can ask the justices to reconsider their decision the department might ask the court for permission to provide its views if louisiana files a rehearing petition , the statement added steve wimberly , the first assistant in the jefferson parish , la , district attorney s office , which handled the case for the state before the supreme court , said in an interview wednesday that while no decision had yet been made , we are strongly considering the option of asking the justices to reconsider the case mr wimberly added that gov bobby jindal , who denounced the court s ruling , was involved in deciding how to proceed the justice department statement was carefully worded to avoid conceding that under the reasoning of the supreme court decision , the military death penalty provision for child rape is now unconstitutional the statement noted that in a 1996 decision , loving v united states , which upheld the military s general death penalty provision , the justices simply assumed , without deciding , that the court s death penalty jurisprudence was fully applicable to the military since no death penalty prosecution has been brought since the military provision took effect , it is not clear how or when its constitutionality may be tested
anchorage convicted of seven felony counts just nine days ago , senator of held a narrow lead on wednesday in his bid for reelection , though the race remained too close to call mr stevens , 84 and a 40year incumbent , led his democratic challenger , mayor mark begich of anchorage , by fewer than 3 , 400 votes with more than 55 , 000 absentee , early and questioned ballots remaining to be counted if he wins , mr stevens would be the first felon elected to the  the senator s campaign said that such latecounted votes traditionally break for republicans and that it was almost mathematically impossible for mr begich to win but mr begich strongly disputed those claims , noting that his campaign had made a concerted effort to win absentee and early voters and that he had won absentee counts in his elections as mayor a final vote count may not come until next week or later even if mr stevens wins , he could still be forced from office many top republican leaders in the senate have called on him to resign , and some senate leaders have threatened to expel him mr stevens suggested in the past week that if he were to lose his criminal appeal , he would resign rather than face a possible expulsion from the senate he said he would do what s right for alaska , aaron saunders , a stevens campaign spokesman , said late tuesday night at the same time , mr saunders questioned whether senators could muster the twothirds vote necessary for expulsion in the event that mr stevens was forced out or resigned , a special election would be called to replace him some people believe that gov sarah palin , also a republican , would be a strong candidate in that scenario ms palin , the republican vicepresidential nominee , has called on mr stevens to resign mr begich , asked whether he would run again in a special election , said , my goal is to win this election the closeness of the vote reflected mr stevens s remarkable endurance in a state where he is revered for bringing home billions of dollars in federal spending many people here refer to him as uncle ted on oct 27 , a federal jury in washington convicted mr stevens of seven felony counts of failing to disclose more than 250 , 000 in gifts and home renovations polls taken after his conviction showed mr stevens clearly trailing mr begich but two days after the conviction , the senator returned to alaska for a sixday campaign sprint in which he insisted to voters that he had been wrongfully prosecuted and would have his conviction overturned mr stevens declared more than once in the last week that he had not been formally convicted , a reference to the fact that a conviction is not complete until sentencing , which had not yet taken place he said he could still effectively represent alaska while pursuing an appeal i do n't believe there is another senator in america who could survive politically what he s been through , john binkley , a prominent republican in the state and a former candidate for governor , said late tuesday as election returns suggested mr stevens could win it is a testament to how much he has done for alaska no senator has been expelled since the civil war , said donald ritchie , a senate historian of 11 senators who have been indicted for crimes , five have been convicted , including mr stevens , mr ritchie said none have been reelected after being convicted the last senator threatened with expulsion was harrison a williams jr , democrat of new jersey , who was convicted of conspiracy , bribery and other charges in 1981 mr williams resigned after the senate ethics committee recommended expulsion
washington every day around 8 am , foreign policy aides at senator s chicago campaign headquarters send him two emails a briefing on major world developments over the previous 24 hours and a set of questions , accompanied by suggested answers , that the candidate is likely to be asked about international relations during the day one recent q a asked , for example , whether mr obama supported the decision by iraq s prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , to include a timetable for american troop withdrawal in any new security agreements with the united states the answer , provided to mr obama with bullet points , was yes or a genuine opportunity , as he put it in a speech on iraq this week behind the email messages is a tightknit group of aides supported by a huge 300person foreign policy campaign bureaucracy , organized like a mini state department , to assist a candidate whose limited national security experience remains a concern to many voters it is unwieldy , no question , said denis mcdonough , 38 , mr obama s top foreign policy aide , speaking of an infrastructure that has been divided into 20 teams based on regions and issues , and that has recently absorbed , with some tensions , the top foreign policy advisers from senator hillary rodham clinton s presidential campaign but an administration is unwieldy , too we also know that it s messier when you do n't get as much information as you can the group is on the spot this week as mr obama is planning to make his first overseas foray as the presumptive democratic presidential nominee , with voters at home and leaders abroad watching closely to see how he handles himself on the global stage unlike george w bush , who entered the presidential race in 2000 with scant exposure to national security issues , mr obama has served since his election to the senate in 2004 on the foreign relations committee and has had a running tutorial from aides steeped in the issues his campaign says that he is well prepared and that he often alters and expands on the talking points provided to him by his foreign policy advisers most of the core members of his team served in government during president bill clinton s administration and by and large were junior to the advisers who worked on mrs clinton s campaign for the democratic nomination but they remain in charge within the campaign even as it takes on more senior figures from the clinton era , like two former secretaries of state , and , and are positioned to put their own stamp on the party s foreign policy most of them , like the candidate they are working for , distinguished themselves from mrs clinton s foreign policy camp by early opposition to the iraq war they also tend to be more liberal and to emphasize using the soft power of diplomacy and economic aid to try to advance the interests of the united states still , their positions fall well within centrist democratic foreign policy thinking , and none of the deep policy fissures that have divided the republicans into two camps , the neoconservatives and the socalled pragmatists , have opened mr obama s core team is led by susan e rice , an assistant secretary of state for african affairs in the clinton administration , who has pushed for a tougher response to the crisis in the darfur region of sudan , and , mr clinton s first national security adviser , who was criticized for the administration s failure to confront the genocide in rwanda in 1994 and now acknowledges the inaction as a major mistake the core group also includes gregory b craig , a former top official in the clinton state department who served as the president s lawyer during his impeachment trial , a navy secretary in the clinton administration mark w lippert , mr obama s former senate foreign policy adviser , who just returned from a navy tour of duty in iraq and mr mcdonough mr mcdonough and mr lippert are paid by the campaign and based in chicago , and the rest are outside advisers who volunteer their time from washington the group no longer includes , the winning harvard human rights expert who resigned in march after she was quoted calling mrs clinton a monster but mr lake still talks to ms power , and mr obama sent a long personal tribute that was read at her wedding in ireland this month mr obama s republican rival , senator john mccain of arizona , has a far smaller and looser foreign policy advisory operation , about 75 people in all , and none are organized into teams in 2004 , the democratic presidential nominee , senator john kerry , had a foreign policy structure similar in scale to mr obama s , but it had limited influence on the candidate , who had spent 20 years in the senate , former advisers said mr obama is not yet receiving the government intelligence briefing that is typically made available to a presidential candidate upon becoming his party s nominee mr obama s infrastructure funnels hundreds of email messages and reams of position papers and talking points each day to members of the core group , who in turn seek advice or make requests for more information to team members down the line , the middle east envoy for mr clinton and the first president bush and a member of the obama campaign s middle east team , is frequently asked by ms rice , mr lake or mr mcdonough for help on framing mr obama s comments on iran s nuclear program and its potential threat to israel they 've asked for substantive help can i take a look at language on iran \? ' mr ross said or sometimes i 've been asked questions to explain the administration s approach on iran mr ross participated in a conference call last week with mr obama and other advisers to prepare for the senator s foreign trip , and he will travel with mr obama in israel and the west bank city of ramallah and at other stops mr ross described mr obama in the conference call as focused on drilling down into the issues on the trip another person who has contributed outside advice is former secretary of state , whom mr obama has been wooing mr powell , a republican , has a friendship of decades with mr mccain , but friends say he has felt excluded from mr mccain s foreign policy operation and was impressed when mr obama called on him in june mr powell also met around the same time with mr mccain from day to day , the main point of contact with mr obama and his foreign policy team is mr mcdonough , who is soon to be joined in chicago by mr lippert if there s something big in the morning , we will either email or call obama , said mr lippert , who performed a similar job , although on a smaller scale , when he was mr obama s foreign policy adviser in the senate so instead of having 20 people at your fingertips , you have 300 the pressure is there , the time is much shorter , but the principle is the same lining up the calls , briefing the candidate , emails , opeds , statements out in the netherworld of the 300 , advisers often say they are unclear about what happens to all the policy paragraphs they churn out on request it s all mysterious what we send him and what gets to him , said michael a mcfaul , a russia scholar at stanford university who leads the russia and eurasia team for the obama campaign other team leaders include , a scholar at the brookings institution who has organized his 40member nuclear nonproliferation team into eight working groups , and philip h gordon , another scholar at the institution , who is in charge of mr obama s europe team although mr obama s team has yet to show any public evidence of deep policy divisions , it has its share of personal tensions , not least those born of integrating mrs clinton s former advisers into the effort in that process , the old clinton administration hierarchy has been turned upside down one person who is not a team leader and who was not included in a 13member senior working group that the obama campaign announced last month is , a united nations ambassador under mr clinton who was mentioned as a potential secretary of state if mrs clinton had won the presidency mr holbrooke has long had a rivalry with mr lake , who was widely criticized in washington for his performance as national security adviser in the clinton white house the obama campaign has since said that mr holbrooke , who mediated an end to the war in bosnia in 1995 , is on the team but mr holbrooke , who declined to comment , has found himself in the position of a general from a defeated army who must now seek peace
pittsburgh when sidney crosby s first shot at a stanley cup championship fell short by the smallest of margins wednesday night , he looked every bit like a 20yearold who had just had his dream snatched away he sat at his locker in full uniform , his eyes red , his voice wavering finally , he got up and walked away , passing his hero and landlord the ' owner , mario lemieux and headed down a hallway without a word to the penguins , the idea that their young , talented team had to lose to detroit as part of a maturing process felt like a hollow platitude that could be seen on crosby s tearstreaked face , in forward ryan malone s solitary vigil at his locker , in the blank stares and pained expressions that filled the penguins locker room lemieux , who went 2 for 2 in his trips to the cup finals as a player , was having nothing of the losebeforeyoucanwin theory , either it s been quite an experience for them they 've come a long way the last few weeks , lemieux said but once you get to the final , you expect to win but these guys , you look at our team , there s a few kids that are 19 , 20 , 21 years old it s always a tough thing to go through , but they 'll gain some experience and i'm sure the next time they will come through in the end , the finals lived up to the billing as a thrilling matchup between the experience , poise and incredible teamwork of detroit and the dynamic , young penguins unfortunately for the penguins , it took them two blowout losses in detroit before they started competing i think as the series went on , we got better , crosby said in game 1 of this series , i thought maybe we were guilty of trying too hard , running around , not working smart we 're obviously learning from that by the end , even pittsburgh s spectacular comefrombehind tripleovertime victory in game 5 in detroit was not enough to derail the they calmly regrouped , grabbed control of game 6 early and never panicked , even as the penguins tried desperately to come back and missed a glorious chance in the final seconds to tie the game they had the advantage of relying on players like defenseman nicklas lidstrom , who hoisted his fourth stanley cup , and goaltender chris osgood , who won his third they came into the series with 10 players who had won a total of 23 championships but it was not just the winning experiences that propelled the red wings here even they learned from losing along the way despite piling up an impressive regularseason record the past few seasons , the red wings had not made a cup finals since their last victory , in 2002 last year , they lost in the western conference finals to anaheim if you go through the last three years in the nhl and the amount of games we 've won i mean , we won 58 , we won 50 , we won 54 so do the math there , red wings coach mike babcock said and then we flamed out this year , it s been a process it did n't happen overnight we 've been a good team , and i think an elite team for the last three years , and we were finally able to get it done the red wings had gone through their own changes since their last title , overcoming the departure of their longtime captain , steve yzerman , as well as players like brendan shanahan and sergei fedorov lidstrom took over seamlessly as the captain , but the cast of star forwards became younger , led by the playoff most valuable player henrik zetterberg , along with pavel datsyuk and johan franzen and they made those changes with the salary cap that arrived after the 2004 lockout we 've had the same core group of guys , four , five , six guys for a lot of years , and i think it s been helpful to keep that core group and add a few players every year , lidstrom said but it shows that we are still able to play well with the new system people probably thought we were going to drop off a little bit going into that first season after the lockout , and the team did n't lose a beat and oddly , it is the penguins facing salarycap issues this coming offseason , not the red wings with the bill coming due on their high draft picks of recent years goalie marcandr fleury is a restricted free agent this summer and forwards evgeni malkin and jordan staal will command big paydays next summer they have to be careful in considering resigning unrestricted free agents like forwards marian hossa , malone and defenseman brooks orpik it s going to be difficult to make it all work , lemieux said but there s been great lessons there we really built this team to give us a chance to win this i'm sure we 'll make the right decisions at the right time but none of them will erase the pain of losing when the cup seemed so close
icelandic pancakes folded with jam of mixed berries and whipped cream read the stylish calligraphy on a little white card atop the dessert buffet in the united nations delegates dining room is locked in a tight race against austria and turkey for two rotating seats on the security council that are reserved for the mostly european bloc , and the luncheon spread last week was part of its charm offensive the lobbying effort gained added urgency in tandem with daily headlines trumpeting iceland s bankruptcy would two buffet tables groaning with delicacies exclusively from iceland persuade any of the 192 member states that can vote this friday that iceland deserves their support \? well , they have to try to convince people with pancakes because they do n't have any money left , said one european diplomat walking past electric moments have become rarer around the united nations secretariat in recent years , but a hotly contested security council vote still creates buzz even as members grumble about the declining relevancy of a security council designed circa world war ii , more and more nations seek to wield the influence gained by winning a seat at the council s iconic horseshoeshaped table it is one of the major plum goals for foreign policy in any country , said colin keating , a former new zealand ambassador who runs security council report , a nonprofit organization that tracks the body it is a place of real power it is the only international institution that exists that has the legal power by majority vote to compel the international community to do something regions try to create consensus around one candidate it is called a clean slate to avoid a bruising vote uganda has been anointed for the africa seat this year , and mexico for latin america a battle is occurring in asia , with iran challenging japan iran argues that it deserves the spot , having not been on the council since 1956 , while japan has served nine times , the last ending in 2006 but diplomats say that iran is such a long shot that it might withdraw they note the country s standoff with the security council over the nuclear issue , with three rounds of sanctions against it nobody seeks to repeat the experience with rwanda in the early 1990s , when it used its seat to hinder resolutions aimed at the violence there the intention to win a seat is often announced a decade in advance it is a bit like applying for a prestigious college you have to prove you are well rounded at the united nations , that means first showing active interest in peace and security issues \( turkey contributes manpower peacekeeping operations in four countries \) second , you must show you are working to improve the environment and alleviate poverty \( iceland s literature highlights pictures of third world students in its geothermal training program \) finally , throwing a good party certainly does not hurt \( austria hosted a special united nations concert at carnegie hall featuring the vienna philharmonic and has planned a bash at the metropolitan club on the eve of the vote \) events can create turbulence around the most carefully choreographed campaigns , however witness iceland it joined the united nations in 1946 , but decided only in 1998 to join the rotation of the other nordic states on the security council in summarizing the pitch he made personally to 181 ambassadors , ambassador hjalmar w hannesson does not edit out the irony created by broken banks we had this economic security that we did n't have before , he said in an interview as we crept up the ladder of welltodo countries , we felt more and more that it was an obligation to serve others in the security council a glass bowl on the table in front of him held one of iceland s campaign geegaws little tin mint boxes they say iceland first time candidate to the security council over a world map showing the island as a little red dot at its center the financial meltdown , however , has rendered iceland in a different kind of red ink the telephone line between new york and reykjavik , the capital , has been burned up with the foreign ministry asking the mission whether the financial mess will derail iceland s candidacy , said kristin arnadottir , the icelandic diplomat running the campaign it is being discussed between us and the nordics if it has an impact , ms arnadottir said they are unsure whether it will create empathy or doubts it is not only iceland that is going through economic turmoil , it is the rest of the western world the general opinion among diplomatic handicappers is that it may affect a few votes at the margin , but that even a few votes may influence a tight race one african ambassador said iceland was trying so hard to reassure everyone that it risked leaving the impression that something was really amiss they are making too much out of it none of us understand what is going on , he said , speaking anonymously because the voting is a delicate issue of course , the other candidates have issues , too austria s antiimmigrant , farright parties won almost a third of the vote in september parliamentary elections ambassador gerhard pfanzelter tries to counter any doubts by noting that austria has a historical commitment to the united nations , hosting important organizations like the international atomic energy agency and serving as a bridge between combative nations since the cold war turkey last held a security council seat in 1961 , sensing that the turkishgreek fight over divided cyprus since 1974 would block its gaining a seat clashes with kurdish separatists prompted turkey to bomb inside iraq last week ambassador baki ilkin argues that turkey s time is due and that its geographic position at the crossroads between the turbulent middle east , the turbulent caucasus and the turbulent balkans makes it ideal to lend regional sensitivities to key council deliberations every country has an equal vote , so none are considered too small to lobby nauru and tuvalu and palau pull the same weight as the five permanent members of the security council the united states , china , russia , britain and france \( they never have to run \) the powerful palau block ! exclaimed stuart beck , an american lawyer who serves as palau s united nations ambassador at times like this our vote has value , so you are able to engage , he said , noting that all three candidates were helping push a resolution of his on combating they are more conscious of our needs both reykjavik and vienna sent envoys across the south pacific ankara invited the pacific islanders to a summit , and also hosted separate caribbean and african summits rumors of payoffs are rife , but no one can site a specific example all candidates say that they have always wanted to do more in , say , africa turkey announced that it planned to open 10 new embassies there and the timing of significant boosts in their aid budgets are a longterm dream not linked to any vote since the votes are secret , there is no insurance that a direct payoff would work it takes twothirds of the votes of members present to win a seat the vote

beijing she is the smiling angel in the wheelchair , a onelegged fencer from shanghai who endured a gantlet of antichinese demonstrators last week as she rolled through the streets of paris clutching the olympic flame each time a protester broke through the barricades and lunged for the torch , the woman , jin jing , shielded it with her body during one particularly ugly scuffle , she was bruised and scratched by a flailing woman wrapped in a tibetan flag ms jin , 28 , a former switchboard operator who lost her leg to cancer as a child , returned home a hero the news media have been filled with accounts of her bravery , using her actions to highlight what many here see as the coldhearted cruelty of those who seek to spoil china s moment in the sun in august , the olympic games in beijing when jin jing protected the torch with all her effort , she was not only defending her motherland , but also the olympic games , which belong to the whole world , said xinhua , the government news agency golden girl lifts a nation , proclaimed a headline in china daily the official web site of the beijing games lauded her valor and posted a blowbyblow account of the april 7 episode with her frail body she was defending the olympic spirit , which moved many people , it said the incident , largely unpublicized in the west , has crystallized the outrage and humiliation felt by many chinese who have been stunned by the torch s hostile reception as it hopscotches the globe although recent stops in argentina , tanzania , oman , pakistan and india went off smoothly , there were concerns about future stops , including australia it s just appalling that people would tarnish an event that the chinese people have been awaiting for so long , said wu tianren , 79 , a retired economics professor , walking in a park here freshly planted with petunias and marigolds this makes us very sad many people here , reflecting the statecontrolled media s point of view , believe that the demonstrators are acting at the behest of the dalai lama , who they say is seeking tibetan independence , despite his assertions to the contrary another target of public anger is the french , who are accused of encouraging tibetan rights advocates and failing to protect the torch internet message boards have been brewing with anger a text message campaign is urging a boycott of french products and companies , especially carrefour , a supermarket chain here the power of an individual is very small and limited , but if we get 13 billion chinese united , anyone and any country would be shocked by our power , read a posting on yahoo by someone identified only as liuanna foreign news outlets have been besieged by angry callers accusing them of running reports that glorify the tibetan demonstrators and belittle the chinese government the statecontrolled news media have stoked the fury through occasionally shrill coverage , feeding nationalist sentiment that often simmers beneath the surface of chinese society on the capital s streets , the anger is palpable , lurching between indignation and wounded pride many people said they were unaware of the protests until they learned about the plight of ms jin , the disabled torch bearer until then , coverage of the relay within china had been glowing , mostly omitting images of the antichinese protests that have been a staple of western television broadcasts those who knew about the demonstrations surrounding the torch relay seemed to conflate the chaos in paris and london with foreign coverage of the rioting in the tibetan capital , lhasa they said those news accounts of the riots had been blatantly sympathetic toward the tibetans , despite their role according to official government accounts in the deaths of 19 people , most of them han chinese the media should be telling the truth , not injecting their point of view into reports , said yang guang , 23 , an electrical engineer i think they 're just trying to make china look bad public protests are rare in beijing , so the sight of screaming demonstrators on television seems all the more jarring for most chinese , the olympics are a sacred event , which they hope will showcase their country s growing economic might and inspire new international respect there is little sympathy on the streets of beijing for tibetan rights advocates the idea that tibet is an inseparable part of china is firmly entrenched , and many people resent what they view as ingratitude among tibetans , who receive subsidies from the central government to the average beijing resident , the concept of an independent tibet is as outlandish as , say , the notion of making arizona a separate nation for the navajo indians you do n't hear chinese interfering in america s domestic affairs , said jiang shuisheng , 26 , a computer salesman taking a cigarette break he said he was particularly unhappy with the united states , which he accused of maintaining a double standard on human rights he cited the war in iraq , which he said had caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people referring to a tense period between china and the united states over taiwan , a close american ally , mr jiang said , when you had your olympics in atlanta in 1996 , you did n't see chinese people ruining the event because they were unhappy about your government s policy he acknowledged that the state media were using ms jin to heighten national pride , but added that this was justified i'm not a nationalist , but if this happened to an american , it would be no different , he said none of the dozens who were interviewed acknowledged a contradiction between their desire for china s acceptance as an equal among modern nations and the government s suppression of dissent college students , retirees and those in the newly rich entrepreneurial class agreed that anyone seeking to spoil the games should be silenced bai ru , 22 , a business management student originally from inner mongolia , said she trusted the government to take whatever measures were necessary to ensure a seamless olympics she said personal sacrifice , including stifling one s dissatisfaction with the political status quo , was for the collective good if the government takes harsh measures to crack down on protesters , of course i support that , she said this is an issue of national pride and national esteem the olympics are our best opportunity for the outside world to see how far we 've come
khui doloon khudag , the boy rode the stallion in a trot around the camp , cooling it down after a long gallop across the steppe he was humming his favorite mongolian hiphop songs , by groups like tatar , flash and guy 666 nearby , in the family s round felt tent , the boy s father ran a wire from a satellite dish to a bigscreen television his mother paced around in highheeled boots when i'm in the city , i miss my horses , the boy , munkherdene , 13 , said when i'm in the countryside , i miss my friends and games i really miss my playstation such is the life of a city slicker turned child jockey in the wilds of mongolia munkherdene and his family , who like most people here go by their given names , are among a growing number of mongolians from the trafficchoked capital , ulan bator , trying to get back to their nomadic roots the boy s father is a successful businessman , importing electronics , bicycles and mining equipment from japan but like many affluent mongolians these days , he also breeds racehorses this summer , i was going to send him to singapore to improve his english , the father , enkhbayar , 49 , said of his son but he decided to stay with me to help with the horses horse racing is becoming an industry across the same central asian steppes where genghis khan and his warrior hordes once galloped the biggest race of the year takes place this weekend 30 miles west of the capital it is part of the annual naadam festival , a gathering that matters more to mongolians than the olympics children as young as 5 ride in races that can be dangerous , with hundreds of horses thundering across the open plain at once , running at speeds of 30 miles per hour or more all told , more than 1 , 800 horses will race over the weekend as the competition intensifies , businessmen are importing larger horses from foreign lands to breed with the small mongolian horses , the prize money is getting heftier and owners are transporting horses to competitions in trucks and trailers rather than riding them other traditions are changing , too horse racing is among what mongolians call the three manly sports \( alongside wrestling and archery \) , but female jockeys have started to appear at its heart , though , horse racing is still as rustic an experience here as drinking fermented mare s milk , and as deeply embedded in the culture munkherdene and enkhbayar spend their summers traveling across the country from race to race , sleeping in the family s richly appointed traditional tent , or ger , one that cost thousands of dollars and elicits approving looks from passersby the best thing is the air , and horse riding , and when it rains , munkherdene said one evening , as a double rainbow arced across the plains following a twilight thunderstorm the family drove out to the electricgreen grasslands of the raceground on tuesday from their apartment in ulan bator for this occasion they set up two gers , one for sleeping and another for cooking their eight racehorses were tethered to posts , brought here by a halfdozen men hired as trainers the family owns more than 100 horses , which they keep in tov , a rural province that surrounds ulan bator the horses graze on property where enkhbayar s grandparents once lived his father , who worked in the capital for a staterun publishing house , took him there during the summers , teaching him to ride and care for the animals now he is doing the same for his son horse owners usually do n't let their sons or daughters race their horses , enkhbayar said but i let my son start racing three years ago it s important to have him inherit the knowledge of horses from me he 'll continue to train horses when a cold wind blows across these plains , as it does even in the summer , enkhbayar puts on a thick brown robe called a del a broad man with a dark , creased face and a wispy goatee , he could play the lead role in a biopic of genghis khan now , there are lots of differences between city and country people , he said for example , my son s classmates want to ride horses in the countryside , but they 've never tried before they 're like foreigners because they do n't understand animals enkhbayar , a father of four , watched as munkherdene jumped off the stallion and hitched it to a post he seems like any 13yearold boy from any world capital last month , he stayed up late to watch matches of the euro 2008 soccer tournament he wears a red manchester united shirt his favorite playstation games are nba street and fifa street munkherdene turned away in disgust one night when a man slaughtered a goat and a sheep outside the family s kitchen ger every teenage boy in the countryside learns how to do this i 've never done it , he said sometimes i even want to beat the man doing it his family is one of dozens that set up gers at midweek here , on the raceground called khui doloon khudag , which means navel of the seven wells some of the families are nomads arriving from hundreds of miles away with simple plastic tents and one or two racehorses others bring dozens of horses and erect elaborate gers larger than a typical manhattan studio apartment \( they take several hours to set up \) by thursday , the place had become the mongolian equivalent of a state fairground there were restaurant gers and souvenir gers and trading gers until the 20th century , horses were in the blood of all mongolians their language has more than 70 words to describe the animals' coloring when a great horse dies , its skull is placed atop a cairn on a mountain , and mongolians make offerings there mongolian horses are short and stubby , but that is exactly what helped genghis khan conquer half the known world his warriors could leap on and off their horses in the middle of battle they also learned to whirl around and shoot arrows while riding away from their enemies my friends always ask me so many questions about horses , munkherdene said i was 8 or 9 when i first rode a horse i was very eager to ride a horse , and if someone did n't let me ride , i 'd cry my father had fast horses , racing horses , and i 'd gallop on them my father would get very angry a racehorse costs anywhere from 300 to more than 80 , 000 , enkhbayar said one of his favorite horses is jiinst , the stallion that munkherdene was riding jiinst s father was a prizewinning stallion , and enkhbayar bought jiinst for breeding purposes when the horse was just 2 years old some businessmen buy larger horses from abroad russia , the arabian peninsula , pakistan , china for breeding purposes we have a belief that stallions and mares , if they 're from far away , they 'll produce fast horses , he said so it does n't matter if horses are from foreign countries but the problem with foreign horses is taking care of them in the winter prize money can be big by mongolian standards the top prize at naadam is 1 , 000 , 000 togrog , or 870 prizes at smaller , more select competitions can be even larger a sport utility vehicle , for instance enkhbayar said his horses had won more than 10 medals half are pinned to a swatch of red cloth he keeps in the ger none were won by his son , however on tuesday night , while munching on sheep organs , enkhbayar was weighing whether to let his son race this weekend had munkherdene grown too heavy \? would he slow the horse down \? the next morning brought more concerns a heavy rainstorm had swept across the plain enkhbayar and his horsemen threw plastic tarpaulins over the eight racehorses if it rains a lot , i worry , he said the horses could catch cold their noses might run the normal training routine is to gallop the horses once a day to make them sweat heavy rains can prevent that , and it had rained seven of the last nine days but by midafternoon , blue sky began peeking through the clouds and enkhbayar had decided that munkherdene would ride in what was likely to be his last chance to race in naadam if i place in the top five , i 'll be so happy , munkherdene said maybe i 'll cry enkhbayar had other hopes next year , he said , his 4yearold son would start learning to ride

ernen , bruno prior , a british entrepreneur , saw the ad from the ernen skilift company one day as he was sipping coffee and looking through the newspaper in london several months later after paying the token sum of one swiss franc , or about 90 cents he is the proud owner of four ski lifts , two trail groomers and a restaurant on 12 miles of ski slopes effectively giving the ski operation away was an act of desperation on the part of ernen , which , like hundreds of other small alpine ski stations at medium altitudes , faces dire times most customers these days prefer the larger resorts with hundreds of miles of ski runs , apr sski activities and luxury shopping as brings less snow , loweraltitude stations rely more on costly snow machines mr prior is our lucky charm , said heinz seiler , who runs the ernen skilift company , sportbahnen erner galen , now owned by mr prior he spared our 560soul village from a catastrophe mr seiler s tiny office looks out on the village square , with its 16thcentury wooden houses smaller ski stations like ours have it much harder , mr seiler said tourism is the only proposition here there is nothing else last ski season , the skilift company lost more than 180 , 000 in march , the need for 14 million more to renew its operating license required every couple of decades was the last straw with rising losses and temperatures , and the snowfall becoming less dependable , the village , the majority owner of the company , decided to shut down the lifts we braced ourselves to lose twothirds of our winter guests , mr seiler said since the boom days of the early 1990s , the number of annual overnight stays in ernen has decreased by almost half , to 90 , 000 last winter in an act of desperation , mr seiler said , the company decided to give away the ski lifts to the person whose idea for resuscitating the resort would provide the most benefit for the village the telephone rang for weeks the village chose mr prior over competing investors from asia , the united states and the netherlands because residents liked his concept for restoring the ski business instead of just selling off the property for vacation homes that might not be used much after spending more than 450 , 000 on the current ski season and a feasibility study , mr prior plans to invest as much as 45 million to build two new lifts and hotels , initially with 300 beds mr prior , whose family business had just sold off a subsidiary when he saw the ad , decided to invest in something fun as a private company we are free to invest into an unfashionable ski resort , he said in a telephone interview we can afford to be patient he hopes that new hotels and modern lifts will draw skiers , and that new , higheraltitude runs will guarantee snow mr prior is not the first foreign investor to answer the call of the mountains the most highprofile case is the egyptian billionaire entrepreneur samih sawiris , who plans to convert a former alpine military base , andermatt , into a grand skiing destination by building an 18hole golf course , 800 apartments , six luxury hotels and lavish leisure facilities the important thing is getting warm beds , said rolf gruber , who runs a restaurant along the road to ernen , meaning with people in them more commonly , investors build chalets to sell as second homes while they generate quick returns for builders , they often end up as cold beds , rarely used by their owners less snow , fewer skiers and cold beds have meant less work for local residents most young people leave ernen , and if past trends continue , it is only a matter of time until the primary school , with one classroom serving 13 children in first through fourth grades , shuts down mr prior will bring new life and work for those who want to live here , and maybe also new children , says ruedi schweizer , whose family is part of a commune that works a small farm , runs a small organicfood store and offers mule trekking for tourists as the village sought to save itself , he said , dozens of local groups proposed alternatives to skiing , like an artificial lake for iceskating , none of which were ever put in place mr schweizer remains torn about the new hotels , which might change the village in ways he would not like but we have no real alternatives , he said the village is dead without its tourists examples of swiss ski resorts facing economic hardship abound this year , three mountain villages in the southern canton , or state , of ticino warded off bankruptcy proceedings after the canton offered interim financing even more exclusive places are not immune a lastminute bridge loan from its parent company allowed the madrisa cablecar company in klosters , a resort known for celebrity visitors like prince charles , to open for the winter but now the company needs 27 million more for snow machines in visperterminen , a tiny threelift ski station 15 miles down the valley from ernen that was on the verge of shutting down , 14 retirees helped keep it open by working without pay to operate the ski lift given this year s early and abundant snowfalls , there is widespread hope that mr prior s first skiing season will encourage him to invest more mr gruber , the chef , hopes to welcome english guests by next season that gives me enough time to translate my menu into english , he said but believe me , i will definitely not offer bread pudding
bangkok the military leaders of seized a shipment of united nations on friday intended for victims of a devastating , declaring that they would accept donations of food and medicine but not the foreign aid workers international groups say are in equally short supply there the ruling junta continued to permit a small number of aid deliveries and promised to allow the first air shipment from the pentagon on monday , a significant concession because the united states has been myanmar s leading critic , imposing sanctions and lobbying for a united nations resolution condemning the nation s generals for human rights violations but the refusal of the country s ironfisted rulers to allow doctors and disaster relief experts to enter in large numbers contributed to the growing concern that starvation and epidemic diseases could end up killing people on the same scale as the winds , waves and flooding that destroyed villages across a wide swath of coastal myanmar nearly a week ago the international red cross estimated friday that the combined efforts of relief agencies and the myanmar government have distributed aid to only 220 , 000 of up to 19 million people left homeless , injured or subject to disease and hunger after the storm there are problems to get the aid inside , and there are problems to get the aid out to the delta area , the danish red cross director , anders ladekarl , told danish broadcaster dr we are simply lacking transportation there are almost no boats and no helicopters this is really a nightmare to make this operation run as foreign aid groups scurried to deliver relief , the generals who run myanmar continued to focus on a separate priority a constitutional referendum scheduled for saturday the junta s plan to go ahead with the vote while restricting aid deliveries drew widespread criticism and concern that soldiers who could be rescuing survivors were likely to be sent to polling places instead it is one of the best examples of the disregard for the people by the military , said josef silverstein an expert on myanmar at rutgers university fourteen years in the making , the constitution is formulated to keep power in the hands of military officers , even if they change to civilian clothes it would guarantee the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament and control of crucial cabinet posts , along with the right to suspend democratic freedoms at any time but while the staterun newspaper urged people on friday to approve the constitution , little help was reaching them to date , myanmar has allowed 11 airborne deliveries of aid , which experts say is a fraction of the relief needed if the scale of the disaster is even close to what the burmese government has claimed much of that has come from the united nations world food program , which said friday that the aid it had delivered and intended to distribute to hardhit regions along the coast had been seized all the food aid and equipment that we managed to get in has been confiscated , said paul risley , a spokesman for the united nations world food program in bangkok after initially saying it would halt deliveries , the agency said later friday that flights would continue saturday while the issue is worked out secretary general ban kimoon urged the myanmar authorities to let aid into the country without hindrance and said the effect of further delay could be truly catastrophic his spokeswoman , marie okabe , said mr ban had been trying for two days without success to get in touch by telephone with than shwe , the junta s senior general we have been told that the phone lines are down , she said myanmar s military junta said in a statement on friday that it was willing to receive disaster relief from the outside world but would distribute supplies itself rather than allowing in relief workers aid agencies want to coordinate and control their own aid already myanmar has turned away one fully loaded flight because the supplies were accompanied by disaster experts and press myanmar is not in a position to receive rescue and information teams from foreign countries at the moment , a foreign ministry statement said but at present myanmar is giving priority to receiving relief aid and distributing them to the stormhit regions with its own resources even so , some agencies and nations were delivering supplies successfully india sent two ships loaded with relief supplies , and the united nations children s fund said it was not meeting problems with its deliveries of aid a spokesman for unicef , christopher de bono , said in an email message that millions of water purification tablets had been delivered thursday , and that although customs clearance could take two days , as far as we know there has been no indication of any problems so far in a telephone call from myanmar , an official of the international red cross , michael annear , said delivery work was proceeding normally in cooperation with other agencies and local businesses doctors without borders , which had been running large hiv and malaria programs in myanmar , has about 80 staff members in the delta region and is sending more in , said frank smithuis , the group s head of mission he said the group was distributing food and medicine from the stores it already had in place in the worstaffected areas , he said , 95 percent of the people had lost their homes and everything they owned , and were in desperate need of food , water and shelter dr smithuis said his group was dispatching teams of six a doctor , a nurse , a medical assistant , two water and sanitation workers and a food distributor who would hire local people to help distribute food the teams are seeing many people injured by the storm who have infected wounds that need to be drained and treated with antibiotics , he said it sounds like we have everything under control , and that s not true , mr smithuis said the area is wide , and there s a lot of people we do n't see other players , we do n't see other help most relief workers on the ground are local people and would be less likely to encounter the suspicion with which authorities view foreigners save the children reported that its staff members in the irrawaddy delta region had come across many rotting bodies where the waters had receded in the pyinkaya area southwest of there , they said , people were dying of hunger and thirst mr risley of the world food program said he had never seen delays like those being encountered in myanmar in indonesia after the tsunami in 2004 , he said , an air bridge of daily flights was established within 48 hours the frustration caused by what appears to be a paperwork delay is unprecedented in modern humanitarian relief efforts , he said it s astonishing he said his agency alone had submitted 10 visa applications for relief workers but that none had been approved before consulates shut down for the weekend we strongly urge the government of myanmar to process these visa applications as quickly as possible , including working over the weekend , he said john holmes , the united nations chief aid coordinator , appealed to countries for 187 million in emergency aid on friday but bettina luescher , a spokeswoman for the world food program , turned aside repeated questions about what had led her agency to make its original decision to suspend relief and then rapidly reverse it all i can say is that at our headquarters in rome , there were discussions going on and it was decided that we should send in those planes tomorrow , she said she said that of the 16 visas for entry into myanmar sought for international staff members , only one had been granted , and it had been requested prior to the storm the white house welcomed the news on friday that myanmar would allow some american aid on monday we hope this is the beginning of major us assistance to the burmese people , said gordon d johndroe , a white house spokesman he added , we are very concerned about the people of burma , and we 're going to keep on working with the government of burma to do what we can to help the people there among the forces the united states could call on is the essex strike group , which was in the region for cobra gold military exercises with thailand the group transferred a dozen transport helicopters to thailand , where they could fly to myanmar in a matter of hours with relief supplies the ships are moving toward waters off myanmar to be available with medical and other relief or reconstruction capabilities on board aboard the ships are amphibious landing craft that can move onto battered shorelines and carry personnel and supplies to remote locations , inaccessible by road we will come , provide assistance , and then leave just like in bangladesh , indonesia , and other places where we have provided assistance , said maj stewart upton of the marine corps , a pentagon spokesman
manchester , nh s defeat of in the iowa caucuses jolted a republican party establishment already distressed about the state of its presidential field but out of the turmoil may rise yet another opportunity for senator of arizona , whose candidacy all but collapsed last year if only by default , mr mccain is getting yet another look and appears to be in a strong position competing against a weakened mr romney in the new hampshire primary on tuesday mr mccain is the latest beneficiary of the continuing upheaval in the republican field that has seen nearly all of the candidates rising at various points among them were mr mccain , former senator of tennessee and , a former mayor of new york mr romney s defeat in iowa only underlined concerns that many republicans had expressed about him , while the success of mr huckabee , a former governor of arkansas , gave rise to new worries among the republican establishment among the intelligentsia of the party , there is definitely a deep concern about huckabee getting the nomination because a lot of them think he ca n't win , said john feehery , a former senior house republican aide and party operative part of it is selfinterested panic since they have their own horses in the race , and none of them are riding huckabee mr mccain , then after a year in which his campaign nearly collapsed , the iraq war and a controversial bill eroded his popularity , and he was forced to continue his candidacy on a barebones budget may be in the right place at the right time and mr mccain was campaigning friday with gusto , attacking mr romney before overflowing crowds at places like a vfw hall in hudson , on issues that included iraq , spending and his own record on security i'm the one with the record , he said i'm the one that s been involved in every national security challenge for the last 20 years mr mccain said that while he was urging the dismissal of defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , mr romney was looking at his shoes mr mccain s schedule was somewhat different than it had been in recent weeks , with only one traditional townhallstyle meeting earlier in the day he popped into a shop in hollis , but the throngs of news media representatives made it difficult to actually do any campaigning , as camera crews banged into shelves and elbowed voters out of earshot it was clear to mr mccain s camp that such events would now be impossible mr mccain does face an obstacle that he has encountered at several other points balancing his effort to run as something of an insurgent with his effort to become the nominee of his party s establishment his difficulties at striking the balance accounted for some of his troubles earlier in the campaign but new hampshire is the state where mr mccain defeated george w bush by 18 points in 2000 the state republican chairman , fergus cullen , said that accounted for why he was in a particularly good position here on the weekend before the primary i believe six months ago , when mccain was going through the darkest days of his campaign , he was still not being ruled out by a lot of voters here mccain stayed in the mix , mr cullen said he has a deep reservoir of good will here that stretches back to 2000 even before the iowa vote , polls suggested that new hampshire voters were embracing mr mccain and his slightly iconoclastic message the way they did in 2000 at the same time , they were moving away from mr romney advisers to mr mccain and mr romney said they believed that mr romney , a former massachusetts governor , was already weakened before iowa and was now even more vulnerable evidence of that could be seen in a furious exchange of attack advertisements between the two men friday complicating mr romney s life even more , mr huckabee s campaign manager , ed rollins , suggested he was entering something of a temporary alliance of interest with mr mccain against mr romney mr rollins said mr huckabee would be using the next several days to present what he said would be an unfavorable comparison of their records as governor we 're going to see if we ca n't take romney out , mr rollins said we like john nobody likes romney mr mccain s advisers said they did not view mr huckabee as a particular threat here mr cullen said that mr huckabee s campaign operation in the state was among the weakest in the field , and that he had not campaigned in the state enough to make a large impact on voters in addition , his record and message is slightly out of step with the antitax sympathies of republicans in new hampshire as for mr giuliani , mr mccain s advisers had once viewed him as a threat since he was competing for many of the same moderate voters but after spending a lot of money here on advertising and making numerous campaign visits , mr giuliani has not been helped in any obvious way mr mccain s bonds with this state have been repeatedly remarked on by the candidate and many of the state s republican leaders , though presumably those bonds are going to get tested in the days ahead but mr mccain may prove to be an elusive target , at least in this state mr romney began seeking on friday night to portray mr mccain as a washington insider , a criticism that seemed to be intended to strip away from him independent voters who were critical to his victory in 2000 \( independent voters here are permitted to vote in either the republican or democratic primary \) several republicans suggested that strategy might be difficult to pull off they are going to try to make him the washington insider , said sara taylor , a former white house political director he spent 10 years as the iconic guy in washington fighting the status quo so that is going to be hard in many ways , mr huckabee s victory and the possibility that he might actually win the nomination may give mr mccain even more maneuvering room among the toptier republican candidates , mr huckabee has the fewest endorsements from members of congress and has stirred some nervousness among washington insiders when you have an unexpected candidate surging to the top in the last three weeks of a campaign , that is telling you that somehow the party does n't know where it needs to go , said pete dupont , a former governor of delaware and republican presidential candidate he is outside the establishment he has won an election without any of their help , and the establishment hates it when that happens
house speaker nancy pelosi is deciding what matters should get priority in the short time left before congress adjourns this month her list must include a vote to hold karl rove in contempt for his lawless decision to defy a congressional subpoena to testify about the united states attorneys scandal there is a vital national interest in getting to the bottom of this matter and in not allowing congress s authority to be undermined it has been nearly two years since congress first began asking questions about the firing of nine united states attorneys , who appear to have been removed for partisan political reasons mr rove may have been directly involved in these possibly illegal firings , but he has not told congress what he knows in defiance of a legally binding subpoena , he refused this summer to appear before the house judiciary committee congress s investigation of the united states attorneys matter is of the utmost importance it now seems clear that the justice department under attorney general alberto gonzales operated as a partisan political actor , using its prosecutorial authority to help the party in power win elections that was a grave abuse , which undermined american democracy there are real victims in this scandal don siegelman , the former governor of alabama , was sentenced to seven years in prison as a result of a prosecution that appears to have been politically motivated mr siegelman is free pending an appeal , but he has already served part of the sentence and could end up returning to prison congress is also pushing to obtain testimony and documents from joshua bolten , the white house chief of staff , and harriet miers , the former white house counsel mr bolten and ms miers have also defied congressional subpoenas the house voted to hold them in contempt in february , and it is fighting in court right now to force them to testify a federal district court judge appointed by president bush ordered them to comply with the subpoenas , but the administration appealed the ruling attorney general michael mukasey is also doing his best to block congress from getting the testimony it is entitled to clearly , the administration s goal is to run out the clock , to get out of town before the subpoenas are enforced the house needs to start pushing just as hard on mr rove the important step is for house speaker nancy pelosi to schedule a vote on holding him in contempt in the next two weeks the house is eager to adjourn the members want to get back to their districts so they can campaign for reelection but it would be a mistake to leave without taking this vote there are many vital principles at stake , but none is more important than the power of congress itself in this era of expanding presidential authority , congress is a critical check on executive branch abuses it cannot perform this function if it allows members of the executive branch to flout its subpoenas and its oversight
jennifer higdon s string poetic , written for the violinist jennifer koh , makes imaginative use of both violin and piano strings on a new disc of the same name , ms koh and the pianist reiko uchida , superb frequent collaborators , vividly explore the varied moods of that work and others by american composers jagged climb , the brash , virtuosic first movement of string poetic , evokes a climber with a carnivorous beast in hot pursuit the adrenaline rush created by the scurrying figures in the violin is heightened by the rhythmic urgency and strange texture of the stopped piano strings \( an eerie sound created when the pianist damps the strings inside the instrument with one hand and plays the keys with the other \) a soulful nocturne brings an end to the chase the stopped strings in the opening of the introspective blue hills of mist create a mystical , gauzy texture , and the violin soars over it maze mechanical is a harmonically vibrant homage to minimalism the finale returns to the opening theme with another frenzied dash the disc also includes mood \( 1918 \) by the seldomperformed carl ruggles this searching , dissonant work posthumously assembled from sketches by the pianist john kirkpatrick after ruggles s death in 1971 traverses mysterious film noir soundscapes the five movements of lou harrison s grand duo \( 1988 \) are inspired by dance forms and 18thcentury models in the prelude rhapsodic violin melodies soar over eighthnote patterns in the piano stampede turns the medieval estampie into an american hoedown with raucous octave piano clusters the disc concludes with john adams s enigmatic road movies \( 1995 \) , which conjures up the dramatic landscapes of a road trip out west forty percent swing , the colorful third movement with hints of bluegrass , features agitated fiddling and is for fourwheel drives only , in mr adams s words when we consider morton feldman these days , we tend to think first of the gigantic works he wrote toward the end of his career extraordinarily beautiful fixations on tiny events and barely perceptible shifts , stretched over static durations of an hour , 90 minutes , even five or six hours hearing one of these pieces is a lifechanging epiphany , but none can be said to provide easy access for the curious newcomer such seekers are urged to consider a new ecm recording of four feldman pieces collectively titled the viola in my life these short , sublime works were composed from august 1970 to march 1971 , when feldman was turning from the indeterminate methods he had favored in the 1950s and '60s to a conventional mode of notating pitches , dynamics and durations every subtle gradation in the cycle is deliberately paced and exactingly controlled the viola its dusky , introverted sound perfectly suited to feldman s ruminations offers fragments of melody in the first two works , while a small ensemble rustles in the background like a light breeze through a window the third piece , for viola and piano , is spare almost to the point of disintegration in the fourth the viola plays its most sustained melodies , while a full orchestra heaves sighs of dreamy restlessness marek konstantynowicz , a polish violist with a background in avantgarde jazz , performs with supreme patience and supple strength the players of the cikada ensemble and the conductor christian eggen are careful , sympathetic collaborators , and ecm s resonant but detailed sound offers an ideal perspective the sole caveat is that at 39 minutes , this is one feldman recording that ends far too soon michael gandolfi s music has some of the rigor of the mid20thcentury atonalists , but it also draws on the richness of melody and timbre prized by the neoromantics you would not put his work firmly in either category , and that s probably for the best , since much of its appeal is in the ease with which it moves between those poles one moment you 're taken with its braininess , its structural logic and textural intricacy the next you 're struck by the flow of fresh ideas , vivid orchestration and rhythmic vitality , all of which give it a visceral punch the three scores included here all played with warmth and precision , and beautifully recorded on the boston modern orchestra project s own label offer a good overview of mr gandolfi s sensibility point of departure \( 1988 \) , an essay on the beauty of angularity , transforms themes couched in the clich s of academic serialism jumpy , zigzagging lines into likable characters within a bracing and sometimes darkhued musical drama mr gandolfi has a great ear for effect the glissandos and arching violin lines in the third movement of point of departure are hard to resist , and they turn up again at the start of themes from a summer night \( 2001 \) , a lightspirited 10movement suite drawn from an incidental score mr gandolfi wrote for a production of shakespeare s midsummer night s dream a few movements are from earlier scores he was on a tight deadline but they work the comic tone painting of bottom brays , from pinocchio s adventures in funland \( 1999 \) , suits shakespeare s story just as well y2k compliant \( 2000 \) , the ephemeral title referring to fears that digital gadgets might stop working at the turn of the century , uses a bustling neoclassicism \( tinged , as always , with sharpedged modernism \) to offer a tongueincheek view of our mechanistic age
excessive baggage track and field athletes are generally lowmaintenance travelers spiked shoes are small running uniforms are slivers of fabric the exception is the one event that requires a 17foot pole , or , more accurately , six or seven of them in a canister as the pole vault coach rick suhr describes it , it looks like a surfacetoair missile this , quite understandably , raises eyebrows everywhere that the polevaulter jenn stuczynski , the american record holder , and suhr , her coach , travel they can catalog a list of problems and adventures caused by her event s unusual equipment i 've hit so many people in the airport with those poles , suhr said i feel so bad i swing around and it s almost like a comedy spoof bags fly , people go down , they get mad only the largest planes can hold the poles , so otherwise simple trips become connectathons , requiring three or four stopovers stuczynski and suhr were once told by the director of the airport in venice that they would never get out with the poles intact other athletes have reported having their poles broken in half by airline employees even on land the poles pose a challenge they are so long they must be strapped to the outside of a car or stick out at least one of its windows rental car agencies are understandably leery of this , so suhr waits around a corner with the poles while stuczynski rents the car we have a picture of our rental car with him standing next to the poles in valencia , spain , stuczynski said it s hilarious it s this little tiny car and the poles are like twice as long diving off the deep end some olympians train in sleek , hightech facilities others train outside in the mountains but half of the 12member united states olympic diving team does much of its work in a former state mental hospital in indianapolis the facility was once a recreation center for psychiatric patients the criminally insane were here , too , said the team s coach , john wingfield , pointing to the bars on the windows central state hospital opened in 1848 as indiana s first psychiatric hospital and closed in 1994 the divers have been occupying it since 2000 the nondescript building is on a desolate plot in the western part of the city , sharing land with a mounted police unit , a medical history museum , a disaster services loading dock and a row of sheds with blownout windows and tumbledown walls downstairs , the platform specialists david boudia , above , and thomas finchum and four other olympians performed 250 repetitions of their dives every day , aided by pulleys , harnesses , trampolines , springboards , foam pits and an array of hightech devices and cameras that measure force , acceleration and muscle activity the facility , which became an official national training center in 2005 , was wellsuited for dryland training because of its high ceilings , 24hour access and proximity to the pool at indiana universitypurdue university indianapolis boudia and finchum have trained there for most of their careers they said they had heard stories about the place being haunted we are n't scared , but we do n't get to explore much , finchum said the facility has five miles of tunnels , and wingfield has been in them at night to work on electrical equipment it s creepy , he said there have been times when my hair stood up whether it was a cat or a raccoon or paranormal things i 've been startled soon , however , the divers will have to find a new place to train the team must be out by october , so the old asylum can be razed and redeveloped last i heard , it will be a grocery store , wingfield said we could have had shinkicking get ready to hear the name pierre de coubertin more than a few times during the games he is the frenchman credited for organizing the first modern olympic games , held in 1896 in athens as a revival of the ancient contests his creation , the international olympic committee , still governs the games and it is because of coubertin that the olympics are in a different city every four years , with athletes from around the world competing , often in contests derived from the greek games but perhaps robert dover deserves some of the credit for the modern olympics almost three centuries before coubertin s games , dover held an olimpicks every year in the english countryside competitors and revelers gathered near cotswold at a giant tent castle that dover erected he gave out yellow ribbons to the victors in sports like stag hunting if dover s games in the early 1600s had shaped the modern olympics , michael phelps might be preparing for the shinkicking competition , and viewers could watch hounds chasing a hare the opening ceremony would probably look more like a renaissance festival the english civil war ended dover s annual olympics later efforts to revive them , including a festival held earlier this year , have remained regional affairs we might not even know about this forgotten olympic revival were it not for a book of poems published in 1636 to celebrate dover as the noble restorer of th' olimpick game jade the new gold here s a first china will be presenting olympic medals , left , that are made partly with the nonmetal material jade some may consider this merely a cosmetic adornment , but jade has significant meaning in chinese culture the use of jade flourishes in chinese history for important artistic and ceremonial objects , and comparisons to jade abound in chinese literature , as when confucius likened human virtues to qualities of jade tae kwon do operative kevin padilla is usa taekwondo s chief spy it s like i'm 007 , he said it s like i'm doing this in stealth mode officially , padilla is the organization s coaching director he also runs a tae kwon do studio in hoboken , nj unofficially , he is usa taekwondo s head scout , traveling to places like vietnam , colombia and turkey to watch the united states team s potential opponents at the beijing olympics traveling alone to tournaments with two video cameras , padilla sets up his tripods , inspects the pool sheets and settles in he takes notice of obvious aspects , like kicking techniques and defensive tactics , but also analyzes more obscure features , like an athlete s posture if this was baseball , i 'd be trying to figure out how to pitch to a guy who hits curveballs really , really well , padilla said the results of the surveillance end up on detailed reports that padilla , after observing a competitor several times live and dozens more on tape , files to the coaching staff together , they develop profiles and , in turn , strategies that guide the team s athletes during training and competition the 44yearold padilla , a former member of the united states team , prides himself on his quick and prolific recall but if he forgets something , he can review the footage , which is logged with software that tags techniques anytime we need to look at anyone , and there are hundreds of them , we have a library at our fingertips , padilla said i'm not going to be coming up for air until the games getting up to speed , and staying there what does it take to be an olympiccaliber sprinter , capable of winning a race of 100 , 200 or 400 meters \? those who run the best , it turns out , are those who slow down the least toward the end of the race that , says jose gonzalezalonso , director of the center for sports medicine and human performance at brunel university in britain , is what he concluded after studying the velocity profiles of athletes in races of 100 to 400 meters , runners accelerate and reach their top speeds by about 60 meters then , for unknown reasons , they slow down , perhaps because of fatigue there is an element of endurance even in 100 meters , gonzalezalonzo said that is different from what happens in a 60meter race , he added there , the winner is the one who accelerates the fastest and can reach a maximum speed before the race is over and that is why , he said , the best 60meter runners are not necessarily the best in 100meter races many americans' athletic footwear also serves as their everyday shoes for many olympians , that would be unthinkable weight lifters' shoes , for example , are designed for maximum stability , so they have wooden soles that do not compress when lifters hoist twice their body weight because the wood is wedgeshaped , it also acts as a heel lift to make squatting easier the 2000 olympic bronze medalist cheryl haworth said the wooden soles were cool because it makes tons of noise when you slap your foot on the platform , but it s horrible to stand in for any length of time she added , it s like standing on concrete because it s very specific to its use pistol shooters must stand perfectly still , so the bottoms of their shoes are slightly concave throughout the entire foot it s subtle , said dave johnson , the united states national shooting coach but when you stand on it , your body weight flattens it almost all the way to the ground , to provide an anchor but if a pistol shooter s shoe were to cover the ankle bone , the international shooting sport federation would consider it as providing too much stability therefore , high tops are prohibited and shoe height is checked rowers' shoes are bolted to the boat they are sometimes the wrong size because they come with the racing shell they are tied to each other with a big pull cord and they have a heel tie that is linked to the bottom of the boat it all sounds quite confining , but all it takes is a yank of the cord between the left and right shoe , or a rower s body weight to pull the heel tie and release it from the footwear if the boat capsizes even underwater , you never take your shoes with you , said portia mcgee , who will compete in pairs in beijing p e fencers , because of their unique stance , have footwear designed for handedness , so their left shoe and right shoe are different righthanders , like the modern pentathlete eli bremer , have much more padding on their right heel because the right foot always leads and lunges on the exterior of the trailing shoe , bremer s left , is a leather pad along the inside of the foot , allowing it to slide perpendicular to his front foot without abrading fencing is just one of five events in the modern pentathlon , so bremer \( when not contesting the discipline s swimming portion \) also requires pistol shoes , racing flats for running and equestrian boots all of which caused his motherinlaw to remark recently that he had twice as many shoes as his wife ah , but which ones to wear to dinner \? the key outside the key the roster for the united states men s basketball team includes onename stars like lebron , kobe and carmelo but one of the most important players may be the most anonymous milwaukee bucks guard michael redd is the only player on the roster without international experience , a sign of his relatively modest stature in basketball circles but he comes to the team as a critical role player , someone who may fill two weaknesses exposed in its loss to greece in the semifinals of the 2006 world championships in japan redd , right , is what the assistant coach jim boeheim calls a specialty player he will be the team s designated shooter and zone buster \( the united states shot 9 of 28 from 3point range in that loss to greece \) redd could also help the americans play from behind , something they were not successful at in recent stints on a poor bucks team , redd averaged 227 points last season he has made nearly 39 percent of his shots from 3point range in his career he knows who he is , boeheim said and after some embarrassing international losses for the united states , redd could help the squad rediscover its identity and a gold medal a wellworn tradition after their final match , retiring wrestlers who left everything on the mat leave their shoes behind as well this is wrestling s symbolic sendoff just ask rulon gardner the sport s most famous amateur left his sneakers white asics , size 13 on the mat after winning a grecoroman bronze medal at the 2004 athens games , below an image from that scene won time magazine s picture of the year gardner later sold the shoes on ebay this thrust gardner s feet and footwear into the spotlight , up there with those of abebe bikila , who won the olympic marathon barefoot in 1960 and wearing sneakers in 1964 and michael johnson , the track star who famously wore gold shoes in 1996 wrestlers struggle to pinpoint when the tradition started it works like this after their final match , wrestlers remove their tightly tied shoes , place them in the center of the mat , then put the handkerchief they carry to matches over the shoes the grecoroman wrestler lindsey durlacher left his shoes behind following an olympic qualifying loss in june he said he would place them on his award shelf , next to the trophies and medals from his career it signifies you left it all out there , durlacher said you gave your heart and soul , and now you 're done it s not an easy thing to do , but as a wrestler , it s just what you do covering all the bases august is the rainiest month of the year in beijing , which has posed an interesting set of problems and solutions for that most outdoor of olympic sports , baseball , and the man appointed to supervise the temporary stadium , murray cook he cannot control the weather , but cook , the international baseball federation s field consultant and an expert in turf management , has spent the last two years safeguarding against potentially unplayable conditions at the wukesong baseball fields beneath the riviera bermuda grass , cook put in a sandandpeat base that , he said , helps the field drain quicker under that is a layer of gravel , then drain lines situated 25 feet apart that empty into a trench ringing the field in one of his first visits , he noticed that the locally made tarps were flimsy , so they were replaced his colleagues have also worked with chinese meteorological services to upgrade their radars so that storms , as at baseball stadiums in the united states , can be tracked as they approach of course , we planned like this for athens and it did n't rain a drop over there , said cook , referring to the 2004 summer olympics better to be prepared teams of every type there will be 14 team events contested in the games china , which qualifies automatically as the host , is the only country that will participate in all of them the united states came close though , qualifying for 11 events , missing out on only men s field hockey and men s and women s team handball , events virtually unknown stateside australia is entered in eight events , and its neighbor new zealand will enter five both were helped by easy qualifying routes in the oceania zone new zealand beat fiji , 11831 , to qualify for women s basketball and defeated papua new guinea , 390 , in men s field hockey twentyfive european nations will contest team events , led by germany with eight and russia with seven other regional leaders are south korea and japan , with seven events , and brazil , also with seven as the host , greece got to enter every event four years ago , and britain may do the same in 2012 competing equally in qualifications this year , they did not fare as well greece will play only men s and women s basketball and women s water polo , and britain just the two field hockey tournaments running like the wind when there is none tyson gay ran 100 meters faster than anyone in recorded history on june 29 , with a time of 968 seconds but that did not count as a world record because gay had a stiff tailwind of 41 meters per second the maximum allowable tailwind for a world record is 2 meters per second but suppose gay had run that fast with no wind and suppose that the worldrecord holder , usain bolt of jamaica , had set his mark with no tailwind who would be faster \? bolt , with a time of 972 seconds , had a tailwind of 17 meters per second when he ran in may the tailwind tables , based on work by nicholas p linthorne , a biomechanics researcher at brunel university in britain , give an answer gay s tailwind gave him a 018ofasecond advantage bolt s gave him a 009ofasecond advantage so gay would have had a 986 time with no tailwind bolt s time would have been 981 after the applause , cheers when the international community descends on china for the olympics , perhaps a toast to the games will be in order for fans roaming the streets of beijing , the question of what to drink may be a difficult one how about a shot of maotai \? frequently described as fiery and potent in flavor , maotai is perhaps the most famous brand of liquor in china it is a rice liquor distilled from fermented sorghum , formulated in the qing dynasty \( 16441911 \) in the town of maotai , in guizhou province in southwestern china maotai has long been considered the liquor of choice for official state banquets and occasions its fame was etched in history by president richard m nixon during his groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 while making a toast , nixon took a sip of maotai and produced a most curious facial expression a severe cringe one that is often repeated by many firsttimers in the spirit of the beijing olympics' official slogan , one world , one dream , international visitors , if brave enough , can try maotai and cringe what travels faster than a eurostar train , reaches speeds worthy of the guinness book of world records and is batted back and forth with rackets \? badminton s shuttlecock is widely recognized as the fastest projectile in racket sports there are entire web sites devoted to the speed of the shuttlecock , which is made from sticking 16 goose feathers into a piece of cork the cone shape allows for aerodynamic flexibility , so much so that it is said to have influenced the design of spacecrafts this flexibility is different from balls in other racket sports the feathers create a drag , meaning the shuttlecock speeds up and slows down faster than , say , a tennis ball estimates place the shuttlecock s speed at

paramus , nj many of history s best golfers have slashed divots out of the ridgewood country club s fairways , from walter hagen , gene sarazen and craig wood to jack nicklaus , arnold palmer , lee trevino , tom watson and gary player but the most memorable shot at the club did not occur on the course as a rookie assistant pro at ridgewood in 1935 , byron nelson was developing a reputation for hitting the straightest shots \( in 1945 , nelson won a record 11 consecutive pga tour events and a record 18 over all \) one day several caddies put together their nickels for a depressionera pot of 55 cents and bet nelson that , given three balls on the slate deck outside the pro shop , he could not hit the tall metal flagpole beyond the practice putting green , about 93 yards away i used my 3iron , nelson often recalled my first shot missed , but i gripped down and hit a draw and , sweet as you please , got the pole dead center the caddies stared , their mouths open i picked up my 55 cents , gave them a little smile and walked away a small plaque on that deck now commemorates nelson s shot and before the barclay s tournament opens the fedex cup playoffs at ridgewood on thursday , the pga tour ought to put up a 55cent prize to see if any of its millionaire pros , given only two balls because that s all nelson needed , could hit the flagpole from the slate deck ridgewood s oldest caddie , 89yearold harry lake , of nearby wyckoff , nj , who still loops six days a week , did n't see nelson s shot , but when he arrived there in 1954 as a retired susquehanna western railroad conductor , he remembered older caddies vouching for it i do n't think any of 'em saw it , he said they just heard about it like i did nelson s legacy has endured at ridgewood along with the 1935 united states ryder cup team s victory , jerry pate s triumph in the 1974 united states amateur , kathy whitworth winning the 1981 cocacola classic , trevino edging nicklaus at the 1990 united states senior open and watson s triumph in the 2001 senior pga championship  according to bill quirin s soontobepublished club history , ridgewood began in 1890 in nearby hohokus as a sixhole course , later expanded to nine it moved to two 18hole locations in ridgewood , at maple avenue in 1901 \( men s annual dues 10 , women s 5 , with 25cent green fees \) , and at lincoln avenue in 1912 , before settling in paramus in 1929 donald ross , the renowned golfcourse architect of his time , had visited the lincoln avenue site in 1914 but did n't consider the land suitable for a quality course the legendary a w tillinghast disagreed after inspecting the future 220acre paramus property in 1927 he knew he could create a rival to his classic courses at winged foot , baltusrol and quaker ridge the mastery of all shots is demanded , tillinghast told the members , without placing undue importance on any the 27hole layout , with an east , center and west nine , and its gracious frenchchateau clubhouse designed by clifford c wendelhack , opened in 1929 the club pro was the energetic george jacobus , hired in 1914 when he was only 16 , the first americanborn pro and the first former caddie to be a president of the pga of america , from 1932 to 1939 at the 1935 , jacobus hired the 22yearold nelson , who tied for ninth to earn 136 , as an assistant pro , with a 400 salary for the season , plus half of his lesson fees in the fifth ryder cup matches at ridgewood later that year , nelson watched the americans' 93 victory and vowed to be on the 1937 team he was , helping it to an 84 triumph in southport , england  while at ridgewood , nelson , a tall and slim texan , won the new jersey open in 1935 , and the then more prestigious met open in 1936 before dominating the pga tour for a decade on the ridgewood range , he perfected the mechanics of his world golf hall of fame swing that , as he said , required no thought he added it s like eating you do n't think to feed yourself although ridgewood never had a pga tour event until now , it has had prominent winners in the 1974 amateur , pate won in a 2and1 final over curtis strange in the 1990 senior open , trevino was 13 under par , nipping nicklaus by 2 in the 2001 senior pga , watson was 14 under you have to hit it right to left off the tee , and high in the air to those small greens , trevino said that s the way they built these old golf courses right to left , tall trees and small greens god , this one is beautiful but for all the memorable winning shots at ridgewood , where towering trees frame every fairway , none has persisted like byron nelson s 55cent 3iron off the flagpole from the slate deck outside the pro shop
as the came to bat in the eighth inning , leading by three runs , the silhouettes in the mets' bullpen remained still , slouching on a bench and leaning against the fence there would be no questions about which member of the closer committee would grapple with the ninth inning or just how many of them it would take with 97 pitches under his belt , there would be only mike pelfrey he emerged in the ninth to finish what he started , a 63 victory over the on wednesday night that kept the mets a game and a half ahead of the phillies atop the national league east mike has evolved into one of the bright young pitching stars of the national league , there s no question about it , manager said and i think he 'll continue to mature , develop , with each outing four months ago , a complete game from pelfrey , the raw , erratic fastball pitcher , seemed unlikely but the transformation he has undergone this season has obscured his 26 start he is 102 in his last 13 outings from where he came earlier in the season , when we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff , to keep him in the rotation , he s pretty much been a huge part of the success we 've had here , manuel said pelfrey \( 128 \) did not allow a base runner in the seventh or eighth , and he began the ninth by striking out chipper jones and inducing a flyout from brian mccann the chants of pelfrey ! pelfrey ! rose during a shea stadium standing ovation as he faced mark kotsay i noticed it , pelfrey said it was pretty cool on his 108th pitch , pelfrey drew a flyout from kotsay to end the game in 2 hours 8 minutes pelfrey allowed three hits and three walks , and struck out three , in his first career complete game in my first two years in the minor leagues and with the mets , i think i completed the seventh inning one time , pelfrey said something i wanted to do was be more efficient coming into the year and try to last longer in games so everybody would n't call me five and dive as efficient as he is , the number of innings he has pitched this season continues to climb higher than ever before the complete game gave pelfrey 154 innings pitched this year , far exceeding the 94 he threw in his first two seasons combined manuel said before the game that it was a number he must keep an eye on at the same time , a starter who goes deep may be the best remedy for manuel s bullpen headaches wednesday night was the second time in a week that he sent out his starter to finish the game johan santana went all nine in sunday s victory when they get us in the eighth inning , they give our bullpen smaller tasks , so to speak , manuel said one hitter here , one hitter there , that type of thing pelfrey s most nervous moment of the night came in the sixth , when his two walks loaded the bases with none out so the pitching coach dan warthen strolled to the mound to settle him dan came out and he said we 'd trade a run for two outs right there , catcher brian schneider said that s exactly what he did got a groundball double play that s huge that run made the score 62 , and another run scored on pelfrey s wild pitch in the bullpen , brian stokes and scott schoeneweis were preparing to take over but by the seventh , pelfrey had reclaimed the mound to work a quick three outs it reminded him of one of the most important lessons he has learned this year i do n't need to be perfect , he said i can make a mistake and get away with it on wednesday , he could also afford to make a mistake thanks to another explosive first inning from the mets' offense there were two outs when braves starter jair jurrjens issued consecutive walks to carlos delgado and carlos beltr n to load the bases the rookie daniel murphy singled to center field to score argenis reyes and delgado beltr n and murphy scored when third baseman chipper jones mishandled fernando tatis s grounder and threw wide of first base pelfrey added the final blow with a single that scored tatis the mets have now scored 104 runs in the first innings of games , 15 more than baseball s most productive offensive team , the texas rangers the braves pulled one back in the third on gregor blanco s runscoring single , but david wright canceled out the run in the fifth by smashing his 24th home run 375 feet into the leftfield bleachers inside pitch the mets signed reliever al reyes to a minor league contract reyes , a 38yearold righthander , was 22 with a 437 earned run average in 26 games for the tampa bay rays this season the mets completed their trade for luis ayala by sending anderson hern ndez to the washington nationals as the player to be named luis castillo , who has been on the disabled list since july 3 with a strained hip flexor , has run out of rehabilitation games after playing for class aa binghamton on wednesday night the mets can now either call him up or send him to port st lucie to play in simulated games ryan church , who has been recovering from postconcussion syndrome and migraines since may , moved from class aaa new orleans to binghamton to stay close to home while he completes his rehabilitation assignment

securities firm disclosed that during its fourth quarter , it reclassified about 7 billion in assets to what is known in accounting circles as level 3 status level 3 assets are items on a balance sheet whose value on a given day is more or less a big , fat question mark or , to put it more scientifically , whose valuation is based on inputs that are unknowable the fourthquarter move does n't necessarily mean that these assets have declined in value the firm has n't taken a charge because of the accounting change but it does mean that morgan stanley felt a lot less confident than it did

first thing every morning , lynn pitet , of cody , wyo , checks her computer to see whether her mother , helen trost , has gotten out of bed , taken her medication and whether she is moving around inside her house hundreds of miles away in minnesota last summer , mrs trost s husband had a stroke and died , but she wanted to stay in the house , in mankato , where she had lived for 36 years she did not want a livein helper , and she cannot drive at 88 , mrs trost has and takes medications for , and  she s a feisty gal , mrs pitet said of her mother she is fine when she takes her medicines , but , even so , i was terrified of leaving her alone mrs pitet and her sister decided to become part of a small but growing number of people who have installed motion sensors and a remote monitoring system to keep aging relatives safe sensors attached to the wall are able to register when mrs trost gets out of bed and whether she stops at her medication dispenser , and to alert her daughters to any deviations from her routine that might indicate an accident or illness the family is updated by electronic report every morning monitoring systems like these , which go far beyond the emergency response buttons that have been around for years , are not found in many homes yet privacy is an issue for some older people , and the basic package can range from 50 up to 85 a month for the motion sensors and remote monitoring system like mrs trost uses more comprehensive packages can include devices to track , weight or respiration experts on aging say the systems will become commonplace as the 76 million baby boomers approach ages when disabilities or conditions like and failing jeopardize the ability to live independently the population of those 65 years and older is almost 40 million today , and the federal census bureau says that will more than double , to nearly 87 million , by midcentury right now , there is little federal health care reimbursement for such devices and private insurance coverage is evolving because the area is new , said dr jeremy nobel , a professor at the harvard school of public health who cowrote a study on the feasibility of such technologies we are at the beginning stages regarding the availability of such services and before business models are developed , said dr nobel , a medical doctor i expect we 'll see a significant increase in the adoption of such systems in two to five years , and widespread adoption in 10 years the coming wave of aging americans threatens to swamp the existing stock of retirement communities , assisted living and nursing home facilities making it impossible to accommodate everyone who will need , or might want , more structured care experts on aging say motion sensors and other hightech devices will help cover the shortfall , allowing older people to live independently for longer the growing number of sufferers , which is expected to more than triple from the current four million by 2050 , may also spur wider adoption of technologies like motion sensors to alert others to deviations in routine , trackers to assure medications are taken and emergency response buttons technology systems to underpin living independently , or what some call aging in place , are still years from being rolled out in a big way , awaiting adequate financing for research and other incentives , like coverage by insurance companies , according to mr nobel s study , which was released in march by the center for aging services technologies , a program of the american association of homes and services for the aging but projects are under way around the country to test hightech gadgets for home use , including wireless sensors and devices to regulate temperature , lights and appliances , and sophisticated medical monitors and some care providers have begun to equip clients with devices that fit their needs newcourtland elder services , a care provider for some 2 , 000 people in philadelphia , started a yearlong pilot in 2006 that equipped 33 patients living on their own with remote sensors that tracked changes in their health or living patterns that required early medical intervention , said kim brooks , the vice president for housing and services at newcourtland one of the patients is cleora coley , 77 , a retired pharmacy technician , who is in a wheelchair after losing a leg to diabetes two years ago , ms coley moved to a living complex for the elderly because she could not maneuver the stairs in her family home in her apartment , she checks her blood pressure with a cuff that automatically sends the reading to a monitoring center , which notifies her and her doctor of any change sensors placed in each room keep track of her movements , and she has a button to summon assistance , which she used in april when she fell i'm alone but i know i'm not all by myself , mrs coley said , adding , and i really like my independence newcourtland is starting a trial in cooperation with companies and home health agencies , installing medical monitoring devices in 1 , 000 residences over the next six months one major roadblock for wider adoption of inhome monitoring has been concern that older people , unused to everyday technologies like the internet , would resist their use that was true for mrs trost , who said she was apprehensive about having electronic gadgets around but said she had found that they are really no bother a survey by aarp found that older people were willing to use hightech devices at home , and to pay about 50 a month the privacy issue made john t fowlkes , 86 , of raleigh , nc , hesitate last year when his children wanted to install a motion sensor system what convinced me was that there are no cameras , said mr fowlkes , a retired postal service distribution clerk who lives by himself in an apartment building for retired people i get peace of mind , but no one is looking at me some exploration into future technologies is being financed by the national institute on aging , part of the national institutes of health , which has been giving grants to entrepreneurs to develop devices like a video data collection system to analyze an elderly person s activity level but most research dollars have come from private companies like intel corporation intel researchers are developing devices like a memory bracelet that vibrates at a specified time to remind the wearer of a doctor s appointment or to take medication also in trials are sensorinfused carpets eric dishman , intel s director of product research , calls them magic carpets and wearable sensors , which would measure changes in gait , to help avoid falls intel invested 3 million with the oregon center for aging and technology , which runs what it calls a living laboratory , with 225 volunteers the project , which also received 7 million from the federal aging institute , uses sensors on walls , doorways and appliances and computer games to detect cognitive decline there is going to be a major transformation in health care because of these technologies , said dr jeffrey kaye , director of the center , at the oregon health and science university in portland , who oversees the project it s more a question of when rather than whether recognizing the commercial potential of technologies for the aging , dozens of companies , including ge healthcare , ibm and medtronic , two years ago formed the continua health alliance to develop products to aid older people despite the projects , trials and commercial interest , mr dishman said the united states was missing in action in aging technologies , compared with europe there just has n't been enough research and development yet to prove these technologies work , he said none of us wants to put a bunch of technology in homes of frail elders unless it does he said the european union had committed 15 billion to developing independentliving technologies last year , intel partnered with

he asked incredulously the admissions process has never been easy in elite indian schools once , private school admissions were based on an opaque mix of connections , money and preferences for certain kinds of families for certain kinds of schools today , as a result of litigation , courtmandated rules in delhi have been devised to make the process fairer and more transparent , at least on paper schools are allowed to set their own admissions criteria , but those must be made clear to parents and followed consistently many schools this year have created a point system that rewards girls , students with older siblings in the same school , children of alumni and , to encourage neighborhood schooling , those who live nearby over the past few weeks , it was hard to find parents who were not complaining about the new rules sridhar and noopur kannan , seeking admission to the delhi public school for their 4yearold son , found it absurd that girls were being rewarded , even as they counted their one enviable blessing mr kannan was an alumnus of the school , and a member of the screening committee remembered him as a good student rumana akhtar s alma mater , where her daughter would have had an edge , was impractical because it was far across town from where she lives alok aggarwal s efforts to ply his connections had done nothing to secure a seat for his 4yearold son ashok gupta rued his own lack of connections , but had set aside more than 2 , 500 in case a donation would open doors many parents said that despite the new criteria , some schools continued to make exceptions in exchange for contributions to school funds the pressures can be felt on the other side of the door as well this year , suman nath , principal of tagore international school , in a crowded middleclass neighborhood , received 2 , 014 applications for 112 prekindergarten seats the other day , she said , a tailor who stitches clothes for her family came to appeal on behalf of her child government ministers called to lobby on behalf of certain children a director at another school recalled receiving a phone call from the electricity board , threatening to cut off her school s power if a certain child was not admitted the one change that many parents and school administrators have welcomed is that children are no longer subjected to interviews for admissions at least now , mrs nath said , children are n't experiencing rejection that brought little comfort last friday afternoon , when tagore international posted its list of children selected for admission parents elbowed their way through a thick crowd to have a look at the list most came away looking bereft they need to open a new school for children who have n't gotten in anywhere , said sarika chetwani , 28 , who had applied unsuccessfully to 12 schools for her 4yearold daughter i'm totally messed up i do n't know what to do next shailaja sharma , 26 , said her only hope was to find an influential someone to ply another influential someone with money mandira dev sengupta , carrying her 3yearoldson son , rio , in her arms , bit her lip and fought back tears after 17 applications , rio had been admitted to only one school , and it was not one that she particularly liked this week , even before the nursery school race was over , another race had begun twelfth graders across india braced for final examinations , which determine whether students will get coveted university seats , and where on monday , the hindustan times published tips for parents of exam takers do not nag your child , was one remember , he is not a machine that can study for four to five hours at a stretch , was another
the entered wednesday night s game at madison square garden having to explain how they were one victory from their best start in franchise history they had hardly overpowered opponents their top line chris drury , scott gomez and markus naslund had struggled their bigname acquisitions had not put a stamp on the team even coach tom renney suspected the rangers had stolen a few victories yet 50 they were i'm not giving any points back , renney said with a shrug but the blazing start came to a crashing halt against buffalo , and the 31 loss seemed to lay out their weaknesses for all to see we knew we could do a lot better , even though we won the first five games , naslund said we have not played our best it s important for us not to fool ourselves i think it was a reality check for us tonight the reality check did not end with the first line the defense left goalie henrik lundqvist vulnerable , and lundqvist left a few ugly rebounds for buffalo to score on he made only 16 saves still , the first line remains the team s biggest concern renney moved drury from his usual position at center to play right wing with gomez , his best playmaker , and naslund at left wing naslund is trying to fit in with a new team after 12 seasons in vancouver while he attempts to rediscover an elusive scoring touch after a promising start in the first two games , against tampa bay in prague , the line has regressed in prague we created chances by coming up together and having lots of options with passes , naslund said now it seems like we 're attacking one at a time and it does n't seem like we can get any sustained pressure we do n't have the puck enough we 're chasing the puck more than we should none of them had scored since returning home and they sat frozen at two goals and seven assists as a unit until gomez scored in the first period against buffalo but he was not on the ice with drury or naslund in the midst of a line change , gomez skated up ice , left a pass behind him for defenseman michal rozsival , then tipped rozsival s shot into the net that was the rangers' only highlight the had powerplay goals from ales kotalik and thomas vanek , and vanek scored a shorthanded goal in the third drury had failed to cover vanek on the rush and defenseman wade redden another offseason acquisition finding his way watched the rush go right by him even before the loss , renney was discussing his first line s woes he said he still believed in them as a combination all three , after all , are team leaders drury is the captain and gomez and naslund are alternate captains we 've all gone through it before , gomez said we know the potential we 've seen it for whatever reason , i think we 're just pressing too hard the team s been winning and we 've been doing all right , but we 've got to pick it up now i still like the makeup of the line and hopefully we 'll stick together after wednesday , they no longer have an undefeated record to hide behind slap shots last season , buffalo forward patrick kaleta flew across the ice and hit rangers defenseman paul mara high , a hit that broke bones in mara s face and ended his season that was why mara began pummeling kaleta after another high hit in this game kaleta refused to fight back , so mara earned a fiveminute major and a game misconduct mara said kaleta asked him how his face was you do n't want to hurt guys in this league and to have him say something like that , it s classless , mara said i will always remember that i did what i had to do and it s over now buffalo ended the rangers' perfect penaltykilling streak the rangers had not been scored on in their first 23 shorthanded situations

on a summer day in 1958 , jack curran sat in a massachusetts diner sipping coffee and flipping through the pages of a newspaper i was living in west springfield at the time , selling building materials for a living , curran recalled last week i read in the paper that lou carnesecca , the head basketball and baseball coach at archbishop molloy , was leaving for st john s i thought , hey , i know the area and i like coaching and working with young kids , maybe i should look into it curran got the job , and for the past halfcentury , he has not had to look for another still strolling the sideline at 77 , he has won more basketball and baseball games 2 , 491 than any high school coach in the united states he s won everything except world war iii , carnesecca said in a telephone interview this week no one in the country has jack s record in both sports , no one and along the way , he has become more than just a great coach , he has become one of the great treasures of new york city on friday , after archbishop molloy s basketball game against visiting st francis prep , curran will be honored for his 50 years of service to the school entering the game , he is three victories shy of 900 for his career he needs 6 in baseball to reach 1 , 600 throughout the changing seasons , curran has become as much a fixture in queens as the mets , the lemon ice king of corona and the world s fair unisphere as a human being , he s probably one of the greatest around , said kevin joyce , who played for curran at archbishop molloy joyce later played for the indiana pacers of the american basketball association and is now an institutional sales trader in new york as far as coaching goes , i always measured every coach i had after high school against coach curran , and none of them ever measured up since arriving at archbishop molloy , a perennial power in the catholic high school athletic association s aa division , curran has compiled a twosport record of 2 , 491826 , including tuesday night s 6665 overtime victory at xaverian of brooklyn he has won 5 city championships in basketball and 17 in baseball and while no other new york city coach has ever won a title in both sports in the same year , curran has done it four times in 1969 , '73 , '74 and '87 he has been inducted into nine halls of fame , including the national high school athletic coaches association hall of fame and the new york city basketball hall of fame after friday s ceremony , a reception will be attended by alumni and some of the players curran has coached a list that includes joyce , brian winters , kenny anderson , robert werdann and kenny smith , all former nba players jack meant the world to me as a player , said smith , who played at north carolina , won two championships with the houston rockets and is now a color analyst for the msg network there was nothing i learned later on as a college or pro player that he had not already exposed to me his respect as a coach is unparalleled i love him curran , who never married , said that an event like the one friday night provides an opportunity to see a lot of my kids that i have n't seen in a while he added over the years , i 've gotten so many nice letters from young men who went on to better things and not just the guys who went on to play in the pros , but other guys who were just as successful in their chosen fields in recent months , many of those letters have offered words of encouragement for curran , who had surgery in the fall to remove a cancerous tumor from his chin everything turned out pretty good , curran said i have n't had anything major go wrong with me since in the early 1950s , curran s chosen field was shaped like a diamond he grew up in the bronx and became a basketball and baseball star at all hallows high school before moving on to pitch at st john s , where he was carnesecca s teammate a 6foot3 righthander who said he had a fairly good fastball , good curveball and good changeup , curran was signed by the brooklyn dodgers in 1952 after graduating from st john s the dodgers gave me a 1 , 500 signing bonus and paid me 300 a month for that season , curran said by 1954 , curran was in the philadelphia phillies' farm system he was pitching in the provincial league on a rainy night in troisrivi res , quebec , when he fractured vertebrae in his back , shattering any hopes for a shot at a bigleague career the next year , he was out of baseball and looking for work he took a job as a recreation director for rye , ny , and then as a salesman at spalding before moving to west springfield to sell building materials fifty years later , curran is still in the business of building i 've been told that the true measure of a coach is the quality of the people he has turned out long after they have left him , he said in that regard , i think i measure up pretty good
when you speak thousands upon thousands of words in public each day , some of them are bound to come out a bit twisted from time to time especially during the grueling , sleepless , whatstatearewein final days of a presidential campaign most of the time they are not so much gaffes as odd verbal hiccups so there was senator john mccain , the republican presidential nominee , on sunday in wallingford , pa , offering up a novel description of with his observation that keeping taxes low creates jobs , keeps money in your pants and strengthens our economy and senator joseph r biden jr in melbourne , fla , on tuesday , mangling the name of the republican vicepresidential nominee as sarah mccain , and making each day seem extraordinarily long when he said there were seven more weeks until the election time often an elastic concept on the trail also tripped up his republican counterpart , gov sarah palin , who may be hoping that none of her supporters in canton , ohio , wait until wednesday to vote on a campaign stop there sunday ms palin told them , now with just three days from the election , the time for choosing is near two hours later in marietta , she corrected herself we are just two days away from the election ! and senator barack obama , the democratic presidential nominee , mixed up his fictional dogooders sunday in columbus , ohio , as he reached for a new simile to make his argument that mr mccain has been a sidekick to president bush he is like kato to the green lantern , he said you all remember that , those of you over a certain age \? if the remark drew little crowd reaction , perhaps it was because mr obama had the wrong green guy he apparently meant to say green hornet , to whom kato \( memorably played by bruce lee \) was the sidekick canal winchester , ohio six months ago , the rev rod parsley was one of the more prominent evangelicals to hail mr mccain as a strong , true , consistent conservative but two days before the election , in a state central to mr mccain s hopes , mr parsley preached to his vast congregation at world harvest church of hellfire and circling in on a fight with the eternal forces of darkness without ever mentioning mr mccain in part , mr parsley s choice could reflect the vagaries of presidential politics mr mccain was forced to disavow him last spring after church tapes revealed that mr parsley had repeatedly claimed that america was founded , in part , to destroy the false religion of islam still , some who have studied the evangelical movement see signs of splintering , as younger evangelicals begin to assert their own political identity and mr obama has courted them with great ardor you are starting to see some fragmentation it could be that the days of a monolithic bloc of evangelicals are over , said mark caleb smith , director of the center for political studies at cedarville university , a christian school the children of the first generation of evangelical leaders are of voting age , and they are questioning old allegiances not all churches remained silent in ohio pastors in a number of the historically black churches all but openly endorsed mr obama and white pastors in liberal leaning congregations , like the rev timothy c ahrens at the first congregational church , united church of christ in columbus , showered praise on mr obama without handing down an endorsement last sunday , mr ahrens noted in his sermon what excites me today about the historic race of barack obama is that we have reached the place in our country s history that a biracial leader can ascend to the office of president whether he wins or loses , this candidacy is remarkable cleveland for the last year , the classics of have played at mr obama s rallies , the soundtrack to yet another campaign so when mr springsteen came to the cleveland mall on sunday to perform in person , a crowd spilled into lakeside avenue and the surrounding streets mr obama may have been the night s headliner , but the sun was shining on the boss he sang a series of hits , then gave his own political talk today , we are at the crossroads it s been a long , long , long time coming , mr springsteen said i want my country back , i want my dream back , i want my america back now is the time to stand with barack obama , roll up our sleeves and come on up for the rising with that , mr springsteen went into the song that introduces mr obama at every rally but a few minutes after mr obama took the stage , a pleasant day faded and the skies opened into a downpour we 've been through an eightyear storm , mr obama said sunshine is on the way he added , we 've just got two more days of these clouds some did not want to wait as mr obama delivered his stump speech , going slightly longer than 30 minutes , the crowd , which the police estimated at 60 , 000 , began to dissipate mr obama did not seem deterred , largely because he was joined by his wife and two daughters for the final weekend of campaigning when they 're with you on the road , boy , everything looks a little better , mr obama said the crowds seem to grow and everybody s got a smile on their face you start thinking that maybe we might be able to win an election on nov 4 as mr mccain s motorcade wound through goldenleaved valleys on saturday in bucks county , pa , a pair of hunters watched from the side of the road , not so much clinging to their guns as keeping them tucked under their arms minutes later , when mr mccain arrived at a rally in perkasie , several people held signs declaring sportsmen for mccain and one man , in an homage to ohio s bestknown plumber , held one identifying himself as joe the hunter we 're glad you 're here , senator lindsey graham of south carolina said in his warmup speech i know the mccain family s glad you 're here i'm glad you 're here then he paused a beat the deer are glad you 're here

washington on feb 17 , 2009 , all broadcast television stations will end their analog transmissions and shift to digital signals this is a complex process that involves spending billions of dollars to build new towers and antennas and to subsidize converter boxes for consumers who do n't have digital tvs in all this planning and spending on the transition to digital transmission , however , we have yet to address the question of white spaces white spaces are the intervals between television channel frequencies to ensure that tv reception is not interrupted by other signals the usefulness of these white spaces is about to be compromised by a proposal before the federal communications commission by some of the nation s largest technology companies microsoft , google and others are asking permission to use white spaces free of charge for millions of unregulated and unlicensed devices for personal networking systems that they would like to sell , including pda s , wireless broadband devices and even toys these devices could disrupt the new digital tv signals that government and industry have spent so much time and money to promote in my district , which includes new york s theater district , performers use wireless microphones on these unused frequencies , as do news crews conducting live interviews on the street every major sports franchise relies on these channels for ingame communications and sideline interviews and in rural areas , white spaces are often used for broadband access unlicensed devices , like wireless laptops and remotecontrolled toys , operating in the white spaces will probably cause havoc to tv viewers , theater goers and sports fans they could potentially render digital television sets and the governmentsubsidized converter boxes inoperable lowincome households , the elderly and people living in multifamily buildings who do n't have cable service and rely on antenna systems could be prevented from watching their favorite programs and from receiving important emergency information nationwide , that s 45 million to 60 million people unlicenseddevice advocates say not to worry they say they 'll fix the problem if it arises but last year , when the fcc tested the sensing mechanism of some of these unlicensed devices , none of them detected broadcast and wireless signals consistently enough to avoid interfering with them new yorkers should be especially concerned a person walking down the block looking up an address in his new pda could easily cause a television set to go blank or silence the wireless microphones worn by performers in a broadway musical at giants stadium , a quarterback could mess up an important play because he did n't hear directions being given to him by his coach through a wireless mike and because these personal devices would be unregistered , there would be no effective way of recalling them or curtailing their use , much less assuring that standards were adhered to their manufacture legislation has been introduced in the house that calls for more research and testing of these devices and creates a timeline for their approval , giving priority to devices that provide broadband access to rural areas other devices would be considered only after the fcc thoroughly tests the new digital transmission system while we should encourage technical developments , we should urge the fcc to proceed with caution we cannot let these new developments undermine television service or hurt key sectors of our entertainment industry
st paul if an auto mechanic accidentally breaks your windshield while trying to repair the engine , he would never get away with billing you for fixing his mistake on wednesday , will start applying that logic to american medicine on a broad scale when it stops paying for the added cost of treating patients who are injured in their care medicare , which provides coverage for the elderly and disabled , has put 10 reasonably preventable conditions on its initial list , saying it will not pay when patients receive incompatible blood transfusions , develop infections after certain surgeries or must undergo a second operation to retrieve a sponge left behind from the first serious bed sores , injuries from falls and urinary tract infections caused by catheters are also on the list officials believe that the regulations could apply to several hundred thousand hospital stays of the 125 million covered annually by medicare the policy will also prevent hospitals from billing patients directly for costs generated by medical errors because medicare is the largest insurer in the country , its decision to refuse payment for preventable conditions has already influenced others public and private to set similar criteria over the last year , four state programs , including new york s , have announced that they will not pay for as many as 28 never events \( so called because they are never supposed to happen \) so have some of the country s largest commercial insurers , including wellpoint , aetna , cigna and blue cross blue shield plans in seven states a number of state hospital associations , including here in minnesota , have brokered voluntary agreements that members will not bill for medical errors in april , maine became the first state to ban the practice statutorily the congressionally mandated medicare measure is not projected to yield large savings 21 million a year , compared with 110 billion spent on inpatient care in 2007 but it carries great symbolism in the bush administration s efforts to revamp the country s medical payment system , which has long been criticized as driving up costs through perverse incentives that reward the quantity of care more than the promotion of health the real money , many health economists believe , may come from reorienting the payment system to encourage prevention and chronic disease management and to discourage unnecessary procedures the two majorparty presidential candidates support such a realignment , a rare point of consensus in a polarized health care debate this is a specific case of the larger payforperformance trend , the idea that you should pay more for quality than lack of quality , or in this case pay less for defects , said dr donald m berwick , president of the institute for healthcare improvement this whole trend is like a juggernaut , and it is not going to stop payforperformance makes use of both the carrot and the stick medicare now grants bonuses to doctors and hospitals that report quality measures it is experimenting with rewarding physicians who follow protocols for treating , coronary artery disease and the medicare payment advisory commission , an arm of congress , recently recommended reducing payments to hospitals with high readmission rates three years ago , healthpartners , a minnesotabased health maintenance organization , was first in the country to refuse payment to hospitals for never events company officials said the policy has yet to save much money but at regions hospital in st paul , which is owned by healthpartners , the change has reinforced a new focus on reducing medical errors historically , there s been some acceptance that these things happen , said brock d nelson , the hospital s president we 've come to now accept that they 're avoidable and that s a sea change some improvements have been technological , like an electronic prescribing system that has helped cut medication errors in half others are breathtaking in their obviousness , like diligent handwashing nurses have been trained to provide more information during shift changes about whether patients are prone to falls highrisk medications like heparin are now marked with pink labels to ward against mixups shortly before cynthia a kehborn s recent ankle fusion surgery , her orthopedic surgeon , dr peter a cole , checked records and asked her repeatedly whether he would be operating on her left leg he then took a sterile marker and signed his initials on her left ankle as they prepared for surgery , technicians tallied sponges and blades so they could later be sure that none were left behind before taking up his scalpel , dr cole was reminded by the timeout ! towel covering his surgical tray to call for a brief break we have cynthia here for a left ankle fuse , he announced does everybody agree \? after all in the room chimed their agreement , he made his incision in preop , ms kehborn , 48 , said it had never occurred to her that patients might be charged for a medical error it should be the hospital s and doctor s responsibility to step up to the plate and own up to their mistakes , she said i 'd be livid if we had to pay for it the patient safety movement picked up steam in this country in 1999 , when the institute of medicine , a prestigious advisory group , estimated that 44 , 000 to 98 , 000 americans died each year from preventable medical errors in response , at least 20 states have passed laws requiring hospitals to report mistakes or preventable infections publicly , according to the national conference of state legislatures the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services now requires hospitals to report on 42 quality measures hospitals that do not fully report may be docked up to 2 percent of their reimbursement in 2002 , the national quality forum , a standardsetting consortium for the health care industry , compiled a list of 27 largely preventable adverse events , a list that grew to 28 in 2006 with the addition of with the wrong donor sperm or egg in 2003 , minnesota became the first state to require reporting of all errors on the list , and last year the state s hospital association became the first to announce that its members would not bill for them the number of never events in minnesota reported to the state has been low 106 in 20045 , 154 in 20056 and 125 in 20067 the most frequent errors have been bed sores , retained objects and wrongsite surgeries regions hospital had six or seven reportable errors in each of those years , including one death , a  because individual hospitals may report only a few serious errors a year , they have started collaborating to look for common threads and propose solutions some of the innovations were initially greeted with rolled eyes , but hospital officials say that has lessened nonetheless , studies by the university of minnesota found that some of the safety procedures , like the presurgery timeouts , have largely become rote clear trend lines are not expected for several years some states have found through audits that not all errors are being reported , but minnesota officials believe that compliance is high there s been an understanding by hospitals that we 're not trying to get them , that we 're really focused on what we can learn from these events , said diane c rydrych , the state health department official in charge of reporting nancy e foster , vice president for quality and patient safety at the american hospital association , said hospitals had generally accepted that many of the 28 adverse events should never happen , like giving a patient the wrong type of blood but she said other areas could be gray , like an injury caused by a malfunctioning device anyone i do n't care who they are always finds it a little provocative to be held accountable for something that is not within their control , especially when you have dedicated yourself to doing the right thing for your patients , ms foster said such unforgiving standards , she said , can set an expectation among patients that staff will be closer to perfect than they actually can achieve even america s health insurance plans , the leading industry trade group , has questioned whether some of the conditions on the medicare list are always preventable but peter v lee , executive director of the pacific business group on health , based in san francisco , said occasional inequity was a price worth paying to send the message that careless medicine will not be tolerated i do n't worry about that 1in100 case that ca n't be avoided , he said , because the benefit of not paying for the 99 that should n't happen means a far greater focus on avoiding harm what we want is to encourage doctors and hospitals to get to zero
when the last shot of a long and hot afternoon slapped against the top of the net and fell back to his opponent s side , gilles muller did not scream , as he had when he won each of the first two sets he just stood for a moment near the umpire s chair , basking in his own sense of relief for once , muller , an improbable qualifier for this united states open , did not need five sets to dispatch an opponent he did it in four grueling ones , defeating the no 5 seed , nikolay davydenko , 64 , 46 , 63 , 76 \( 10 \) , advancing to face the no 2 seed , roger federer , in the quarterfinals muller , ranked no 130 in the world , became the first player from luxembourg to advance this far in a grand slam event but the milestones do not stop with his nationality he is the lowestranked quarterfinalist at the open since 1999 \( when nicolas escude , no 136 , became the only other qualifier to advance this far \) , and he is the lowestranked quarterfinalist at any grand slam tournament since 2003 , when no 198 alexander popp made it that far at wimbledon muller seemed as stunned as anyone he won his previous two matches after falling behind two sets to none , and he has made it this far despite also playing in the qualifying tournament that heavy pounding took its toll during the third set on tuesday , when muller , who said his left knee was hurting when i put pressure on it , stopped the match to have a trainer wrap it after that , he said , the pain was pretty much gone by the time the fourthset tie breaker arrived , it was clear that adrenalin had taken over muller led by 54 when davydenko hit a brilliant return that muller called the shot of the tournament but even after muller fell behind by 65 , and by 76 , and by 98 , he managed to hang on i'm really surprised about myself , the way i feel , muller said because , i mean , i'm feeling tired , but it s not , like , that bad for davydenko , a russian who said he broke four rackets during the match , this was the latest setback in the most difficult year of his professional career but the cloud that has hovered over him may be about to lift the times of london reported monday that within the next two weeks , davydenko would be cleared of allegations of matchfixing that had trailed him since 2007 it has been six years since pete sampras played in the united states open , and with his retirement went the last vestige of a tennis style that dominated the sport for decades the serve and volley since then , the men s game has been ruled by hardhitting baseliners who treat the terrain north of the service line like a demilitarized zone to be entered infrequently , and only as a last resort but the lost art may be having a bit of a resurgence no one keeps statistics on serveandvolley points specifically , but leo levin , the head statistician for ibm and the open , said he had seen evidence of it there is a slight upward trend this year , he said , although he added that he was not sure why mardy fish , the american journeyman who has never made it past the second round here , servedandvolleyed his way into the quarterfinals he came to net 69 times including a john mcenroelike 41 advances in the first set alone to upset no 32 ga l monfils after the match , fish said his attacking strategy was the only way he saw to win against a grinder like monfils he wants to keep the points as long as possible and run the guys down , fish said i do n't intend to let him do that in the second round , michael llodra of france came to the net 97 times and nearly took the sixthbest player in the world , andy murray , to five sets the australian chris guccione pushed the 28thseeded radek stepanek to four sets behind his big serve and steady volleys , approaching the net 65 times still , those examples do not suggest a return to the attacking style of sampras and mcenroe nick bollettieri , the coach who practically invented the power baseline game , was blunt no , it s not coming back it s a different game now novak djokovic was playing in arthur ashe stadium , juniors and doubles matches were sprinkled across the grounds , and yet ilie nastase was still drawing attention on court 4 , he was playing with his partner , hana mandlikova , against anne and stan smith in the mixed doubles champions invitational the stands were about twothirds filled on the large outer court when nastase , now 62 , went onstage during the match , which he and mandlikova lost , 63 , 36 , 119 , nastase tried to let his partner do most of the running when he was forced to run down a lob , he took as much time as he could before serving the next point the umpire signaled he was taking too long by saying , time nastase looked up and intentionally bounced the ball on his foot nastase has been refining his act on the hitandgiggle circuit since retiring in 1985 it is a mix of the humorous and angry , the comical and the profane he jokingly asked for a replay after a questionable call he sent a ball into the park after missing a serve because he lost his toss in the sun and after he doublefaulted to lose the first set , he dropped his shorts , though with that act he did show one sign of mellowing since his days on the tour he was wearing underwear
as a freshman last season , michael crabtree was an alleverything receiver for texas tech he led the nation in receptions \( 134 \) , receiving yards \( 1 , 962 \) and touchdowns \( 22 \) all ncaa freshman records in tech s 3519 victory at nevada last saturday , he had 7 catches for 158 yards , including an 82yard touchdown michael is contributing a diary to the quad during the season in this latest installment , he writes about what it s like for a football team to stay in a casino , how the rain in lubbock is suddenly constant and why it s so difficult for him to talk to the girls in his classes well , they said that my first journal entry here was a smash success i guess my mom and dad visited the site quite a bit over the last week ! it has been very rainy for the last several days in lubbock , which is very unusual lubbock is a very dry place and known for sunny skies i m not sure if it s rained this much the entire time i have been in school here they are calling for a good chance of rain on saturday during the game against southern methodist so that will definitely make things interesting coach leach doesn t spend a whole lot of time talking about weather conditions so i don t feel like we will change much because of it the good thing is that our running game has been carrying the load for us since the season started shannon woods , baron batch and aaron crawford will play big roles again for us against smu it s nice to be back at home and playing at the jones this weekend we went out to reno last week and faced a tough team in nevada it was pretty crazy staying in a casino because that is something we are certainly not used to doing most of our hotels are really quiet and away from all the action so that we can focus and prepare for the game coach leach made it pretty clear that none of us were to even go near the casino and if we did we would be on the first bus \( yes , bus \) back to lubbock all the guys resisted the temptation because we knew we were there on a business trip the hotel was pretty smoky because of the casino so it made it hard for me to breathe i think some of that carried over to the game because i felt like i was struggling to catch my breath at times school is going pretty good so far nothing very big to report there although , there are several girls in my classes that i would like to talk to but all my professors have me sitting at the front of the class that pretty much shoots me down oh well saturday is my birthday so i will have a lot of family back in town again i also hope to have one of my shirts all made up just in time for my birthday party i will let you know how it turned out next week
minnesota and wisconsin just can t seem to find a balance the golden gophers started the season up and the badgers were down now , minnesota is winless in its last three games after starting the season 704 and the badgers , who were winless in their first seven games of the season , are 711 in their last nine \( in wisconsin s defense , the opening eight games of its schedule were beyond brutal at boston college , at new hampshire , two games at denver , two home games vs minnesota and a weekend trip to north dakota that is the stuff bad dreams are made of \) the divergent paths of the two traditional wcha powers were on full display in the college hockey showcase over the weekend , when both played host to michigan and michigan state wisconsin was the unofficial winner of this annual big ten weekend , winning both games ranked first in the nation on friday afternoon , minnesota lost to michigan on friday night and tied michigan state on saturday wisconsin was a model of consistency in its two wins the badgers scored three goals in each game and senior goalie shane connelly allowed just one goal , on a 5on3 michigan state power play friday for purposes of context , we should point out that the spartans are struggling badly , and their onegoal output against wisconsin was the seventh straight game in which they scored one goal or none at all but saturday s shutout of a michigan squad that had struck for six goals against the gophers the previous night made a statement , as the milwaukee journalsentinel s jeff potrykus pointed out  a lot of credit for the badgers resurgence has to go to connelly the senior from the philadelphia suburbs stopped 30 of the 31 shots he faced , and his improved play has coincided with wisconsin s in his first five games , connelly allowed over four goals per game but in the last eight , his goals against average is under two connelly was solid throughout the weekend , although he didn t have to make any saves like this one connelly went undrafted when he turned 18 and will be a free agent after this season don t be surprised if a few nhl teams give him a look solid goaltending is exactly what minnesota has lacked in its last three games sophomore alex kangas \( atlanta thrashers \) has allowed four goals in each of them and was pulled for freshman kent patterson \( colorado avalanche \) early in the second period against michigan on friday no 14 michigan went on to win the game , 63 it marked an offensive explosion for a team that scored just one goal the entire previous weekend minnesota coach don lucia put it succinctly to the minneapolis star tribune , it wasn t alex s finest hour kangas was back in net saturday against the spartans , but his play wasn t exactly improved he gave up four goals yet again , but his teammates came through to earn a tie but four goals allowed to michigan state is even worse than it sounds , considering the spartans offensive struggles in the past month michigan state hasn t won a game since halloween both coaches tried to find bright spots in a lackluster weekend , according to uschocom s scott brown in one of the other big stories from the weekend , air force saw its seasonopening winning streak end after 13 games with a 41 loss to denver on saturday if you needed any more evidence to support the helterskelter nature of the college hockey season thus far , take a look at the current krach rankings krach is considered by some to be the most objective way to rank college hockey teams , and the current top five is certainly interesting air force , vermont , northeastern , princeton and cornell boston university is the highestranked traditional powerhouse program at no 6 if you re interested in how the voters rank the teams , here is the latest poll
aurora , ill when he rolls to the starting line for the 1 , 500meter wheelchair race at the , the olympics for disabled athletes that begin saturday in beijing , tony iniguez will wear his team usa uniform with pride he will compete for the united states s olympic program he is also suing it for discrimination iniguez is one of many paralympians who criticize the for providing less direct financial assistance and other benefits at lower levels to paralympic athletes than to olympians in comparable sports the committee awards smaller quarterly training stipends and medal bonuses to paralympic athletes benefits like free , which help athletes devote more hours to training , are available to a smaller percentage of paralympians the united states is no stranger to disputes over discrimination against various groups and the provision of benefits for citizens , as the battle over universal health insurance indicates but in this case the paralympians are emphasizing their needs as athletes as much as their needs as citizens they claim that races have been lost and medals squandered by their having to compete against athletes from nations like canada and britain that support their disabled athletes and olympians virtually equally iniguez , a 37yearold high school art teacher here , says that because he has had to work full time to provide his family s health insurance and has received almost no assistance from the usoc , he will race in beijing relatively unprepared for the serious competition i'm going to do my best over there , believe me but i ca n't help but wonder what i could do if i 'd been able to fully train the last four years , he said iniguez added that equal support to disabled athletes was as logical as the reforms that have opened equal sports opportunity to women male and female , are you going to discriminate on the basis of sex \? it s unfathomable now we do n't give different support to women the sprinter kortney clemons , one of many injured iraq war veterans who have become elite disabled athletes , agreed with iniguez s frustration i thought that when i was protecting this country , we had the best , said clemons , a former combat medic in iraq who lost his right leg in an explosion we do things right , we do things the best way and just to know that other countries can man up and support their paralympic athletes , and we 're not , it s disappointing other disabled athletes said they viewed the situation differently marlon shirley , a champion amputee sprinter , said that benefits for paralympic athletes had improved but could not reach olympic equality on paper , it looks absolutely atrocious i'm aware of that but the olympics is big business , shirley said he added that when an american sprinter wins a gold medal at the olympics , compared to when marlon shirley wins the gold medal in the paralympics , commercially , it s a hell of a lot greater in hearing the lawsuit brought by iniguez and two retired wheelchair racers , the united states district court and the united states court of appeals have ruled that the usoc has the legal discretion to finance ablebodied and disabled athletes differently \( the case has been appealed to the supreme court \) but even the district court judge who ruled against iniguez in 2006 wrote do i decry a culture that relegates paralympians to secondclass status in the quantity and quality of benefits and support they receive from the usoc \? emphatically yes the usoc contends that equitable support to paralympic athletes is unrealistic because the agency receives almost no government assistance , and paralympic success does not generate enough increased revenue darryl seibel , the usoc s chief communications officer , also emphasized that the agency s support for paralympic athletes has grown markedly to 114 million this year from 3 million in 2004 , in contrast with a relatively modest bump in olympic funding i see 3 million going up to 11 million and say that s not too bad that s a good direction , seibel said we care more about the paralympics than we ever have before he added , we 're much closer to the beginning of our support and involvement in the paralympic movement than we are to being a finished product olympiccaliber athletes in the united states are generally financed by two agencies the usoc and the national governing body of their sport paralympians are supported almost exclusively by the usoc while linebyline comparisons are difficult because programs have different designs , almost every form of support that a paralympic contender receives is considerably less than that given to a similarly situated olympian for example , in 2007 , members of the united states paralympic track and field team were given either 1 , 000 or 2 , 000 in stipends to help defray the cost of training similar olympic hopefuls received 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 slots for athletes to receive room and board for fulltime training at centers in colorado springs and chula vista , calif , were also more open to olympic athletes than paralympic athletes wheelchair athletes had no livein program at all over all , the rules covering which athletes qualify for usocpaid health insurance are considerably more strict for paralympians than olympians according to the usoc , in 2007 there were 174 insurance policies given to paralympic athletes vying to make the 200member beijing team olympic hopefuls had 1 , 150 policies , enough for the entire 600member team in beijing and almost another full team most athletes interviewed said that securing health insurance without a fulltime job was the primary avenue to effective training the most striking difference between the funding of paralympic and olympic athletes , some contend , is in the cash bonuses given for top performances olympic gold medalists in beijing received 25 , 000 from the usoc and often additional money from their national governing body paralympic gold medalists will get 5 , 000 from the usoc for 2007 competitions , the usoc distributed 185 million in performance bonuses , none of it to paralympic athletes , the usoc s seibel confirmed two women united states paralympians who because of their family roots could compete for european countries said that they had strongly considered competing for that other nation because training would be more affordable \( they asked not to be identified for fear of backlash from the usoc and their teammates \) one prominent american coach did switch affiliations peter eriksson , now a consultant for canada s paralympic track and field program , said he resigned as coach of the united states paralympic track and field team two years ago because , i could n't do my job , he said in the united states , the athletes are as determined , but they ca n't access the services they need to compete at the elite level , eriksson said a lot of their athletes never developed out of the gate they had humungous potential , and it just evaporated iniguez said he wondered if he was one of those athletes unable to walk without crutches since ravaged his legs at age 2 , iniguez was a rising star in wheelchair racing during the 1990s he missed the 2000 paralympics because he could not afford to leave his job at aurora east high , his alma mater in the years that followed , iniguez squeezed in whatever training he could on mornings when it was warm enough , and occasionally after school but he slipped from internationally elite status to a virtual hobbyist by the time the usoc started offering health insurance and 250 to 500 quarterly training stipends to some of its top paralympic contenders several years ago , iniguez was no longer enough of a medal hopeful to qualify iniguez said he attended the united states paralympic track and field trials this year just to see what i was still capable of he won the 1 , 500meter sprint one of wheelchair racing s marquee events to earn a place on the united states team iniguez and two other top american wheelchair racers , scot hollonbeck and jacob heilveil , filed their discrimination suit against the usoc five years ago the committee successfully argued in united states district court and the united states court of appeals that the olympic and paralympic programs are distinct and that anyone capable of making the olympic team receives premium support , regardless of disability the wheelchair racers contended that federal law forbade a university from fielding an allmale track team by claiming , a woman can be on it if she runs fast enough they said that similar logic should require that disabled athletes under the usoc umbrella receive equal support to ablebodied athletes with his suit awaiting consideration by the supreme court , iniguez now finds himself in the awkward position of racing on behalf of a team he is also suing i am not doing it for personal gain , said iniguez , who is not seeking financial damages i'm doing it to make the sport better for other future athletes iniguez is one of many united states paralympians who said they would attend the beijing games relatively unprepared , compared with their competition tyler byers , a 26yearold wheelchair racer who works full time as an engineering analyst in washington and squeezes in training in his free time , said , there s no reason someone like me should be representing us in the paralympic games the united states s performance at the paralympics has decreased markedly over the last 20 years it won about 12 percent of medals in the summer games of 1988 and 1992 , but in 2004 won just 56 percent of medals , well behind china \( 9 percent \) and in a pack that included australia \( 64 \) , britain \( 61 \) , germany \( 50 \) , canada \( 47 \) and spain \( 45 \) nations with far smaller populations liz nicholl , britain s director of elite sport , said that the manner in which the united states supported its disabled athletes was a top cause of the decrease i would say that this a nation that is choosing to underperform , she said the british wheelchair racing champion david weir said competitions were marred by the united states s approach it s the sort of thing you 'd expect from a thirdworld country in africa i think it s quite disgusting , actually , weir said they 've got talented athletes coming from there that could bring back medals from beijing and london , and it looks like they do n't really care every nation has a different mix of paralympic services and financing plans for example , britain and canada provide living and training support from the equivalent of 18 , 000 to about 50 , 000 annually based solely on the athlete s standing internationally , not on whether he or she is an olympian or a paralympian athletes competing for nations like canada do not have medicalinsurance costs because of nationalized health care britain offers a special healthinsurance program to olympians and paralympians the principle is you 're a member of the same organization with the same goals and performance targets , so of course there will be an equivalent level of services provided , said rob needham , the senior manager of high performance for the canadian paralympic committee the paralympians are on the same team as the olympians they are siblings , not stepsiblings sir philip craven , president of the international paralympic committee , called the united states slower to react to paralympic support than nations well beyond canada and britain , citing brazil , iran and france i find it strange in the 21st century , he said we would expect of the us to be one of the leading nations when it comes to this sort of principle marlon shirley , the amputee sprinter , said he understood the principles at play but that he also felt like saying , shut up and race shirley won his first paralympic gold in 2000 when he had virtually no financing from the usoc , and emphasized that programs are much better now than they 've ever been he said that market forces played a greater role in the united states where the paralympics have almost no television coverage than in other countries , whose sports fans have shown interest in disabled athletics many paralympians interviewed said a chickenandegg dynamic now exists the usoc is waiting for paralympic sports to generate more revenue , but that revenue will not grow without greater support for disabled athletes only then , the athletes said , can they truly compete internationally we are very much focusing on growing the paralympic movement in the united states , said charlie huebner , chief of paralympics for the usoc that is no doubt complicated the reality is that we also do n't have unlimited resources if resources remain fixed , at least one olympian has come to support giving up some of her financing to create more equality with paralympians simi adeagbo , a triplejumper who did not make the olympic team , said that after spending most of this year training with the amputee sprinter april holmes and several other paralympians at the olympic center in chula vista , her view of disabled athletes had changed before this experience , maybe just as a general american , i did n't have access to know the paralympians , adeagbo said you do n't know them you do n't know their stories you do n't know how they train and try to win medals on behalf of their country you do n't even know , really , that they exist so to ask an olympian would you want to lose benefits because of something you 've never heard of or does n't exist sounds crazy but if you gave them an opportunity to see what i 've seen and experience what i 've experienced , i think they 'd change their mind
dujiangyan , china the s destruction of xinjian primary school was swift and complete hundreds of children were crushed as the floors collapsed in a deluge of falling bricks and concrete days later , as curiosity seekers came with video cameras and as parents came to grieve , the fourstory school was no more than rubble in contrast , none of the nearby buildings were badly damaged a separate kindergarten less than 20 feet away survived with barely a crack an adjacent 10story hotel stood largely undisturbed and another local primary school , beijie , catering to children of the elite , was in such good condition that local officials were using it as a refugee center this is not a natural disaster , said ren yongchang , whose 9yearold son died inside the destroyed school his hands were covered in plaster dust as he stood beside the rubble , shouting and weeping as he grabbed the exposed steel rebar of a broken concrete column this is not good steel it does n't meet standards they stole our children there is no official figure on how many children died at xinjian primary school , nor on how many died at scores of other schools that collapsed in the powerful may 12 earthquake in sichuan province but the number of student deaths seems likely to exceed 10 , 000 , and possibly go much higher , a staggering figure that has become a simmering controversy in china as grieving parents say their children might have lived had the schools been better built the chinese government has enjoyed broad public support for its handling of the earthquake , and in sichuan on saturday , secretary general ban kimoon of the united nations praised the government s response but as parents at different schools begin to speak out , the question of whether official negligence , and possibly corruption , contributed to the student deaths could turn public opinion the government has launched an investigation , but censors , wary of the public mood , are trying to suppress the issue in staterun media and online an examination of the collapse of xinjian primary school offers a disturbing picture of a calamity that might have been avoided many parents say they were told the school was unsafe xinjian was poorly built when it opened its doors in 1992 , they say , and never got its share of government funds for reconstruction because of its low ranking in the local education bureaucracy and the low social status of its students a decade ago , a detached wing of the school was torn down and rebuilt because of safety concerns but the main building remained unimproved engineers and earthquake experts who examined photographs of its wreckage concluded that the structure had many failings and one critical flaw inadequate iron reinforcing rods running up the school s vertical columns one expert described the unstable concrete floor panels as time bombs xinjian also was illequipped for a crisis an ambulance and other rescue vehicles that responded after the earthquake could not fit through the entrance into the school s courtyard a bulldozer finally dug up beneath the front gate to create enough overhead clearance parents say they believe several hundred of the school s 660 pupils died it is impossible to describe , said a nurse standing on the rubble of the xinjian site there is death everywhere schools are vulnerable to earthquakes , especially in developing nations where less attention is paid to building codes the quake in sichuan province has already claimed 60 , 560 lives , and some of the flattened schools , especially those buried under landslides , could not have stood under any circumstances the government has not provided a public list of those schools , but one early estimate concluded that more than 7 , 000 schoolrooms were destroyed china has national building codes intended to ensure that major structures withstand earthquakes the government also has made upgrading or replacing substandard schools a priority as part of a broader effort to improve and expand education yet codes are spottily enforced in march 2006 , sichuan province issued a notice that local governments must inspect schools because too many remained unsafe , according to one official web site nothing is more central to the social contract in china than schools parents sacrifice and eat bitter so their children can get educations that lead to better lives in turn , children care for their parents in old age as in manhattan , affluent chinese fight to gain entrance to top schools from kindergarten onward but the families who sent their children to xinjian are neither wealthy nor well connected they are among the hundreds of millions still struggling to benefit from china s economic rise many lost their jobs when a local cement plant shut down some sought work in more prosperous areas , leaving their children behind to attend school angry parents at several destroyed schools are beginning to stage small demonstrations on wednesday , more than 200 xinjian parents demonstrated at the temporary tents used by dujiangyan s education bureau , demanding an investigation and accusing officials of corruption and negligence one of the parents , li wei , said his son was one of 54 students who died in a class of 60 fifth graders he said education officials told the demonstrating parents that the bureau had reported safety concerns to municipal leaders in the past but their complaints were ignored we want to bring justice for our children , one father said the day before the protest we want the local officials to pay the price the earthquake struck on may 12 at 2 28 in the afternoon as 20 fifth graders were rehearsing a dance on the basketball court in front of the school fourth graders were outside for gym class when nearby shopkeepers rushed over , the children were standing on the court amid a cloud of dust they were n't crying , said chen chunmei , 35 , the manager of a shopping strip beside the school they were in shock the main building was decimated parents , neighbors and nearby college students arrived to find awful carnage ma qiang , a decommissioned soldier living across the street , described a sickening scene we were standing on the bodies of dead children , pulling out other children , he recalled days later he stood in the rubble and held his hand level with his head the concrete was this high on the top was a boy , and two girls below him , and another boy under them , who was dead it took four hours to dig them out for hours , this ad hoc rescue team formed a line and passed along bricks or chunks of concrete in an attempt to clear debris bodies of children were piled on the sidewalk across the street by late evening , paramilitary officers arrived and ordered the parents and others to withdraw outside the school gate many parents considered this a tardy response that was a stinging reminder of xinjian s low standing a lot of our students came from the mountains , said deng huiying , the former longtime principal their parents were migrant workers xinjian is in the heart of the city of dujiangyan the lack of damage to the yellowtiled kindergarten next door or to the beijie primary school a fiveminute walk away has served as a reminder that proximity is not the same as equality beijie is the city s elite primary school , designated as a provinciallevel key school , boasting the best facilities and the finest teachers the kindergarten , meanwhile , was built and controlled directly by the city government of dujiangyan for years , xinjian was controlled by a smaller , local township government , which had far less money and did little to improve the school in recent years , china s central government has gradually abolished primary school tuition and other fees to ease burdens on farmers and migrants beijing has also increased its payments to local governments for education , but the main burden remains on local authorities , and many find themselves strapped for cash or siphon it off when xinjian was built in 1992 , many parents worked for the dongfeng cement factory company bosses donated 40 tons of cement but that was not enough everybody knew they did n't have enough cement , said dai chuanbin , an older man familiar with the project so they used a lot of sand parents say the township government cut costs further by hiring farmers to do the work instead of trained construction crews one former school official recalled that workers poured the foundation during such heavy rains that it collapsed another foundation had to be poured the school opened in 1993 and would quickly be overrun with students the detached annex was rebuilt in 1998 after inspectors deemed it substandard ms deng , the former principal , recalled that nearby construction work in may 2006 caused the flooring in the main school building to shake violently but she said she never had reason to believe the building was structurally unsound and never filed any written complaints with higher officials if i 'd thought the building was unsafe , there s no way i would have let the kids stay there , she said when she saw the collapsed building , she fell on the ground , sobbing several parents tell a different story they say ms deng and other school officials told them that the building was aging and unsafe , though they could provide no written proof one father was told that xinjian would soon be closed another , zhu junsheng , 44 , claimed that ms deng filed a report with dujiangyan s education bureau complaining about the building the education bureau said there was no money , said mr zhu , sitting in front of a blue tent in a refugee camp a block from the school they did n't care i just want to say the government did n't do its job nearly two weeks after the earthquake , mr ma , the decommissioned soldier , keeps returning to the rubble of xinjian he smokes cigarette after cigarette and has not changed out of the che guevara tshirt and blue jeans he wore on that frantic afternoon that s where government officials send their children to nursery school , he said , pointing to the undamaged , yellowtiled kindergarten mr ma saved several children the day of the disaster but cannot shake the memory of one girl her leg had been pinned beneath a heavy concrete slab two small cranes had failed to free her her body temperature was quickly dropping so mr ma told her father , she can keep her leg or her life the father was led away mr ma used a serrated knife he kept in his jeans he said the job took three cuts across the girl s shin she will hate me when she is older if she has trouble with love , he said with a grim smile he does not know the girl s name i have dreams every night , he said she was very pretty very strong techniques for fortifying buildings to withstand earthquakes have been clearly understood for decades use highquality concrete embed extra iron rods tie them tightly into bundles with strong wire ensure that components of floors , walls and columns are firmly attached pay special attention to columns , which are the key to having a building sway rather than topple engineers are already trying to assess how much of the destruction on may 12 should be attributed to faulty construction during china s long and often helterskelter building boom the earthquake was so powerful , measuring at least 79 in magnitude , that a certain amount of damage could not be prevented but engineering experts say xinjian and some other schools in sichuan were especially vulnerable six structural engineers and earthquake experts asked by the new york times to analyze an of the wreckage at xinjian concluded , independently , that inadequate steel reinforcement , or rebar , was used in the concrete columns supporting the school they also found that the school s precast , hollow concrete slab floors and walls did not appear to be securely joined together the widespread use of cheap , hollow slab floors is significant because numerous buildings with the same flooring collapsed during another chinese earthquake in 1976 , which devastated the city of tangshan and killed at least 240 , 000 \( a few buildings with the same flooring also fared poorly during the 1994 earthquake in southern california \) if the hollow core slabs are not adequately tied to the lateral frames , which seems to be the case in the photos , the structures are likely very flexible and would undergo large deformations under severe ground motions , said mary beth hueste , an associate professor of engineering at texas am university , in an email message when such components are not securely joined , they are extremely dangerous , like time bombs , said xiao yan , an expert in earthquakeresistant designs at the university of southern california the most pronounced failing at xinjian seemed to be inadequate steel reinforcement of the concrete columns supporting the school , experts said there were too few rebar reinforcing rods and too little of the thin binding wire that holds the rebar together and , critically , the steel bindings attaching the concrete flooring slabs were inadequate xiaonian duan , an engineer specializing in earthquake resilience for arup , a multinational design consulting company whose head office is in london , said that concrete flooring panels fall apart during an earthquake if not strongly attached , like we see legos collapse the chinese government has known that many schools , especially in rural areas , are unsafe since 2001 , the state council , china s cabinet , has budgeted roughly 15 billion for a nationwide program to repair dangerous schools in rural areas in 2006 , sichuan province s government issued an urgent notice calling for localities to stop using substandard primary and middle schools unsafe buildings are the major hidden danger of school safety at present , and in recent years , accidents with death tolls and injuries were caused by collapsed schools , the provincial notice warned dr xiao toured the disaster zone after this month s earthquake and found that many of the problems at xinjian were common elsewhere he said one reason for the widespread damage was that buildings in the region were not required to meet china s most stringent standards for seismic protection he also noted that china rates overall building design codes from 1 to 4 buildings rated 1 are considered important and must meet stricter design requirements but the system rates schools only as a 3 , which means no additional design protections are needed in the aftermath of the quake , a handful of bricklayers and builders have visited xinjian primary school out of professional curiosity a builder from nearby meishan city recognized the faulty columns and flooring problems then he picked up a chunk of concrete from the rubble and rubbed it in his hands the ratio of sand and concrete is n't right , he said it fell down because of cheap materials the parents of xinjian primary school posted an online petition last wednesday they demanded justice for their children local police officials have promised an investigation , but the parents are not satisfied they intend to protest again school represents hope in china the parents do not express it exactly like that , but they saw education as their children s only chance the cement factory that employed many parents and provided cement for the school went bankrupt in 2002 they now collect small welfare payments and hold down odd jobs to support their families liao minhui had aspirations for his daughter he knew that xinjian was considered inferior and that a better school might help her find a better life so he tried to wheedle her into beijie , the elite school he said he offered thousands of yuan to gain her admission , to no avail she died in the xinjian rubble i tried very hard , mr liao said i tried to get help from every wellconnected friend i have everything there is the best the teachers are the best the facilities are the best jiang xuezheng , 41 , is a small , wiry man whose simple manner betrays his country upbringing in a village about 200 miles away he has sold fruit in dujiangyan for nearly a decade to support his family back in the village but to do this , he lived apart from his son for eight years so last year , mr jiang also paid to try to win his child admission to a city school he chose xinjian to him , a peasant , a city school like xinjian represented a step up he paid a 1 , 400 fee to make the switch his 9yearold boy was admitted in september my parents are still in the countryside , but i wanted my son to live with me , said mr jiang , bowing his head and weeping i waited for eight years finally , i was together with my son and then tragedy happens
coach was watching just like everyone else sunday when the game of the year went up in smoke , when the team regarded as the patriots' biggest roadblock to another super bowl title was eliminated as a bonus for him , on the san diego sideline in indianapolis was a most welcome sight for any coach about to face the ladainian tomlinson standing there , his knee injured enough to keep him out of the second half of the chargers' 2824 victory over the in an american football conference divisional playoff game with the defending super bowl champion colts , whose rivalry with the patriots has colored more than a few postseason games this decade , out of the playoffs , the patriots will play host to the chargers next sunday in the afc championship game it figures to be a much less heated game than if the colts had advanced the patriots found their run defense saturday night in their divisional game against the jacksonville jaguars , holding fred taylor and maurice jonesdrew to 66 yards combined now the team that least needs a break could receive a gift , a conference championship game against tomlinson , the nfl s premier running back , who may be at less than full strength , and against quarterback philip rivers , whose knee was banged up enough that he did not play in the chargers' final two drives sunday there is a chance neither will play going out on the road and winning in indianapolis shows what kind of mental toughness they have , belichick said sunday in a conference call we know we 're going to have to play our best game of the year we 'll prepare for everybody as we saw today , any number of players could be in the game the chargers and the patriots have their own checkered history they played in the divisional round in san diego last season , and it was the patriots' victory that ushered marty schottenheimer into unemployment but that game was also notable for the sour reaction of several chargers , including tomlinson , to the patriots' celebration on the field tomlinson said the patriots showed no class and indicated he thought they took their cues from their coach after the patriots' spying scandal early this season , tomlinson said that they lived by the credo , if you 're not cheating , you 're not trying poking superman in the chest is never a good idea , and the patriots quieted tomlinson in the second week of the season , only days after belichick and the patriots were sanctioned for the videotaping incident the question then was whether the patriots would be distracted they have been answering ever since , constructing a 170 record as they try to become the second nfl team to complete a perfect season with a super bowl title the patriots , playing emotionally in support of belichick , crushed the chargers that night , 3814 , but plenty has changed since then the chargers' defense has found itself just ask the colts and san diego has run off eight consecutive victories to get to the conference championship round we 'll start all over on our preparations with them , almost like it s a new team , belichick said that was such a long time ago i think the most important thing for us to focus on is what the chargers have done in the last couple of months what they did against the colts may draw particular attention the chargers were able to pass for 312 yards , with rivers and billy volek under center toward the end of the season , the patriots' secondary had some trouble stopping the best passing games the giants' eli manning had the game of his life in the regularseason finale and the patriots struggled to stop david garrard on saturday night , allowing him to complete 22 of 33 passes for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns garrard s lone mistake , which was turned into an interception by safety rodney harrison , secured the victory for the patriots the patriots were in the afc championship game last year , too , which for most franchises would mean a very good season for the patriots , though , the loss to the colts was the impetus for a furious remake of the receiving corps that has lifted the patriots' offense into the stratosphere now it is the chargers , mocked in the first half of the season and stunning in the second , who will have to grapple with what the colts wrought with a shot at the super bowl on the line the thing about it now is none of it matters , patriots quarterback said saturday night for 17 games , it all comes down to this we were here last year i hope we perform better

tbilisi , georgia s prowestern president narrowly won reelection over the weekend , according to official results released sunday , but the main opposition candidate contested the outcome with returns from what election officials called nearly all precincts in saturday s vote counted , president had received 528 percent , according to the central election commission , a slim majority that would allow him to avoid a runoff the main opposition candidate , levan gachechiladze , received 27 percent but the outcome was not as clean as the government had hoped for when mr saakashvili called early elections in november and declared a state of emergency to deal with antigovernment protests on sunday , mr gachechiladze said that fraud had tainted the results , and by late in the day he had not conceded mr gachechiladze said a second round of voting should be held and called for street protests he told a rally of several thousand supporters in tbilisi on sunday that , we have won despite pressure , despite intimidation , despite televised terror exerted against us the demonstration , which was peaceful , dispersed by early afternoon as orthodox christians , the majority of georgians , began celebrating their christmas eve supporters of mr saakashvili , an americaneducated leader close to the bush administration , had already claimed victory based on exit polling on saturday a statement by the international observer mission of the called the vote in essence consistent with most osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , but noted violations observers recorded apparent cases of the same individuals voting more than once at 12 polling stations , according to the statement , and noted that ballot boxes in 3 percent of the precincts they visited were not properly sealed at a news conference in tbilisi on sunday , alcee l hastings , a democratic congressman from florida and the coordinator of the osce mission , declined to say whether voting irregularities were significant enough to upset mr saakashvili s slender margin in response to the report , giorgi kandelaki , a spokesman for the justice ministry , said to our knowledge , there were very few violations that could be regarded as serious the perception of a fair vote was important because the bush administration has cited mr saakashvili s government as an example of democratic success in a region where democracy has been scarce georgia is also valuable to washington because it is an ally in the iraq war with 2 , 000 troops in iraq , it is the thirdlargest contributor of troops there , after the united states and britain mr saakashvili , 40 , had about a year to go in his fiveyear term when he called early elections in november he hoped to win a new mandate after he declared a state of emergency on nov 7 and ordered a police crackdown on antigovernment protests in the dispersal of demonstrators , more than 500 people were injured , none fatally
if there was a link among the three compositions lorin maazel and the presented at avery fisher hall on wednesday night , it was by no means apparent of course not every philharmonic concert adheres to a programmatic theme but the chasms that separated these particular works a chamber concerto by bach , a romantic confection by tchaikovsky and a premiere by bernard rands made for an event that felt more uneven than it actually was none of the pieces were exactly standard fare for the philharmonic bach s brandenburg concerto no 5 , though hardly unfamiliar , is now strange terrain for a modern symphony orchestra tchaikovsky s suite no 3 in g is a charming but marginal work composed during the decade between the fourth and fifth symphonies , and makes many of the same noises they do the philharmonic , in an earlier incarnation , first played the suite in 1891 , with tchaikovsky conducting , and last did it in 1973 mr rands s chains like the sea , commissioned by the philharmonic , was in a sense no more foreign than the other works this orchestra has regularly favored new pieces from composers who combine rigorous methods with more lyrical inclinations mr rands , englishborn but based in the united states since 1975 , creates pieces filled with technical demands that make them gratifying to the performer , as well as sufficient sensual beauty to appeal to listeners poetry has provided the spark for some of his strongest creations chains like the sea , an instrumental work about 20 minutes long , was inspired by dylan thomas s fern hill certain phrases , mr rands explained in a program note , conjured memories of early years spent in wales true to its title , the sabbath rang slowly , the first of two sections , was a broadly paced sequence punctuated with bell tones made from stacked notes that shimmered and rippled in combination patches reminiscent of debussy seascapes and early stravinsky lullabies floated in a dreamlike drift , meant to evoke the tedium of slow , pious sundays a more animated second part , rivers of the windfall light , repeatedly surged with chattering gusts of horns , brass and percussion mr rands has an unerring knack for lucid orchestration here , scintillating details regularly pricked through an overall melancholy tone a brief , gentle duo for solo violin and muted trumpet midway through the second part , for instance , seemed to leave behind a humid , bluesy wilt in its wake mr maazel , who does some of his best work when confronted with challenging new scores , provided an exactingly detailed account the orchestra s polish and commitment earned a warm response from the audience the bach concerto , which opened the program , was another story a reduced ensemble , spread thin across the stage , sounded clean and efficient but lacked vivacity , despite lively contributions from the soloists \( anna rabinova , violinist sandra church , flutist and lionel party , harpsichordist \) mr maazel dutifully beat time but seldom seemed engaged happily , the tchaikovsky suite inspired sufficient ardor and good cheer to provide a rousing conclusion
participants former new york mayor rudolph w giuliani former arkansas governor mike huckabee senator john mccain representative ron paul former massachusetts governor mitt romney former tennessee senator fred d thompson moderators charles gibson , abctv news anchor scott spradling , wmurtv news anchor mr gibson i thank you all for being here , and i genuinely look forward to this so let us begin and i 'll start the stopwatch president bush said in his endoftheyear news conference , during the primaries and during the general election , i suspect my name may come up a lot so let s bring it up and i want to start with foreign policy and just to set some context , we 've got a little background here from abc s jonathan karl jonathan karl \( abc \) when he was on the debate stage eight years ago , candidate george bush promised a humble foreign policy after september 11th , a new bush doctrine the united states would hit its enemies before they hit us hence , the iraq war on terrorism , president bush told the world , you 're either with us or you 're against us with the second term , an even bolder vision president george w bush \( from videotape \) with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world mr karl sounding like woodrow wilson , the president vowed to push for democracy everywhere there are exceptions support for musharraf in pakistan , for example , and the nuclear deal offered to north korea from the axis of evil to nationbuilding in iraq and afghanistan , the bush policy has been bold , but not exactly humble charlie mr gibson so let me start with a general question if you are the nominee , will you run on the bush foreign policy record or will you run away from it \? and governor huckabee , let me start with you because it was you who wrote that the bush foreign policy reflects an arrogant bunker mentality mr huckabee and when i made those statements , i was speaking to the fact that there were times when we gave the world the impression that we were going to ignore what they thought or what they felt , and we were going to do whatever it is we wanted to do but the fact is we 're going to do what is best for the american people and as president , i will always act in the best interests of our country , but i 'll always try to make sure that we 're the strongest nation on earth , the most powerful , the most prepared but also the one that uses that strength in a very , very understanding way of making sure that when we use the strength we use it with full understanding of the implications of it and let me just finish the thought , charlie , if i may there were times when the arrogance was reflected , for example , in the former defense secretary , who despite getting advice from the defense department that we would need 400 , 000 troops to be able to successfully bring stability to iraq insisted that we would only use 180 , 000 troops and we would go in with a light footprint and there was one particular statement that he made that i found especially troubling he said we do n't go to war with the army that we want we go to war with the army that we have i felt that the proper way for us to approach this is we do n't go to war with the army we have we go to war with the army that we need , and we make sure that we have what we need before we go to war , including a clear definition of what we 're going to do , irresistible force when we do it and once we do it we do n't let the politicians interfere or interrupt the battlefield decisions of the commanders with blood on their boots and medals on their chest mr gibson senator thompson mr thompson well , i think that maybe the governor s rethought his comments that he made about america arrogant foreign policy because it seems now what he s saying is that we were arrogant because we did n't go in with enough troops i think that s kind of a different impression than the one that he originally sought to leave i do n't think our foreign policy has been arrogant presidents are not perfect policies are not perfect but the bottom line is we are in a global war with radical islam they declared on it us war on us a long , long time ago we took note really for the first time on september 11 of 2001 we must do whatever is necessary to protect ourselves we were n't considered to be arrogant in afghanistan when we went in there and won that conflict i agree that we made a mistake in terms of going into iraq as far as the number of troops are concerned , and i think the flawed strategy also i think that s been rectified now , and i think we 're on the on the way to prevailing there and because we are prevailing there , i think it s going to be for a safer united states of america mr gibson mayor giuliani , would you run on the president s foreign policy record or away from it \? mr giuliani i think you run on your foreign policy ideas , theories and policies , which i 've laid out in articles and i think the president got the big decision of his presidency right the big decision that he made on september 20th , 2001 , when he put us on offense against islamic terrorism and i give him great credit for that because we had been dealing with islamic terrorism incorrectly up until then we had been on defense we have been responding the president set a whole different mind set it was let s anticipate , let s see if we can prevent another attack that led to afghanistan it led to iraq it s led to the patriot act it s led to electronic surveillance it s led to changing our intelligence services all that is very , very good mistakes have also been made mistakes were made particularly in the period of time after the capture of saddam hussein and now , a year ago , when we got to the surge policy mr gibson well , let me bring up the bush i'm sorry , go ahead mr giuliani if i may add , i think one of the things that would would help answer some of the issues that have come up is we should increase the size of our military bill clinton cut the military drastically it s called the peace dividend , one of those nice sounding phrases , very devastating it was a 25 , 30 percent cut in the military president bush has never made up for that we our army had been at 725 , 000 it s down to 500 , 000 we need at least 10 more combat brigades we need our we need our marines at 200 , 000 we need a 300ship navy this president should do it now if i'm president , i 'll do it immediately mr gibson let me let me just ratchet up the question slightly and ask you if you believe in the bush doctrine , because in september 2002 , up for years , our foreign policy has been based on the idea that we form alliances , international consensus we attack retaliate if we 're attacked but in 2002 the president said we have a right to a preemptive attack , that we can attack if this country feels threatened and on that basis wmd we went into iraq we have cited the threat of a nuclear iran to leave the military option on the table do you agree with the doctrine , senator mccain , if you were president , or would you change it \? sen mccain i agree with the doctrine , and i 'd also like to give president bush a little credit as we have this discussion right after 9 11 , every expert in the world said there would be another attack on the united states of america there has n't been now maybe that s all by accident , but if there had been , i think it s very clear where the responsibility would have been placed so i think we ought to give him credit for that we went through the greatest reorganization of government since the creation of the defense department and the creation of the defense department of homeland security , and america is safer america is not safe america is safer i 'd like to give the president some credit for that now , i strongly disagree with the strategy employed by secretary rumsfeld , and by the way , i'm the only one here that disagreed at the time and i'm the only one at the time that said we 've got to employ a new strategy and outlined what it was , which is the petraeus strategy and i said at the time i had no confidence in the then secretary of defense but we are succeeding now in iraq , and the fact is , as we blame the president for the failed strategy , we should give him credit for changing the strategy and changing the leadership so that we now have , i think , one of the finest military leaders in american history in david petraeus so , look , i think we 've got enormous challenges ahead of us i think the transcendent challenge of the 21st century is radical islamic extremists and by the way , i 'd like to give my friend , the mayor , for the great job that he did after 9 11 and the way that he and the president rallied this nation but i know how to lead i 've been involved in these issues , and i know how to solve them mr gibson congressman paul , let me ask you do you agree with the bush doctrine or would you change it \? rep paul well , i certainly agreed with his foreign policy that he ran on and that we as republicans won in the year 2000 you know , the humble foreign policy , no nationbuilding , do n't be the policeman of the world and we were strongly critical of the policy of the clinton administration , that did the opposite and we fell short of course , the excuse is that 9 11 changed everything , but the bush doctrine of preemptive war is not a minor change this is huge this is the first time we as a nation accept as our policy that we start the wars i do n't understand this and that all options are on the table to go after iran \? this this is not this is not necessary these are thirdworld nations they 're not capable but i think it s the misunderstanding or the disagreements that we 've had in this debate along the campaign trail is the the nature of the threat i'm as concerned about the nature of the threat of terrorism as anybody , if not more so but they do n't attack us because we 're free and prosperous and there are radicals in all elements on in in all religions that will result to violence but if we do n't understand that the reaction is is because we invade their countries , we and occupy their countries , we have bases in their country , and that we have n't done it just since 9 11 , but we have done that a long time i mean , it was the air force base in saudi arabia before 9 11 that was given as the excuse if we do n't understand that , we ca n't win this war against terrorism mr gibson you can break in here , governor romney mr romney well , unfortunately , ron , you need a thorough understanding of what radical jihad is what the movement is , what its intent is , where it flows from , and the fact is it is trying to bring down , not just us , but it is trying to bring down all moderate islamic governments , western governments around the world , as we just saw in pakistan but let s step back with regards to the president the president is not arrogant the president does not subject or is not subject to a bunker mentality the president has acted out of his desire to keep america safe , and we owe him a debt of gratitude for keeping this country safe over the last six years mr gibson let me mr romney in addition , let me let me continue with my own thoughts on on the issue of do we follow his policy or create a new one he did the right thing in responding and reacting to the fact that we got attacked and people now recognize you attack america and there is a response but we 're going to have to move our strategy from simply being a respond to military threat with military action to an effort that says we 're going to use our military and nonmilitary resources nonmilitary resources , combined with other nations who are our friends , to help move the world of islam towards modernity and moderation it s something that former prime minister aznar of spain spoke about the new mission for nato and for other nations is to help provide the rule of law , education that is not through madrassas , agricultural and economic policies that can be instilled in various islamic countries so the muslims are able to reject the extreme and the and the terrorists we can help them our military is going to be needed we do need i agree with what the mayor said we need to add to our military by at least 100 , 000 troops , but the answer is to move now to a second phase , a phase of helping muslims become so strong they can reject the extreme mr thompson charlie , is this subject still open \? mr gibson sure mr thompson can we comment on that \? i served on the intelligence committee in the senate i was the floor manager for the republicans on the homeland security bill so i have a bit of a different vantage point than some of my colleagues on this the question had to do with preemption preemption did n't just appear one day as a good idea after the cold war , we had one big enemy and one big weapon against us when we kind of took a holiday from history in the '90s and let our military slide and our intelligence capabilities slide , the world was changing we now have multiple enemies we now have terrorists and various groups , al qaeda , rogue nations in different stages of developing nuclear weapons we must be prepared for the different kind of weaponry that we 're facing we could be attacked with a biological weapon and not even know it for a long period of time this is a different world so instead of mutually assured destruction , which we lived under for a long time , it s now a world where preemption has got to be an option under the right circumstances mr gibson so you would keep the bush policy \? mr thompson things that happen on the other side of the world sometimes can affect us such as , perhaps , pakistan we should only go in where we should and where we 're able to mr gibson let me mr giuliani charlie \? mr gibson yeah , go ahead mr giuliani just make one point ron s analysis is really seriously flawed the idea that the attack took place because of american foreign policy is precisely the reason i handed back a 10 million check to a saudi prince , who gave me that money at ground zero for the twin towers fund and then put out a press release saying america should change its foreign policy it seems to me if you do n't face this squarely , to have an islamic terrorist threat against us , it s an existential threat , it has nothing to do with our foreign policy it has to do with their ideas , their theories , the things that they have done \( and in \? \) the way they 've perverted their religion into a hatred of us and what s at stake are the things that are best about us our freedom of religion , our freedom for women , our right to vote , our free economic system our foreign policy is irrelevant , totally irrelevant if you read what they write , if you bother to listen to what they say , this comes out of their own perverted thinking rep paul charlie mr gibson go ahead rep paul let me try to explain so you can understand this better try to visualize how we would react if they did that to us if a country , say china , came that great distance across the ocean , and they say , we want you to live like us , we want you to have our economic system , we want bases on your land , we want to protect our oil , even if we do that with good intentions , even if the chinese did that with good intentions , we would all be together and we 'd be furious mr romney ron ron , you 're reading you 're reading their propaganda rep paul what would you do mr romney i 'd read their i 'd read their i 'd read their writings i 'd read what they write to one another , and that s why when someone like sayyid qutb lays out the philosophy of radical jihadism and says we want to kill rep paul and what you 're saying mr romney let me complete wants to kill anwar sadat when there s the assassination of anwar sadat , it has nothing to do with us the reason why did they kill madame bhutto \? it has nothing to do with us this has to do with a battle that is going on within the world of islam of radical violent jihadists trying to bring down all moderate islamic people and nations and replace them with a religious caliphate rep paul but this means mr romney and we are doing our very best to help support the voices of moderation mr thompson who had we invaded before 9 11 mr romney they tried it in the philippines rep paul we were occupying we had an air base mr thompson occupying rep paul in saudi arabia mr thompson a base rep paul we have propped up how many governments have we propped up \? mr gibson before we start with governor huckabee , i owe you a few seconds because you somebody said no or senator thompson said we 're not arrogant we do n't have bunker mentality just take a few seconds mr huckabee well , in those words first of all , governor romney , you yourself on 60 minutes said that we had left iraq in a mess you 've also said that you were n't going to have this my way or no way philosophy , and i 've been attacked for using the words policy that had an arrogance and bunker mentality i did n't say the president was i supported the president and the war before you did i supported the surge when you did n't i'm not a person who is out there taking cheap shots at the president i worked really hard to get him elected , but i'm not running for george bush s third term i want to be president of the united states on my own terms and i think it s important for us to recognize that mr romney charlie , i get to i get to respond to that mr huckabee let me finish this when when congressman paul mr paul and i get a chance to respond \( laughter \) mr huckabee you 'll all get a chance to respond mr romney i'm out of time mr huckabee before it s over , i'm sure but mr romney governor governor mr huckabee the fact is when there is a when there is a serious threat to this country , it is not a threat because we happen to be peaceloving people it s a threat because in the heart of the radical islamic faith not all islam , and that s what s very important this is n't an islamic problem this is a jihadist problem this is an islamofascism problem and if you read the writings of those who most influenced and governor romney mentioned said qutub , executed in egypt in 1966 he is one of the major philosophers behind this and the fact is , there is nothing about our attacking them that prompts this they are prompted by the fact they believe that they must establish a worldwide caliphate that has nothing to do with us other than we live and breathe , and their intention is to destroy us mr gibson very quickly , you went after governor romney mr romney yeah , a number a number of things i disagree with the governor writing in foreign affairs magazine that the president s administration suffers from an arrogant bunker mentality mr huckabee did you read the article before you commented on it \? mr romney i did read the article mr huckabee the entire article , before you commented on it mr romney i read the entire article , and i thought it well , i wo n't make any further comments it was not mr huckabee before you commented on it mr romney before i got a copy of the article and read the article and in the in the headline of the article , it said that the bush the bush mr paul did you read mine \? \( laughter \) mr gibson i 've got to i 've got to mr romney john \? no , no , hold on john no , i did n't , sorry \( laughter \) what i read is and number two mr paul what about mine \? mr romney number two number two , i did support the surge rep paul unknown mr romney it was senator mccain of all of us who was out fighting for the surge he was right on that on the same day the president announced the surge , i also having spoken that day with fred kagan , who is one of the brilliant theorists in this regard , i laid out my plan that i thought made sense actually , even before the president s speech calling for additional troops i called for a different number so i also supported the surge from the very beginning but look , i you know , governor mr huckabee i'm way over mr romney do n't try and characterize my position of course , this war has mr huckabee which one \? \( scattered laughter \) mr romney you know you know , we 're wise to talk about policies and not to make personal attacks mr huckabee well , it s not a personal attack , mitt , because you also supported a timed withdrawal and senator pryor , from my state mr romney no , that s mr huckabee was praising you for that , and mr romney i do not i do not support and have never support a timed withdrawal so that s wrong , governor you know , it s it s really helpful if you talk about your policies and the things you believe and let me talk about my policies and my policy is i 've never talked about a time withdrawal with a date certain for us to leave that s not the case simply wrong i 've also supported the troop surge , governor , and i supported it on the same day the president brought it forward and the critical thing here is for us to stand together and to say i think we do agree with troop surge we believe that the troop surge is going to make an enormous difference for the world and protect us from the establishment of safe havens from which al qaeda could launch attacks against us mr gibson very quickly rep paul there s there s always a radical element in almost all all religions they have to have an incentive we give them that incentive the question that you do n't are n't willing to ask is , why is it that they attack america \? i mean , they do n't attack the canadians they do n't attack the swiss if it were merely because they want to go into europe , why do they mr romney is it such a puzzle , is it such a mystery as to why they attack america \? mr giuliani they attacked israelis , they attacked bali rep paul it is mr romney they 're not going after luxembourg \( laughter \) mr giuliani ron ron rep paul it is because we 've gone six mr romney we 're the strongest nation in the world mr giuliani ron ron , it is simply not true islamic terrorists killed over 500 americans before september 11 , 2001 , going back to the late 1960s they have also killed people recently in bali , in london they have launched attacks in germany where did the attack on the munich olympics take place \? in the united states \? or did it take place in germany \? mr gibson all right , let me stop this mr giuliani i could go on and on the attack on leon klinghoffer mr gibson let me mr giuliani islamic terrorists have attacked rep paul you paint all islamics the same way mr giuliani all over the world mr romney no , of course not rep paul they absolutely do not mr romney of course not mr gibson gentlemen , i rep paul what you 're doing is damaging our relationship by destroying our relationship with all muslims mr giuliani i do not rep paul that s what you 're doing mr gibson time time mr thompson charlie , you started it mr gibson i did start it , yes i did \( laughter \) mr charlie , you wanted a freeforall mr giuliani it is important to make this point just the opposite , ron i have great respect for the islamic religion i have great respect for the arab world , for the middle east i think we should be closer to them i think we should trade more with them i think we should have cultural exchanges with them the overwhelming majority of the islamic world rep paul why do we support their dictators , then \? why do we prop up all their dictators \? mr giuliani and on the evening of september 11 , 2001 , the day my city was attacked , i got on television and i said to the people of my city , we 're not going to engage in group blame this is a small group of people this does not typify a great religion and a great people mr gibson i'm going to mr giuliani i do not accept that criticism rep paul \( off mike \) mr romney \( \? \) we 're going to miss you tomorrow night \( laughter \) mr gibson i'm going to move on to domestic policy , and i'm going to violate a promise that i made to all of your campaigns i promised that we would n't do any questions on videotape questions from somebody outside this room but i'm going to violate it with a question from the president of the united states , who posed a question that i think is important about all of you posed a question at his last news conference about what he thought candidates ought to be as they ran take a look president bush \( from videotape \) you ca n't be the president unless you have a firm set of principles to guide you as you sort through all the problems the world faces and i would be very hesitant to support somebody who relied upon opinion polls and focus groups to define a way forward for a president it is and so my question to if i were asking questions to people running for office , i 'd say what are the principles that will stand on in good times and bad times \? what would be the underpinning of of of your decisions \? mr gibson what are the principles , and are they constant \? you all have been questioning as i 've watched you campaign , you 've all been questioning your opponents and i'm going to ask senator mccain , you and governor romney , because you two have been going at each other in interviews and in ads about this , of the constancy of your principles , or whether or not you look to opinion polls and focus groups to make up your minds so let me have the two of you dialogue with each other about this and answer the president s questions , and then i 'll bring the other four in and give them equal time sen mccain the principles and philosophy that i hold i 've held since i raised my hand at age 17 to as a midshipman in the united states naval academy to uphold this nation s honor , to serve it , call americans to sacrifice and serve for their nation and defend the greatest nation in the history of the world now we need to restore trust and confidence in government now we are in a titanic transcendent struggle of the 21st century , which we have been discussing earlier i believe for the last 20 years i 've been engaged in every major national security issue that has affected this nation , and i have been involved in many of the decisions as to how those are handled and i , again , say that i'm glad to know that now everybody supported the surge i said at the time that general petraeus and his strategy must be employed , and i was criticized by republicans at that time and that was a low point , but stuck to it i did n't change i did n't say we needed a secret plan for withdrawal i said that we can prevail , and as general petraeus has said , this is the central front in the battle against radical islamic extremists we are succeeding , and i believe that if we 'd have done what the democrats had wanted to do , al qaeda would be trumpeting to the world that they defeated the united states of america so my principles and my philosophy are those embodied in those words that we believe that all of us are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights i will defend those i believe in them and i believe america s best days are ahead of us mr romney charlie , when i sat down with my family and had the discussion about whether or not to get into this race , we went around the room , and each one of my five sons and five daughtersinlaw expressed their views and it s because of them and because of my concern about the future of america that i'm in this race i'm convinced that america is the greatest nation on earth , that we are a good nation and a strong nation and we are safe and prosperous , in part , because of our greatness and our strength i'm concerned , though , right now we face challenges of such an unprecedented nature that unless we deal with them honestly and effectively , america will become less of a nation that it needs to be to preserve the peace here and the peace around the world and i believe it s essential for america to stand for principles of an eternal nature i think at the heart of our strength is the family i do n't think there s anything more important to the future of america than the work that s going on within the four walls of the american home i think we have to strengthen america s families i think we have to have good schools and good health care for moms and dads tending to the needs of kids , that we have to have better schools and better health care i believe also that this nation has to have a strong and vibrant economy i do n't think we can lead the world unless we have the leading economy and finally , a strong military to keep us safe so my overriding principle is keeping america the strongest nation on earth and there will be a lot of choices and pulls and tugs in different directions but keeping america strong through all those elements , through our families and our values , through our economy and its vibrancy and through our military is what is essential to me for the future of this land mr gibson all right let me turn to mayor giuliani i must say , you do n't sound like two guys who have sniping at one another over and over in your ads and interviews you sound different mayor giuliani mr giuliani i think what the president had in mind is that at the core of leadership is knowing what you believe , standing for something ronald reagan was my hero in that respect i wrote about it in my book leadership and i think one of the things president bush was getting at is that too many people in politics today put their finger up and go with the poll you know , you can see it in some of our democratic colleagues changing their position mr gibson but let me interrupt you for a moment mr giuliani what do i stand for \? i laid out 12 commitments to the american people i wrote them out the first one is the most important keeping this country on offense in the islamic terrorist war against us the rest of them lay out what i believe this country has to do over the next four years that would be my guidepost if i'm elected president , i 'll put that card on my desk , and every day i will try to accomplish it end illegal immigration , solve health care through private options , reduce taxes , reduce the size of government on the civilian side , expand the military , appoint strict constructionist judges these will be the beliefs that i have , the way that ronald reagan got elected to increase the size of the military , to reduce taxes mr gibson let me interrupt you for just a second because with all due respect , many of your fellows here on this stage have said you 've had to moderate an awful lot of your views to get within the mainstream of the republican party and that you do n't believe now what you believed when you were mayor governor huckabee , you 've been accused of having been a taxand spend governor when you were in arkansas and changing your beliefs now governor romney , i do n't have to go into how many times they 've called you a flipflopper in terms of issues and what you believed as governor of massachusetts congressman paul , respect to you , i do n't know that you 've changed much except your party \( laughter \) because you were a libertarian when you first ran for president senator thompson has been accused of running on a more conservative record for president than when he was in the senate and senator mccain , you 've been accused of moderating your views on the bush tax policies in order to get into the mainstream of the party and on immigration to moderate your views mr giuliani charlie , that s the reason why you lay out the things that you believe in there are beliefs that you have that you 're not going to vary from , no matter what the winds of change bring about there are some that you are going to change look at ronald reagan ronald reagan had three prime goals to increase the size of the military to win the cold war , to reduce taxes , and to reduce the deficit he accomplished two of the three the third one he was n't able to accomplish , probably because the first two , in his view , were more important so you ca n't accomplish every single thing that you want over a period of time , your views on things are going to change but if your essential philosophy stays the same , the way it did with ronald reagan , the way it did with our great president , that s what leadership is about mr gibson governor huckabee mr huckabee well , charlie , i think the question the president was asking is not as much about our policies because those can change with each generation , with each year , with each circumstances but the principles what is it that s deep inside of us that that guide us , that direct us , that show the framework of what we 're going to do and i think the simple answer for me is all the way back to the document that gave us birth and it goes like this that we hold these truths to be selfevident , that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights , these being life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness that we are created equal in that sense of equality , the greatest principle is that every human being and every american is equal to each other one person is not more equal because of his net worth or because of his iq or because of his ancestry or last name that was a radical idea when those 56 signers put their names on that document knowing that if their experiment in government did n't work , they were going to die for it those are principles those are things that you 'll live for , you 'll die for that sense that all of us have an essence of equality and that the primary purpose of a government is to recognize that those rights did not come from government , they came from god , they 're to be protected and then defined as the right to a life the right to liberty , our freedom , to live our lives like we want to live them without government telling us how to do it and ultimately not to be happy , but to have the pursuit of happiness that s our principle mr gibson and i take your statement it is an interesting statement of the basis that we all believe in this country but you started by saying , but we can change our policies how often did you say \? mr huckabee our policies often reflect what s going on at the time for example , if the primary thing we are facing is war , then we 're going to be talking about military size and military might if we have a problem with illegal immigration , the number one issue right now might be securing the borders i'm not saying we change our positions , but we change the policies in terms of the priority but those principles do n't change the principles are still to make sure that we recognize the equality of each other and that we recognize where those rights come from and what those rights are mr gibson senator thompson \? mr thompson everyone has kind of a wish list i think it s most important , though , that a president of the united states understand that our principles our first principles are based on the constitution of the united states , understanding the nature of our government , the checks and the balances , the separation of powers that our founding fathers set up a long time ago there s a reason for that they knew about human nature they learned from the wisdom of the ages they set the government up according to that they set the powers out in the constitution of the federal government and they basically said , if the powers are n't delineated in this document , they do n't exist and then we got the 10th amendment that says if they 're not delineated , they belong to the people and to the states that s fundamental to everything else and then we grew from that principles , such as a dollar belongs in the pocket of the person that earned it unless the government can make a case that it can spend it better you do n't spend money that you do n't have and you certainly do n't spend your grandchildren s money with debt that they 're not at the table when the decision has been made to spend it mr gibson i'm going to run out of time on this , but i want to come back to that point go ahead rep paul the president asks a very important question , and we should all come together and we should n't have that many disagreements because we should be bound down by the constitution but the people in this country think we live in an age of relative ethics , is what they 've kind of come to the conclusion of sure , profess to believe in the constitution , but why have we gone to war since world war ii without a declaration of war \? why do we have a monetary system that is not designed by the constitution \? why do we have a welfare state running out of control not designed by the constitution \? you ca n't pay lip service to the constitution without obeying it and we should have peace and prosperity that should be our goal we in foreign policy ought to have a golden rule we ought to treat others as we would want others to treat us , and we do n't treat others so fairly we treat them like we 're the bully , that we 're the policeman of the world , and we 're going to tell them to behave if we do n't if they do n't listen to us , we bomb them if they listen to us , we give them more money and it s bankrupting this country because we do n't live up to our principles the principles are embedded in our constitution mr gibson let me turn for the next few moments to health care the democrats have talked a lot about this and they have spelled out some pretty specific health care plans but what you propose , what you have talked about in terms of health care in many ways represents a more basic change in the way health insurance would be obtained little background on that abc s medical editor , dr tim johnson dr tim johnson \( from videotape \) in general , republicans have criticized democratic proposals for health care reform as radical expansions of the federal government s role but many health care experts say that it is actually the republicans' emphasis on individuals buying their own policies versus getting their insurance through employers that is a more radical change and it raises concerns individual policies can be more expensive for the same coverage because of administrative overhead and sales costs group policies , like those provided by employers , can bargain with providers for lower costs and do a better job of monitoring quality medical professionals caution that individual insurance may sound good on paper but it usually turns out to be very difficult for people on their own to find quality policies medical professionals caution that individual insurance may sound good on paper , but it usually turns out to be very difficult for people on their own to find quality policies at the right cost charlie mr gibson all right dr tim johnson , thanks very much we 're the only industrialized nation in the world that does n't insure all of our citizens if we can afford a trilliondollar war in iraq , why ca n't we afford medical insurance for everybody \? governor or mayor mr mayor mr giuliani the reality is that , with all of its infirmities and difficulties , we have the best health care system in the world and it may be because we have a system that still is , if not holy , at least in large part still private to go in the direction that the democrats want to go much more government care , much more government medicine , socialized medicine is going to mean a deteriorated state of medicine in this country i mean , i said jokingly in one debate , if we go in the direction of socialized medicine , where will canadians come for health care \? \( laughter \) and the reality and the reality is mr gibson but do you all do you all agree that we have the best health care system in the world \? mr sure mr yes sen mccain now tell me , when people get sick where they come to to get health care \? i mr thompson we certainly have the best health care rep paul it s mr romney charlie , it that does n't mean it should n't be improved and i think i think that the notion of people buying their own private health insurance is a very good one , so long as a lot of them do it only 17 million americans right now buy their own the only thing that reduces cost and increases quality is a significant , dramatic , large consumer market , not government control mr gibson you all have proposed free market , consumer purchased insurance , and you all talk about giving tax deductions for buying insurance let me do a little math the average family employerprovided insurance , when the companies buy it , it s 13 , 000 a family now , you 've talked about a 15 \( thousand \) to 20 , 000dollar deduction , right , for people buying their own insurance \? if you take a medianincome family of 62 , 000 in this country , you 've just saved them 3 , 000 on their taxes that does n't come close to buying an insurance policy sen mccain sure and next year , if you continue 10 percent inflation associated with it , it 'll be even further away , and the next year after that because the problem with health care in america is not the quality it is the inflation and in all due respect to your expert that we just saw , he s talking about the wrong aspect of this issue the right aspect of this issue is inflation if we could get it under control and get it reduced so that health care costs are reasonable in america , then those people will be able to afford it mr gibson and to get health care costs sen mccain and they can and they will be able to go out and choose their insurer anywhere in america and they will be able then to get affordable health care in america but we have to make the recipient of the health care more responsible we have to have outcomebased results for health care we have to emphasize wellness and fitness one of the most disturbing things in america is the increase in diabetes , obesity and high blood pressure amongst young younger americans so we have to reward wellness and fitness mr huckabee charlie , the problem you made a statement about european nations they all get health care well , somebody some people here in new hampshire have been to canada i do n't think they want that system mr that s not europe mr romney a lot of people have ideas about health care and improving health care we took the ideas and actually made them work in our state as people in new hampshire know , we put in place a plan that gets every citizen in our state health insurance , and it did n't cost us new money and it did n't require us to raise taxes what we found was it was less expensive or no more expensive to help individuals who had been uninsured buy their own private policy than it had been for us to give out free care at the hospital and since we 've put our plan in place last april , we 've now had 300 , 000 people who were uninsured sign up for this insurance private insurance and where the doctor , the good doctor was wrong is that it s true the insurance companies do n't want to sell policies to one person at a time it s expensive we established what we called a connector a place where individuals could go to buy policies from any company , and that connector would , in turn , send their premiums on to those companies so the economics of scale existed and as a result of what we did , the premiums for health insurance for an individual buying insurance when from 350 a month to 180 a month , with lower deductibles and now with prescription drugs mr gibson anybody mr romney the answer let me just i just , i want to underline this we do n't have to have government take over health care to get everybody insured that s what the democrats keep on hanging out there the truth is we can get everybody insured in a free market way we do n't need hillarycare or socialized medicine rep paul charlie , you really answered the question you answered it in your question , because you said how can we afford a trilliondollar war and we ca n't afford health care \? well , that s the reason the resources are going overseas we 're fighting a trillion dollar war , and we should n't be doing it those resources should be spent back here at home there is an inflationary factor we ca n't afford it we do have good medical care , but the costs are so high now that our people in this country are actually going to india and getting their heart surgery done they pay the plane ticket , the hospital , and the hotel and they get it for half price so it s inflation but if you do n't understand how inflation comes , we ca n't solve this problem it comes from deficit financing with this warmongering foreign policy we have we run up the deficits we tax we borrow we borrow from the chinese we ca n't borrow enough then what do we do \? we print the money , and then you wonder where the inflation comes \? the value of the dollar goes down and prices go up where the government gets involved in certain things , like housing or medical care or education prices are skyrocketing so you have to deal with the monetary issue to solve the problem of the medical issue mr gibson senator thompson mr thompson hmm \( laughter \) rep paul do n't print any more money we do n't need any more money mr thompson so if we would stop printing so much money , we could get out of the war and provide health care to everybody \? \( laughter \) rep paul if we get out of the war , we would n't have to print the money mr thompson okay i just wanted to make i just wanted to rep paul what s wrong with backing the money by something mr gibson all right , let him go let him mr thompson i wanted to make sure i wanted to make sure i had this right let me let me break it down a little bit so i can understand it a little bit better rep paul keep trying mr thompson we 've got the best health care in the world it costs more than it should we can either go one of two ways we can let the government take it over , and that 'll lower costs , like like they do in other countries we will also sacrifice care , which nobody wants to do we 're not going to do in this country or we can make the markets work more efficiently there are a lot of components to that part of that is not just giving a tax break to the individual that s part of it , but it s also putting them in a position to get the best prices for the care they 're getting we do that in every other aspect of our life that s what keeps prices as low as they are i mean , if if if the consumer had no concept of what the product was costing and did no shopping for it , when you could get an mri here for one price or over here for half the price , you do n't even know that to make the choice , that would n't work at all so you can do that you can open up these markets so a person can buy their insurance from all over the country we 've got various state regulations now that , as a practical matter , prohibit that and make the markets work but we 're never let s be honest with the people we 're probably never if you lower costs , more people who want insurance we 'll be able to afford it we 're probably never going to achieve total coverage a good number of the people who are uninsured can afford to choose not to do so a good number of people are eligible for government assisted \( off mike \) mr gibson \( off mike \) governor romney \( off mike \) mandate and that s an obstacle , although you 've backed away from mandates on a national basis mr romney no , no , i like mandates do the mandates work \? mandates mr thompson i beg your pardon \? \( laughter \) mr romney let me mr thompson i did n't know you were going to admit that mr romney let me oh , absolutely mr thompson you like mandates mr romney let me tell you what kind of mandates i like , fred , which is this mr thompson and what did you come up with \? \( laughter \) mr romney here s my view if somebody can afford insurance and decides not to buy it and then they get sick , they ought to pay their own way as opposed to expect the government to pay their way , and that s an american principle that s a principle of personal responsibility so i said this if you can afford to buy insurance , then buy it you do n't have to if you do n't want to buy it , but then you 've got to put enough money aside that you can pay your own way , because what we 're not going to do is say , as we saw more and more people mr sen governor , you imposed tax tax penalties in massachusetts \( inaudible \) mr romney yeah , we said , look , if people can afford to buy it , either buy the insurance or pay your own way do n't be free riders and pass on the cost of your health care to everybody else mr thompson the government is going to make you buy insurance mr romney no , the government s going to mr thompson i mean the state your state plan , which is , of course , different from your national plan , did require people to make that choice , though the state required them to do that what was the penalty if they refused \? mr romney they refused to pay let s go back , fred what s what s your view \? if somebody if somebody mr thompson well , i asked question first mr romney no , okay \( laughter \) well , i 'll answer your question , you answer mine if somebody is making , let s say , 100 , 000 a year and does n't have health insurance and they show up at the hospital and they need a thousanddollar repair of some kind for something that s gone wrong and they say , look , i'm not insured , i'm not going to pay do you think they should pay or not \? mr thompson did your plan cut people off at 100 , 000 \? was that the level \? mr romney no , actually mr thompson does it only apply to people with 100 , 000 income and over \? mr romney it actually applies to people at three times federal poverty they pay for their own policy at less than three times federal poverty , we help them buy policies so everybody is insured and everybody is able to buy a policy that s affordable for them and the question is this , again if someone can afford a policy and they choose not to buy it , should they be responsible for paying for their own care , or should they be able to go to the hospital and say , you know what , i'm not insured , you ought to pay for it \? what we found was one quarter of the uninsured in my state were making 75 , 000 a year or more , and my view is they should either buy insurance or they should pay their own way with a health savings account or some other savings account mr gibson we have an expression in television we get into the weeds we 're in the weeds now on this \( laughter \) mr gibson but let just come to one point yes or no \? in your national plan , would you mandate people to get insurance \? mr romney i 'd have i think my plan is a good plan that should be adopted by the states i would n't tell every state mr gibson would you mandate mr romney i would not mandate at the federal level that every state do what we do , but what i would say at the federal level is we 'll keep giving you these special payments we make if you adopt plans that get everybody insured i want to get everybody insured in governor schwarzenegger s state , he s got a different plan to get people insured i would n't tell him he has to do it my way , but i 'd say each state needs to get busy on the job of getting all our citizens insured it does not cost more money mr gibson i want to give governor huckabee a little time , and then we 've got to go mr huckabee okay i think it s important to realize that the issue is not just insurance the issue is that the whole model of our health care system is upside down we really do n't have a health care system we have a disease care system and the insurance model that we use , we act like that if we insured everybody we 've fixed it , we have n't , because the real problem is that our model , both in the insurance model and the health care model , waits until people are catastrophically ill before it intervenes and we really have to change the concept to a preventative focus rather than an intervention focus , and that means the entire system starts working on health and wellness because 80 percent of the 2 trillion that we spend on health care goes to chronic disease we could prevent it or we could cure it , but we do n't so it s not an issue of there s not enough money to cover people but if a real health care system exists it has three components it has affordability , it has quality and it has accessibility and if it does n't have those elements , it s not a system , it s a maze , and what we have in america is a health care maze it s built on the idea that we wait until people are so desperately ill that the cost to try to fix them is catastrophic and out of control , and no wonder we have a system that needs major , major attention and by the way , just out of due respect , you said a thousand dollars for a repair it s about a thousand dollars for a kleenex at a hospital and more \( light laughter \) and that s why we need to have a totally different system that keeps you from going to the hospital in the first place mr gibson and i thought mr giuliani charlie , a health savings account actually helps to accomplish what the governor is talking about if somebody can put aside and the plans that we 've been talking about include a health savings account you 'd have a you 'd have an exemption up to 15 , 000 \( dollars \) if you could find a policy for 11 , 000 \( dollars \) , you could have a 4 , 000 health savings account you would be able to buy some of your health care and your prevention yourself it gives you an incentive over a lifetime to deal with wellness mr gibson and i i 've got to go , but senator mccain has talked a lot about controlling costs , and you bring up in controlling costs and all the experts say to me , look , if you 're going to control costs , you 've got to do three things you 're going to limit access to technology you 're going to limit in some way , change the reimbursement system for doctors and hospitals or you 're going to have limit the amount of treatments that s the only way we can bring costs down , and that s the third rail of health here which of you is going to touch any of that \? mr huckabee charlie , that s not at all what the debate is the fact is you sen mccain with all due respect , i thought i was i the question mr gibson i'm sorry , yeah , it was turned to you , yes \( laughter \) sen mccain i think that there s additional choice here , a choice of having outcomebased treatment there are five major diseases that consume 75 percent of health care costs in america if someone has diabetes , we should give the health care provider a certain amount of money and say , care for that patient and , if at the end of that period of time , then and that patient is well , we 'll give you a reward , rather than every test , every procedure , every mri and we need walkin clinics , and we need community health care , and we need incentives for home health care as opposed to longterm care in my state of arizona , we adopted a proposal which incentivizes health care providers to keep people in home health care settings dramatically less expensive than longterm care in arizona we have onehalf the number per capita of people in longterm care facilities as the state of pennsylvania incentives to keep costs down , charlie there are no incentives in the system today could i just mention one other thing \? both the attorney general of south carolina i do n't know why i mention south carolina mr gibson because there s a primary there \( laughter \) sen mccain and the attorney general of iowa and i do n't well , anyway mr gibson \( \? \) that s too late \( laughter \) sen mccain have sued have sued the pharmaceutical companies because of overcharging of millions of dollars of medicaid costs to their patients how should that how could that happen \? how could pharmaceutical companies be able to cover up the cost to the point where nobody knows \? why should n't we be able to reimport drugs from canada \? it s because of the power of the pharmaceutical companies and we should have people pharmaceutical companies competing to take care of our medicare and medicaid patients mr okay , do n't leave me mr romney do n't turn the pharmaceutical companies into the big bad guys i sen mccain well , they are mr romney no , actually they 're trying to create products to make us well and make us better , and they 're doing the work of the free market and are there excesses \? i'm sure there are , and we should go after excesses but they 're an important industry to this country but let me note something else , and that is , the market will work and the reason health care is n't working like a market right now is you have 47 million people that are saying , i'm not going to play i'm just going to get free care paid for by everybody else that does n't work number two , the buyer does n't have information about what the cost or quality is of different choices they could have if you take the government out of it to a much greater extent you 'd get it to work like a market and we 'll rein in costs mr gibson i 've got to call a halt we 're going to take a commercial break we 'll come back i'm going to be joined by scott spradling from wmur , and we 're going to go to some more direct questions stay with us the republican debate continues from manchester \( announcements \) mr gibson for the second 45 minutes of this debate i'm going be joined by scott spradling , who is political director of our station , wmur , here in manchester , new hampshire and i would say during that threeminute break that all of the candidates headed for the wings , and i thought it might just be the two of us here for the last 45 minutes \( laughter \) and i'm so relieved to say that they all came back senator mccain , senator thompson , congressman paul , governor romney and governor huckabee , mayor giuliani it s good to have all of you with us we 're going to do some more direct questions we 've got tally lights this time we 're going to limit you in the length of your answers , and if you want to respond in these first questions , you 're certainly welcome to do so why do n't you start , scott \? mr spradling senator mccain , good evening sen mccain good evening , scott mr spradling i'm struck by the fact that we 're on the saint anselm campus , and a few months ago you took some hits in a debate that you had here with your fellow republicans on the issue of illegal immigration and yours views since that debate sen mccain i should n't have come back mr spradling \( laughs , laughter \) since that debate , sir , you 've told voters i hear you you 've acknowledged some of these complaints and there s more talk , i know , from you about stronger borders that s a big focus in this debate but fundamentally , i'm wondering , do n't you still have the same plan for a path to citizenship that you fundamentally held months ago \? sen mccain sure , but the fact is that the american people have lost trust and confidence in government , and we have to secure the borders first i come from a border state i'm very aware of the challenges we face and the impact of illegal immigration so we will secure the borders first as president , i will have the border state governors certify that those borders are secure and of course , in the course of our debates and discussions and with secretary chertoff , he said that there s 2 million people who are in this country illegally who have committed crimes those people have to be deported immediately and i do believe we need a temporary worker program , one with an employee employee employment electronic employment verification system and tamperproof biometric documents so that the only document and that system can an employer legally hire somebody , and any employer who employs someone in any other way will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law now , i want to say again , we this is a national security issue we have to secure our borders but i want to say again , these are god s children we have to address it in as humane and compassionate an issue as possible but we have to respect our nation s security requirements so i think that it s time republican and democrat sat down together and resolved this issue because if you got broken borders and if you have 12 million people here illegally , then obviously you have de facto amnesty it is a federal responsibility the federal government s government must act i will act as president mr gibson we got the tally lights this time governor \? sen mccain oh , i'm sorry i'm sorry , charlie mr gibson that s all right mr romney i disagree fundamentally with the idea that the 12 million people who 've come here illegally should all be allowed to remain in the united states permanently , potentially some of them applying for citizenship and becoming citizens , others just staying permanently i think that is a form of amnesty and that is not appropriate we 're a nation of laws our liberty mr do you want mr romney our liberty our liberty is based upon being a nation of laws i would welcome those people to get in line with everybody else who wants to come here permanently but there should be no special pathway to permanent residency or citizenship for those that have come here illegally i welcome legal immigration of course we need to secure the border , we need to need to have an employment verification system with a card to identify who s here legally and not legally we need to have employers sanctioned that hire people that then do n't have the legal card but with regards to those already here , it is simply not right , and unfair , to say they 're going to all get to stay , where there are people around the world who 've been waiting in line to come to this country they should have the first chance , not those who came illegally sen mccain scott , can i respond to that \? mr spradling i have a question for both you and the mayor , and i 'd like to give it to the mayor first mayor giuliani , a point of specificity here do you believe that the illegals that have been identified in the us need to leave the united states and reapply for citizenship to come back into the country \? and if so , for how long \? mr giuliani what i believe should happen is we should stop illegal immigration at the border , and we should begin doing it now we should erect a fence we should erect a technological fence we should expand the border patrol we should have a border \( status system \? \) we should have a rule that you cannot come into the united states without identifying yourselves , which , after all , is the rule in every other country , just about and then we should operate that for two , three , four years , change behavior , and then we should take that system , with a tamper proof id card which would be used for people coming into this country and what we should do with the people that are here first of all , right now our priority should be , since you ca n't throw out all 12 million people , whether governor romney would like to do that or not , or anybody else would , you just ca n't do it it s not physically possible to do i would focus on the illegal immigrants that are here who have committed crimes they should be given priority that s a number we can deal with that s a number we can throw out then what i would do with the people that are here , when you had a good system place and i believe my plan is the best plan for doing that , and these are the kinds of things i achieved in the other jobs that i 've had in my life , as mayor and associate attorney general i think what you would do then is you would say to the 12 million people that are here , come forward , get a tamperproof id card , get fingerprinted , get photographed if they do n't come forward , then you throw them out of the country the ones who do come forward would have to pay taxes they 'd have to pay fines if you pay fines , it is not amnesty they would not get ahead of anybody else they 'd be at the back of the line but then they could eventually become citizens so long as they could read english , write english and speak english mr spradling thank you sen mccain let me just say i 've never supported amnesty a few nights ago , joe lieberman and i had a town hall meeting together it was a rather unusual event the issue came up joe lieberman said john mccain has never supported amnesty , and anybody says he does is a liar , he s lying now , no better authority than governor romney believe that it s not amnesty , because two years ago , he was asked , and he said that my plan was , quote , reasonable and was not amnesty it s a matter of record mr spradling governor , you want to explain your ad \? mr romney yeah , absolutely , which is what he describes is technically true , which is his plan does not provide amnesty , because he charges people 5 , 000 to be able to stay and that technically is sen mccain that s not true that s not complete , the response to it , and governor romney , it was explained to you , and you said it was reasonable and not amnesty that s just you can look it up mr giuliani you know , ronald reagan mr romney wait , wait , wait , wait , wait let me have a chance mr spradling go ahead mr giuliani one point mr romney rudy , rudy , let me have a chance to finish , okay \? you 'll get your chance i saw your plan along with senator cornyn s plan and the bush plan i said they were all reasonable and i said i would study them and decide which one to endorse , and i endorsed none of them , as you know , senator number two , your plan , i said , is not technically amnesty , because it provides for a penalty for people to be able to stay sen mccain it provides for more than a penalty mr romney okay , would you describe what else it has besides a penalty \? sen mccain sure fine , learn english , back of the line behind everybody else pretty much what rudy just described mr romney okay , great so it has sen mccain so that we can address the issue mr romney fine , it lets you pay 5 , 000 sen mccain and the fact is it s it not amnesty and for you to describe it as you do in the attack ads , my friend , you can spend your whole fortune on these attack ads , but it still wo n't be true mr giuliani may i make a mr romney no , no , no , no i get a chance to respond to this i'm sorry i'm sorry i do n't describe your plan as amnesty in my ad i do n't call it amnesty what i say is and you just described what most people would say is a form of amnesty yeah , they pay 5 , 000 , their background is checked , they have to learn english but your view is everybody who s come here illegally , today , other than criminals , would be allowed when they speak english and get 5 , 000 payment and they get a background check , they 're allowed to stay forever sen mccain look mr romney that s your plan , and that plan , in my view , is not appropriate those people should be invited to get in line outside the country with everybody else who wants to come here but they should not be given a special right to stay here sen mccain there is no special right associated with my plan i said they should not be in any way rewarded for illegal behavior mr romney are they sent home \? sen mccain they have to get in line mr romney are they sent home \? sen mccain behind everybody else mr romney are they sent home \? sen mccain some of them are , some of them are not , depending on their situation mr romney the last bill you put forth sen mccain a woman has been here for eight years mr romney i'm sorry , the last bill sen mccain and has a son fighting in iraq mr romney senator , the last bill you put forward sen mccain i'm not interested in calling her up calling up her son and telling i'm deporting his grandmother mr thompson excuse me , did n't did n't you just did n't you say mr that s a very emotional mr hold on mr gibson senator thompson mr thompson did n't you say republicans were making a terrible mistake if they were separating themselves with president bush on the illegal immigration issue \? mr romney no that was quoted in ap , it happened to be wrong let me \( laughs \) mr giuliani well , could i could i may i make my point mr romney that does happen from time to time but let me sen mccain when you change positions on issues from time to time , you will get misquoted \( laughter \) mr romney senator , is there a way to have this about issues and not about personal attacks \? i hope so , because i think we have some differences on issues sen mccain i do mr romney and let me tell you , the issue that s at stake here is do the people who come here illegally , the 12 million , are they allowed to stay in this country the rest of their life \? and the final bill you put forward in the united states senate was they got a z sen mccain the answer is that there was still negotiations and debating on that mr romney may i complete \? sen mccain the answer is we were still negotiating we were debating i'm saying that some people have to go back to the country mr romney i'm sorry there was a z visa the z visa was given to everybody sen mccain and it was having that some people have to go back first , as rudy said , we have to round up the 2 million who have committed crimes and deport them immediately mr romney let s not divert sen mccain and that is not amnesty for anyone mr gibson well , i do n't want to divert let me come back to your plan is it practical to take 12 million people and send them out of the country \? mr romney is it practical \? the answer is no the answer is no so here s why my plan works one , it says to those 12 million people they do not have the right , as they would under the final senate plan , to receive a z visa which was renewable indefinitely that meant these people could stay in the country forever that was what the plan did , and that s why talk radio and the american people went nuts sen mccain that s not the plan mr romney senator , you look up your z visa it is renewable indefinitely every illegal alien got to stay in the country forever , other than those that committed crimes mr gibson go ahead mr giuliani charlie , if ronald reagan were here , who we all invoke , he would grab the microphone , say it s my microphone , i paid for it and ronald reagan did amnesty he actually did amnesty mr romney yeah , yeah mr giuliani i think he 'd be in one of mitt s negative commercials \( laughter \) and he is the hero of our party none of us none of us has a perfect record on immigration , because this is a very complicated problem the thing that we have to do is we have to decide who has the best plan among all of us for fixing illegal immigration you 've got to stop it at the border , you 've got to stop it cold at the border , and then you have to have a rational system it is not amnesty if you charge i did this more in my life than i did politics , meaning law enforcement if you charge fines , if you have impositions of conditions , it is not amnesty ronald reagan gave amnesty saying they have to pay a fine , have to get on the back of the line , have a whole bunch of conditions mr romney i thought you said that was n't amnesty mr giuliani that is not amnesty mr romney okay \( laughs \) mr giuliani that is not amnesty if you have a fine , if you have conditions , if you have a whole bunch of steps that people have to go through , it is not amnesty ronald reagan gave amnesty , straightout amnesty mr thompson the question is are you rewarded for your illegal behavior in any way \? if the answer is yes , it s amnesty mr giuliani but if you have to pay a penalty for it , it is not for example mr thompson so you get allowed to but you can still stay in the country mr giuliani pay money , have to follow conditions mr thompson but you can still stay in the country mr giuliani well , but you have to pay penalties mr thompson but you can still stay in the country mr giuliani there are all different kinds of penalties mr spradling what would you do , senator \? mr giuliani someone gets amnesty from a crime mr sen what would you mr thompson you can have you can have you can have enforcement by attrition if you obey the law and you enforce the law that s on the books today if we started securing the border as we 're supposed to do and we 're all in agreement that it must be done now i mean , we arrest thousands over the years of people from countries that are state sponsors of terrorism i mean , it s essentially a national security issue as well as an issue of fairness , as well as a social issue with regard to what states and communities have to face nowadays and workers who are in competition with this if we enforce the borders so people could n't go back and forth , if we assisted employers with a system that we now have on the books , that 20 \( , 000 \) 30 , 000 employers now are using , a verification system so you could essentially punch a button , the homeland security folks will tell you whether or not this person is illegal on the front end and if we and if we stop sanctuary cities , where we 're telling the local people that you ca n't cooperate with the federal authorities , so and stop inducing people to come here with employment and protection under sanctuary cities , as mayor giuliani did when he was mayor of new york , then we would have we would have attrition of these numbers and start reversing them mr giuliani charlie \? rep paul \( \? \) our clock system our clock system is n't working mr gibson the interest of limiting these answers has gone just to mr \( off mike \) had a comment mr giuliani i have to answer that i have to answer that question new york city was not a sanctuary city new york city turned in the names of every single person who committed a crime or who was suspected of a crime mr thompson what about just being illegal \? mr giuliani well , new york city turned in the names of all people that were illegal with only three exceptions one exception was for children that were going to school we had 70 , 000 children of illegals i was not going to leave them on the street i am proud that i continued that policy it would have been inhumane to do anything else second mr thompson we passed a bill in 1996 mr giuliani let me let me finish let me finish second , we said if you come into a hospital and you need treatment for an emergency , you 'll be treated it would have been inhumane to do anything else and we said if you report crimes , we will take those reports and we wanted those reports of crimes because they helped us to reduce crime mr thompson well , go back and go back and look in the record in 1996 , congress the united states congress , when i was there , when i was in the senate , we passed a bill outlawing illegal amnesty in cities rudy went to court and sued to overturn what we passed in legislation we were n't trying to throw children out on the street either i think if you mr giuliani those were the three narrow categories that i was objecting to they all had to do with humane conditions it was a policy that mr thompson we were not for inhumane conditions we were not mr giuliani it would have been totally inhumane mr gibson governor huckabee sat there with a great smile just thinking okay , let them fight i'm going stay out of this \( laughter \) so i want to bring you in quickly and then congressman paul and then we 'll go we 'll move on mr huckabee as abraham lincoln said , if it were n't for the honor of it , i 'd just soon pass , when he was run out of town on the rail but let me join in on this \( laughter \) the fact is americans are upset about this issue because they feel like that we 've violated the rule of law every one of us , i think , agree that you have to secure the border , and until that s done , nothing makes sense that ought to be done it ought to be done with american workers , with american products , and it ought to be done immediately eighteen months ought to be the outside length of time if the empire state building can be built in 14 months , if some of the great works of this country can be built in a record period of time , i'm convinced we can secure our borders and i agree with senator thompson it s an issue of national security more than it is anything else but it s a matter of sealing the borders of our nation in a responsible way i think we ought to have a period of time in which people then return to their home country and get in the back of the line now , the reason i 've come to that conclusion is for a variety of focus , but here s part of it when people live in the united states , they ought to have their head up they ought not to live in fear every time they see a police car , they should n't run and hide nobody ought to live like that in this country and the only way we 're going to fix that is that people do it right and in order to do it right , they 're going to have to go back and get in the back of the line it s not an inhumane way i think it s the only way that makes sense and i want make one final point that i think ought to happen when we say , well , we ca n't round these people up and take them home we do n't have to , charlie you give them the option if you do n't do it the right way and then we catch you , you would be subject to deportation but if you do it the right way , then you 're going be able to live with your head up and live free in this country properly and it wo n't be that we have this huge problem and the resentment that goes with it and the final reason that s important i know you 're wanting me to finish and i'm doing it the reason that we 've got to do that is that when people say we ca n't get them we do n't have to for this simple principle the government did n't escort them over the border in the first place , so the government does n't have to take them back they got here on their own , and people can go back and start the process legally for their benefit and for everyone else s benefit mr gibson congressman paul \? rep paul i think there s two points i 'd like to make one , i get a little bit worried when we talk about the tamperproof id for illegals or immigrants because how do you do that \? anybody that is an immigrant or looks like an immigrant would have to have an id , and then you ca n't discriminate , so everyone s going to have the id i think it s opening the door for the national id , and we should be very , very careful about that but one thing that we have n't talked about here is about the economics of illegal immigration you ca n't solve this problem as long as you have the runaway welfare state and the excessive spending and the wiping out of the middle class through inflation because that s what directs the hostility is people are hurting and then when we have all these mandates on the hospitals and on our schools , and no wonder the incentives are there there s an incentive for a lot of our people not to work because they can get welfare , and there s a lot of incentive because they know they 're going to get amnesty we gave it to the illegals in the '80s , and then we put mandates on the states to compel them to have medical care , and you say , well , that s compassionate but what happens if the hospital closes and then the people here in this country do n't get medical care \? so you ca n't divorce it from the economics you 've got to get rid of the incentives no amnesty and no forced benefits because obviously they 'll bring their families and it just wo n't work if you try to see this in a vacuum , and you have to deal with it as a whole as an economic issue as well mr romney charlie , can we just underscore we 're talking about illegal immigration mr gibson yes mr romney and i think every person on this stage wants the community to understand that legal immigration , we value it s great for the country we welcome legal immigration every single one of us no difference on that we get twisted on this outside mr gibson so noted so noted so noted mr romney we are very much in favor of legal immigration it s a great source of vitality for our country mr spradling governor romney , i'm going to stay with you in charlie s health care dialogue in the first half you mentioned hillary care this group has aimed a lot of partisan firepower at hillary clinton , but i 'd like , if you do n't mind , to adjust the outcome for a minute and walk down this road with me let s say that barack obama is the nominee he won the iowa caucus we have a wmur poll out just tonight that shows it s tied here in new hampshire , 33 \( percent \) to 33 \( percent \) and i 'd like to know from you why , against you as the nominee down the line , why not vote for barack obama \? and not just because he s a democrat you 're not allowed to say that \( laughs \) mr romney \( laughs \) mr spradling i 'd like to hear some specifics on why not him mr romney well , we have very different views on a whole series of issues , and i could take you through one by one one would be health care , for instance he wants the government to take over health care , spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone that will be that will break the bank if you think as the comedian said pj o'rourke if you think health care is expensive now , just wait 'til it s free \( laughter \) all right \? so that s not the right direction but there so we could talk about issues , but the biggest difference i think and it s going to be true for me and others who talk about it is that this is a time when america wants change washington is broken that was the message coming out of iowa i 've heard it across the country washington is broken not just the white house , not just congress washington ca n't get the job done on immigration , on lowering taxes , on fixing schools , on getting health care , on overcoming radical jihad they want change barack obama looked at several senators steeped in long history in the senate and completely blew them away in the iowa caucus it s a message of change and when we sit down and talk about change barack obama and myself , in that final debate , as you 're positing i can say , not only can i talk change with you , i 've lived it in the private sector for 25 years , i brought change to company after company in the olympics it was in trouble i brought change in massachusetts i brought change i have done it mr gibson i'm mr romney i have changed things , and that experience is what america is looking for mr gibson i'm just going to try to keep us on time mr romney you look at that debate with barack obama i'm looking forward to headtohead mr gibson i'm going to keep us on time go ahead mr spradling senator thompson , i 'd like to get your take on that you versus senator barack obama why not him \? mr thompson well , senator obama is has adopted the position of every liberal interest group in this country , as best i can tell all the major ones the nea and everyone who s stepped forth with a position paper on these issues his positions are very liberal positions his first alternative to all problems , as best i can see , is not only the government but the federal government he s talking in generalities right now as the time goes on , the process goes on , i think he 'll have to be more definitive , but it s clear from what he s said so far that he s taking that position and as far as change is concerned , the change we need is to go to constitutional principles , the first principles that this country was founded upon respect for the rule of law , market economies , free people doing free things in a country that does n't tax and spend its people to death and does n't regulate the lifeblood out of them , does n't spend money that it does n't have and that s not the direction they want to go in they want to take us down the road of the welfare state , essentially , and the road that i think would lead us to a weaker position in terms of national security mr spradling move off topic in a moment , but senator , you served with mr obama sen mccain i just wanted to say to governor romney , we disagree on a lot of issues , but i agree , you are the candidate of change \( laughs , laughter \) look , the difference i would have with senator obama has got do with national security i know senator obama , and i 've worked with him many times and i respect him , as i respect senator clinton senator obama does not have the national security experience and background to lead this nation we are facing the transcendent challenge of the 21st century , and that is radical islamic extremism in his recent statements on various foreign national security issues i 've strongly disagreed , but i am can make it perfectly clear that it requires a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience and a lot of background to have the judgment to address the challenges that our nation faces in the 21st century mr romney may i make a comment \? mr spradling sure mr romney one one , the continued personal barbs are interesting , but unnecessary but number three or number two , hillary clinton hillary clinton and bill richardson and senator dodd and senator biden all made that same argument in iowa , and barack obama blew them away and if you think making that argument as a republican that you have more experience and you 've been around longer in the senate that that s somehow going to and that you know the cloakroom , the senate cloakroom , better than he does that s not going to work mr thompson it was an iowa democratic primary \( inaudible \) mr romney you 're going to have you 're going to have you 're going to have to you 're going to have to have you 're going to have to have a person \( laughter \) sen mccain \( \? \) yeah , this mr romney you 're going to have sen mccain \( \? \) this was an iowa democrat primary we 're talking about mr spradling \( \? \) yeah , go ahead mr romney america wants change mr thompson \( \? \) a lot of independents mr spradling mr mayor \? mr giuliani i think the problem barack obama would have is , first of all , he s never run a city , never run a state , never run a business i do n't think , at a time when america s at war , with the major problems that we face , we 're going to want someone to get on thejob experience as the chief executive , never having had that kind of experience i do think he s embraced change , but change is a concept is it change for good or change for bad \? changing and having higher taxes , in my view , would be very bad for our economy changing and moving towards socialized medicine would be very bad for our health care system changing by a precipitous withdrawal from iraq without considering the consequences he voted for giving the enemy a timetable of our retreat in iraq , unheard of in a time of war so i would say that virtually the same issues that exist between me and , let s say , hillary clinton , barrack obama , john edwards , they are really issues between republicans and democrats and in the case of senator obama , he really does n't have the experience either from the national security point of view or even from just the executive point of view mr gibson governor huckabee \? mr huckabee well , i think there would be substantial differences on the second amendment , on the sanctity of life , on the role of government , on the idea of local versus federal government i'm still a 10th amendment guy , i believe that most of these decisions ought to be left to the states i think there would also be fundamental differences on taxes , whether they ought to go up or down i think there would be differences on national defense i think we ought to have the strongest possible military that nobody else on earth wants to ever even think about engaging in battle there would be a number of issues that would be fundamentally different probably on samesex marriage there would be a difference of opinion between senator obama and me i mean , i could go through a whole litany of things it would be dramatically different i think , in fact , it would be fair to say that any one of us would have a very different litany of issues but in fairness since i still have just a little bit of yellow light left i think we also ought to recognize that what senator obama has done is to touch at the core of something americans want they are so tired of everything being horizontal left , right , liberal , conservative , democrat , republican they 're looking for vertical leadership that leads up , not down he has excited a lot of voters in this country let s pay respect for that he s a likable person who has excited people about wanting to vote who have not voted in the past and we 'd better be careful as a party because if we do n't give people something to be for and only something to be against , we 're going to lose that next election , and there are some fundamental issues that we lose with it mr gibson congressman paul rep paul you know , it s interesting that you asked this question because we have a lot of similarities as a matter of fact , barack obama and myself , because our campaign is made up of young people and frequently we will have young people joining us that came from the barack obama s campaign , and we 're very pleased but barack spoke out against the war before it started , and he respects civil liberties , and i respect him for that but the question is , is why would it be \? i assume it s because of the similarity in the age of us two candidates that young people are attracted to us \( laughter \) but it is it s the youthfulness of the ideas that bring the young people to us , but there is a difference between what barack obama s talking about because he does give hope to young people and that s what happens in our campaign , but i talk a lot more about different kind of economic policies i talk about personal liberty and the right to people s personal life and getting stopping these wars and coming home and having a sensible monetary policy , and young people like this but barack obama is not going to talk about the goal of getting rid of the income tax and dealing with monetary policy i mean , he he is too much into the welfare state issue , not quite understanding how free market economics is the truly compassionate system if we care about the poor and want to help the poor , you have to have free markets you ca n't have a welfare state in order to try to take care of people mr gibson let me move on people in this state , and everywhere , are worried about gas prices when 2007 began , oil was 61 a barrel it was 100 \( dollars \) last week we have n't even begun to see the demand that india and china is going to put on the world s oil market do n't you have to , in the end , level with people that gas prices are at this level to stay and , if anything , they 're going to go higher \? and is n't not to do so intellectual dishonesty \? anybody \? \( laughter \) go ahead rep paul i 'll be glad to answer that question because it s something i talk about all the time and it s a very important question the wall street journal yesterday had a very good chart that explains this if you look at the price of oil in the last 10 years , if you look at it in terms of dollars , it went up 350 percent if you look at it in euros , it went up about 200 percent if you look at it in the price of gold , it stayed flat it s the inflation , it s the printing of money , it s the destruction of the value of the dollar added onto this , the notion that we go to protect our oil oil was 27 when we went over there to get the oil and protect the oil and take the oil from iraq there s less than there s less than about half the production now in iraq right now and we 're threatening iran , and that pushes prices up it pushes up the concept of supply and demand but you ca n't deal with the price of oil without dealing with the supply and demand of dollars when you devalue the dollar and the dollar is going down every day , and the further the dollar goes down , the higher the prices of oil going up we have to understand that mr gibson senator \? sen mccain at that price of oil we 're going to send 400 billion a year overseas to oil producing countries some of that money will end up in the hands of terrorist organizations it will certainly end up in the hands of dictators who do not have our interests or our values and sometimes want to harm america we have to reduce the dependence on foreign oil , and we have to eliminate we have to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions i think it s a nexus of two critical issues facing this country alternate energy , nuclear power , wind , solar , tide , hybrids we have to unleash the technology of america , and we must reduce and eventually eliminate this dependency on foreign oil because it has become a national security issue and we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because i believe there s enough evidence that we are going to damage this planet beyond repair unless we begin to address that issue mr spradling senator thompson , americans are also watching the profits of companies here in america that are making a lot of money as these prices per barrel are skyrocketing they 're bothered by it people in new hampshire are bothered by this are n't you \? mr thompson bothered by the high profits mr spradling high profits , yes mr thompson yeah mr spradling should something not be done \? mr thompson well , i take note of those profits , and i take note of the losses when they 've had them mr spradling but you would n't step in to do anything to change the mr thompson such as what \? mr spradling excess profits tax \? mr thompson windfall profits tax \? no no you know , the oil price basically is a function or a result of supply and demand we can throw rocks at each other and we can demagogue the issue and all that , and of course , there s plenty of it but getting back to your original question , charlie , i mean , nobody knows what the price of oil is going to be in the future , but i think you can make a good case that it s going to be it s going to be very high because it s not just us the chinese are demanding more oil , going around the world and making all kinds of deals with dictators and causing all kinds of other problems because of it india there are a lot of growing economies out there and that s the world we live in for the immediate future we 're not going to be energy independent in a few years now , we have to be more diversified we 're getting too much oil from trouble spots in the world everybody knows about the middle east everybody knows about chavez in venezuela and we 're just too dependent on the wrong kinds of people and we need to do all the things that john mentioned as i recall the things he mentioned , plus cleaner coal technology plus using the oil reserves that we have here in this country , and nuclear , more nuclear but but , you know , we are not you know , we 're not a nation that regulates the profits or the losses of of our economy we want people refining that oil and we want people and there has n't been a refinery built here in a long time in this country and we want we want the oil to flow we need for it to flow right now , while we work our way into a more diversified situation mr gibson any of you buy the idea of an extra profits mr giuliani charlie , we really have to take the idea of energy independence and turn it into a program for energy independence we 've been talking about it since richard nixon , jimmy carter never done it and it has to be done on the scale of putting a man on the moon all of the things that they 've all talked about we 've talked about it a long time we just have n't done it we 've got to expand nuclear we 've got to do clean coal , we 've got to expand the use of hybrid vehicles , wind , solar , hydroelectric , liquid natural gas , natural gas , domestic oil , more refineries senator thompson is absolutely right we have n't built a refinery , i think , in 30 years we have n't licensed a nuclear power plant in 30 years france is 80 percent nuclear we 're 20 percent nuclear china is building 40 nuclear power plants we 're having trouble getting one licensed for the last 30 years if we do n't if we do n't make this a major program led by the president of the united states the way eisenhower started the program to put a man on the moon and then kennedy followed and then johnson followed and nixon got it done two republicans , two democrats it should be an american achievement mr gibson nuclear is a very interesting issue here in the state of new hampshire governor huckabee \? mr huckabee well , i think it s it is possible to get energyindependent , and do it within a decade we 're the same country that built the atomic mr romney in 10 years \? mr huckabee i believe we can , if we want to if we untax the possibilities of the innovations and technologies if we also look at the fact that if put an incentive out there that s just truly something dramatic a billiondollar bonus for the first person who can produce a car that can get 100 miles per gallon in addition to that , look at the alternative forms of energy that we can use everybody s talked about mr thompson complete without a windfalls profits tax \? \( laughter \) there 'd be no windfalls profits tax on that \? mr huckabee there would n't be and i do n't believe mr thompson i agree \( laughs \) mr huckabee there should be , fred , because i think we ought to untax innovation , untax income anything any time you penalize productivity , it s counterintuitive to an economy and one of the reasons that we 're dependent is because we have allowed the oil companies to dictate not just prices , but policy and it s time to say that we 're not going to allow dictators , whether it s the middle east or from venezuela , to continue to , in essence , enslave the american people , which is exactly what we 've done senator mccain is right we have an issue now where we 're paying for both sides of the war on terror we pay for it with our tax dollars to fund the military , but every time we swipe our credit card in the gas pump , we might as well be sending a check over to the madrassas that are training the terrorists that eventually are going to come back to us and that s why it s got to be an urgent matter of utmost priority mr gibson we are just about out of time , but governor romney , you 're going to have the final word mr romney we 're going to have to deal with this in an honest way with the american people , and that is this is not something that s going to get solved in 10 years we ca n't become energyindependent in 10 years , but we can get ourselves on a track to do that , with all the ways that senator mccain and mayor giuliani and fred thompson have described we can get there it s going to require a far more substantial investment by our nation in energy technology right now we spend about 4 billion a year on new sources of energy and energy efficiency we 're going to have to increase that dramatically and american corporations last year they spent more money defending tort lawsuits than they spent on research and development we 're upsidedown the future of a great nation like ours depends on leading the world in technology and innovation , in energy in particular this has to be our highest domestic , economic priority get ourselves on a track to become energysecure and energyindependent we can do that it s within our grasp , but it s going to take real the reality , rather than just the political rhetoric we 've seen over the last 25 years mr gibson and with that , gentlemen , we conclude the republican debate and i thank you and i think you are due a round of applause \( applause \)
obama good morning , everybody i hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving last week , we announced our economic team which is working as we speak to craft an economic recovery program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy today , vice presidentelect biden and i are pleased to announce our national security team the national security challenges we face are just as great and just as urgent as our economic crisis we are fighting two wars our old conflicts remain unresolved and newly asserted powers have put strains on the international system the spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril that the world s deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet america must also be strong at home to be strong abroad we need to provide education and opportunity to all our citizens so every american can compete with anyone anywhere and our economic power must sustain our military strength , our diplomatic leverage , and our global leadership the common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century , our destiny is shared with the world s from our markets to our security from our public health to our climate , we must act with that understanding that now more than ever , we have a stake in what happens across the globe and as we learn so painfully on 911 , terror cannot be contained by borders nor safely provided by oceans alone last week , we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of six americans among nearly 200 victims in mumbai in the world we seek , there is no place for those who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism this weekend , i told prime minister singh of india that americans stand with the people of india in this dark time and i am confident that india s great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear it down obama and so in this uncertain world , the time has come for a new beginning , a new dawn of american leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century and to seize the opportunities embedded in these challenges we will strengthen our capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends we will renew old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships we will show the world once more that america is relentless in the defense of our people , steady in advancing our interests , and committed to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world democracy and justice , opportunity and unyielding hope because american values are america s greatest export to the world to succeed , we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully using , balances , and integrates all elements of american power , our military , and diplomacy , our intelligence and law enforcement , our economy and the power of our moral example the team that we 've assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that in their past service and plans for the future , these men and women represent all of the those elements of american power and the very best of the american example they 've served in you uniform and as diplomats they have worked as legislators , law enforcement officials , and executives they share my pragmatism about the use of power and my sense of purpose about america s role as a leader in the world i have known hillary clinton as a friend , a colleague , a source of counsel , and a tough campaign opponent she possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic i am proud that she will be our next secretary of state she s an american of tremendous stature who will have my complete confidence , who know many of the world s leaders , who will command respect in every capital , and who will clearly have the ability to advance our interests around the world hillary s appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew american diplomacy and restore our alliances there s much to do from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to iran and north korea , to seeking a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians , to strengthening international institutions i think no doubt that hillary clinton is the right person to lead our state department and to work with me in tackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda at a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars , i 've asked secretary robert gates to continue as secretary of defense and i'm pleased that he s accepted two years ago , he took over the pentagon at a difficult time he restored accountability he won the confidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform as well as their families he earned the respect of members of congress on both sides of the aisle for his pragmatism and competence he knows that we need a sustainable national security strategy and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home as i said throughout the campaign , i will be giving secretary gates and our military a new mission as soon as i take office responsibly ending the war in iraq through a successful transition to iraqi control we will ensure that we have the strategy and resources to succeed against al qaida and the taliban as bob said not too long ago , afghanistan is where the war on terror began , and it is where it must end going forward , we will continue to make the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces to defeat the threats of the 21st century eric holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as attorney everyone from his first day on the job , which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance he has distinguished himself as a prosecutor , a judge , and a senior official and he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement challenges we face from terrorism to counterintelligence , from whitecollar crime to public corruption eric also has the combination of toughness and independence that we need at the justice department let me be clear the attorney general serves the american people and i have every expectation that eric will protect our people , uphold the public trust , and adhere to our constitution janet napolitano offers of the experience and executive skills we need in the next secretary of homeland security she has spent her career protecting people as a us attorney , an attorney general , and as the governor of arizona she understands the need for a department of homeland security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks and respond to catastrophe be it manmade or natural obama janet assumes this critical role having learned the lessons , some of them painful , of the last several years from 911 to katrina she insists on competence and accountability she knows firsthand the need to have a partner in washington that works well with state and local governments she understands as well as anyone the danger of an unsecure border and she will be a leader who can reform a sprawling department while safeguarding our homeland susan rice will take on the crucial task of serving as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations susan has been a close and trusted adviser as in previous administrations , the un ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and in integral member of my team her background as a scholar on the national security council and assistant secretary of state will serve our nation well at the united nations susan knows the global challenges we face demand global institutions that work she shares my belief that the un is an indispensable and imperfect forum she will carry the message that our commitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform we need the united nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action against terror and proliferation , climate change and genocide , poverty and disease finally , i am convinced that general james jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilled national security adviser generations of joneses have served heroically on the battlefield from the breech beaches of tarawa in world war ii to fox trot ridge in vietnam jim s silver star is a proud part of that legacy he will bring to the job the duel experience of serving in uniform and as a diplomat he has commanded a platoon in battle , served as supreme allied commander in a time of war , and worked on behalf of peace in the middle east jim is focused on the threats of today and the future he understands the connection between energy and natural security and has worked on the front lines of global instability from kosovo to northern iraq to afghanistan he will advise me and work effectively to integrate our efforts across the government so that we are effectively using all elements of american power to defeat unconventional threats and promote our values i am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for american national security this morning , we met to discuss the situation in mumbai and some of the challenges that we face in the months and years ahead in the coming weeks , i will be in close contact with these advisers who will be working with their counterparts in the bush administration to make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on january 20th given the range of threats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition , i hope that we can proceed swiftly for those natural security officials who demand confirmation we move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men and women protecting us on our frontlines , diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerous corners of the world , troops serving their second , third , or fourth tours , fbi agents in the field , cops on the beat , prosecutors in our courts , and cargo inspectors at our ports these selfless americans whose name are unknown to most of us , will form the backbone of our effort if we serve as well as they are serving , we will protect our country and promote our values and as we move forward with respect for american s tradition of a bipartisan national security policy and a commitment to national unity , we have to recall that when it comes to keeping our nation and our people safe , we are not republicans or democrats we are americans there s no monopoly of power of wisdom in either party together , as one nation , as one people , we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them together , we will meet the challenges of the 21st century not with fear but with hope now , before i take questions , i 'd like to invite my team to say a few words and i'm going to start with my dear friend , hillary clinton clinton mr presidentelect , thank you for this honor if confirmed , i will give this assignment , your administration , and our country my all i also want to thank my fellow new yorkers who have , for eight years , given me the joy of a job i love with the opportunity to work on issues i care about deeply in a state that i cherish and you 've also helped prepare me well for this new role after all , new yorkers are n't afraid to speak their minds and do so in every language leaving the senate is very difficult for me but during the last few weeks , i thought often of our troops serving bravely under difficult circumstances in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere i thought of those other americans in our foreign and civil services working hard to promote and protect our interests around the world and i thought of the daunting tasks ahead for our country an economy that is reeling , a climate that is warming and as we saw with the horrible events in mumbai , threats that are relentless the fate of our nation and the future of our children will be forged in the crucible of these global challenges america cannot solve these crises without the world , and the world cannot solve them without america by electing barack obama our next president , the american people have demanded not just a new direction at home but a new effort to renew america s standing in the world as a force for positive change we know our security , our values , and our interests cannot be protected and advanced by force alone nor , indeed , by americans we must pursue vigorous diplomacy using all the tools we can muster to build a future with more partners and fewer adversaries , more opportunities and fewer dangers for all who seek freedom , peace , and prosperity america is a place founded on the idea that everyone should have the right to live up to his or her godgiven potential and it is that same ideal that must guide america s purpose in the world today and while we are determined to defend our freedoms and liberties at all costs , we also reach out to the world again seeking common cause and higher ground and so i believe the best way to continue serving my country is to join presidentelect obama , vice presidentelect biden , the leaders here , and the dedicated public servants of the state department on behalf of our nation at this defining moment president kennedy one said that engaging the world to meet the threats we face was the greatest adventure of our century well , mr presidentelect , i am proud to join you on what will be a difficult and exciting adventure in this new century and may god bless you and all who serve with you and our great country gates i am deeply honored that the presidentelect has asked me to continue as secretary of defense mindful that we are engaged in two wars and face other serious challenges at home and around the world , and with a profound sense of personal responsibility to and for our men and women in uniform and their families , i must do my duty as they do theirs how could i do otherwise \? serving in this position for nearly two years , and especially the opportunity to lead our brave and dedicated soldiers , sailor , airmen , marines , and defense civilians has been the most gratifying experience of my life i am honored to continue to serve them and our country and i will be honored to serve presidentelect obama holder thank you , presidentelect obama , for the honor that you have bestowed upon me i look forward to working with you and the members of this national security team assembled here the department of justice plays a unique role on this team it is incumbent those of us who lead the department to ensure not only that the nation is safe but also that our laws and traditions are respected there is not a tangent \( ph \) between those two we can and we must ensure that the american people remain secure and that the great constitutional guarantees that define us as a nation are truly valued for example , working with republicans and democrats in congress , should i be confirmed , we look forward to actually structuring policies that are both protective and consistent with who we are as a nation holder i also look forward to working with the men and women of the department of justice to revitalize the department s efforts in those areas where the department that s unique capabilities and responsibilities in keeping our people safe and ensuring fairness and in protecting our environment this presidentelect and the team you see before you are prepared to meet the challenges that we will confront from my experience at the department of justice , i know that we cannot be successful if we act alone we must never forget that in many ways those in state and local law enforcement are our first line of detection and protection against those from foreign shores who would do us harm we will need to interact with our state and local partners in new innovative ways to help them solve the other issues that they confront on a daily basis national security concerns are not defined only by the challenges created by terrorists abroad but also by criminals in our midst , whether they be criminals located on the street or in a board room we must forge new ties and reestablish old bonds with our state and local partners there is much that needs to be done in this new century i am confident that working with our presidentelect , the people on this stage and the departments that they represent , those of both parties who i know and respect on capitol hill , we can keep our nation safe , strong , and respected it is now my pleasure to introduce janet napolitano , a great governor and an old friend

vigilance and relentless work to prevent terrorist attacks it also will plan carefully and thorough so that our domestic response to all hazards is fast , sound , levelheaded , and effective americans deserve no less to achieve this high level of performance , it will be my job and the job of this team to hold ourselves and our agencies accountable , to coordinate fully across the spectrum of government agencies and to ensure that we work hand in hand with state and local governments to share information , secure our borders , and keep our country safe we are a nation that will be proud , prepared , and resilient thank you for the opportunity to serve and i would be remiss if i did not also thank the wonderful people of arizona like hillary , it is difficult to leave one job for

the american people have signaled to the world that our nation is on the path to change now , we must fulfill that promise by joining with others to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the 21st century to prevent conflict , to promote peace , combat terrorism , present the spread and use of nuclear weapons , tackle climate change , end genocide , fight poverty and disease all of these goals are vital to america s security but none can be accomplished by america alone to enhance our common security , we must invest in our common humanity and to do so , we need capable partners and far more effective international institutions the united nations was , in major part , america s creation rice mr presidentelect , i share your commitment to rededicate ourselves to the organization and its mission if confirmed , as un ambassador , i will work constructively within the organization to help strengthen its capacities and achieve needed reforms i can think of no more important time to represent the united states at the united nations mr presidentelect , thank you for the confidence you 've placed in me and for the opportunity to serve in this vital mission it s now my pleasure to introduce general james jones jones mr presidentelect , mr vice presidentelect , members of this tremendous team assembled this morning , i'm deeply humbled to have been asked by the presidentelect to serve as national security adviser especially during the challenging times we currently face and mr presidentelect , i deeply appreciate your mentions my family s contribution to our national security since 1939 as has been previously mentioned , national security in the 21st century comprising a portfolio which includes all elements of our national power and influence working in coordination and harmony towards the desired goal of keeping our nation safe , helping to make our world a better place , and providing opportunity to live in peace and security for the generations to follow i am deeply humbled and deeply appreciative of this great opportunity , and i am very proud now to introduce a man who will play a key role in making this come to pass , the vice presidentelect , joe biden biden well , mr president , you 've assembled quite a team and i hope and believe that the american people will come to feel as i do that we brought together one of the most talented national security teams ever assembled a team prepared to meet the serious challenges we face today and the emerging threats that will confront us tomorrow i have worked with and admired each of the members of the team some as far as back in days , jim , when you were a marine liaison to the united states senate and so we have a i have a long relationship , as the president does , and i do with each of these folks and each has a clear understanding of the forces that are shaping this new century and the lives of our fellow americans as was mentioned earlier , the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the emergence of china , india , russia , brazil , and the unifying europe as major powers , the spread of lethal weapons to dangerous countries as well as dangerous groups , the shortage of and scarcity of energy , water , and food , the impact of climate change , economic dislocations , persistent poverty the technological revolution that sends people , ideas , and money around the planet as ever faster speeds and , as was already mentioned , as we witnessed again last week with the terrible events in the india , the challenge to democratic nation states from radical ideologies that s just a short list of the forces that are shaping the 21st century and it s been implied by all the comments thus far , no one country can control these forces but more than any other country in the world , we have the ability to affect them if we use the totality of our strength and bringing together senator clinton , secretary gates , eric holder , governor napolitano , susan rice , and general jones , the presidentelect has assembled a national security team that is poised , in my view , to recapture the totality of america s strength each member of this team shares the goals and the principles that the presidentelect and i have attempted to advance each member shares our conviction that strength and wisdom must go hand in hand each member believes , as we do , that america s security is not a partisan issue witness the team each member understands that america s military might and economic strength must married to the power of our ideas and our ideals if we are to deal effectively with dealing with the forces of change , some of which i 've mentioned , and if we 're going keep this country we love so dearly prosperous and free these are extraordinary times that s not in a flight of fancy or exaggeration these are extraordinary times we face extraordinary challenges biden but i am , as the presidentelect is , optimistic , absolutely optimistic that this team , with the presidentelect at our helm , will see to it that america leads not only by the example of our power but by the power of our example and now , presidentelect obama is prepared to take your questions and , again , mr presidentelect , congratulations on assembling what i believe will be a firstclass team to lead us into this century thank you obama ok let s start with liz question \( inaudible \) \? obama well , first of all , i think it s important to reiterate that our condolences , our thoughts , and our prayers go out to the people of india , the families that have been affected , and , obviously , we 're heartbroken by the deaths of the six americans that were caught up in this tragedy i 've spoken to prime minister singh and expressed these concerns to him an investigation is taking place i was briefed by secretary rice throughout the weekend she s on her way to the region we 've sent fbi to help on the investigation and this is one of those time where i have to reiterate there s one president at a time we 're going to be engaged in some very delicate diplomacy in the next several days and weeks so i think it would be inappropriate for me to comment but what i can say unequivocally is that both myself and the team that stands beside me are absolutely committed to eliminating the threat of terrorism and that is true wherever it is found we cannot have we cannot tolerate a world in which innocents are being killed by extremists based on twisted ideologies and we 're going to have to bring the full force of our power , not only military but also diplomatic , economic , and political , to deal with those threats not only to keep america safe but also to ensure that peace and prosperity with exist around the world so i will be monitoring the situation closely thus far , i think the administration has done what s needed in trying to get the details of the situation and my expectation is that president zardari of pakistan , who has already said that he will fully cooperate with the investigation , will follow through with that commitment all right karen \? question thank you , mr president you 've selected a number of high profile people for your national secure team how can you ensure that the staff that you are assembling is going to be a smoothly functioning team of rivals and not a clash of rivals \? obama well , i think you heard joe mention the fact that many of the people who are standing beside me are people who have worked together before , who have the utmost respect for each other these are outstanding public servants and outstanding in their various fields of endeavor they would not have agreed to join my administration , and i would not have asked them to be part of this administration unless we shared a core vision of what s needed to keep the american people safe and to assure prosperity here at home and peace abroad i think all of us here share the belief that we have to maintain the strongest military on the planet , that we have to support our troops and make sure that they are properly trained , properly equipped , that they are provided with a mission that allows them to succeed all of us here also agree that the strength of our military has to be combined with the wisdom and force of our diplomacy and that we are going to be committed to rebuilding and strengthening alliances around the world to advance american interests and american security and so in discussions with this entire team , what i am excited about is a consensus not only among those of us standing here today , but i think cross a broad section of the american people , that now is the time for us to regain american leadership in all its dimensions and i am very confident that each of these individuals are not going to be leaving the outstanding work that they are currently doing if they were n't convinced that they could work as an effective team one last point i will make i assembled this team because i'm a strong believer in strong personalities and strong opinions i think that s how the best decisions are made one of the dangers in the white house , based on my reading of history , is that you get wrapped up in group think and everybody agrees with everything and there s no discussion and there are no dissenting views so i'm going to be welcoming a vigorous debate inside the white house but understand i will be setting policy as president i will be responsible for the vision that this team carries out , and i expect them to implement that vision once decisions are made so as harry truman said , the buck will stop with me and nobody who s standing here , i think , would have agreed to join this administration unless they had confidence that , in fact , that vision was one that would help secure the american people and our interests jake \? question thank you , mr presidentelect during the campaign , you said that you thought the us had a right to attack highvalue terrorist targets in pakistan if given actionable intelligence with or without the pakistani government s permission two questions on that one , do you think india has that same right \? and , two , regarding what karen just said , some people up there on the stage took issue with your saying that they have strong opinions about issues ranging from pakistan to the surge and while they 're all committed to have a successful united states , what private assurances have they given you that they will be able to carry out your vision even when they strongly disagree with that vision as some of them have been able to do in the past \? thank you , sir obama i think that sovereign nations , obviously , have a right to protect themselves beyond that , i do n't want to comment on the specific situation that s taking place in south asia right now i think it is important for us to let the investigators do their jobs and make a determination in terms of who was responsible for carrying out these heinous acts i can tell you that my administration will remain steadfast in support of india s efforts to catch the perpetrators of this terrible act and bring them to justice and i expect that the world community will feel the same way now , in terms of my team and carrying out my vision and my policies , as i 've said , during campaigns or during the course of election season , differences get magnified i did not ask for assurances from these individuals that they would agree with me at all times i think they understand and would not be joining this team unless they understood and were prepared to carry out the decisions that have been made by me after full discussion and , you know , most of the people who are standing here are people who i 've worked with , and on the broad core vision of where america needs to go , we are in almost complete agreement there are going to be differences in tactics and different assessments and judgments made that s what i expect that s what i welcome that s why i asked them to join the team peter baker \? question thank you , mr presidentelect you 've talked about the importance just now of having different voices and robust debate within your administration but , again , going back to the campaign , you were asked and talked about the qualifications of the your now , your nominee for secretary of state and you belittled her travels around the word , equating it to having teas with foreign leaders and your new white house council said that her resume was grossly exaggerated when it came to foreign policy i'm wondering whether you can talk about the evolution of your views of her credentials since the spring obama well , i mean , i think this is fun for the press to try to stir up whatever quotes were generated during the course of the campaign no , i understand and you 're having fun but the and there s nothing wrong with that i'm not i'm not faulting it but , look , i think if you look at the statements that hillary clinton and i have made outside of the heat of a campaign , we share a view that america has to be safe and secure and in order to do that obama the statements that hillary clinton and i have made outside of the heat of a campaign , we share a view that america has to be safe and secure and in order to do that we have to combine military power with strength and diplomacy and we have to build and forge stronger alliances around the world so that we 're not carrying the burdens and these challenges by ourselves i believe that there is no more effective advocate than hillary clinton for that wellrounded view of how we advance american interests she has served on the armed services committee in the senate she s knows world leaders around the world i have it extensive discussions with her both preelection and postelection about the strategic opportunities that exist out there to strengthen american s posture in the world and i think she is going to be an outstanding secretary of state and if i did n't believe that , i would n't have offered her the job and if she did n't believe that i was equipped to lead this nation in such a difficult time , she would not have accepted john mccormack where s john \? question thank you , mr presidentelect you 're known as a pretty good storyteller can you tell us a little bit of a story about how senator clinton was selected for this job \? was there a seminal moment \? how was the offered extended \? can you give us some detail on how it was accepted and kind of the negotiation process that was involved here \? and , also , does secretary gates meet the requirement for a republican on the cabinet , or should we be looking for others as well \? obama well , i mean , i did n't i did n't i did n't check his voter registration secretary gates , meets the qualification of being an outstanding current secretary of defense and somebody who is doing everything he can every single day to make sure that our troops are properly equipped and trained and organized in order to succeed at their missions and that their families are cared for so i have complete confidence in secretary gates being able to carry out his tasks and i think the point here is that i did n't going around checking people s political registration what i was most concerned with was whether or not they can serve the interests of the american people with respect to senator and soontobe , secretary of state clinton , it was not a light bulb moment i have always admired senator clinton we have worked together extensively in the senate i have always believed that she is tough and smart and disciplined and that she shares my core values and the core values of the american people and so i was always interested after the primary was over in finding ways in which we could collaborate after the election was over and i began to think about my team , it occurred to me that she could potentially be an outstanding secretary of state i extended her the offer and she accepted i know that s not as juicy a story as you were hoping for , but that s all you 're going to get , john thanks where s dean \? there you are hey , dean question sir , do you still intend to withdraw all us forces from iraq in 16 months after inauguration \? and did you discuss that the possibility of that with secretary gates , before selecting him \? obama well , keep in mind what i said during the campaign and you were there most of the time i said that i would remove our combat troops from iraq in 16 months with the understanding that it might be necessary , likely to be necessary , to maintain a residual force to provide potential training , logistical support to protect our civilians in iraq the sofa that has been now passed by the iraqi legislature points us in the right direction it indicates we are now on a glide path to reduce our forces in iraq i will be meeting be not only secretary gates but the joint chiefs of staff and commanders on the ground to make a determination as to how we move that pace how we proceed in that withdrawal process i believe that 16 months is the right timeframe but as i have said consistently , i will listen to the recommendations of my commanders and my number one priority is making sure that our troops remain safe in this transition phase and that the iraqi people are well served by a government that is taking on increased responsibility for its own security it is a sovereign nation what this signals is a transition period in which our mission will be changing we will have to remain vigilant in making sure that any terrorist elements that remain in iraq do not become strengthened as a consequence of our drawdown but it s also critical that we recognize that the situation in afghanistan has been worsening the situation in south asia , as a whole , and the safe havens for terrorist that have been established there represent the single most important threat against the american people and we 're going to have to mobilize our resources and focus on attention on defeating al qaeda , bin laden , and any other extremist groups that intend to target american citizens thank you very much , everybody

last month , the bush administration launched the latest salvo in its eightyear campaign to undermine women s rights and women s health by placing ideology ahead of science a proposed rule from the department of health and human services that would govern family planning it would require that any health care entity that receives federal financing whether it s a physician in private practice , a hospital or a state government certify in writing that none of its employees are required to assist in any way with medical services they find objectionable laws that have been on the books for some 30 years already allow doctors to refuse to perform abortions the new rule would go further , ensuring that all employees and volunteers for health care entities can refuse to aid in providing any treatment they object to , which could include not only abortion and sterilization but also contraception health and human services estimates that the rule , which would affect nearly 600 , 000 hospitals , clinics and other health care providers , would cost 445 million a year to administer astonishingly , the department does not even address the real cost to patients who might be refused access to these critical services women patients , who look to their health care providers as an unbiased source of medical information , might not even know they were being deprived of advice about their options or denied access to care the definition of abortion in the proposed rule is left open to interpretation an earlier draft included a medically inaccurate definition that included commonly prescribed forms of contraception like birth control pills , iud s and emergency contraception that language has been removed , but because the current version includes no definition at all , individual health care providers could decide on their own that birth control is the same as abortion the rule would also allow providers to refuse to participate in unspecified other medical procedures that contradict their religious beliefs or moral convictions this , too , could be interpreted as a free pass to deny access to contraception many circumstances unrelated to reproductive health could also fall under the umbrella of other medical procedures could physicians object to helping patients whose sexual orientation they find objectionable \? could a receptionist refuse to book an appointment for an hiv test \? what about an emergency room doctor who wishes to deny emergency contraception to a rape victim \? or a pharmacist who prefers not to refill a birth control prescription \? the bush administration argues that the rule is designed to protect a provider s conscience but where are the protections for patients \? the 30day comment period on the proposed rule runs until sept 25 everyone who believes that women should have full access to medical care should make their voices heard basic , quality care for millions of women is at stake

joe henry and i had been talking about writing together for ages , and even tried it once , circa 2000 , with uneven results but now seemed the right time he started the engine , so he gets to take the wheel i wrote him an email i am hesitating with the disclaimer i want to issue here , about how i never let anyone see my lyrics this early in the game , and how i haven t written for a long while , so maybe it s a little awkward and stiff oh there s the disclaimer i wrote one to joe , too february 28 , 2008 joe , this is so rough and even a little juvenile , but there s something here to pull out i think really this is just an idea not a song yet so it goes i lost two friends , and each stood alone one died by the hand of god , one by his own i loved them both but so it goes , so it goes love and madness go hand in glove first the madness , and then the love i want you but you ll never know so it goes so it goes no one drives me like i drive myself i want to rest and put me on a shelf but just ahead are the lights of home so , so it goes so it goes we have in common an uncommon grace to live in this time , this \? \? , this place new york and everyone we know so it goes so it goes many years and many friends never pass this way again the last one standing is the first one home so it goes , so it goes so it goes a note it is not in my nature to cowrite i would rather go deep into the underworld alone , like persephone looking for the pomegranate the solitude and the simple satisfaction of having my own phrases laid out like beads on a necklace , while finetuning my melodies , suits me entirely but i have pushed myself to be a cowriter more often in recent years and to force myself to forgo both the arrogance and the insecurity of the solo voice my songwriting style is a synthesis of my strengths and my limitations , and occasionally it behooves me to borrow from someone else s strength , and offer a key to the locked door of someone else s limitations i had to give up the pride of thinking myself only a journalistic songwriter , in order to become a better writer overall joe and i have already weathered the most uncomfortable moment in cowriting the takeback last year , he had asked whether i minded if he took a prose work of mine called what did you dream this time \? to use some of the lines and ideas in a song , which we would cowrite i agreed , but when he actually did it , and i heard my lines inside his song , i felt suddenly and acutely territorial it took me a couple weeks , but i gathered the courage to tell him that i wanted those lines back , and that he couldn t use them in the song we got through it , preserved our friendship , and got back around to writing together again not only that , but i changed my mind a few months later when he sat in my living room and played me the song both ways with my lines , and with his revision i asked him to put my lines back in that experience made this one , writing so it goes , easier , and more compatible i m not afraid of him , and he s not afraid of me we know we can say anything , even though we may writhe in paroxysms of insecurity while we re saying it joe wrote back right away \( i quite like the tone you ve established with this one , rose \) , with changes to the lyrics i lost two friends , each one alone one by the hand of god , one by his own oh , i loved them both , that same god knows and so it goes , so it goes wisdom and madness go hand in glove one falls to the other , like need into love i want you in ways that nobody knows and so it goes , so it goes we have in common an uncommon grace taught us by time , revealed by the face of beauty in even the worst that we know and so it goes , so it goes \( sung as a bridge \? \) there s no one who drives me like i drive myself once more around before i rest on the shelf home is just one step beyond what i see and darkness the thing one step behind me many years pass , and so many friends and none of us ever may pass here again the last of us standing the first one who knows so it goes , so it goes so it goes , so it goes although i missed my line about new york , as i thought it gave a sense of physical weight to the song , i understood intuitively why joe had eliminated it , and i let it go without saying anything \( i do love geography in songs , however it gives me a special thrill my own songs that are tied to a particular place include seventh avenue , sleeping in paris and house on the lake among many others \) i liked how he made the last line the first one who knows , rather than the first one home , and overall he gave the lyrics a rhythmic structure that just worked better i was delighted from rosanne cash to joe henry oh wow you made it a real song i love it thank you thank you thank you and i like the alternate verse better , with revealed by the space i love the two lines that carry over adds so much fluidity didn t shakespeare do that \? \? yeah xxxrose soon joe wrote me back as follows still playing with this some , as i really like the shape and feel one thing i find i like sometimes and think it might work here is to create a form of 2 verses , a bridge , then a 3rd verse have an instrumental break , and then sing a variation of the 3rd verse over a repeated bridge form then conclude with a final verse did i describe that right \? what it does is puts a different spin on a particularly pivotal verse makes it like a hinge in the song allows something important to repeat and still be heard as an evolving thought i ll show you what i mean shortly if it works but i do think it works having a pair of couplets unresolved by the refrain line as a bridge and i like that one about driving yourself in particular being the bridge it swings to the personal in a way that the other verses are a little more objective thanks for the good words love , joe ps and yes shakespeare dabbled with this sort of the thing amazing how good he remains just flip through the sonnets i felt very comfortable letting joe guide this song to completion , and the whole experience was so easy and fluid that it boded very well for our future cowriting endeavors from rosanne cash to joe henry it s become very elegant , i think i love that you reprised the verse into a bridge do you need the word thing \? but i see in you the best thing that i am could it just be best that i am and scan correctly \? it was time to think about a melody , but i was so sick of my own melodies that i was hoping to get joe to do the heavy lifting on that as well i thought if i wrote one more song with a 146 minor progression i was going to have to shoot myself , or let all the other songwriters of the world do it for me , which they probably would be keen for from rosanne cash to joe henry subject so it goes joe , just reading the lyrics to so it goes this is really good have you tinkered with a melody yet \? i want so much for you to write the melody because you know more chords than me you know what i mean you would take it someplace i probably wouldn t know how to also first bridge what if the last line was truncated , if it worked with the melody , so it had only 4 syllables or so does that work \? or is it not necessary \? i hope i am looking at the last set of lyrics you sent joe wrote back , and sent an attachment \( you can play the song see above \) rose , here s a really rough run through this \( with dinner waiting \) see if this is anything like what you d imagined i m tough as nails give it to me straight is this something you can work with \? joe from rosanne cash to joe henry subject re so it goes i m listening with tears i loved it from the fourth bar joe was coming to new york from his home in southern california in the next week we made plans to meet in the studio and demo the song together is a grammy awardwinning artist who has released 14 albums , most recently black cadillac \( 2006 \) , and 11 no 1 singles she is also the author of a shortstory collection , bodies of water and a children s book , penelope jane a fairy s tale her essays and fiction have appeared in the new york times , rolling stone , and other publications she is currently working on a new recording and a book of nonfiction to be published by viking this year her web site is
even as russia and georgia continue their onagain , offagain struggle over south ossetia and abkhazia , a frenzied tealeaf reading about the war s global political ramifications has broken out across airwaves and thinktank forums but as the situation on the ground recedes inevitably to some new form of the pernicious frozen conflict that has plagued the region since georgia s civil wars of the early 1990s , few are paying attention to a less portentous but equally critical international threat an increase in the longstanding , rampant criminality in the conflict zones that is likely to further destabilize the entire caucasus region and at worst provide terrorist groups with the nuclear material they have long craved while the russian peacekeepers who entrenched themselves in the conflict zones in the 1990s \( and who will now likely resume their posts anew \) have proved ineffectual and uninterested in maintaining stability , they 've been highly successful in protecting an array of sophisticated criminal networks stretching from russia through georgian territory south ossetia , in particular , is a nest of organized crime it is a marketplace for a variety of contraband , from fuel to cigarettes , wheat flour , hard drugs , weapons , people and , recently , counterfeit united states 100 bills minted at a press inside the conflict zone it s a pretty sophisticated counterfeiting piece , the american ambassador to georgia , john tefft , told me when i was in georgia last year he added that the fake bills appear so authentic that , if you were n't specifically looking for a forgery , you 'd easily miss it more than 20 million worth have been found up and down the east coast of the united states as well as in israel , russia and georgia we know where the printing press is , shota utiashvili , a chief intelligence analyst at georgia s interior ministry , told me last year , when i was researching a study on smuggling that was published by harvard s belfer center for science and international affairs we know the channels of distribution and we know who is running the business but the problem is neither we nor the americans can do anything because the place is under the protection of the russian military i found this sentiment echoed in my discussions at the american embassy far more dangerous contraband than fake bills is bartered in the conflict zones on a bleak winter day last year , i hitched a ride from tbilisi , the capital , to the administrative border the semiporous line of control that swoops deep into georgian territory from the russian border demarking the contours of south ossetia i was investigating one of the most serious nuclear smuggling incidents in years an offer of up to 3 kilograms of bombgrade highly enriched uranium because south ossetia is within georgia s internationally recognized borders , georgia does n't recognize the south ossetian periphery as a legitimate frontier , and has thus refused to post border guards or impose any normal controls at the administrative line at the grim little checkpoint , i had to navigate through dozens of armed young men , clad in seemingly random combinations of camouflage , none bearing the insignia of a national force \( the scariest kind of border to cross , as there s no way of telling who s who \) aside from demanding bribes from journalists , these south ossetian irregulars , backed by the russian peacekeepers , have long prevented georgian forces from getting anywhere near the actual border a twolane hole called the roki tunnel that plunges into a mountainside on the russian side of the border , cuts through two miles of bedrock beneath the caucasus mountains and pops out in south ossetia , smack in the war zone three years ago , georgian intelligence officials began receiving reports from south ossetian criminal contacts that a russian smuggler a north ossetian calling himself oleg was circulating in tskhinvali , the south ossetian capital he was reportedly looking for a buyer for what he claimed was highquality enriched uranium pilfered from the russian military the price was 1 million for the initial shipment 100 grams at 10 , 000 per gram if the deal went well , a mother lode of up to 3 kilograms would be made available one hundred grams of highly enriched uranium is not enough to build a nuclear bomb it s thought that even a toptier terrorist group would require at least 15 kilograms but it would be a step in the right direction huge international efforts sponsored by the united states state , energy and defense departments have sought to counter such nuclear smuggling \( since 1994 , the energy department has spent upwards of 420 million installing nuclear detection equipment at international border crossings , most of that effort concentrated on russia s frontiers \) , but conflict zones like south ossetia have been an achilles' heel in this case , we got lucky a haphazard sting operation run by georgian paramilitaries and interior ministry agents recovered the 100 grams of highly enriched uranium and captured oleg khinsagov , the russian smuggler , and three georgian associates testing of the material proved it to be nearly 90 percent pure bombgrade uranium indeed sending secure telephone lines ringing from washington to langley , va the russian government refused to acknowledge the obvious that the uranium had originated in russia so a quickly assembled team of american experts from the energy department and the fbi loaded an unmarked jet and quietly raced to tbilisi to secure the material good police work is vital , but we simply cannot depend on dramatic interventions like the georgian raid to combat the broad security threats posed by anarchy on russia s borders there are some great examples of cooperation between washington and moscow the setting up of nuclear detection programs at borders is clearly one of them somehow , however , the full spirit of cooperation has yet to reach to the top of russia s government the same men , unfortunately , who seem more inclined to pouring fuel on the fire in georgia

off on reproductions , and always refused \( much to his dealers' chagrin \) calder jewelry comes to new york from the norton museum of art in west palm beach , fla it was organized by jane adlin , an associate curator at the met , with the norton adjunct curator mark rosenthal and the calder foundation director \( and calder grandson \) alexander s c rower it can be difficult to exhibit jewelry , even calder s resolutely unprecious metals , without creating a boutique atmosphere smaller objects like brooches and hair combs are clustered in vertical display cases , and even the larger necklaces get lost in the highceilinged galleries photographs of calder s jewelry on the body are scarce in the galleries , though numerous in the unwieldy catalog still , the show has an intimate , even familial quality calder made many of the pieces as gifts for friends and relatives mr rower recalls that when he was a child , his grandmother s dressing table always seemed a mysterious altar two cases are devoted to the jewelry calder made for his wife , louisa , beginning with the couple s engagement ring a simple spiral of gold wire calder always returned to the spiral for birthday and anniversary gifts he seems to have adopted this late bronze age motif as a personal talisman he was also fond of initials and monograms , as evidenced by the pieces he made for friends like the curator dorothy c miller and the art dealer marian willard johnson these objects are the equivalent of the wire portrait heads at the whitney bits of customized whimsy more interesting are the pieces with a surrealist bent , like the pair of earrings that spell out joan mir s piquant declamation a bas la m diterran e \( down with the mediterranean \) calder s jewelry appealed to women with avantgarde tastes who liked to make a dramatic entrance mary rockefeller was said to have required a little elbow room when she wore her calder necklace to art openings peggy guggenheim boasted in her autobiography , i am the only woman in the world who wears his enormous mobile earrings two pairs of those broad and pendulous earrings are in the exhibition they are certainly not for everyone , or at least not for the woman who might be afraid to inflict flesh wounds while airkissing consider the spectacular object nicknamed the jealous husband , from 1940 in this oversize necklace , a breastplate of flat curlicues of hammered wire rises into barbed coils at the collarbone hilton kramer , writing in the new york times magazine in 1976 , noted the work s humor of mock aggression and shameless selfassertion other necklaces suggest less extreme forms of body armor an aptly titled chainmail necklace from 1940 features handlinked circles of silver wire an untitled piece from 1942 might be described as brass knuckles for the shoulders calder s necklaces and tiaras could take up a lot of space without looking heavy his flower necklace \( 1938 \) is a chain of delicate silver leaves attached to a daisylike blossom , all fashioned from looped wire in crown \( 1940 \) , clusters of brass ivy rise from a simple headpiece craftsmanship is anything but mysterious nearly every piece consists of hammered , bent or chiseled wire pliers marks are visible on the unpolished surfaces calder rarely used solder when he needed to join strips of metal , he linked them with loops , bound them with snippets of wire or fashioned rivets some of his intricatelooking cuff bracelets , with wavy lines and zigzags , are little more than single pieces of twisted and flattened wire in both technique and design , calder aspired to be primitive like picasso , he had seen and collected african sculpture in paris ms adlin points out , in her catalog essay , that calder s bracelets and neck collars with parallel strips of wire bear a striking resemblance to the beaded corsets worn by members of the east african dinka tribe other comparisons will come to mind , particularly if you wander through the met s galleries of celtic or precolombian art calder s forms were n't new , but his sense of the body as a kinetic sculpture was liberating he convinced us that art can be precious , and jewelry need not be
the title eminent domain contemporary photography and the city suggests a history of contested municipal development projects like the atlantic and hudson yards instead , this show at the is about the photographer s proprietary claim to the urban landscape that claim was briefly threatened last year by a bloomberg administration proposal that would have required a permit to film and take pictures in public places organized by stephen c pinson , the library s robert b menschel curator of photography , the exhibition highlights recent work by five new york artists none of them are street photographers in the conventional sense broadly speaking , eminent domain is a series of responses to change in the city \( the source of which might be anything from gentrification to globalization \) weaving the five projects together is an autobiographical text by the artist glenn ligon , housing in new york a brief history \( 2007 \) , in which he reminisces about the various new york city apartments he has occupied over the course of his life this entertaining digression , which begins in a bronx housing project and ends in a chinatown coop , almost steals the show mr ligon s current neighborhood is also the subject of thomas holton s series the lams of ludlow street \( 20035 \) , which documents the activities of a chinese family of five squeezed into a tworoom apartment mr holton , who is half chinese , says in the catalog that his objective was to get behind closed doors and photograph more than the stereotypical images of chinatown s street scenes his curiosity is shared by many new yorkers with no particular connection to the area in the lam apartment , space is multifunctional and psychologically layered winter coats hang above the dining table , and the bathtub doubles as a laundry station the intimate glimpse of family life includes polaroids taken by the three lam children , who do n't seem to mind living \( and bathing \) in such close proximity and in the presence of an interloper mr holton makes the lams' apartment seem like an entire city , at least until his camera follows the family to the observation deck of the  other artists view the essence of the city as sprawl rather than dense concentration for her project borough edges , nyc \( 20047 \) , bettina johae mapped the five boroughs from a bicyclist s perspective getting as close as she could to the waterfront and other border areas , ms johae recorded more than 2 , 400 digital images at the library she presents 40 photographs \( eight from each borough \) in a flipbook style that recalls ed ruscha s surveys of los angeles gas stations and apartment buildings video might have better conveyed the experience of biking along the city s periphery , but ms johae s shots do present a counterintuitive view the manhattan section shows views from wards and roosevelt islands brooklyn features tidy row houses in east new york and a trashstrewn lot in greenpoint the construction of highrise condominiums is conspicuously absent from scenes of the brooklyn and queens waterfronts the city s two most populous boroughs also figure in the work of ethan levitas , who photographs trains on elevated sections of the j , m and z lines his large color prints isolate the subway cars on white backgrounds , focusing on the weathered and graffitied exteriors of the trains and the interactions of passengers in one photograph taken in the winter , a man risks a fatal slip as he crosses between iceclad cars in another , a woman in an americanflag tshirt scowls at the photographer through the doors mr levitas has an eye for gesture , but he ignores the most interesting aspects of new york s elevated subways the unusual views they afford and the manner in which they cut a swath , financially and aesthetically , through neighborhoods zoe leonard has photographed momandpop storefronts on the lower east side and in brooklyn over the past decade her dyetransfer prints \( an outdated technique \) have a selfconsciously retro quality , and ms leonard sometimes seems too determined to conjure eug ne atget and walker evans her careful attention to handlettered signs and reflections in storewindow displays is almost uncanny having lived on the lower east side since 1977 , however , ms leonard comes by her nostalgia honestly using a 19thcentury camera and 8by10 blackandwhite negatives , reiner leist has recorded the view from his 26thfloor studio in midtown on a more or less daily basis since march 1995 \( he inserts a black print for each day he is out of town or otherwise unable to photograph \) from mr leist s series of approximately 3 , 000 images , 40 , all corresponding to the dates sept 11 through 15 , are displayed in a grid formation the emphasis , predictably , is on the events of sept 11 , 2001 mr leist is not the only artist to have incorporated that day into a preexisting body of work , but his decision to keep taking pictures echoes new yorkers' determination to return to their normal routines his antique camera softens the view , and the blow the art in eminent domain would seem scattershot if not for mr ligon s wry narrative \( printed on placards dispersed throughout the exhibition \) in the early '80s he flees an underheated fort greene apartment for an illegal sublet on riverside drive when he is discovered , he moves to washington heights until a flooded bathroom and a federal drug raid in the building prompt him to relocate back in rapidly gentrifying fort greene , mr ligon \( who is black \) discovers that older africanamerican residents treat him with contempt his peripatetic existence is hardly unique , especially among artists , but it sets the tone for the exhibition i was born here in new york , and like many other new yorkers i lack imagination the idea of living somewhere else has never occurred to me , mr ligon concludes indeed , to live in new york is to have lived everywhere day by day or block by block , the artists in eminent domain seize their own pieces of the city the fifth avenue branch of the new york public library , soon to be renamed for the financier stephen a schwarzman , is the perfect site for this meditation on the nature of public and private urban space
louisville , ky the day began with 23yearold anthony kim , the youngest player in the 2008 ryder cup , unnerving the wily sergio garc a with a precise game of golf and an imprecise , if pivotal , dose of gamesmanship another ryder cup rookie , hunter mahan , was next on the course , a relative unknown who would finish with more points than any other american in the competition soon , another newcomer to the scene , boo weekley , had teed off and cut through the usual tension of the event by riding his driver down the fairway like a hobby horse by late afternoon , the united states had won the ryder cup , beating europe for the first time in nine years and it was the six rookies on the team , some who were in high school the last time the americans hoisted the cup , who were being lauded as the spark that ignited an upset i'm not going to say that those six guys were talking smack out there , but they were supremely confident and it was their energy that changed the team , said jim furyk , whose par on the 17th hole clinched the ryder cup for the united states and set off a joyous celebration it was a big bonus to have six guys who did n't know anything about losing in the ryder cup for some veteran players , the more time you have to think about the results of the previous ryder cups , the more it weighs on you but the new guys were n't coming from there they made us all loose phil mickelson , standing alongside the 17th green after completing his seventh ryder cup , rolled his eyes when asked about his rookie teammates have you ever seen such grit \? he said they were the key , because they had none of the baggage of the previous ryder cups they came with heart , with a lot of game , and look at all the points they won kim , mahan , weekley , j b holmes , ben curtis and steve stricker combined for 13 of the american team s 16 points , and , significantly , they earned 5 of the 7 won by the united states during the decisive sunday matches indeed , it was kim who dominated perhaps the most feared european player , defeating garc a , 5 and 4 garc a was clearly demoralized and out of the match early , and with players from the other teams watching on television as they waited to tee off , garc a s slumped shoulders and desperate scowls served to bolster the americans kim declined to concede a couple of short garc a putts in the opening holes , which seemed to irk garc a , who then hit consecutive shots in the water fronting the seventh hole on the 11th green , he missed a crucial 2foot putt as kim watched nearby anthony kim took tiger woods s confidence slot for us , said stewart cink , who was on the winning side of the cup for the first time on his fourth try honestly , i think the other team was scared of playing him as much as kim accomplished early , and while weekley was well ahead of england s oliver wilson after nine holes , there were a couple of hours in the middle of the afternoon when it appeared that the americans were going to need holmes or curtis to win his match to keep things from getting uncomfortable the final result turned out to be a 5point victory for the americans , but at around 5 pm sunday , with many matches still close , the pressure was building again on the american rookies to clinch the cup before it came down to the final match , which had chad campbell facing europe s padraig harrington , who has won three majors so there was holmes on the 16th hole taking a onehole lead on soren hansen and off the 17th tee , holmes unleashed a majestic 350yard drive down the middle of the fairway his wedge shot from 77 yards hit behind the hole and spun back to 20 inches from it his birdie for a 2 and 1 victory relieved the pressure , and furyk s steady par a few minutes later for his 2 and 1 victory over miguel ngel jim nez brought on the champagne i was a captain s pick , and paul azinger got a little heat for picking me , said holmes , who was raised in kentucky i had to back him up for his confidence in me and i should thank him , too azinger disagreed i will be thanking those young guys whose fearlessness inspired all of us , he said you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to see how we all fed off of it

there are many things that nba players excel at doing running , jumping , selling shoes at these specific skill sets , nba players rank among the world s elite but there are other things that nba players consistently struggle with , and talking about their feelings is one of them this should not be surprising there is not a lot of motivation for professional basketball players to explain the texture of their existence selfactualization does not help you get an offensive rebound in fact , it s possible that pondering the nature of one s life might be detrimental to success in the nba happiness \( or the lack thereof \) is just one more thing that can shut you down i am reminded of this as i sit on a bench with rajon rondo and leon powe , two members of a team that , as of this moment in late january , sustains the best record in the league afternoon practice has just concluded rondo is the club s point guard powe is an undersize power forward who logs about 10 minutes of playing time on any given night their lives , obviously , appear wonderful they play for the league s most storied franchise , they rarely lose \( their 304 start tied a team record and was the fourth best in league history \) and they 're making lots of money while doing so it is a dream scenario yet just one year ago , these two were mired in the nba equivalent of a night tremor during this same juncture last season , the celtics were in the midst of an 18game losing streak they finished the year 2458 there s no big mystery as to why the celtics went from awful to wonderful on june 28 , the general manager , danny ainge , traded three average perimeter players for one very good one , ray allen \( along with the rights to glen big baby davis , a portly rookie from louisiana state university \) this improved the celtics marginally later that summer , ainge shipped half of his remaining roster to the minnesota timberwolves for the 11time nba allstar kevin garnett this improved the celtics exponentially almost instantly , the team was reinvented \( a reinvention that has been reported , over and over , everywhere \) but what s often overlooked is how a chunk of the celebrated '08 celtics was also part of the wretched '07 celtics , often fulfilling identical roles in a similar scheme these are the same people , living in the same city , holding the exact same jobs yet so much about their lives has changed i ask rondo and powe how this feels it is not a question they are prepared to answer they start to say it feels very different , only to end the thought by mentioning that it is n't different at all they repeat predictable words and phrases the importance of focus the importance of pride the necessity of taking things one game at a time i 've been informed that the team recently went through a media training session , which means only that they 've recently been instructed on the best ways to avoid answering anything the larger truth , i suspect , is that all of their potential answers are complex winning is supposed to be everything , but winning does n't solve problems winning merely removes problems which is finally what rondo explains last year i was happy , too , he says it was my first year in the nba we had cool teammates but here s the difference this year , it s less stressful losing 18 games in a row is very stressful all you think about is how you can make this situation better or what else you can do you lose so much more sleep that s the difference this , i will learn , is the overarching discrepancy between being a role player on the league s best team and being a role player on the league s worst team sleeping it really affects sleeping it would be convenient to suggest that the celtics' radical turnaround is unprecedented , but that would be totally wrong it is n't even unprecedented for boston the year before the celtics acquired larry bird , they won 29 games a year later , they won 61 more than any other team sport , basketball is designed for rapid relaunch but what makes this particular reconstruction unique is the way it was concocted it contradicts the premise of building a future nucleus through the draft the celtics got older on purpose people seem to think it s easier to coach younger players than older players , but it s really the opposite this is the celtics' coach , doc rivers , speaking last month , he coached in the nba allstar game last year , his name was usually mentioned only in reference to the possibility of his termination most veterans in our league have had their day and chased the idea of being a star , and now they 've fallen back to whatever they really are they know who they are young guys always want to prove they 're better than whatever role you give them they wo n't buy into the system they always say that they will , but the minute they have the chance to score , they 'll try to prove that they can be a scorer prior to the trade that brought garnett to boston , the june 28 addition of the 32yearold allen was an unforeseen but not necessarily surprising decision the move seemed to fall somewhere between practical and desperate by adding allen s outside shooting to paul pierce s midrange assault , the celtics looked to be a bad defensive team with a betterthanaverage offense \( which , in the eastern conference , would be enough to qualify for a playoff berth \) the seattle supersonics , allen s former team , had drafted kevin durant second overall , so they were motivated to move allen elsewhere the deal made sense for everyone involved however , the july 31 transaction that landed garnett is harder to fathom the timberwolves traded the lone transcendent player in the franchise s history for five players off a team that lost 58 games overnight , the wolves became the worstpossible incarnation of the modern celtics certainly , much of this was due to the fact that garnett wanted to leave minneapolis the wolves needed to trade him before he was lost to free agency but the reason it seemed so curious is because the wolves' general manager is kevin mchale , a longtime celtics star who spent all 13 years of his career in boston , much of it alongside his teammate ainge some people see this relationship as less than coincidental i was not surprised that mchale made that trade , because it was clear that al jefferson was the best player they were going to get in exchange , rivers says al jefferson averaged 16 points and 11 rebounds a night for boston in 200607 this year , the muscular 23yearold forward has been averaging 21 and 12 as the wolves' only hope obviously , i'm biased , rivers says , and i know there is this big conspiracy that claims kevin will be named president of the celtics' franchise in two years but i do n't believe that mchale wanted to get minnesota younger , and he wanted the best young player and in all the trade scenarios , al was the singlebest guy we had to throw in a lot more bodies to make it work , but i think mchale s singular focus was correct it did n't make sense for kevin to move garnett for a 29yearold you 're never going to get valueforvalue in any trade involving a superstar , so , for his age , al was the best player out there i ask rivers if he thinks the celtics would have eventually been good had they kept their young talent i ask him what the team might be doing right now if they still had jefferson and sebastian telfair and gerald green and theo ratliff and everyone else who was jettisoned his response was semisarcastic , but probably not untrue i would be doing abc so that , on the surface , is the entire explanation as to why the celtics are good again they traded away most of a bad team to get two guys , one of whom is awesome they fused the new guys with pierce , whose career scoring average was already 23 points per game now they win 80 percent of the time it s math but what is one to make of the pieces that did not change \? along with pierce , there are five other players around from last year s train wreck rondo and powe , kendrick perkins , brian scalabrine and tony allen two of these players are starters none of them is famous but they all share a rarefied view of what it s like to be great and what it s like to be terrible , often for reasons that have little to do with who they are what is your direction for this story \? scalabrine asks me i can take this in a lot of different directions of all the celtics , scalabrine is the only one who actively wants to be interviewed he is also the least intimidating pro athlete i have ever met he has been in the nba seven years and was signed by boston for 15 million , so he s obviously physically gifted he s more mobile and more dexterous than the average 6foot9 american but scalabrine does n't look anything like a pro basketball player he has red hair and a breaddough body , and he wears a knit hat that would have looked goofy on a beastie boy in 1991 he says the word absolutely a lot , and he sounds like bill walton when he does so all of this superficial uncoolness seems to give scalabrine a kind of abstract advantage he comes across as likable and selfaware though he averages only 2 points a night \( and was previously an object of widespread vitriol among the celtic faithful \) , he has become the paradoxical crowd favorite of the td banknorth garden , perhaps not coincidentally because \( a \) this is boston and \( b \) he is one of two white members on the team i inform him that this story is about how his life is different and how his life is the same , principally due to the efforts of people who are not him do i think about myself differently \? absolutely , he says i ca n't speak for everyone on this team , but that is absolutely the case for me there s a different sense of selfworth when you 're losing 18 games in a row , you look at yourself and say , what am i doing \? what else can i do \? what could i do differently \? ' and those things get you into even more trouble on the court but if you can look at the rest of your team and think , all we have to do is do our individual roles and jobs , and we 'll get wins' that takes away so much of the stress last year , i would sometimes go out of character , because everybody thought they should be doing more i 'd try to drive the lane and get a foul , which is n't something i should be doing scalabrine understands his value and his limitations he is tremendously dedicated , he s fearless and he can knock down open jump shots \( coming off the bench for the new jersey nets in the '04 eastern conference semifinals , he drained four 3pointers late in the game in a tripleovertime win against the detroit pistons \) more important for the celtics , he has the ideal mentality for a role player he seems to base his whole selfidentity on being a winner , even if his contribution to that win is negligible i was not happy last year , he says in society , they would say the way i felt was depressed but in sports , it was just a situation where we had to turn things around the thing that really bothered me about last year s team was the individualism during all the losses individual play was trumping the result of the game if somebody went out and got 16 points in a loss , he would be like , hey , i got my 16' that was the culture of last year in an illfated attempt to further explain the cultural difference between last year s team and this year s squad , scalabrine throws out a few metaphors he first describes the new celtics as an efficient car factory , whereas last year s team built flawed models that were constantly being recalled later , he says the only occupational analogy that truly makes sense is to compare an nba roster with a house of firemen , since both collectives are comprised of disparate men who come together on a nightly basis with a singular purpose there is only one goal at the end of the night , you sleep well if you win you do not sleep well if you do not here again , the ability to eradicate insomnia is mentioned as a key consequence of winning i ask if the current celtics roster has more of a desire to win than the team that went 2458 interestingly , scalabrine admits that he is not sure i try to get a sense of what ethereal elements might have altered the chemistry of the celtics , but i am told that the difference is not intangible it s tangible , and it s not complicated this is my seventh year in the nba i 've been to the finals twice , and those teams were great but they were not like this team , scalabrine says and the reason why is kevin garnett the media perception about garnett is real when kevin walks into the facility and the weight room , he jokes around and makes fun of guys but then about 15 minutes before practice , it s all focus it s all work if he is not clear about something , we do n't move on until we are all clear he solves a lot of problems i mean , i 've played with good players i played with jason kidd , and kidd is an incredible gamer but he was never as demanding of his teammates the way kevin is not half as much not a quarter as much on paper , this description sounds a little hollow it sounds like the kind of meaningless mythosbuilding that espn studio analysts engage in ad nauseam but perhaps it really is this simple last year , the celtics were 16th in the league in defense this year , they 're first rondo can gamble on opencourt steal attempts , largely because he s backed by a hypernimble , 6foot11 shot blocker who makes everything less of a gamble part of garnett s allure is the sheer amount of energy he surrenders on almost every possession some guys make the game look easy , but garnett makes it look hard he plays with the face of a man in pain there is no ceiling to his emotion \( during a tnt interview with john thompson , he once started crying on camera \) he is also , by all accounts , an ideal teammate he s uninterested in media opportunities and goes out of his way to distract selfadulation though garnett is clearly the club s highestprofile commodity , pierce , the team captain , remains the last player announced over the pa when the boston starters are introduced this is the kind of gesture that has no practical application , but it symbolizes a lot within the insular society of the team it s especially significant to someone like pierce , an allstar who seems destined to forever exist inside mildly depressing coincidences at the university of kansas , he majored in crime and delinquency studies as a pro in the year 2000 , he was stabbed 11 times in a boston dance club last year , pierce stoically carried the celtics on his back while nobody noticed this year , he remains the leading scorer but still gets less attention \( and less credit \) than the passionate newcomer who commands a different context of respect in so many ways , the nba is still the playground leaders create themselves , and no one can really argue look , i can keep saying a million clich s , but those clich s are going to be true , scalabrine says are we more focused \? yes , we are more focused that is true but here s the basic thing basketball involves only five guys , playing both offense and defense the impact of one person can be immense it s much larger than in any other sport so when you add kevin garnett , the defensive intelligence he brings is huge it s not just that he s adding 20 points and 10 rebounds a night there are other guys who can get you 20 and 10 who are not the player that he is he demands a different level of focus from everybody so that sounds clich , but it s the truth it s the truth wednesday night in boston january cold damp coming off an uninspired mlk day win against the new york knicks in madison square garden , the celtics are set to face the toronto raptors , currently the secondbest team in the atlantic division halfway across the country , a handful of former celtics are preparing to face the phoenix suns in even colder minneapolis at the moment , the wolves' record is 634 some of their old friends in boston feel their pain i really bonded with all those guys , kendrick perkins said the day before , his texas voice drawling perkins , 23 , starts at center for boston he averages a quiet 7 or so points a game , but he managed to drop 22 in one half against the hapless knickerbockers we spent all our time together on the road we had dinner all the time you miss people especially al jefferson it was hard to see him go , because that was my man perkins heard about the garnett trade on espn , when the info crawled across the bottom of the screen powe says he read about the trade on the internet while vacationing in the bahamas rondo barely remembers hearing the news at all , even though he had reason to take notice i was in the trade talk a lot , but i do n't really read the newspapers or watch sportscenter during the summertime , he says i just think , if it happens , it happens they all acknowledge that basketball is a business and that trades and getting cut are part of life still , it must be weird to hear through the television that your best friend is leaving town in the td banknorth garden press room , reporters are eating chocolate ice cream and talking about heath ledger , who died the night before the new arena is not a historic building and does not feel as such when people talk about the celtics , they always like to bring up bird and john havlicek and bill russell , but those references always feel forced and unrelated this facility and this team feels entirely modern the night s most intriguing individual matchup is kg versus toronto s chris bosh , a younger , thicker , less intense version of garnett with more of a scorer s mentality however , they do not begin the night guarding each other , and garnett spends the first quarter going up against the raptors' italian 7footer , andrea bargani \( although it s like a man versus a robot , or maybe a praying mantis versus an italian dragonfly \) during an early timeout , kg gives rondo a semistern lecture about how the diminutive point guard needs to pull the ball back out when his efforts at penetrating the defense are thwarted the discussion is completely onesided , and it s hard to tell how closely the younger player is listening but the exchange is a clear example of how things in boston have evolved it is hard to imagine who would have told rondo these things in 2007 leon powe enters the game late in the quarter and \( somehow \) picks up two fouls in the span of 13 seconds he looks out of his element but a few possessions later , powe draws a charge on bosh and forces him to the bench the surprise star of the first half is tony allen , another member of last year s 24win disaster allen elected not to be interviewed for this story he does n't like thinking about last season last year , against indiana , allen blew out his left knee after flying down the lane and gratuitously dunking the ball after the play was dead it was a needless , embarrassing injury , and it epitomized everything that was wrong with the 2007 celtics it s the kind of injury that might follow him forever but , at least tonight , tony allen looks healthy and explosive he slashes for 14 points in less than a full quarter the game is tight scalabrine buries a 23foot jumper at the end of the third quarter his only basket of the night and the crowd explodes with unreasonable delight garnett fills the box score \( 11 of 14 from the floor , 7 rebounds , 5 assists \) , but boston fails to contest toronto s outside shooters , who are all spontaneously combusting the raptors go 15 of 21 from behind the 3point arc the celtics lose , 114112 inside the locker room , on the other side of a closed door , i can faintly hear what i think is garnett expressing both histrionic bitterness and sincere disbelief we 're in shock , he keeps saying to his teammates we 're in shock i'm in shock they have to play perfect to beat us by 2 \? we 're in shock i'm in shock somewhat ironically , the excelts on the timberwolves have just finished their best game of the year , a victory against the highly favored suns perkins s old buddy al jefferson unloads for 39 points and 15 boards in the 10point upset in two days , the celtics will play those same wolves and escape with a 1point win however , garnett will strain his abdomen and miss the following game with the orlando magic , who defeat the celtics this all seems mildly problematic it is possible that boston is not deep enough to challenge the league s elite over the grind of an 82game season and twomonth playoff staking a franchise on three aging stars may be a shortsighted solution despite the plentiful fist pounds on the bench and the quasicollegiate camaraderie , there is a glaring talent chasm between the big 3 and the random 10 championship teams need a viable second unit , and this club does not have one as i write this , boston has the best record in the nba , but that means little over the long haul the amount of wins we get this year is insignificant i honestly could not care less , rivers says such sentiments are often prefabricated coachspeak , and at first , that s what i think he s expressing but as he continues , i realize he s being uncommonly candid fifty wins , 60 , 45 it does not matter all i want is to be the best team we can be when the playoffs start , and i know that we can be better than the team we are now there are teams that have a huge advantage over us , and we ca n't make that advantage up we have to make it up in other ways san antonio , detroit , dallas they 've all been to the finals , and two of those teams have won it all they 've been in game 7s and in team fights and in team controversies we 've have n't been in any of that we 've been in nothing , and we ca n't catch up to them in that regard so chemistry kind of becomes everything for us we never practice for the next day we practice for the playoffs it is an oddly pessimistic perspective for a winning organization rivers is keenly aware that adding highprofile older players to boston s roster does n't equate to adding meaningful experience only one current player has won a championship \( the reserve james posey \) this grand experiment may generate nothing more than a lot of regularseason wins for the celtics , which , in pro sports , is just a slower way to get fired but still that s better than going 2458 , no \? an inconsequential win is still better than an inconsequential loss , right \? well , yes you wake up better you sleep better , rivers says actually , you do n't sleep better but you do wake up better the celtics have kevin garnett they may still need ambien
beijing it was obvious that this was not just another victory when the captain of iceland s team squad , with a big lead and only 30 seconds left in a semifinal game , put his hands to his face and cried when the players carried their postgame celebration through the tunnel of the national indoor stadium , a bigger indication of the victory s magnitude followed behind the players and the coaches came iceland president olafur ragnar grimsson , wearing a smile and happy to chat this is the biggest moment in icelandic sports history , he said and no one disagreed iceland has never won a gold medal in any olympic sport that includes the winter games , despite the seeming advantage of having a wintersport playing surface in the nation s name iceland has three medals in its history , all in individual summer sports a triplejump silver in 1956 , a bronze in 1984 and a polevault bronze in 2000 we are only 300 , 000 people , gudmundur ingvarsson , president of the iceland handball federation , said before the match that is a population roughly equal to bakersfield , calif , or toledo , ohio what do you expect \? now iceland is about to get another medal , this time in a wildly popular team sport , a sort of lacrosse without sticks or basketball with goals instead of baskets and the next medal just may be made of gold with a smattering of enthusiastic icelandic fans at the national indoor stadium , and with the majority of icelanders watching on television during midday there many stores were closed in reykjavik , and movie theaters showed the big match on big screens iceland beat spain , 3630 , earning a surprise trip to the championship game against france on sunday we 've had individual victories before , and we won our first medal when i was a kid in a small fishing village in iceland , the 65yearold grimsson said and i remember vividly what a national celebration that was but for a small nation like mine to come with a whole team and to be victorious against some of the greatest nations , nations that have millions and millions of people , it s not just the message for us in iceland i think it s a message to the international sports movement , that anything is possible grimsson said he considered declaring friday a national holiday but thought that people in iceland were celebrating it like a holiday on their own , without the urging of the president i think people are dancing in the workplaces , in their homes , grimsson said there will be celebrations long into the night nobody will do anything tomorrow and when the final will be played , the whole country will come to a standstill the team s celebration was a bit more muted it planned a trip to mcdonald s the important thing is to have given joy and happiness to 300 , 000 people who speak the same language that i do , the 35yearold captain olafur stefansson said that s what it s about there were about 75 icelandic fans sprinkled through an arena that holds 18 , 000 , although certainly hundreds or thousands more will someday claim to have been there , too most were members of the nation s olympic contingent , which included 28 athletes who qualified for the games eight in , three in trackandfield events , one in judo , one in and the 15 handball players none of the others came particularly close to earning a medal but they were among those with the country s flag painted on their faces , chanting and clapping constantly through the handball match if we win this , we 're going to count them as 15 golds , one for each player , said axel nikulasson , an icelandic ambassador in beijing he sat upstairs in section 301 among a group of four adults and six children , wearing handpainted tshirts in support of iceland a few rows behind the bench , johannes valdemarsson wore a blue wig , and his chineseborn wife , junia vald jia , wore a red one he danced during timeouts , and his hummed with text messages from friends wanting to know what it was like to be there the couple had brought 10 iceland flags and distributed them to chinese fans near them , creating an impromptu icelandic cheering section at halftime , with iceland leading , he could barely conceive of the idea of iceland reaching the goldmedal match everything will be crazy , he said i do n't think i will have enough adrenaline to handle it president grimsson said he was pleased that he would not have to excuse himself during a luncheon on sunday with president hu jintao of china grimsson had told hu that if iceland lost in the semifinals , he would have to leave early to attend the bronzemedal match the goldmedal match is scheduled for later in the day president hu jintao said , i sincerely hope you will be able to stay for the entire luncheon , ' grimsson said i thought that was a very diplomatic way of supporting the icelandic team and after lunch with world leaders , grimsson will head to the stadium like the rest of iceland , he wants to see if the biggest moment in the nation s sports history can be followed so soon by another one

the fifth down s guest blogger of the week , andrew furman , peppered the comments section with insight during the giants playoff run he has his own blog ,  by andrew furman on feb 2 , a day before the super bowl , ultimatenyg quickly ran through the rookies from the draft class of 2007 , pinpointing them as a big reason the giants were in the big game with the super bowl in the record books , is there any doubt that the rookies were also a big reason the giants won the big game \? they made an impact on the biggest stage of all any credit given to the rookies has to start with the front office and jerry reese all of the great successes in professional sports are due in part to the front office finding talent and getting the support players who allow those stars to excel men like eddie debartolo , bobby beathard , ron wolf , george young and the rooneys are the lifelines for how these organizations can make championships possible not only once but again and again ernie accorsi set the table for reese and tom coughlin by locking up a number of key players for a long time , simultaneously passing down a salary cap that was in very good shape the giants cap room is the best in the nfc east and is in a very good position to keep reese competitive with new signings where he deems fit where accorsi ended , reese began reese was also the director of player personnel , so the result of the 2007 draft was going to fall squarely on his shoulders it was historic and seismic reese s draft made him instant royalty the firstyear impact players became known as reese s pieces super bowl or not , reese s crop of kids made such a big splash that it was almost uncomfortable for him to accept such inordinate praise he went out of his way to compliment the young group of players he redirected accolades to the coaching staff for enabling the draft class to assist the team so positively and so quickly the new giants were not all along for the parcells ride , where rookies are seen but not heard with the exception of adam koets , every other rookie drafted \( and even a few who were signed as ufas \) made significant contributions this added up to a record number of rookies getting super bowl rings  how do the giants win if 1 pick aaron ross is not providing tremendous coverage all season \? as soon as ross started playing meaningful minutes , the defense tightened up everyone remembers the second half of the first redskins game , but does everyone remember that that was the first time ross stepped in to play corner \? he was there knocking marion barber down with a separated shoulder he was there to save the jets game when the rest of the team was flat he was not immune to getting beat , but he had mostly excellent coverage and could also be physical add that he played through multiple injuries , had madison , dockery , webster and mcquarters rotating in and out with their injuries , and you can see how significant his efforts were in getting the team to a championship for a second pick , steve smith was almost allworld if not for a midseason injury , he would have been putting up numbers all year he caught four passes in the super bowl , none bigger than the play sandwiched between david tyree s helmet grab and plaxico burress s gamewinning td on 3rd and 11 , smith caught a pass in the right flat , came to a complete stop to avoid going out of bounds , ran another 34 yards up field for the first down , then went out of bounds to stop the clock that kind of play would have been excellent for a seasoned veteran like amani toomer , but for a rookie who did not even play half the games this season , it was nothing short of spectacular it will be overlooked in history , but giants fans who appreciate the rookies will remember smith s grab and key first down as long as they remember the super bowl xlii win jay alford \( 3 \) plays a tough position for any rookie , dl but he was good enough to provide rotation relief among the veterans and his entire career may already be remembered for the sack on 2nd down of the final series that buried tom brady and the patriots chances zak deossie \( 4 \) put the finishing touches on the 1990 championship season s analog by being the long snapper and impact special teams player for a giants super bowl winner just like his father 17 years before it was enough to bring steve deossie to tears kevin boss \( 5 \) filled in for injured te jeremy shockey his great hands made him an instant threat and kept defenses off balance as soon as he went into a route the boss catchandrun for 45 yards at the beginning of q4 of the super bowl ignited the offense and set up the first goahead score imagine a rookie doing what welker , moss , burress and toomer could not do ! boss s chemistry with eli manning was so impressive that it forced others to question whether shockey was already yesterday s news that conclusion is unfounded , and the giants will likely reap many rewards from a two te set with double threats michael johnson \( 7a \) filled in and started for the giants when other safeties were hurt he never lost his aggressiveness and was instrumental in the team s drive to 62 earlier in the season at one point he and undrafted rookie craig dahl were each patrolling the defense s deep waters a large responsibility that proved critical along the team s path to a super bowl coughlin went out of his way to point out that it was johnson who got the mcquarters nightmarish fumble vs green bay knocked away so that domenik hixon \( another great pickup by reese \) could recover the ball ahmad bradshaw \( 7b \) , the last giant pick , was taken only a few spots from the end of the draft bradshaw was featured early and often on ultimatenyg because his speed , cutbacks , quickness to the hole , northsouth running , pass catching and ability to pound defenses was a total find it took an injury by brandon jacobs \( on top of derrick ward already being on ir \) for bradshaw to get up on the depth charts high enough to be seen his impact on the team s lateseason and postseason drive was nothing short of stunning in the second half of the bills game w16 , when everyone knew the giants were running the ball , bradshaw told his teammates during a timeout that if they made their blocks he would take it the distance one snap and 88 yards later , he helped sew up the team s playoff berth the accolades he received from competitors was a reminder that bradshaw can be special for quite some time if he remains healthy his only weakness was a lack of experience and knowledge in how to pick up the blitz this may get squared away in 2008 s training camp , affording him the opportunity to be the starting rb he is that good the giants made a very special run to collect their third super bowl title it is next to impossible to envision how this could have happened without the major contributions delivered by this fine rookie class as a group , they exhibited maturity and experience beyond their years the draft of 2007 can be the backbone for many playoff runs to come \( andy f has been bleeding giant blue since the late 1960s with fran tarkenton , spider lockhart and ron johnson from 4thand17 to the tyreeplaytobenamedlater , all things giants football can be found on his blog at \)
athletes who take human growth hormone might not be getting the boost they expected while growth hormone adds some muscle , it does not appear to improve strength or exercise capacity , according to a review of studies that tested the hormone in mostly athletic young men the review was released monday the research has some limitations and sheds no light on longterm use of hgh the scientists noted that their analysis included few studies that measured performance the tests probably do not reflect the dose and frequency practiced by athletes illegally using the hormone experiments like that are not likely to be conductedit does n't look like it helps , and there s a hint of evidence it may worsen athletic performance , said the review s lead author , dr hau liu , of santa clara valley medical center in san jose , calif the california researchers had support from stanford , government agencies and genentech inc , which makes growth hormone none of the groups had a role in the study
the ' recent losses have come in a sickening loop , one in which the outcome is sensed before the rest of the grisly plot unfolds one loss is barely distinguishable from the next because only the details how many runners were left on base , which reliever failed change from game to game the cumulative effect has been six defeats in seven games , with the latest and perhaps most numbing of all coming thursday for the second time in 18 hours and the third time since sunday , billy wagner blew a save and the , who hardly touched while falling behind by four runs through seven innings , edged the mets , 54 , in 10 innings to spoil a beautiful afternoon at shea stadium i'm sick to death to see what our team s doing , wagner said before , in his next breath , verbally flogging himself for costing the mets two victories and nearly a third for all of the mets' shortcomings , and they are plentiful , there is one thing that they do perhaps better than any other team in baseball day in , day out , no team finds more remarkable and creative ways to lose during this dreadful stretch , they have lost on a hit batsman with the bases loaded and on a gameending home run , they have lost when pedro mart nez pitched and twice when santana pitched , they lost when they scored six runs against one of baseball s worst offenses \( san diego \) , and they lost three straight to the padres by the score of 21 they have dropped to 3134 , seven and a half games behind firstplace philadelphia , which beat florida on thursday night we 've had some of the most bizarre endings that i 've ever had in my life , manager willie randolph said you ca n't even make it up and to think , randolph uttered those words thursday morning , about five hours before his stomach turned to mush and the bullpen betrayed him yet again in their past four games , the mets have failed to hold a tworun lead in the eighth , a fourrun lead in the fifth , a threerun lead with two outs in the ninth , and now this , when they led , 40 , after seven and 42 through eight wagner was the primary culprit thursday as he was wednesday , as he was sunday but joe smith gave up two runs in the eighth that gave arizona hope , and aaron heilman allowed the winning run , on a miguel montero sacrifice fly the bullpen has allowed runs in 9 of the mets' last 10 games its earned run average has swelled by more than half a run , to 418 from 367 this is a team effort , and i think my teammates in the bullpen know what they have to do , said santana , who allowed 3 hits and struck out 10 over seven scoreless innings i trust every single player on this team no one has deserved that trust more often this season than wagner , who through may 22 had converted 9 of 10 save opportunities and had not allowed an earned run in his first 18 innings but the next night in denver , matt holliday socked a ninthinning home run against him , which set the stage for the mets' fifth straight loss since then , wagner has failed to convert 4 of his 8 save chances while allowing seven earned runs , including three homers one came sunday in san diego , when tony clark blasted a pinchhit threerun homer in the eighth , and the most recent occurred wednesday night , when mark reynolds s threerun homer with two strikes and two outs in the ninth ruined mike pelfrey s brilliant start before the mets won in the 13th i just do n't have an answer , wagner said i have to get three people out before they score wagner came in to pitch the ninth and allowed the first four hitters to reach base on a walk , a single , a runscoring double by chris young and another walk that left the bases loaded with nobody out for orlando hudson , who , with the infield playing in , sent a grounder to shortstop jos reyes he threw home , forcing out stephen drew , but ram n castro , who had a chance to throw out young at third for a double play , looked only at first before holding onto the ball i was going to throw to first , said castro , playing for the first time since being yanked from sunday s lineup for oversleeping it s kind of hard to turn and throw to third so up came the cleanup hitter conor jackson he followed with a high chopper near second base that reyes flipped to damion easley for a forceout , but easley s return throw arrived a splitsecond too late to complete the double play as young scored the tying run it was the first time since may 1226 , 2000 , when wagner blew five straight for houston , that he has failed to earn a save in three consecutive chances back in the clubhouse , santana was icing his arm and watching what he presumed to be the final three outs of a muchneeded victory as wagner struggled again , santana said he did not smash any doors or ram his foot through the television that s reality , santana said what else is real is that the mets stranded 11 runners , eight after the sixth inning , leaving the bases loaded in the seventh and ninth the ninthinning rally concluded when easley grounded into a fielder s choice on a close play at second , setting up the heartbreak to come i do n't think it s going to be this way all season , randolph said we 're just in one of those real bad ruts where the baseball gods are not good to you inside pitch before learning the results of wednesday night s magnetic resonance imaging exam of his left calf , which revealed an aggravation of the strain he sustained on may 21 , moises alou sounded resigned to landing on the disabled list again he sounded none the better afterward , although the mets plan to wait an additional day or two to see whether alou , a notoriously slow healer , somehow improves quickly as reflected by his 347 average , alou is a major addition to the mets , but his absence has made it practically impossible for manager willie randolph to field a consistent lineup only five times in 65 games has he been able to start what would have been the mets' desired opening day lineup the mets are on the verge of signing their second firstround pick , reese havens , to a deal that includes what has reported to be a 14 million signing bonus havens , the no 22 selection over all out of south carolina , will begin his professional career as a shortstop , but it is likely that the mets ask him to switch to second base or catcher
last night i would have loved nothing more than to play a bedtime song for my 9yearold son , jack , and then relax with my wife , a hardworking middleschool science teacher but instead i stayed up late examining the latest maneuver in the neverending tussle between opponents of limits on greenhouse gases who are using holes in climate science as ammunition and those trying to raise public concern about a human influence on climate that an enormous body of research indicates , in the worst case , could greatly disrupt human affairs and ecosystems i have a short piece in tuesday s paper on a quirky conference on climate questions organized by the antiregulatory heartland institute the meeting , which wraps up today , has brought together a variegated assemblage of people who reject the prevailing scientific view as reflected in the findings of the intergovernmental panel on climate change and other scientific statements  the article probably won t make anyone immersed in this tussle happy it describes the meeting for what it is a gathering of scientists , economists and individuals , some with industry ties but many driven mainly by libertarian passions or a nonconformist streak , who have hugely varied views on what s up with climate \( see the news story for a few details \) the one thing all the attendees seem to share is a deep dislike for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gases update 9 37 am a reader noted this useful additional background on the publicrelations goals of the meeting at realclimateorg a video report from cnn is here \( scroll down to last player box on page but i ll surely also get angry email from some of the hundreds of scientists who ve devoted careers to identifying links between greenhouse gases and warming many top scientists in this arena feel none of the skeptics \( or merchants of doubt , depending on whom you talk to \) deserves an inch of newsprint there was significant grumpiness about my sunday story on cool weather in a warming world , as a result one of the unavoidable realities attending global warming a reality that makes it the perfect problem is that there is plenty of remaining uncertainty , even as the basics have grown ever firmer \( my litany more co2 warmer world less ice rising seas and lots of climate shifts \) some skeptics have long tried to use the uncertainty as an excuse for maintaining the status quo campaigners for carbon dioxide curbs seem reluctant to acknowledge the gaps for fear that society will tune out so the story migrates back to the edges catastrophe , hoax no doubt i find no comfort in seeing stories that i write about humans and climate frustrate both sides \( just look at recent blog comments to gauge this \) in theory , journalists can go home content if no one is happy with a story that means you ve cut things down the middle , given time to both sides , been fair and balanced , to use a completely overexposed phrase i m not content when i m forced to cover the edges of the discourse \( and i know each edge would like to think it s the new middle \) , that threatens to obscure the enormous body of established science that is not in dispute , which should be enough to inform smart policy i m trying to do several things in my articles , where space allows convey what s confidently understood about the human influence on the climate and then honestly describe the range of responses \( from the individual to the intergovernmental \) that might meaningfully limit related risks i also try to characterize the voices in a story , so readers understand possible motivations beyond simply a search for understanding there are scientists who are also libertarians , liberals , campaigners or paid promoters i won t always get it right the hurdles to effective journalism on issues like this are many \( and pressures on the media are making things worse , not better \) i ll post on those hurdles this week , drawing on a couple of book chapters i ve written on this challenge my son and wife were asleep before i finished this

we have four children we are homeschooling and we hope to continue that up until they go off to college elizabeth do you have a bias against homeschooled students \? they don t always have the classes available to them , such as ap , honors , labs , etc if you don t have a bias , what do you look for in a homeschooled student \? the transcript may include nonstandard courses how do we let a school know , other than with standardized test scores , how they might be a good fit for that school \? leslie howard mr walker of texas homeschooling is a more recognizable educational enterprise than it once was this has made directors of admission more comfortable with their ability to properly evaluate a student s readiness for the rigors of a challenging college curriculum and a student s social adaptation skills we recognize that there are many ways to get a rigorous education , and ap and honors classes are just two of the most popular examples we probably provide better service and a more complete and personal evaluation of our homeschooled children than we do to our more traditional applicants while homeschooled children present slightly different application materials , the differences are shrinking we are seeing parents become more entrepreneurial in finding good educational experiences for their children , and more parents are pooling resources to provide the more specialized subjects in the sciences the web has allowed for a much broader and more organized enterprise than was ever possible even the term homeschooled has become a less accurate description of where learning takes place the term is more descriptive of where the administrative staff resides and where the student s home room might be mr syverson of lawrence we welcome homeschooled students just as with high schools , there is great variation in the strength of the preparation we see among homeschoolers and in many instances , because they are not presenting a traditional set of credentials , it is important for homeschoolers to be particularly thoughtful about what they will include in their application some will submit a number of sat subject tests taken over the course of several years as a way to document their mastery of these areas others will prepare for ap exams as another way to document , with a traditional metric , the rigor of their work many will submit one or more substantial works they have done as part of their courses mr poch of pomona i do have skepticism about some versions of home schooling we will seek concrete evidence of preparation which may , for better or worse , fall both to a wider range of standardized testing but also to evidence of collaborative work with other students both academically and socially the home schooled student does carry an additional burden of proof how to address it \? good and deep articulation of the courses of study followed representation of knowledge acquired and intellectual skills developed interview if possible admissions officers may rely more heavily upon standardized testing than we would like because the transcript of a home schooled student will carry the imprint of a parent and the references if written by a tutor or parent cannot address questions we would have regarding the engagement of a student with a teacher and peers in a classroom or collaborative learning environments anticipate what we would like to see develop a full curriculum and make sure math and laboratory sciences are part of the experience even where general admission requirements may ask only for optional presentation of tests or where no sat subject tests are required , i suggest that the student present those familiar representations of their work and achievement if the standard expectation of the college is for two sat subject tests , send more send four or five in different academic areas to fully represent a range of academic exposures mr brenzel of yale we see only a few homeschooled applicants , and we do occasionally admit a homeschooled student evaluation is usually difficult , however it helps if the applicant has taken some college level courses , and we can get evaluations from those teachers we are not keen on homeschooled students where the only evaluations come from parents and the only other information available consists of test scores how well do the criteria used in the admissions process predict future college success \? do colleges track their students fouryear gpas and such and look for correlations with admissions data \? if so , what kinds of trends do you see \? jen what procedures do you have in place to measure the fairness of your process \? what kind of followup do you do on your decisions \? in what circumstances would you consider one of your decisions to be a failure \? margaret heisel mr syverson of lawrence most colleges periodically conduct research to correlate the data they collect during the admissions process with the outcomes experienced by their students the two outcomes typically assessed are gpas at the college and graduation rates not surprisingly , in the majority of studies , high school grades have the strongest correlation with college grades the sat and act have the next strongest correlation , but this too is not surprising because they have a strong correlation with high school grades i believe that defining success in college as the college gpa is too limited a definition , as there are many students who have marginal college gpas but have had very successful college experiences in terms of their personal growth and the things they go on to accomplish after college assessing those other types of success are much more difficult than just tracking gpas and graduation rates , so studies traditionally focus on grades as the measure of success most of us can agree , though , that a student who flunks out of college did not have a successful experience , so we conduct studies to try to identify the characteristics of students who have been unsuccessful our application review process is designed to ensure that we give every applicant a thoughtful review and the opportunity to rise to the surface of the applicant pool some candidates clearly demonstrate are insufficiently prepared academically to be successful in our program , so the rest of their application may receive a less thorough review if a student fails here academically , due to lack of preparation or ability , we would question whether or not we made the best decision mr walker of texas we attempt to validate the objective factors of our admission process on a regular basis we test for how accurate they are in predicting freshman year gpa when attempting to predict longer range outcomes such as graduation or life success there are simply too many variables over which we have no control there is a great deal that can happen in a student s life over four years that has an effect on their gpa and graduation patterns but nothing to do with their intelligence even predicting oneyear performance has the problem of variations in grading practices , disciplines pursued , class schedule , teaching styles , etc , making it difficult to get high correlations between test scores and freshman year gpa mr brenzel of yale we draw our students from the very most competitive fraction of high school graduates from a statistician s point of view , there s not much variance in that group virtually all the students we enroll are extremely talented and accomplished with respect to what can actually be measured in the admissions process not surprisingly , they tend as a group to be very successful in school and career pursuits , both in the short and long runs after they come to yale , what differentiate them are their individual choices and decisions , not the small differences in their admissions credentials mr poch of pomona at pomona , training includes norming exercises where the entire staff will review the same set of applications to share multiple perspectives with our colleagues the intended benefit is to expose our individual analyses to our colleagues and to consider and represent institutional interests , not personal biases there are other checks and balances , too if someone on the admission staff has an external relationship with a candidate or the candidate s family , they are required to remove themselves from any discussion about the applicant and to keep out of the admission decision that same restriction applies to faculty members who sit on the admissions committee in the end , we face the judgment of faculty and deans who will share their impressions of their students with our staff students will also let us know what they think about their peers we are ultimately responsible to the community as a whole for choosing well and if we get it wrong , we will hear about it ! how do the colleges weigh the writing portion of the sat versus the reading and math sections \? in other words , are students evaluated on a 2400 scale or the more traditional 1600 measure \? barry schkolnick why don t all schools take the writing portion of the sats into consideration \? i understand that it is important to get an idea of an applicant s passion through their application essay but there is always a good chance that the essay is not a true indication of an applicant s writing abilities since it could have been coached or polished by a parent , tutor , etc susan mr syverson of lawrence every college has its own system of review and weights different portions of the application differently despite the fact that an application essay may not be the candidate s own work , many colleges also feel that the writing portions of the sat and act are not necessarily indicative of the type of writing that is expected in college the admission process is imprecise and subjective applicants and their families often seek specific , concrete answers about the process in an effort to assess their chances for admission , and many are suspicious that somehow the process will not treat them fairly \( which translates to they won t gain admission to the college they most want to attend , despite being a wonderful person who has done well in high school and will probably be very successful after college \) college admissions officials are , for the most part , thoughtful , caring individuals they take their jobs seriously they read applications carefully informed by their institutional priorities at that particular moment in time , they weigh all of the information available to them about students in an effort to make the best possible matches between students and institution at the most selective institutions , there are far more wonderful applicants than can be admitted the fact that lots of good students are not admitted does not mean there is anything unfair about the process , even though there is not some magic , objective recipe that will guarantee admission mr poch of pomona my impression is that the sat writing test is more and more frequently working into the overall evaluations but that institutional differences certainly come into play i confess i am still adapting to the new vocabulary of a 2400 point scale when i first had students saying , i got 2230 , i had to quickly run calculations in my head i knew what 2400 meant but the reality is that admissions officers do not yet seem to talk the 2400s mr brenzel of yale we have been getting more comfortable incorporating the sat writing section into our evaluations , although again , it s good to remember that at most selective colleges , high test scores characterize most of the applicants and most admissions decisions are therefore based on other criteria are you willing to publish some aggregate statistics on your admits \? for example , would you publish average and standard deviation of high school class rank and sat scores , broken down by public school versus private school , and whether the student was a legacy or a recruited athlete \? cah thank you for your explanations of how sats and acts are used in the admissions process when i researched colleges , i also wanted to use standardized tests as one factor in my evaluation i ve searched in vain for average scores on the mcat , gmat , gre and lsat exams taken by a school s graduates why aren t these scores available \? john martens mr brenzel of yale more statistics are publicly available than you might think , but myths persist despite whatever statistics get published for instance , a number of readers seem to be under the illusion that yale , and some its peer institutions such as harvard and princeton , cater exclusively to a powerful elite , where less qualified legacy applicants \( children of alumni \) dominate the admissions process the truth is that in this year s entering class at yale , only 13 of the students were legacies , consistent with classes admitted over the last two decades moreover , enrolled legacies on average have test scores and grades higher , not lower , than the average for the class as a whole , and they also outperform their predicted college grades unfortunately , cultural and media obsession with myths about a tiny handful of colleges obscures the real problems in higher education more generally among the poor , there is widespread lack of access to adequate k12 preparation for college and to effective means for financing a college education among the affluent , artificial college ranking systems published by profitdriven commercial publications produce a status mentality that disguises the basic good news about our country s higher education system relative to the rest of the world , we are absolutely loaded with highquality colleges and universities looking for good students , and virtually everything important about student success depends on how a student uses the resources at a strong college , not which one in particular he or she happens to attend mr poch of pomona aggregate statistics are quite widely available though the common data set which is used for many college guides our aggregate representations of recent classes are on our web site and i think you will find most colleges make that information freely available we haven t cut all these figures up into all the subsets you have asked in large part because it reflects no statistically significant differences at some point the numbers in those subsets can become small since our entering class is fewer than 400 \( for example , male students from private schools in montana versus women from illinois or california or new york city public schools \) but i do take your point that this could be reassuring and provide further transparency mr syverson of lawrence while we would be willing to research and provide such statistics , at colleges as small at lawrence , some of the numbers you seek would not provide meaningful information you also need to understand that many schools do not provide class rank , and the differences between high schools are as great among publics and privates as between the two groups groups like recruited athletes and children of alumni run the gamut from the top to the bottom of the class statistically , so there too , such statistics might not yield much helpful information i m not sure how many colleges even systematically track those graduate and professional school test results for their graduates and , again , at small schools like lawrence , the small numbers in each of the categories might limit the value of the compilations i m curious as to how admissions criteria are altered or shifted in importance for a transfer applicant compared with a freshman applicant colin j how are transfer applicants from community colleges viewed in the admissions process \? what advice would you offer these applicants \? maureen mr poch of pomona there are huge variations in transfer student possibilities from institution to institution some have lots of room and some little or none usc enrolls more than 1000 transfer students each year pomona has room for 10 to 15 obviously different factors affect both of these patterns and common answers will be hard to find transferring to pomona is tough there are proportionally many fewer spaces than there are for first year students in huge part because of the high graduation rate of our incoming first years space doesn t open up we look at the high school record , especially for those seeking to transfer as sophomores we look closely at the college record and the extent to which the student has pursued a general education program which would leave them time to dedicate the time they and we would wish to their electives and their major when they enroll at pomona we will explore the reasons for transfer and to understand as best we may about why pomona and how the student sees life changing in our educational environment are they transferring from something or to something \? mr brenzel of yale our unusual system of residential colleges makes the freshman year and sophomore years critical to our undergraduate program so we maintain only a very small transfer program , limited to 24 places each year mr syverson of lawrence in the case of transfers , the bulk of the academic evaluation focuses on the college record we welcome transfer applicants from community colleges and treat them essentially the same as transfer applicants from fouryear colleges an increasing number of schools are offering their students the choice of studying for and taking the international baccalaureate \( ib \) diploma what are your views on this qualification regarding the importance you assign to it in the admissions process and its relevance in preparing students for college \? finally , thanks for taking the time and trouble to participate in this discussion simon r mr brenzel of yale we treat ib programs very much like ap programs in our evaluation we believe the ib program to be a strong , challenging program for college preparation mr syverson of lawrence the ib program is a rigorous academic program that is gaining in popularity here in the united states some students take individual ib courses while others strive to complete the entire ib diploma we view ib coursework as comparable to ap coursework , and will award lawrence credit for strong scores on either the ap exams or the ib exams \( though only those who complete the ib diploma can receive credit for their results on the subsidiarylevel exams \) what recommendations do you make to applicants with learning disabilities on the one hand , our son has achieved a remarkable academic record which is all the more remarkable given the additional hurdles he has had to overcome i would think that such determination warrants special recognition on the other , i suspect that some schools would see only a potential problem they would rather avoid so should the application refer to these issues or should that wait until postacceptance discussions about accommodations , etc \? ndm mr brenzel of yale it helps us to have specific information about disabilities , whether learningrelated or other , because as the questioner notes , it can help us see accomplishments in context and also determine better if we will be a good fit for a particular student but let me say this how does it help a student proceed in education and life to be taught that he or she needs to be manipulated or packaged or even disguised in order to gain some imaginary advantage with a college admissions committee \? good students in this country have many , many choices among excellent colleges and universities , where their success is going to depend almost entirely on their own actions and decisions my general advice to parents is simply to worry less about achieving an admissions edge and to focus more helping your student to be happy , enthusiastic , curious and wellprepared to seize opportunities mr poch of pomona a student who has worked against longer odds because of a learning disability and who performed well is able to provide evidence that they developed compensation mechanisms that can work to their favor on the other hand , we do sometimes receive calls insisting the c or d grade on the high school transcript was because of a learning disability and that we can t hold that against the student it will be the performance \( and underdeveloped compensation mechanism \) not the disability that would work against the student mr syverson of lawrence we favor honesty in the admission process and therefore encourage students with learning disabilities \( or other potential special needs \) to identify that to us in the admission process so that we can put them in touch with the appropriate individuals on our staff to discuss the accommodations available to them it has no impact on our admission decision , but if the student is skeptical , they can delay bringing it to our attention until after they are admitted i encourage them to engage the college in dialog prior to enrolling , so that they can ascertain whether or not it will be a viable environment for them questions from readers \( updated on dec 18 at 4 50 pm \) as a teacher who writes 20 or so recommendations a year and tries to make each letter unique , can you offer any more information about how such letters are read \? i try to present as honest an appraisal as possible but sometimes wonder if that s in the best interest of my students do you look for what is stated in recommendations \? what s not said \? after having written literally hundreds in my career , i find myself wondering if the at least 2 hours per recommendation i spend is worth it are there cases where recommendations will tip the balance for or against admission \? mary mr brenzel of yale recommendations play a critical role for us , and we deeply appreciate the time teachers put into writing good ones if you teach at a school from which we receive multiple applications , the same officer will read and evaluate any recommendations you write for those applicants if each recommendation reads about the same , with numerous positive adjectives but little in the way of concrete detail , the recommendations tend not to be helpful we look for professional judgment from teachers , not simply warm feelings and we look to see whether teachers incline toward calling each bright student one of the best i have ever taught , or instead try to distinguish the really extraordinary individual from those who are strong in the usual ways mr poch of pomona i am grateful for fulsome teacher references and even more appreciative of those which are candid , sharing the good with the bad over time we sometimes get to know a teacher who has written for a number of students a balanced reference will establish credibility for a teacher and is very helpful for our efforts on the other end of the spectrum is the dismay we feel when we see literally identical references written for multiple students from the same classroom sometimes that has even meant a telling of the same tale or moment about students who clearly are not connected that situation reflects more poorly on the teacher than the student , and while we recognize the enormous burden reference writing does require of the author , we value and depend upon that input from someone who has worked closely with a student references can command even greater importance in a residential college environment where our students will live and work together gaining a sense of competitive or collaborative instincts and an impression of a student s interest in engagement with peers and instructors provides important insights which can have an impact on the learning communities we are trying to build the length of a reference isn t our measure of its worth we are also very mindful of the context of high schools a teacher engaging 200 students per year will not likely have the time to write many pages for each of her students when they do , we will take notice that a top student has received such a strong endorsement a teacher in a classroom of 10 to 15 students will often write more mr syverson of lawrence typically , all the documents in an application tend to affirm each other , but occasionally a recommendation , essay , or interview reveals something significant about the applicant that we would not otherwise have known in most cases , no single document tips the balance , but in a few cases it does i encourage writers of recommendations not to spend time summarizing information that will be available elsewhere , but instead to focus on aspects of the student that may be known only to you because of your interactions with them specific anecdotes or examples that support your comments are likely to be powerful a short recommendation that effectively highlights one specific trait , activity , or characteristic can often be the most helpful be honest do you really read all the essays submitted \? or , do you read only for the borderline cases \? vinod mr poch of pomona we do at pomona but some colleges use the essays as a tie breaker and some work in a holistic review which more carefully considers the essay whether for content or writing style in cases of a generally solid application , an essay becomes increasingly important in the case of an otherwise weak application , it may not take much more than a skimming of the essay to seal an impression a brilliant essay presented in an application with substantial weakness in academic performance will not likely compensate for other concerns and could possibly lead to questions about authorship or editing influences essays that reflect or amplify the impression of the person created by the application as a whole are read fully and appreciated mr syverson of lawrence at lawrence university and other small selective liberal arts colleges , all essays and recommendations are read carefully \( as is every other document the student submits \) when reading an application , we strive to gain a reasonably complete picture of the student strengths , achievements , and aspirations , as well any particular challenges they may have overcome through this process , we seek to identify students who will not only be successful , academically , but who will also contribute to the vibrancy of our residential campus community through their personalities , perspectives and outsideofclass activities academics is foremost , but we want this to be a stimulating , engaging environment in lots of other ways , as well mr brenzel of yale we look at every essay from every applicant , and for students who reach the level of serious consideration , essays may end up being read multiple times how do you encourage students to spend their summers \? are professional work experience or programs abroad viewed positively or can some become too gimmicky \? evan mr syverson of lawrence this was addressed well by one of my colleagues yesterday students should follow their passions and develop the aspects of their personalities and proficiencies that are most exciting to them , not the ones they think will best package them far too many students are spending far too much of their young lives attempting to do what the colleges want to see in an applicant in order to someday gain admission to some highly idealized \( often hyperselective \) college loren pope , onetime editor of the new york times education section , who passed away earlier this year , spent much of his latter years promoting the concept that the quality of a student s college education has more to do with the student s engagement than with the specific college through books like beyond the ivy league and colleges that change lives he argued that there are many wonderful colleges in the us that offer an educational experience as good as \( or better than \) those at the highest profile colleges \( albeit without the pedigree \) the college search should focus on finding a college that is a good match for the student not just the most selective place to which they might gain admission mr brenzel of yale we encourage students to make use of their summers in the way they find most interesting if they undertake a specific program , it should be because it appeals strongly to them , not because they imagine it will look best on a resume why \? first , it is frankly impossible to know what will look best to a particular admissions committee at a particular college trying to outthink or outguess the admissions committee strikes me as a useless exercise , though many book authors and private consultants purvey the illusion that they can do this for you second , for both education and life , the best program is the one that you find most valuable for yourself at this point in your life we also honor and value summer jobs for many students they are necessary and for others they can be just as important a learning experience as anything else what s important to us in not what you chose to do for the summer , but what you got out of it mr poch of pomona while unusual activities may add a great deal to a student s experience and have a profound effect on their world view , for some it just comes across as decorative , not substantive is a special experience or summer expected or a minimum requirement \? no many of those special experiences reflect the educational and economic background of the family more than the curiosity or talent of the student for example , i believe most admissions officers would assume it s not fair to expect a student who works and contributes to family expenses to take an overseas internship i confess i often wonder why some students who live in areas that have many social service needs unaddressed will ignore the local situation but move to another country to perform a similar social service is it really a service trip or is it a summer vacation built for college admission purposes \? it may be both and that s not a penalty point , but it isn t a bonus consideration either is the student whose family connections provided an internship at a highprofile organization more worthy than a student who delivered pizza or tended to family farm commitments \? the rest of the application will give us the answer it has long been understood that there are five main facets of an application transcript , recommendations , standardized test scores , extracurriculars and essays if a student s transcript is in the weaker half of the applicant pool , but the remaining four facets are quite exemplary , will an elite college be willing to take a chance \? jonah mr poch of pomona the more selective the institution , the more likely the decision for admission may turn on things not so easily quantified if the application suggests strong basic competence academically , the other qualities of a candidate become interesting and often determine the outcome i am interested in both where a student is at the current moment as well as making a guess about where they may be in a year or two or three perfect records in high school don t always suggest perfect students in college a student who had a bump along the way may know more about how and why they learn than one who has been grinding along without a second thought glowing references , strong tested ability , leadership strength and a terrific interview can sometimes outweigh a transcript with a glitch or two but in highly selective environments are not likely to override a real mess of a record mr brenzel of yale weaker transcripts face tough sledding in a highly selective college environment they don t automatically disqualify a candidate for us , but you have to remember that we have many thousands of applicants with extremely strong transcripts who are also just as exemplary in the other ways that count i m a junior in new jersey , and i feel i m a pretty good student recently , a college guidance counselor emphasized that doing community service is essential , not just for the common good , but also for college admissions how valid is this claim \?

does a student from a wellknown private school automatically have a leg up \? elizabeth is the quality of an applicant s high school taken into consideration \? matthew we live in rural wyoming where class offerings are limited because schools cannot afford to pay teachers to teach ap classes for five kids what advice do you have for students in rural communities who are extremely bright and motivated but do not have access to the same course selections as students in urban and suburban areas \? is there any possibility for them to apply to elite schools \? sherrill hudson mr poch of pomona a wellknown private school student does not automatically have a leg up everywhere sometimes private schools have more grade inflation than the nearby public schools sometimes the students at the public or parochial school had to work harder to gain resources or opportunities that were more typically available at the independent school context matters in the consideration of an applicant even within new york city or los angeles , there are vastly different opportunities available to students depending on the school they attend or the resources their family may have 4h commitments in a rural community may be as stunning a leadership signal as volunteer work in a new york city museum i think many applicants and their parents would be surprised to learn about the high school origins of most admissions deans and officers , even at the most selective colleges and universities those alma maters are overwhelmingly public schools and often are not public schools that appear on top 10 lists i would urge the new york times to poll admissions deans about where they attended high school and whether it was public , private , parochial , rural , urban , suburban , wellsupported or underfunded mr walker of texas to ask if the quality of an applicant s high school is taken into consideration in the admission process is a little like asking if attractiveness is taken into consideration in a beauty contest though we try not to rely so heavily on the school that a student attended , the benefits of good schooling shows up in so many ways that it would be less than honest to say that the school one attended doesn t matter the goal is to not let the name of the school blind you the individual qualities of the student mr syverson of lawrence we recognize that there are differences in high schools , although it isn t necessarily just a publicprivate distinction there are both strong and weak public and private schools in terms of academic rigor and opportunity , there are some public schools that can match even the best private school we recognize that an a at one school may indicate a different level of achievement and experience than an a at another school , or even in another class high schools send us profiles that help us to understand their particular environment grades are not just taken at face value they too are contextbased we have high regard for students who are clearly motivated and have seized available opportunities to challenge themselves within their school , even if the school s offerings are more limited if there were a test for motivation , timemanagement skills , and studyskills , i would take it over any standardized test we have available to some extent , that s what a transcript provides mr brenzel of yale we are always looking for students who excel in context , and we are acutely aware that context and access to resources vary widely \( and wildly \) across schools every year we get the other side of this question from those at private schools if i had only gone to a public school in a less populated state , would i have stood out more and been treated more favorably \? it is important to keep your eye on the bigger picture if you are a highachieving student in whatever context your circumstances have placed you , a number of strong colleges are going to be vying for you as a student and again , ultimately it matters far less which strong college admits you than it matters what you do with your opportunities once you arrive there do they anticipate discounting more heavily as the economy worsens \? or do they hope to buck the trend among other luxury products \? jg will the financial crisis affect your university s financial aid policy \? will you put more weight on an applicant s financial condition when considering his or her application for admission \? jason bourne mr poch of pomona pomona remains completely committed to financial aid support for our students and will remain needblind in our consideration of applicants we will continue to meet fully the demonstrated need of our admitted students who enroll , and we will continue to do so for the duration of their enrollment we will do so without expecting students to assume any loan burden as part of our financial aid packages there are a handful of colleges with similar plans and aspirations though there are many others that have financial resource challenges and may not yet know what they can afford to do next year i have heard no outright reports of colleges cutting aid , but we do know that loan challenges will surface for some families i would reemphasize the importance of students and their families respecting deadlines for aid applications because the clearest way many colleges may have to control growing pressure on financial aid budgets may be to stick to those deadlines increasing numbers of students in recent years have delayed filing financial aid applications , sometimes because of costs and sometimes because of the paperwork they have waited until after an offer of admission was extended this delays getting an aid package and this year , could result in outright denial of support even for students who have need don t dawdle in filing ! mr syverson of lawrence the downturn has forced us to look even more seriously at our expenditures and to identify areas in which we can significantly reduce them , but at lawrence , there is a commitment to protecting the academic and artistic integrity of the institution so , we have not eliminated plans to fill our current faculty vacancies nor are there any plans to cut our financial aid budget mr brenzel of yale a family s ability to pay for a yale education has no effect on our admission decision , and this has been true for over 40 years further , our president and trustees have made their first priority sustaining yale s quite extraordinary financial aid programs we actively recruit lowerincome students to come to yale , and this is not changing with the economic situation there is a lot of controversy about using tests like the sat and act in the admissions process , and some top schools don t even use the scores other schools intend to deemphasize these tests in the admissions process in the future some studies have shown these tests not only to be biased against students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds but also to be a poor prediction of college success how much do these tests really figure in the admissions process and how can you give talented poor kids a chance when so much emphasis is placed on the tests \? scott mr syverson of lawrence lawrence university made the decision to go testoptional students who believe their act or sat scores are consistent with the rest of their academic record and will represent them well in the admission process are welcome to submit their scores , whereas those who believe their test scores do not appropriately represent their academic capabilities may choose not to submit them in 2004 , bates college reported on 20 years as a testoptional college they had collected sat scores from nonsubmitters who ultimately enrolled and determined that , in spite of having sats that were 160 points lower , the nonsubmitters graduated from bates and achieved gpas that were virtually identical to those of the submitters you can read their fascinating study here  the nacac \( national association for college admission counseling \) commission on the use of standardized testing in undergraduate admissions recently released a report that is critical of the sometimes outright misuse and the overemphasis currently placed on these tests by our society the entire report is available here additional good information is available at fairtestorg  mr poch of pomona colleges have a variety of testing requirements because they have found different parts of the application correlate best with success at that individual institution even the most selective colleges and universities use standardized tests thoughtfully and understand that they should be used in context , not as a standalone indicator grades matter references matter for some , test scores correlate perfectly with the rest of the application for some , they may make little sense the weight assigned to test scores may vary within a college , too a student from a comfortable background who had test prep courses and attended very strong schools may be expected to present stronger tests than a student who had fewer resources and no test prep the dials are adjusted for all sorts of things in an application , including testing i urge students to look at graduation rates as one signal not just crude overall rates , but at graduation rates for students like themselves do financial aid students graduate at comparable rates to nonaided students \? do latino students graduate at a rate comparable to the overall student body \? do students of african descent \? do student graduation rates vary by geographic origin \? do graduation rates vary much by the sat or act score of enrolled students \? all of this will signal that the colleges are fulfilling their commitments and are admitting students appropriately for that institution mr brenzel of yale we know that test scores correlate highly with socioeconomic circumstances and school resources , so we do not penalize students with fewer advantages who also have somewhat lower test scores mr walker of texas for some colleges , sat or act results are not useful because nearly everyone is admitted anyway for others , the test results have become less useful because all students have about the same test score and therefore the tests have lost all power to discriminate and for others still , the test scores are useful as one piece of information but not the only piece that separates students from one another if used honestly , the tests should only carry the amount of weight that is appropriate to make important distinctions among applicants that can t be made more accurately in some other way to mr brenzel of yale what is the purpose of deferring 2 , 644 students in this year s round of applications \? you say that the deferred student will be reevaluated in the regular application process , but seeing as your freshmen class this year had 1 , 892 students , there is no possible way that most of these applicants stand a chance of being accepted in addition to the 742 accepted early and the regular applicant pool yet to come why do you prolong the misery \? alexander mr brenzel of yale this question makes two false assumptions that being deferred is a misery and that deferred candidates have relatively poor chances of admission though odds of admission to yale are always long , each year we accept about the same percentage of the students deferred from the early round as we accept of the regular decision applicants we are often looking to see how applicants perform in the first half of senior year , when many students are taking their most challenging schedules or seeing their primary activities outside the classroom bear fruit at the same time , we do try very hard to give final decisions to as many students as possible , where we feel certain that we will simply not be able to offer admission in the spring this year we let over 2 , 100 students know that we were closing our consideration of their applications , about 38 of our early candidates virtually all of these applicants were very strong students , who are going to attend great colleges and have great success we only chose not to defer them so that they could focus wholeheartedly on their other applications for mr walker how has the controversial texas top 10 percent rule which guarantees admission to state universities for the top 10 percent of all high school graduates affected the quality of the students admitted at texas , and what is the retention rate from the freshman to sophomore year \? thank you a alaniz mr walker of texas the disparities between the have and havenot public high schools that produce the top 10 percent students is cause for concern their preparation for study at a large , selective flagship is uneven given that they come from all high schools in the state having said that , we have studied top 10 percent students since the law was passed in 1997 we have posted the annual results of our study on our admission research web site for 10 years what we have learned is 1 \) as measured by freshman year gpa , top 10 percent students outperform nottop 10 percent students this has been without exception for 10 years 2 \) within the top 10 percent group , gpa goes up with increases in sat scores in other words , when we control for rank in class , sat scores do matter as an indicator of freshman academic performance 3 \) the superior performance of top 10 percent students extends across all majors 4 \) retention rates are highest among top 10 percent students visit our web site for more information questions from times editors what part of the admissions process is most misunderstood \? jeff brenzel of yale university it is not well understood that we are not aiming to pick out the best candidate in a particular school or from a particular area , as measured by some predetermined criteria rather , we are trying to assemble the most varied and most interesting class we can from an extremely diverse group of close to 25 , 000 outstanding applicants we do not aim to compare a student primarily with other students from his or her school we look instead for students who will bring something of particular value to the entering class second , few people seem to grasp the weight given to various aspects of the application , though this can vary considerably by institution for us at yale , for instance , standardized test scores generally do little to differentiate applicants , because virtually all our applicants score very well most important to us are the transcript and the school and teacher recommendations , which students can do little to influence once it comes time for an application we also look closely to see where and how a student has developed talents or engaged the school or community outside the classroom essays and interviews round out an application , and we look here mostly to see whether they convey information that enlarges or enhances , while remaining consistent with what we hear from counselors and teachers bruce poch of pomona college most of it ! as i read admissionsrelated web sites and blogs , i am often struck by the mistaken and sometimes troublesome counsel about what matters sometimes that advice comes from counselors , sometimes from parents of other students and sometimes from peers rather than from the individual college some of that bad counsel relates to questions about what to report or what to conceal grades and scores , the core if not sole basis of decisions at some institutions , may be a much smaller part of an ultimate decision for students applying to a very highly selective institution where most applicants clearly enough can do the work why students chose a particular course of study may matter a great deal to an admissions officer how they approach a classroom or learning environment may mean more than just the letter grade received in a class students should objectively look at what they have submitted and ask themselves if questions remain unanswered for a reader of that application do the essays reflect ideas and personality or just present a report of involvement \? does it sound like the student wrote the essay \? was a change of schools midyear explained or left to the wild imagination of an admissions officer who may read an unanswered question as a signal of danger \? why was a particular extracurricular activity the most important involvement \? bruce walker of the university of texas at austin the most misunderstood part of the process is that colleges have different missions and goals when selecting a class , and that an acceptance or denial will likely be for different reasons across multiple colleges steven syverson of lawrence university we all have our own institutionally idiosyncratic ways of making admission decisions but the common perception tends to be that all colleges are difficult to get into the reality is that nearly 90 percent of america s fouryear colleges admit more than half their applicants , and with the exception of students who apply only to hyperselective institutions , most applicants are admitted to one or more of their top choices another misconception is that colleges admit students from the top down , academically , and stop when they have filled their class the academically outstanding applicants will likely be offered admission , but a substantial portion of the class will be filled with students who are academically qualified , but also have some other characteristic that is attractive to the college \( eg , athletic or musical talent , a parent who attended the college , or a personal or cultural background that is unusual at the college \) and , when a student is denied admission to a college , there is often the presumption that they were not qualified at highly selective colleges , the reality is that many \( perhaps most \? \) of the denied applicants meet the academic standards for admission , but were not offered admission simply because there was not sufficient capacity to accommodate all academically qualified candidates given that colleges need to admit a certain balance of athletes , legacies , artists , musicians and developmentoffice selections , is it reasonable for people to expect the process to be fair \? mr syverson of lawrence this really depends upon what is defined as fair colleges don t admit all their students just based upon their academic prowess each college strives to enroll a class that meets a number of objectives for the college provide enough athletes to have competitive teams , provide enough musicians who play the right instruments to round out the needs of the orchestra , maintain good relations with alumni donors by enrolling their children , etc these needs and objectives vary by college and by year if this year we really need a bassoonist for the orchestra and a point guard for the basketball team , then bassoonists and point guards have an advantage if next year we need a baseball pitcher and a violist , but have plenty of point guards and bassoonists , then bassoonists and point guards no longer have an advantage it can be argued that it would be unfair to other members of the orchestra if the admissions office did not enroll a qualified bassoonist if they had the opportunity to do so mr walker of texas we try to keep the process fair but you have identified some situations where the public believes the process is not fair this is an extension of the question about what part of the admissions process is most misunderstood mr brenzel of yale every college aims at putting together a diverse and interesting class , and colleges differ greatly in their institutional priorities accomplished students with high aspirations will find a welcome at a broad range and a large number of excellent colleges further , it matters far less exactly which of those colleges they attend than it matters how prepared they are to engage the world of opportunities available at any strong college the fairness issue that concerns me most is not whether wellprepared students will be admitted into good colleges in this country , they will the real fairness question is whether poor students have anything like an equal chance to obtain good preparation for college , not to mention access to a means for bearing the cost mr poch of pomona i reject the conclusion that some of the things on this list are quantifiable or even a given at some institutions , legacy interests are specifically excluded from consideration at some , developmentoffice selections do not exist \( at pomona , for example ! \) at some , coaches get their picks and let the admissions offices know whom to take , and at others , the coach may simply communicate interest in an athlete but will have no direct control over the choices made by the admissions officers i know of no place with a specific quota on legacies , artists , musicians or any of the categories listed in a larger university with a division i athletic program , typically the size of the institution translates into the athlete entering without displacing the possibility of another student enrolling how has the recession affected the admissions process and the availability of financial aid \? mr poch of pomona this remains to be seen and there are crosscurrents and contradictory stories coming from across the country and which vary from public to private and large to small institutions many colleges are writing to alumni and friends reporting new assumptions for budget planning many apparently will freeze hiring or hold salaries to a current level or expect only very modest salary changes most conversations i have been privy to reflect serious concern about maintaining student access to their institutions and universities to students across the economic spectrum , whether those institutions are large or small , private or public , well endowed or more modestly endowed some colleges made very significant commitments to loanfree aid programs , which are being maintained this year many will work to ensure the continuing availability of aid even if other areas of the budget may have to be constrained i hope not to hear about colleges cutting needbased aid while preserving merit aid , but acknowledge that s a personal bias , and that some may see this as a survival tool what does worry me is some early reporting of smaller numbers of middle and lowincome students submitting applications or submitting aid applications i do think it will be critically important for students to submit their aid applications before deadlines this year and not wait until after an admission offer has been extended in a year many colleges and universities experiencing a budget crunch , there may be nothing left at the end of an admissions cycle to actually meet their need if it has already been fully committed to those who got things in on time mr walker of texas we are seeing higher numbers of applicants to public universities than in past years we will not know the real impact of the recession until families have to pay a deposit and commit to a known cost mr syverson of lawrence the support that colleges receive from their endowments is likely to decrease because the values of their endowments have dropped this may cause some colleges to reduce the level of funding they can provide for financial aid other colleges may maintain their commitment to financial aid , or even increase it to assist those families who are in distress although it might be difficult to increase the commitment to financial aid at this time , it might be even more problematic for a college to lose enrollment i suspect that families who can pay the full cost of education will be even more attractive to colleges now than in the past there are a number of plausible and perhaps competing impacts of these financial uncertainties for example , it is probably prudent for private colleges \( at least \) to anticipate a drop in their yield rates , which will mean they need to offer admission to a larger number of students to fill their class at the same time , some of the private colleges , particularly less selective ones , may see an increase in applications and enrollments as a result of public institutions reducing their enrollments of new students due to cuts in funding from their states it is likely that we will see an increase in the number of students enrolling at community colleges , though at least one state is discussing reducing its community college enrollment typically when the economy is bad , the number of students enrolling in college actually increases because there aren t many jobs available it is very likely that graduate school enrollments will increase for the same reason and colleges that offer programs to retrain workers who have been displaced from their jobs are likely to see demand for those programs burgeon mr brenzel of yale thankfully , it has not affected us at yale , and president richard levin has just reaffirmed in an open letter to the yale community that preserving our extraordinary financial aid initiatives is our first priority for the immediate future in an environment where so many applicants have good grades and test scores , what s the most innovative thing an applicant has done to be appealingly memorable \? mr walker of texas students are being told \( my perception that it is mostly by hired counselors \) that they need to do something to stand out in the applicant pool clever promotional gimmicks will be talked about around the office but seldom , if ever , will the clever promotional gimmick be why a student gets admitted the best selfpromotion is to be an outstanding student mr poch of pomona what works best is what best and most fully and consistently represents the applicant tricks that don t fit the person end up looking like gimmicks , without real substance the student who years ago sent in a lifesize doll who was her best friend , equipped with a recorded endorsement of the applicant , left the admissions staff feeling like it was in a twilight zone episode creepy don t send brownies , tshirts or love notes just write a good application , choose recommenders well , write a thoughtful , personalityinfused essay and if an interview is offered , do it mr syverson of lawrence i resist answering this question directly , because many of us are striving to help make the college search and admission process less stressful for students every year the media publish some amusing stories about unusual strategies employed by individual applicants , but i fear this prompts more students to believe that doing some bizarre thing is an appropriate strategy to gain admission to their favored college we should avoid encouraging that behavior jeff brenzel of yale university we re much less interested in innovative applications than we are in innovative students , who have shown over time the spark of real intellectual curiosity and a real enthusiasm for engaging with peers , schools and communities how have you seen applicants shoot themselves in the foot \? mr brenzel of yale few of our applicants shoot themselves in the foot what concerns me more are the number of high achieving students whose lives are governed by what they , or perhaps more often their parents , imagine is going to improve in some slight way their chances of admission to this or that particular school exploration and growth serve a student best for the long run , both in education and life , not the construction of a perfect resume we try as best we can to distinguish the one from the other mr syverson of lawrence it is reasonably common for students to try to impress us with how much they love our particular college , by incorporating a mention of our college into their essay \( for example for the past four years , every time i was ready to give up on math , the thought of gaining admission to lawrence university inspired me to redouble my efforts \) but it is also a notinfrequent experience for them to forget to replace all the mentions of some other college in their essay though i doubt that many students are denied admission over such a faux pas , the current ability to cut and paste so easily can sometimes come back to haunt students it is also particularly imprudent to plagiarize an application essay but the most frequent form of selfinflicted damage is careless preparation of the application in the days of handwritten applications , it might have been poor handwriting currently it is simply that they waited until the deadline to finish their essay and complete the remainder of their application , so they are hurried and don t proofread carefully a poorly presented application can , in fact , have a negative affect on the admission decision mr walker of texas by creating inconsistencies within the application file when students attempt to make themselves sound better than they are , the admission officer has to wonder where else the student has stretched the truth mr poch of pomona see my answer to the previous question ! do you have any way of getting beyond the persona that a student presents , on paper or in an interview \? mr walker of texas a public flagship university with a large applicant pool , and limited time , rarely has the opportunity to get beyond the surface with an applicant s persona but there will be opportunities for getting to know the student better , such as scholarship competitions , on campus interviews , etc , that can help with this problem mr brenzel of yale all aspects of the application say something to us we try to add those things together to see whether we can picture a real , living person , with interesting talents and authentic interests the information we have is imperfect , our judgments are imperfect , and the time we can spend on evaluation is short but the process works well enough in general that the great majority of talented , hardworking students find a college where they can thrive mr poch of pomona a complete application really does reveal a pretty full picture which does penetrate a manufactured persona if teachers describe what a student is like in their classroom rather than just reporting the grade the student received , we may well get a glimpse into a student s learning style or how they have used and contributed to a classroom if a student provides a multipage resume of activities and the teachers barely mention any of the leadership claimed in the activity roster , surely that may raise a question about actual involvement transcript performance will be reflected in teacher comments , too interviews likely will pick up on themes in the application and may amplify why a student has chosen some paths rather than just repeating what is on the list it should all come together mr syverson of lawrence we do get beyond the persona that a student presents , but we re not interested in digging into facebook to do so

when news surfaced over the weekend that , , and other rap stars had been implicated in a steroids investigation , some hiphop fans were shocked , but to many in the industry the accusations seemed inevitable although public accusations of steroid and humangrowthhormone use by rappers and rb stars like , who was also named in the investigation , according to a report in the times union of albany are all but unheard of , the latest news struck a chord about the increasing pressure on these performers to maintain perfect , even superhuman physiques as a part of their overall image and brand the spectacle of hiphop now is so much greater than it s ever been , said jeff chang , the author of the hiphop history ca n't stop wo n't stop there s always the battle aesthetic at work , this idea that you 're going to go up there and show that you 're badder than everybody else it s part of the swagger that hiphop carries the investigation , by the albany county district attorney s office , has focused on doctors who illegally prescribe drugs for nonmedical purposes none of the celebrities have been accused of breaking the law , though the times union , citing anonymous sources , reported that the stars have received packages of prescribed steroids and humangrowth hormone at their homes , at hotels around the country and at the offices of a long island chiropractor but the recent news highlights an issue that has long been whispered about in hiphop as some performers have leaned ever more heavily on a schwarzeneggerian body as part of their public image the producer and rapper timbaland , whose real name is tim mosley , weighed more than 300 pounds before his dramatic turnaround a few years ago , when he began a rigorous exercise regime and transformed himself into a bodybuilder , dropping more than 100 pounds in the process representatives for timbaland and 50 cent did not respond to requests for comment yesterday a spokeswoman for ms blige said that the singer had never taken steroids , and a spokeswoman for columbia records had no comment about wyclef jean anabolic steroids and human growth hormone can have immediately visible results in rappers as in athletes , decreasing fat tissue and increasing muscle but the longterm consequences of the growth hormone can be severe , said dr alvin m matsumoto of the university of washington and the veterans affairs puget sound health care system if you take it in excessive amounts , it will stimulate a lot of softtissue growth , make the jaws larger , dr matsumoto said there could be a lot of the manifestations of organ enlargement heart enlargement , liver enlargement all tissues are enlarged , basically , because of growthhormone stimulation and that s not good talk has swirled about many rappers who have maintained suspiciously olympian musculatures but for 50 cent , in particular , the news could affect his business a former boxer , he has long promoted himself as fit and abstemious he also has a line of vitamin water sold through glac au , which was bought by cocacola last year for 41 billion the marketing of the images is so key now to so many different bottom lines , mr chang said not just the music industry , but a whole range of consumer products your body is your brand and you 've got to maintain that image the machoness and braggadoccio , that s always been a part of hiphop what s different at the highest levels of the money game in hiphop is the size of it all how the allegations will be received by fans , however , is far from clear illegal or unsavory behavior carries little stigma in some corners of the hiphop world and troubles with the law can even help the allimportant celebrity story line fans watch these people like they are watching movies , danyel smith , editor of vibe magazine , said these kind of controversies , she added are considered another arc in the narrative people will wait to see what good , and what tragedy , will come of it

les jackson did a very good job of presenting the positives of the organization , and fabian really felt this was the right fit for him , fabian s agent jp barry said in the dallas morning news of the stars cogeneral manager who engineered the deal barry didn t mention if brett hull , the cogm formerly known as the stars ambassador of fun , might have done anything to influence fabian as well here s an interesting statistical analysis of brunnstrom s potential by scott cullen of tsn watching the way dallas played game 1 , you d think they skated a doubleheader recently the wings played very strongly and they believe they can get even better dallas has no choice the game might have turned around early in the second period with detroit on top 20 , after a prone marty turco made a terrific stop by extending his stick along the ice to steal a goal from henrik zetterberg , who was attempting a wraparound \( one more stride holding on the the puck and z berg could easily have scored \) then the stars rushed the puck the other way and how often we ve seen a sure goal thwarted at one end leading to a big goal at the other \? but this time , chris osgood stopped a good pointblank shot by niklas hagman and you never got the sense the wings were in trouble again the officials didn t do dallas any favors , however , especially on tomas holmstrom s second period goal with holmstrom just about sitting in turco s lap since the nhl scuttled the toeinthecrease rule following hull s 1999 ot no goal cup winner against buffalo , they ve had increasing difficulty policing the crease and confusion about what constitutes goaltender interference and how to penalize it on montreal radio team 990 this morning , bob mckenzie suggested the nhl adopt the rule that us college hockey and european leagues use , that if a player skates through the crease , even if he doesn t make contact with the goalie , play is whistled down and the puck is facedoff outside the blue line that sounds rather workable , although some , no doubt , will complain that it ll slow the game down well , stay out of the crease and the game won t slow down mac has seen that rule in action his son plays for st lawrence university and if it was a detriment to the flow of play , we seriously doubt he would suggest it coaches in limbo in the vancouver province , jason botchford writes that coach alain vigneault s future is solidly in limbo as new gm mike gillis sifts through the wreckage of the canucks oncepromising season one reason no move has been made , botchford says , is that there are no alist candidates on the open market on the available list , there is pat burns , a winner but one who is a potentially risky shortterm solution there are the unwanted , including pat quinn , who probably has too much baggage to return here there are the unproven scott arniel , peter deboer and dale hunter , who would have to learn on the job none scream 15point improvement now , if mike babcock or joel quenneville ever become available , things could change it s sorta the same story in raleigh , where hurricanes owner peter karmanos \( who must be doing cartwheels with the red wings playing so well \) will be flying in from detroit to meet with canes coach peter laviolette next week no one is commenting on anything to luke decock of the news observer in ottawa , bruce garrioch writes in the sun that owner eugene melnyk has asked gm bryan murray , who has said he would not be back behind the bench next season , to consider remaining the coach murray s an excellent coach , the thinking goes , but it s nearly impossible to do both jobs today while murray hasn t interviewed coaching candidates , the belief is he s made a list and will soon start the interviews , garrioch says and from tampa , where the wild continue their organizational meetings , there is nothing new from jacques lemaire on whether he wants to coach the wild again , although he is more than willing to discuss his reservations with tom powers in the st paul pioneerpress  sorry jacques , alain , bryan and peter , but for you , we must do the limbo rock  skating around as the leafs search for a gm continues , damian cox in the toronto star wonders if the qualifications that president richard peddie is seeking in candidates might not be ones that necessarily lead to nhl success dave nonis , who is rumored to be on his way to toronto as gm , or interim gm until gm inwaiting brian burke takes over , told the vancouver sun the leafs have not contacted him and finally , over lunch yesterday , olie kolzig confirmed to tarik elbashir of the washington post he took his nameplate down in the dressing room because the verizon center will no longer be his business address it sucked that i wasn t playing , said washington s longesttenured professional athlete 16 seasons and a fan favorite but he acknowledged his stats this year were below what everyone wished they d be he hopes to get another shot somewhere , but if the offer is not out there i ll just sit by the pool with a sixpack a capital idea
brett favre versus giants' secondary when these teams played in week 2 , packers quarterback brett favre completed 14 straight passes to start the second half his short , quick throws were a form of slow torture for the giants , who played too loosely on the receivers and could not find enough time to mount an effective pass rush but things are different now for the giants , in good and bad ways the pass rush evolved into the nfl s best , with 53 sacks in the regular season and the giants' secondary became increasingly physical with receivers in playoff victories over tampa bay and dallas , the giants bumped receivers hard at the line of scrimmage , knocking them off their routes and upsetting the timing of the quarterbacks' throws the giants want to do the same to favre , making him hesitate long enough to allow the pressure to arrive , leading to sacks or errant passes making matters difficult for the giants is their depleted defensive backfield cornerbacks sam madison \( stomach \) and kevin dockery \( hip \) are unlikely to play , and aaron ross \( shoulder \) , a starter , is sore the backups were good enough against tony romo and the cowboys , but can they keep it together against favre and the packers \? giants running backs brandon jacobs and ahmad bradshaw versus packers running back ryan grant brandon jacobs , ahmad bradshaw and ryan grant were giants teammates in september and when the giants and the packers played at giants stadium on sept 16 , after grant , right , had been traded to the packers , none of them had a carry jacobs was out of the lineup with a knee injury sustained in the opener bradshaw s only lasting contribution was a fumbled kickoff that helped turn an 8point fourthquarter packers lead into a 15point advantage grant was awaiting his star turn , which did not come until injuries unleashed him as a surprising key to green bay s championship plans grant had 201 yards and 3 touchdowns on 27 carries against the seahawks last week , and a subplot of this game is whether the giants vastly underestimated his abilities when he was the no 5 running back on the depth chart he was traded for a sixthround draft pick the giants seem to be in good hands with jacobs \( 27 carries , 88 yards in two playoff games \) and bradshaw \( 23 carries , 100 yards \) the trick for the giants is how to alternate them effectively without quashing the momentum one or the other has built the teams versus the weather the giants tried to spend the past week deflecting questions about the weather , figuring that they should not worry about things they could not control then they spent the week trying to figure out how to control it with gametime temperatures expected to be about 0 cold enough to turn those beers in the stands into slush in minutes the giants made some contingency plans they practiced outside , in temperatures in the 30s , which is cold enough to typically send them indoors quarterback eli manning , hoping not to repeat his fivefumble performance in warmer temperatures at buffalo last month , practiced with a glove on his nonthrowing hand he will not wear one on his right hand , but he will have plenty of miniature heat packs inside the muff he will wear around his waist manning , who grew up in new orleans and played at ole miss , may take some solace in the words of favre , who is from mississippi favre said he had never grown accustomed to the cold , so there is no inherent advantage for the packers after all , they practice indoors he said cold weather was more a question of mind over matter for those three hours , you just have to suck it up and handle it , he said whichever team sucks it up best probably goes to the in the desert of arizona by the numbers 0 interceptions of eli manning in two playoff victories he has not gone three games in a row without having a pass intercepted since weeks 24 in 2005 14 the giants' regularseason record when they recorded zero or one sack 92 the giants' record when they had two or more sacks 19 sacks of packers quarterbacks , third fewest in the nfl 53 sacks by the giants' defense , which led the league 30 the giants' record in conference championship games

joe henry and i had been talking about writing together for ages , and even tried it once , circa 2000 , with uneven results but now seemed the right time he started the engine , so he gets to take the wheel i wrote him an email i am hesitating with the disclaimer i want to issue here , about how i never let anyone see my lyrics this early in the game , and how i haven t written for a long while , so maybe it s a little awkward and stiff oh there s the disclaimer i wrote one to joe , too february 28 , 2008 joe , this is so rough and even a little juvenile , but there s something here to pull out i think really this is just an idea not a song yet so it goes i lost two friends , and each stood alone one died by the hand of god , one by his own i loved them both but so it goes , so it goes love and madness go hand in glove first the madness , and then the love i want you but you ll never know so it goes so it goes no one drives me like i drive myself i want to rest and put me on a shelf but just ahead are the lights of home so , so it goes so it goes we have in common an uncommon grace to live in this time , this \? \? , this place new york and everyone we know so it goes so it goes many years and many friends never pass this way again the last one standing is the first one home so it goes , so it goes so it goes a note it is not in my nature to cowrite i would rather go deep into the underworld alone , like persephone looking for the pomegranate the solitude and the simple satisfaction of having my own phrases laid out like beads on a necklace , while finetuning my melodies , suits me entirely but i have pushed myself to be a cowriter more often in recent years and to force myself to forgo both the arrogance and the insecurity of the solo voice my songwriting style is a synthesis of my strengths and my limitations , and occasionally it behooves me to borrow from someone else s strength , and offer a key to the locked door of someone else s limitations i had to give up the pride of thinking myself only a journalistic songwriter , in order to become a better writer overall joe and i have already weathered the most uncomfortable moment in cowriting the takeback last year , he had asked whether i minded if he took a prose work of mine called what did you dream this time \? to use some of the lines and ideas in a song , which we would cowrite i agreed , but when he actually did it , and i heard my lines inside his song , i felt suddenly and acutely territorial it took me a couple weeks , but i gathered the courage to tell him that i wanted those lines back , and that he couldn t use them in the song we got through it , preserved our friendship , and got back around to writing together again not only that , but i changed my mind a few months later when he sat in my living room and played me the song both ways with my lines , and with his revision i asked him to put my lines back in that experience made this one , writing so it goes , easier , and more compatible i m not afraid of him , and he s not afraid of me we know we can say anything , even though we may writhe in paroxysms of insecurity while we re saying it joe wrote back right away \( i quite like the tone you ve established with this one , rose \) , with changes to the lyrics i lost two friends , each one alone one by the hand of god , one by his own oh , i loved them both , that same god knows and so it goes , so it goes wisdom and madness go hand in glove one falls to the other , like need into love i want you in ways that nobody knows and so it goes , so it goes we have in common an uncommon grace taught us by time , revealed by the face of beauty in even the worst that we know and so it goes , so it goes \( sung as a bridge \? \) there s no one who drives me like i drive myself once more around before i rest on the shelf home is just one step beyond what i see and darkness the thing one step behind me many years pass , and so many friends and none of us ever may pass here again the last of us standing the first one who knows so it goes , so it goes so it goes , so it goes although i missed my line about new york , as i thought it gave a sense of physical weight to the song , i understood intuitively why joe had eliminated it , and i let it go without saying anything \( i do love geography in songs , however it gives me a special thrill my own songs that are tied to a particular place include seventh avenue , sleeping in paris and house on the lake among many others \) i liked how he made the last line the first one who knows , rather than the first one home , and overall he gave the lyrics a rhythmic structure that just worked better i was delighted from rosanne cash to joe henry oh wow you made it a real song i love it thank you thank you thank you and i like the alternate verse better , with revealed by the space i love the two lines that carry over adds so much fluidity didn t shakespeare do that \? \? yeah xxxrose soon joe wrote me back as follows still playing with this some , as i really like the shape and feel one thing i find i like sometimes and think it might work here is to create a form of 2 verses , a bridge , then a 3rd verse have an instrumental break , and then sing a variation of the 3rd verse over a repeated bridge form then conclude with a final verse did i describe that right \? what it does is puts a different spin on a particularly pivotal verse makes it like a hinge in the song allows something important to repeat and still be heard as an evolving thought i ll show you what i mean shortly if it works but i do think it works having a pair of couplets unresolved by the refrain line as a bridge and i like that one about driving yourself in particular being the bridge it swings to the personal in a way that the other verses are a little more objective thanks for the good words love , joe ps and yes shakespeare dabbled with this sort of the thing amazing how good he remains just flip through the sonnets i felt very comfortable letting joe guide this song to completion , and the whole experience was so easy and fluid that it boded very well for our future cowriting endeavors from rosanne cash to joe henry it s become very elegant , i think i love that you reprised the verse into a bridge do you need the word thing \? but i see in you the best thing that i am could it just be best that i am and scan correctly \? it was time to think about a melody , but i was so sick of my own melodies that i was hoping to get joe to do the heavy lifting on that as well i thought if i wrote one more song with a 146 minor progression i was going to have to shoot myself , or let all the other songwriters of the world do it for me , which they probably would be keen for from rosanne cash to joe henry subject so it goes joe , just reading the lyrics to so it goes this is really good have you tinkered with a melody yet \? i want so much for you to write the melody because you know more chords than me you know what i mean you would take it someplace i probably wouldn t know how to also first bridge what if the last line was truncated , if it worked with the melody , so it had only 4 syllables or so does that work \?

paradigm , the group formed 10 years ago by gus solomons jr with carmen delavallade and dudley williams , has always seemed like a good idea on paper but this company , created for and by older dancers , has n't always produced work equal to the talent in the troupe s latest program , presented on thursday at dance theater workshop as part of the summerdanz series , paradigm began with a bang kay cummings s stayin' alive , set to the bee gees' disco hit of the same title mr solomons , valda setterfield and mr williams , wearing hospital gowns and pushing iv stands , took shaky sideway steps across the stage occasionally pointing a tired finger in the style of john travolta or flashing a manic grin , the dancers , notably the hilarious ms setterfield , sparkled like vaudeville stars as an introduction , stayin' alive was also a deviously clever way of addressing the age issue but the meat and one real success of the program came from jonah bokaer , a young choreographer whose exceptional player prayer , a trio for mr solomons , ms setterfield and ms delavallade , gave the cast and its collective history a timeless gloss moving within a landscape of cool , greengray lighting by burke wilmore , the dancers wore sculptural layers of purple by oana botezban as they froze their bodies into striking tableaus or weaved across the stage in simple formations , frequently appearing in shadowy silhouette , they seemed like slender reeds slowly swaying in a shallow pond the digital sound score , also by mr bokaer , incorporated interviews conducted with the dancers , who had mp3 players strapped to their arms their overlapping voices , in snippets revealing the path each took to become a dancer , were transmitted through six speakers such an environment brought the past to the present , assimilating modern technology while never disturbing the dance s crystalline beauty the rest of the program was n't as distinguished robert battle s stages featured two dances in one expressionistic gestures in the first half , a vigorous romp in the second with neither section providing lasting appeal three scenes from archy mehitabel , by mr solomons , who portrayed a cockroach \( with a bizarre brooklyncockney accent \) , while ms delavallade played an alley cat , was an uneven theatricalization of the popular newspaper columns of don marquis in the early 1900s and mr solomons s three of clubs three of hearts had little to recommend it beyond ms botezban s colorful cloaks and the presence of ms setterfield and keith sabado none of the choreographers grasped what mr bokaer demonstrated so instinctively in player prayer with the truest of dancers , theater comes from the inside summerdanz continues through july 19 at dance theater workshop , 219 west 19th street , chelsea \( 212 \) 9240077 photo from left , carmen delavallade , gus solomons jr and valda setterfield in player prayer \( photograph by andrea mohin the new york times \)
nearly 40 years ago sesame street forged a new path in educational television for preschoolers but in recent years , as even very young children have migrated online , the show s web efforts have lagged far behind those of commercial competitors like the walt disney company and viacom s nickelodeon the show s nonprofit parent , sesame workshop , hopes to change that on aug 11 , when the new web site goes live developed over two years at a cost of 14 million , the site is making its debut the same day as season 39 of sesame street , seen weekdays on pbs kept under tight wraps until now , the site will be previewed for some in its target parent audience at the blogher conference for female bloggers in san francisco this weekend while there are no plans to discontinue the television show , sesame workshop officials have high hopes for the broadband site we view this as really the future of the workshop , as becoming the primary channel of distribution down the line , gary e knell , president and chief executive of sesame workshop , said in a telephone interview mr knell has set ambitious goals for the new site , asking the staff to double the use of the current site about 15 million unique users each month in just a year or two , he said the television show , by comparison , draws six million to seven million weekly viewers , on average , he said \( older sesame street episodes are shown on the cable channel pbs kids sprout , a joint venture of pbs , sesame workshop , comcast and hit entertainment \) a robust web site is a necessity for children s television companies , said sandra l calvert , director of the children s digital media center at georgetown university children expect it , and parents expect it , she said parents overwhelmingly think that computers are the gateway to children s futures but the sites are expensive to develop and unlike nickelodeon , disney and time warner , which mr knell said control about 80 percent of the worldwide children s television market , sesame workshop has a limited number of other onair opportunities to promote its site , making the challenges all the greater for sesame as an independent producer to try to compete for eyeballs , we 've got to be proficient technologically and innovative in content , he said like the sesame street television show , the site was based on research in this case it involved about 100 children of all socioeconomic levels at three preschools in the new york area , said glenda revelle , vice president for research for sesame s digital content the research found that children did not want a linear televisionlike experience on the web site , she said , and that online as on television , they responded strongly to having a muppet guide them so unlike other web sites , which rely heavily on flash animation , this one features a liveaction muppet video that welcomes children with a new educational theme every day perhaps equally important is a feature that children will not even notice a proprietary , trademarked option , known as playsafe , intended to reassure parents when the downloadable playsafe software is activated , it is technologically difficult for children \( but not adults \) to navigate away from the site , so parents can theoretically leave children alone in front of the computer without worrying that they will accidentally stumble onto inappropriate content , buy something or delete files although many earlychildhood experts strongly recommend that parents and children use educational web sites together , the reality is often different none of the other major children s educational play sites has such a feature , workshop officials say the system was developed in conjunction with cignex and firefly interactive each day on the new sesame street site , the muppet video will welcome children with a different theme , be it the number 5 or sharing the muppet will point children to a big green button , which starts a daily playlist of seven short alternating videos and games tied to the theme using a simple design scheme , the site s content , including 3 , 000 videos and 400 games , is reached via areas for games , videos and customizable playlists there s a section where the content is organized by specific muppet , and a my sesame area for saving favorites some games use a keyboard , for children who do n't have the motor skills for a mouse , and many use video , not animation segments for some new videobased web games were filmed at the same time as the television show , said miles ludwig , vice president and executive producer of sesame workshop s digital media group , adding that a year from now the tvweb crossover will be even more extensive , to deepen the learning as on the current site a big yellow star replaces the arrow cursor , and links are surrounded by sparkles , concepts that are easier for young minds to grasp , ms revelle said the site will be free , supported by sponsorships at the bottom of the page aimed at parents , and by a request for donations , to underscore the workshop s nonprofit status we wo n't do marketing to kids , mr knell said by contrast , commercial rivals like nickelodeon s noggin , and even pbs , have begun paid web sites , to complement their free sites we felt subscription violates the mission of what we 're trying to do here , which is to reach as many kids as possible with our content , mr knell said
john mcenroe sensed the moment after years at the top of men s , bjorn borg might be vulnerable , giving in ever so slightly so mcenroe , who had beaten borg at the 1980 united states open and at wimbledon in 1981 , pressed the perceived advantage in their 1981 open final he served and attacked with greater urgency , lobbed surprisingly well and closed out borg in four sets for a third consecutive open singles title months later , when borg told mcenroe that he was considering retirement at 25 , mcenroe realized the significance of his victory tennis may be experiencing a similar moment of change as this year s united states open unfolds has won four opens in a row , but s victories over federer at the french open and at wimbledon , and his move to no 1 after federer s 237week reign at the top , will provide the backdrop for what mcenroe describes as some type of gut check in the men s draw as the last major tournament on the grand slam calendar , the open is the perfect stage for transition differing conditions and strategies for day and night matches , the physical demands of hardcourts , unpredictable weather , finalset tie breakers , noisy crowds , and the idiosyncracies of commuting offer more than their share of potential angst a summer olympics so far away but so close to a grand slam event carries further burdens on an overcrowded calendar the open being the last of the majors has that sense of ending , of grinding it out , said billie jean king , a fourtime united states singles champion , whose name is on the national tennis center in flushing meadows getting to the championship , you know you 're not going to get another chance players are tired , but they 're willing to kill themselves in the last major the backdrop for nadalfederer is even more intriguing in light of their epic fiveset wimbledon final like borg , who lost four united states open finals , the 22yearold nadal has found the open his most difficult grand slam tournament he has not advanced beyond the quarterfinals last year , he lost in the fourth round in a 3hour 28minute foursetter at night to his fellow spaniard david ferrer , who is seeded fourth this year and in nadal s half of the draw but nadal has won two of his three hardcourt events this summer , including the olympic tournament federer faces a different set of challenges nadal s stroke improvement and surface maturity , and how to regain what jim loehr , a noted sports psychologist , describes as the sense of invincibility that separates champions from peers it does not take much perhaps only a single shot to shift the balance of power rod laver faced an older countryman , neale fraser , then the world s no 1 player , in the 1960 australian men s singles final i was down two sets to love , laver said recently fraser had two match points on me on one , he lobbed me i chased it down and let a backhand rip referring to his countryman roy emerson , laver said , emmo , who was watching the match , thought my shot was going out , but fraser volleyed it out and i was still in the match blessed with what he calls the shining light of opportunity , laver went on to defeat fraser for the first time , 86 , in the fifth set one year later , laver won his first wimbledon and gained the no 1 ranking he swept all four grand slam tournaments in 1962 , repeated the achievement in 1969 and became perhaps the sport s greatest player physical factors can often dictate a change ivan lendl s power game and commitment to fitness coincided with a nagging hip flexor that curtailed some of mcenroe s effectiveness after succeeding borg at no 1 and yielding only eight games to lendl in their 1984 open final , the 26yearold mcenroe lost to lendl , who was 25 , in straight sets the following year mcenroe never reached another grand slam final similarly , lendl s reign at the top was upended by a young power player , pete sampras , then only 19 , at the quarterfinals of the 1990 open lendl had reached eight straight open finals and it was federer , then only 19 , who put the dent in sampras s almost impenetrable sixyear run at the top , with a fiveset victory over the 29yearold sampras in the fourth round at the 2001 wimbledon championships one year later , sampras was ousted in the second round at wimbledon by a relatively unknown swiss pro , george bastl reeling but still dangerous , sampras walked away for good that fall after winning the united states open for his record 14th grand slam title federer turned 27 this month , and his fitness , form and confidence have remained questionable since his bout with mononucleosis last winter twentyseven is an age when your body starts talking back to you , mcenroe said rivalries can also spice drama at the top , none more so than the spirited 16year battle between martina navratilova and chris evert dominant at no 1 between 1975 and 1977 , evert won 30 of their first 50 matches navratilova s power and athleticism carried her to victories in 23 of the next 30 meetings , and evert was forced to reassess her fitness and tactics , most noticeably after navratilova s 61 , 63 rout in the '83 open final gardnar mulloy , a member of the international tennis hall of fame who will turn 95 next month , has been watching the changing of the guard since bill tilden s dominance was ended by ren lacoste and other french musketeers in 1926 if you have beaten a rival several times , you do n't think about losing , mulloy said loehr , the sports psychologist , said federer s failure to complete the comeback from two sets down at wimbledon had spawned a sense of doubt , only months after federer was being heralded as tennis s tiger woods nerves , a sense of failure and indifference can be products of a collapse , loehr said , pointing to federer s string of earlyround losses this summer to players he had dominated in the past it requires a whole new mobilization , loehr said in an interview from his sports academy in orlando , fla federer does n't need fame and money but he s got to get better he s got to go to a whole new level that s the only way he stays in the game king , never one to hang at the baseline , has her own theory on federer if i were him , i would take the fall off and get healthy and rested , she said think things through all the great ones love the challenge nadal s rise has drawn the respect of peers and past champions , especially for his performance at wimbledon , federer s home turf i could n't believe the tension in that match all the way , laver said , describing it as the best match he had ever seen a match like that can knock the wind out of your sails , he added , and nadal is oozing so much confidence but not everyone seems convinced that nadal , despite his consistency , commitment and work ethic , will have a long stay at the top there s too many good players now , said pancho segura , who had court savvy second to none he rattled off a list of potential challengers andy murray of britain juan martin del potro , a 19yearold argentine who has won 19 straight matches and ernests gulbis , a rapidly rising young latvian player nadal s got the best lefthanded forehand in the history of the game , and he s one of the best defensive players on the run , segura said but the difference is so small between nadal and the rest maybe he lasts one or two years throughout his ascent , nadal has remained respectful of his rival federer has said he would analyze and assess after the united states open it s just all a blur , he told reporters after losing to ivo karlovic in the third round of the cincinnati at the end of july players who have been to the summit often lack the tolerance to be no 2 or no 3 , loehr said but public perception often overshadows reality , especially when it comes to changes at the top it s amazing , mulloy said during a recent phone interview from his home in miami on the street , they say , is federer going to come back \? ' i say , come back from what \? ' what if he were the secondbest player \? in tennis , they do n't consider anyone ranked 10 if you 're the 10thbest baseball player or pro football player , you 're considered pretty special if you 're the 10thbest tennis player , you 're nothing
from the opening credits of raising the bar , s new drama of judicial tantrum throwing and tousled hair , we know we are many subway stops away from the dinge , greek coffee cups , billowing waistlines and other resplendently moody glories he and david milch offered in blue here now is a new york that glows and gleams in saturated color every day looks like christmas at rockefeller center even the public defender s office has good leather swivel chairs and tall plants in stylish pots if the assistant district attorneys are n't wearing prada , they 're finding very good facsimiles at hm the heels are high , the deltoids defined the series s cocreator , david feige , is a former bronx public defender , but it seems as though his field notes on the aesthetics of municipal government were quickly tucked away in a folder marked , completely ignore raising the bar , which begins monday on tnt , revolves around a group of young public defenders and the junior prosecutors whom they battle in courtrooms during working hours and drink beers with later some of these beers are consumed in a bar but some are consumed in the shower , because this is the kind of show in which three words generally relevant to any treatment of the legal profession conflict of interest appear to have been censured a morning in the district attorney s office might begin with a senior lawyer comparing the anatomy of a pretty young deputy to two bowls of yogurt young deputy have you even heard of a hostile work environment \? lascivious boss santucci v sussman , eighth circuit , 1997 even unusually vivid descriptions of foodstuffs do not , as a matter of law , constitute harassment for purposes of a title vii claim were raising the bar anything like ally mcbeal , that attractive deputy would be filing complaints and raising hell ally mcbeal began in 1997 with its heroine landing a position at a law firm in boston after having filed a sexualharassment suit in her previous job during its fiveyear run the show spent a lot of time mucking in the waters of male evildoing but the late 1990s are long over , the gender politics of the monica lewinsky years behind us , and raising the bar shows us how far we 've come or how far we 've receded since her body compared to a dairy product , michelle \( melissa sagemiller \) , the blonde with great cleavage , does n't rely on any statute to take care of business she climbs on her boss in his desk chair in an emasculative lesson to show him that he should n't promise what she knows he wo n't deliver perhaps catherine mackinnon will consider expanding her definition of sexual harassment to include false intent part of what makes raising the bar so loopy is its commitment to this peculiar politics of personal responsibility and to a sappy liberalism that means none of the accused represented by jerry kellerman \( markpaul gosselaar \) and his compatriots in the public defender s office are ever all that bad they are just mentally ill , or poor and struggling , or innocent mr feige has written eloquently about loving his work as a public defender , not out of some abstract devotion to the judicial process but out of the genuine feeling he developed for the addicts and crooks he spent time with but liking your job does n't necessarily mean you will be good at dramatizing it if the first three episodes foretell the rest , raising the bar will continue to give us criminals who are generally decent defenders who are passionate , right and uncompromised and prosecutors who stretch ethics to try to defeat them raising the bar gives us none of the formal comforts of law order , television s longestrunning crime series , none of its rejection of the cult of character and the crimes are n't ripped from the headlines without any social resonance they 're pulled from a police blotter raising the bar has far less interest in the law institutionally than it does in the extreme personalities that it imagines ravage and sustain it it refuses to delve into broken systems only into nutty jurists , opportunistic clerks , manipulative district attorneys every case is argued before the same judge , trudy kessler \( jane kaczmarek \) , who does n't get things started before she waters the zinnias on her bench first jerry calls her a petty , spiteful tyrant , and surely he s right but jerry himself , with his untucked shirts and ties knotted at his rib cage , is such a drag , such a dopey vessel for the show s na ve rants about the primacy of truth , that i was begging for someone to send him away and submit him to the torture of taking the bar exam in the 49 remaining states trudy locks him up for contempt of court let her also lock him up for failing to find a good barber
senator s vote last week against a bill to curtail the s use of harsh interrogation tactics disappointed human rights advocates who consider him an ally and led democrats to charge that he was trying to please republicans as he seeks to rally them around his presidential bid the bill , which the senate passed wednesday by 51 to 45 , would force the cia to abide by the rules set out in the army field manual on interrogation , which prohibits physical force and lists approved interrogation methods mr mccain , who was tortured as a prisoner of war in vietnam , has led the battle in recent years on a number of bills to end torture by the united states he said he voted against the bill wednesday because legislation he had helped to pass already prohibits the cia from cruel , inhumane or degrading treatment mr mccain , of arizona , said he believed it would be a mistake to limit cia interrogators to using only those techniques that were enumerated in the field manual , which he noted was a public document when we passed the military commissions act , we said that the cia should have the ability to use additional techniques , mr mccain told reporters friday in oshkosh , wis none of those techniques would entail violating the detainee treatment act , which said that cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment are prohibited the problem , human rights advocates say , is that disagreement remains over which tactics are prohibited mr mccain , for example , said a simulated drowning technique was an illegal form of torture but while the cia says it no longer uses waterboarding , the bush administration has not ruled out its use in the future it s disappointing , said jennifer daskal , a senior counsel at human rights watch , that senator mccain , who has long made it clear that congress had intended to outlaw abusive interrogation techniques including waterboarding , wo n't stand up to an administration that continues to say waterboarding is ok in certain circumstances although mr mccain has battled the bush administration over whether waterboarding is illegal , his vote on wednesday allied him with president bush , who has threatened to veto the bill democrats have used the vote to suggest that mr mccain was trying to curry favor with conservatives in the republican party , who have viewed him with suspicion and whose support he needs as he tries to unite the party behind his presidential campaign the democratic national committee said in a statement last week that mr mccain had chosen pandering over his principles mr mccain said the vote was consistent , noting in a statement he submitted to the congressional record that when congress voted in 2005 to apply the army field manual to the entire department of defense , it deliberately excluded the cia mr mccain , according to a senate aide of his , believes that while the cia should be and is prohibited from using cruel and inhumane and degrading tactics , it should have the flexibility to use acceptable tactics that are not listed in the field manual elisa massimino , the washington director of human rights first , said given the administration s refusal to clearly ban abusive techniques , it made sense for congress to be more explicit about what should and should not be allowed requiring the cia to follow the field manual , ms massimino added , would be a welcome step in that direction we 're very disappointed in his vote , she said of mr mccain because of his personal history and his leadership on this issue , it sends a terrible message to the rest of the world , to americans , to the troops mr mccain , in his statement to the congressional record , faulted the bush administration for declining to declare waterboarding illegal he said congress intended to outlaw the practice when it passed the military commissions act in 2006 and was even reassured by the administration that it had been staging a mock execution by inducing the misperception of drowning is a clear violation of this standard , mr mccain said in the statement indeed , during the negotiations , we were personally assured by administration officials that this language , which applies to all agencies of the us government , prohibited waterboarding it is unfortunate , he continued , that the reluctance of officials to stand by this straightforward conclusion has produced in the congress such frustration that we are today debating whether to apply a military field manual to nonmilitary intelligence activities it would be far better , i believe , for the administration to state forthrightly what is clear in current law that anyone who engages in waterboarding , on behalf of any us government agency , puts himself at risk of criminal prosecution and civil liability
the cause of mining law reform long the province of the environmental community has now gained an important ally in earl devaney mr devaney is the independentminded inspector general of the interior department , which oversees the antiquated 1872 mining law , approves new mining leases and has responsibility for nearly all the 160 , 000 or so abandoned mine sites that dot the western landscape after an extensive oneyear investigation , mr devaney concludes , in language that is always blunt and at times incendiary , that both the bureau of land management and the national park service have put the public s health and safety at risk by failing to clean up or seal off abandoned mine sites several deaths and injuries have already occurred one mine swallowed an entire vehicle , the report says and the potential for more deaths and injuries is ominous the threat to the larger environment from these mines including poisoned streams and groundwater supplies has long been established but mr devaney s is the first federal report to document their threat to life and limb as such , it could refocus congressional attention on a muchneeded reform of the mining law an issue that has made headway in the house but almost none in the senate among the many flaws of the 1872 mining law is that it has never forced mining companies to clean up their messes last fall , the house passed a reform bill that would strengthen environmental controls on new mines and raise money to clean up old mines by forcing companies that mine gold , silver , copper and other hardrock minerals to pay royalties just like oil companies do the house bill has some support in the senate , but it also has one powerful opponent harry reid , the majority leader who is a miner s son and whose home state of nevada does a brisk business in mining mr reid has been unenthusiastic about reform in general and royalties in particular mr devaney s report should be required reading for mr reid and any other senator who has doubts about the hazards these mines have become
hey kids , what season is it \? it s not nhl preseason , not yet if you re reading this blog , you ve gotta , gotta know it s khl season it s hurricane season it s political party convention season we ve just learned it s rrrrrestaurant season ! and it also must be nhl number retirement season a couple of weeks ago , the rangers announced they d honor andy bathgate s no 9 and harry howell s no 3 last week , someone leaked that the habs would honor patrick roy s 33 \( still unconfirmed \) the caps announced this week they d honor mike gartner s 11 and just today , the vancouver canucks have told the world they will honor trevor linden s no 16 on dec 17 retiring a player s sweater is one of the highest honours a club can pay to its most elite players and ambassadors , said chris zimmerman , president and ceo , canucks sports entertainment uh , why is that one of the highest \? is there a higher honour , or even an equally high honour \? if you can think of one , let us know we think there s no higher honour and it s even higher than an honor , because of that u are gabby s days numbered \? what s going to happen with the wild and marian gaborik \? he s entering the final year of his contract , which will pay him a very handsome 75 million , and says he loves minnesota , but he s not about to commit to signing an extension or even say much about it mike russo in the minneapolis startribune tried and tried and tried to get the 26yearold gabby to gab about his prognosis but gabby wasn t too gabby , other than riffing repeatedly on the theme , i m not saying i m leaving i m not saying i m staying i m saying i have one year left on my contract i m leaving it up to the wild and my agent to discuss it but i want to be left out of it and that s what he s saying gaborik s agent is in discussions with wild assistant gm tom lynn , and the team is supposedly offering the richest , longest contract in franchise history lynn tells russo the negotiations are complicated coming off a 42goal , 83point season , the team s best player could end up being the best available ufa next summer if they can t agree will gm doug risebrough let this thing drag through the season and distract the player , the team , the twin cities , the state of hockey , gary bettman , alexander medvedev , the entire nhl , the entire khl , the world hockey community and , ultimately , alaska governor \( or will it be vice president \) and hockey mom supreme sarah palin \? you never want to worry a mom or will he deal gaborik for a package of players and let him be someone else s problem \? russo kept asking marion about his sense of the talks and finally got this much from him i m willing to stay , but it depends on what kind of deal they re going to propose , gaborik said i had a good discussion with doug and tom last month in slovakia they explained how they want to go forward of course , i want to win if it s here , i would love that , but who knows what s going to happen \? russo writes , the wild is trying desperately to sign the right wing to a contract extension before the oct 11 opener , and this raises the most important question of all shouldn t that be the wild are trying desperately to sign the right wing to a contract extension before the oct 11 opener \? nhl boycott buried in yesterday s story in the tennessean by john glennon on the suspension of alexander radulov for the season were these sentences nhl deputy commissioner bill daly said tuesday the league has chosen not to participate in an international ice hockey federationsponsored meeting saturday in zurich that will include members from top european hockey associations the nhl is not interested in meeting with russian hockey representatives until the radulov situation is resolved , daly said the meeting will go forward , however , and the iihf will release a statement following the meeting on the status of radulov and the five others whose transfers between the nhl and khl have been disputed so the nhl will learn of the rulings via the statement , along with the rest of the world it is possible after the findings are presented , the khl might also request investigations on the three newest russian youngsters to sign nhl contracts , two by the kings \( viatcheslav voynov and andrei loktionov \) and one by the blue jackets \( maksim mayorov \) khl president alexander mevedev spoke to sportexpress and said despite the preds suspension of radulov , his league would not follow suit and suspend the five players the khl claims jumped valid contracts for he nhl i don t see any reason to copy the nhl , he said what do we have to gain by prohibiting these youngsters from playing in the russian championship \? meanwhile , as the nhl and khl continue to act like a pair of 3yearolds grabbing each other s toys , there remains no transfer agreement governing movement between them and , for that matter , no transfer agreement between the nhl and the iihf on behalf of the other european hockey associations this meeting in zurich was originally supposed to take place in new york and have a different agenda it was planned as a session designed to hammer away at new transfer agreements among the nhl , iihf and khl that meeting was canceled due to the nhl s refusal to meet with the khl over the radulov matter that has to be of some concern for the euro countries , who are not receiving the compensation from the nhl they did when transfer agreements were in effect on their web site last saturday , the iihf listed 63 europeanbased players who up until then had signed with nhl clubs for the 200809 season \( 64 nhlers went the opposite way \) , and none of the european hockey governing bodies received a penny could the nhl secretly want things this way , trying to prove they are the man among boys \? guess who showed up in kazan to watch jaromir jagr s avangard omsk team practice yesterday \? why , none other than former nhlpa head bob goodenow and rangers assistant coach mike pelino you are puzzled , no \? well , goodenow has been a consultant to the khl , and , as sovietsky sport has reported previously , jj s avangard club has began to make friends with the rangers pelino s trip is the first step in that cooperation hmmm p lysenko of sovietsky sport spoke with both , first goodenow who , he writes \( you ll love this \) , stood at the boards and watched the rolling avangard from under the rectangular lenses of his glasses , the way a teacher s gaze usually permeates schoolchildren when searching for those who have learned their lessons badly what are you doing in kazan \? since last fall i ve worked as a consultant to the khl i was asked by igor larionov and slava fetisov if any questions arise about the organization , i will help them i give them ideas about how the league should be structured and the like my goal is to improve soviet excuse me , russian hockey do you want the khl organized like the nhl \? not necessarily the khl should have their own way of development why should someone copy someone else \? what are the ideas have you already come up with \? or is that a secret \? i do not want to give any recommendations during the season i will travel a lot in russia , and examine the sport and then i will give advice to the khl s managers , because they make the decisions as a lawyer , what do you think about the radulov situation \? lysenko writes here , goodenow diplomatically did not say anything new , but merely repeated the words of khl president alexander medvedev , and outlined the political situation that our league still has no transfer agreement with the nhl speaking simpler , bob , who is right radulov or nashville \? and do they must someone be blamed \? everyone thinks that they are within their rights \? the result requires diplomacy and the iihf the rangers interest in avangard has little to do with jagr and everything to do with his omsk teammate , rangers prospect alexei cherepanov pelino has visited russia before , in 2000 , and finds it more beautiful today he also thinks the khl is on the right track and that the smallersized arenas might benefit them , saying the larger ones might actually hinder their ability at this point to do business how does the khl differ from the nhl \? the first thing that grabs my attention is the size of the rinks there is no place for bangbang action hockey here is more calculated , there s more teamwork the players spend more time in the attacking zone and they prefer puck possession which can be better they don t get their bodies beaten every minute is that good or bad \? probably , well it s just a different style of hockey it has its own charm has jagr asked you about the rangers \? he just asked about the guys now he s thinking only about omsk what do you think about the relationship between the khl and the nhl \? i am sure we should respect each other s contracts i do not know about other nhl clubs , but the rangers will not violate the rules cherepanov has a contract here with avangard we have to honor it , not violate it we let him play in omsk and gain experience and if alex says that he s better off in russia right now , we will not disturb him pelino also discussed russia s newest hockey celebrity , chris simon , although he speaks slowly , chooses his words carefully , according to lysenko , and says , he s a good person his teammates love him that s how it was when he played for us before the lockout but on the ice , sometimes it s as if he goes mad and he starts looking for someone to fight they re learning that in the khl , too  ok , sarah palin being a hockey mom has absolutely nothing to do with politics , the election , the gop , its values , none of them we just made it up  that s why , as puck daddy s greg wyshynski points out today , hockey was mentioned more in last night s republican vice presidential acceptance speech by gov sarah palin than the words afghanistan or terrorists or health care she repurposed the hockeymomsaspitbullswithlipstick line that played so well in the weekly standard signs like hockey moms 4 palin dotted the xcel center in st paul , home of the minnesota wild and the michigan delegation took the hockey movement to its logical extreme , making quite the fashion statement from the ap , on the rnc hockey jerseys that s what the michigan delegation donned wednesday night as a show of support for hockey mom sarah palin as the alaska governor and vice presidential candidate addressed the convention the delegates were easy to spot they were close to the podium wearing redandwhite detroit red wings jerseys and chanting , let s go , palin that s a variation on the let s go , red wings chant heard during hockey season at detroit s joe louis arena that s not entirely accurate they weren t red wings jerseys , but personalized republican convention jerseys given to each delegate by michigan attorney general mike cox and we recommend greg s entire post \( we recommend the whole blog \) for a good perspective on how integral hockey is becoming to the campaign , including this response from the dems  greg has been on a sarah palin exploration daily and , as he s written regularly , hockey is now an irremovable facet of our national political discussion , as critical to palin s biography as john mccain s military past and barack obama s multicultural ancestry are to theirs yesterday wyshynski located a blog post from the baltimore sun by dan rodricks , who defined the difference between a soccer mom and a hockey mom and set out to define three types of hockey moms and wonder which type ms palin might be items this this leave little doubt she has become the shooting star of the gop and , to a huge extent , hockey is the hook we ve made our views known you can decide for yourself if you think what she stands for is reflective of hockey moms , the culture of youth hockey and the larger setting of suburban america , and if that is good for the nation as a whole we d only add this after watching the conduct of some hockey moms over the years , we d take her comment from last night that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick and wonder if it s an insult to pit bulls selanne s got a secret time for our daily dose of mats sundin , who has been easing us into this sort of announcement well , surprise , surprise , mats told a news conference in sweden yesterday that he won t know if he s coming back until after the season starts if this sounds reminiscent of the scott niedermayerteemu selanne partial season plan , that s because , well , it is but teemu apparently wants to be in for the full package this year blogging in the oc register , dan wood writes that this time last year , selanne had no idea if he would be returning to the nhl \( and , of course , he eventually did \) this year , teemu has more than an idea i have made a decision , selanne said wednesday after participating in an informal skate with a small group of players at anaheim ice i m not going to say what my decision is , but i have made a decision and i m skating every day oh , the suspense is killing us what could that decision possibly be \? please tell , teemu , baby please selanne s problem is that the ducks are about 2 million over the cap and someone must go to make room for teemu there s no rush , selanne said the only thing i can say is that i haven t been skating every day for the last four weeks just for fun there is a reason he s so coy woods writes , at least two of the clubs pining for sundin are believed to also have interest in trading for veteran ducks defenseman mathieu schneider perhaps now , given sundin s stance , one will pull the trigger on a deal for schneider , thus giving the ducks 5625 million in salarycap relief and paving the way for selanne to sign with the ducks skating around tsn has announced it is adding john tortorella and ray ferraro to their already huge cast of hockey analysts that means there are now more tsn hockey analysts than members of parliament our goal is to have one analyst for every nhl player , tsn s vicepresident , production mark milliere did not say in the press release announcing these new hirings the bruins have signed 34yearold forward stephan yelle , twice a cupwinner in colorado who played the last for seasons with the flames it s confirmed pat quinn will coach the canadian team at the wjc this december the canadiens are considering playing an outdoor game at the big o , olympic stadium , former home of the expos this isn t meant to be winter classic iii but played on dec 4 , 2009 , marking 100 years to the day of the team s birth you thought this was the habs centennial season , right \? well , it is , it s their 100th season , just like from the day you are born until your first birthday is your first year and after that , you start your second year but you re 1 year old they ve done that 100 times anyway , it s still in the planning stages and dave stubbs in the gazette has the news asked his reaction to plans that would see his partnership with henrik zetterberg ended and each center a line , pavel datsyuk told dave dye blogging in the detroit news i start crying i can t sleep two days but now everything is fine in july , nhl defenseman steve mccarthy said he would sign with the khl s salavat yulaev ufa but he didn t show up when camp began then came word a couple of weeks ago he would instead sign with ska st petersburg but he didn t show there either as he apparently couldn t get the necessary travel papers but now word comes today that mccarthy is back on the ice ready to play for \( drum roll , please \) salavat yulaev ufa yes , sportexpress says he s there , motoring alongside alexander radulov , wearing no 20 all s right with the world and finally , red wings coach mike babcock dave dye in the detroit news that he s just returned from more than a week hunting lions , leopards , elephant and buffalo in tanzania in east africa africa is like the nhl of hunting , babs says it was his third trip there and he s got some setup the food s fantastic the service is great and you get a great opportunity to hunt quality animals it s like being at the ritzcarlton you re in a tent in the middle of nowhere , but there s a cement floor and a standup shower and a sink you re sleeping in a queen bed , your laundry is folded on your bed each and every day and the meals are prepared by a fivestar chef over a fire yep , tapping into some primal instincts with a fivestar chef , that s the way to rough it and what do you suppose constitutes a quality animal \?

before his united states team played japan on saturday morning for the bronze medal , manager davey johnson planned to make a quick speech just to remind his players that a consolation prize in what might be the final olympic baseball competition was better than no prize at all it s a pretty good group , johnson said after the united states lost , 102 , to cuba on friday night they 're not a group i need to motivate a whole lot at least that was his hope his players looked deflated after the loss , having expected to ride the momentum of four consecutive victories into a semifinal matchup against cuba the united states could not match cuba s power or pitching , giving up four home runs including a two threerun blasts in cuba s sixrun eighth and 14 hits while mustering only 6 of its own if you would have told me before the game that we would have scored that many runs against that good pitching , i would have thought you were crazy , cuba manager antonio pacheco said through an interpreter cuba will face undefeated south korea for the gold medal saturday night the united states had defeated cuba four consecutive times before a tough 11inning loss last friday that left johnson and pacheco criticizing each other for what each considered unsportsmanlike behavior the second baseman brian barden said he was pleasantly surprised at how cuba respected the game friday , although that sentiment was hardly shared by his teammates or johnson , his manager after alexei bell hit a deep threerun homer in the eighth that pushed cuba s lead to 72 , he stood at home plate admiring the ball , looking up to the sky and flinging his bat to the side the american catcher lou marson jawed at him as he started his homerun trot and again when bell crossed the plate i have a bad taste in my mouth , marson said i'm sure everybody else does , too us success from team medals with the olympic games on the cusp of completion , success here could be measured by the number of overall medals , the number of gold medals or , according to what the united states olympic committee chief executive jim scherr said friday , by a new method all together we really measure our success on how well our team sports performed , he said more individual athletes will finish with a gold medal around their neck than any other country , if you want to look at it that way through 2 am saturday here , the united states had won 102 medals over all , matching its effort at the 2004 athens games it had 31 golds , five fewer than it had in athens the us team s best effort was at the 1992 barcelona games , when it won 108 medals , 37 gold in beijing , china still leads with in gold medals , with 47 it has 89 medals over all but using scherr s calculation , the united states is ahead 81 american athletes now have medals around their necks , compared with 69 chinese athletes so far , the united states has won team medals in several sports , including women s soccer , softball and women s water polo the us team is also guaranteed several more medals all in team sports men s and women s volleyball , men s and women s basketball and men s water polo have reached the medal rounds that will put the united states at 106 medals over all , on the edge of beating the record peter ueberroth , chairman of the usoc , said the committee was focusing on the success of team sports because those sports were the ones most likely to inspire children to exercise we 're fascinated , and what country is n't , with gold medals , he said but what s important is that our team sports do very well that s what gets our kids from their chairs , from their computers and out of obesity problems still , with two days left , the medals tally will change though not that drastically already , steve roush the usoc s medals tally guru is crunching numbers his job is to figure out how to allocate funds so the us team is even more successful in the 2012 london games he said the sports the usoc would probably focus on included canoe kayak and rowing he added that the usoc was looking to diversify the sports where its medals come from but , in the end , roush said he was happy that so many of the american athletes finished in the top eight in their event , meaning that a little more work and maybe more money could boost them into that precious top three having a lot of teams in the top eight is quite an accomplishment , he said maybe the rest of the world sees gold medals as the only way to win , but we 're looking at things for down the road juliet macur american wins boxing bronze deontay wilder , 22 , leads the united states boxing team in superlatives he is the least experienced , the most charismatic and , despite a 71 loss to clemente russo of italy in a heavyweight semifinal friday , by far the most successful he will settle for bronze , the only american medal earned in boxing , a sport it once dominated the american team came here boasting of its strength , of the possibility of sending four , maybe five boxers to the medal round but eight of nine fighters failed to reach the semifinals , punctuating the united states' worst olympic showing since 1948 , when it came away with only a silver medal ben shpigel dutch women win field hockey after a 24year wait , the dutch women regained the olympic field hockey title , beating china , 20 since 1984 , the dutch had won four olympic medals , none of them gold china s previous best finish had been fourth in 2004 , so while the chinese had already achieved history by reaching the final , the dutch still needed a victory to get what they came for the chinese had upset germany , the reigning olympic champion , with a late goal in the semifinals it s my third olympics , minke booij , the captain of the dutch team , said i won bronze in sydney , silver in athens and now gold it s a perfect way to go peter berlin us men reach volleyball final the united states men s volleyball team remained undefeated

las vegas the standings change and so does the economy , inside and outside the sports world but the character of baseball s signature franchise never does the , who missed the playoffs this season , still expect to win the world series and are still spending big to try the yankees jolted major league baseball on wednesday as they neared completion of a record sevenyear , 161 million deal with the ace lefthander they have also told a j burnett that they would offer him a guaranteed fiveyear contract , perhaps for 16 million a season as some teams scale back , fearing a sharp drop in revenue from sponsorships and ticket sales , the yankees are the most aggressive shoppers at baseball s winter meetings that s them , that s the yankees , that s how we look at it , said dan o 'dowd , the general manager of the colorado rockies they operate in a world by themselves , and we understand that it does n't really affect the market because it s them sabathia will front a 2009 rotation that also includes chienming wang and joba chamberlain but the yankees are also eager to sign two more starting pitchers from a group comprising burnett , derek lowe , andy pettitte and ben sheets they could move quickly on sheets , if his medical records come back clean and if burnett and sheets join sabathia as yankees , the team would pull its oneyear , 10 million offer to pettitte several factors allow the yankees to keep spending amid the crumbling economy they are moving to a new yankee stadium in april , operate their own cable network \( yes \) and have shed more than 80 million with the expired contracts of jason giambi , bobby abreu , mike mussina and others the yankees' payroll exceeded 209 million last season , and while it will probably be lower this year , it will still be the highest in the majors by a substantial amount we 're having a lot of money come off our payroll , and we 're going to be aggressive on players we think could be terrific yankees and be key components for us for 2009 and beyond , general manager said it s as simple as that the yankees must complete the details of sabathia s deal , like how much he will make each season , and sabathia who is 6 feet 7 inches and 311 pounds must pass a physical the deal , which includes an optout clause after three seasons , would push sabathia past johan santana for the largest guaranteed contract ever given to a pitcher the mets gave santana a sixyear , 1375 million deal in february , after the yankees passed on a chance to acquire him from the minnesota twins they did not want to give up a package of prospects in addition to arranging a lavish contract , and resisted a sabathia trade this summer for the same reason milwaukee acquired sabathia from the cleveland indians instead , and he went 112 with a 165 earned run average down the stretch that performance persuaded the yankees that sabathia must be the centerpiece of their offseason plans with sabathia costing only dollars now and a compensatory draft choice the yankees pounced they offered six years and 140 million on nov 14 , the first day they were allowed to negotiate , trying to overwhelm sabathia , a california native who wanted to pitch in his home state though he also met with the boston red sox , sabathia had only one other offer , from the brewers for five years and 100 million , and none of the five teams in california made a serious pitch cashman met with sabathia here on sunday and monday , telling sabathia s agents that he would welcome the chance to visit sabathia s home in vallejo , calif the agent greg genske called tuesday and invited cashman , who flew to oakland with a second sabathia agent , brian peters when the opportunity was given , cashman said , i knew that s a flight i had to take cashman met sabathia and his wife , amber , at their home , telling him he recognized the house from an episode of mtv cribs they spoke for two hours in sabathia s living room with sabathia s children toddling in and out before cashman raised the offer 20 million more in a conversation with peters the brewers , meanwhile , had been considering adding a sixth year to their offer in an effort to keep the player who led them to their first playoff appearance in 26 seasons but at 7 30 am on wednesday , genske called brewers general manager doug melvin and told him sabathia would not return to milwaukee i guess the yankees had to pay a surcharge for sabathia playing in new york , melvin told two reporters , jokingly i was down at the tables last night trying to win enough money to get us back in the game i congratulate brian he got himself a great pitcher the yankees tried hard to convince sabathia that he can thrive in new york at the sunday meeting , cashman and manager joe girardi took along the hall of famer reggie jackson , who conquered new york in the 1970s after starring in oakland shortstop derek jeter , the team captain , called sabathia last month jeter , who was here for a news conference about the world baseball classic , hinted that sabathia had asked about places to live outside manhattan there s a lot of different places you can live , jeter said you do n't have to live in the city left fielder johnny damon had dinner with sabathia early this season in cleveland , and damon said their wives have kept in touch sabathia was 68 for the indians last season before his trade to milwaukee on july 7 , and damon sensed he was pressing i think the first half of the season , he was thinking , oh , i'm a free agent , but i love it in cleveland , ' damon said in a telephone interview and then when he got traded , he was a man on a mission he started to understand the business side of the game , and this is where it got him the yankees badly needed an ace last season , especially after their best starter , wang , injured his foot in june and did not pitch again as their own playoff hopes faded , the players noticed sabathia s work in the brewers' frantic pennant race sabathia made his final three starts on short rest , allowing two runs in 21 2 3 innings he worked a complete game on the final day to clinch a wildcard berth just watching milwaukee toward the end of the year they were in the playoffs , they were out of the playoffs and he was like , hey , i 've only been here half the year , but i'm ready to be a leader , give me the ball on three days' rest , ' yankees reliever brian bruney said in a telephone interview you could tell he was selfless , you could tell he cares about winning i'm looking forward to coming in after him if he needs it but i reckon that s not going to happen a lot any time you have a horse like c c going seven , eight or nine innings , that s a day for the bullpen to regroup yankees relievers logged 543 1 3 innings last season , the second highest workload of any american league bullpen , yet managed a solid 378 era sabathia led the majors in innings pitched in each of the last two seasons while going 3617 since his debut at age 20 in 2001 , only one pitcher in the majors mark buehrle of the chicago white sox has won more games and pitched more innings he s a workhorse , damon said he s a guy who can dominate for long periods of time that s the first step adding c c makes us a serious contender again , and we 'll see what other things we can do

concertgoers like you and me have become part police officer , part public offender we prosecute the shuffled foot or rattled program , the errant whisper or misplaced cough we tense at the end of a movement , fearful that one of the unwashed will begin to clap , bringing shame on us all how serious we look , and how absurd we are silence is not what we artists want , kenneth hamilton quotes in after the golden age , a detailed reflection on concert behavior in the 19th and early 20th centuries published recently by oxford university press we want applause , wearing his music critic s hat , wrote that the silence at a london performance of liszt s dante symphony represented not rapt attention but audience distaste liszt , anton rubinstein and virtuosos like them would have been offended had listeners not clapped between movements , although in beethoven s case the point is moot , given that hardly anybody played more than one movement of a beethoven sonata at a time i owe this information , along with most of the anecdotes that follow , to mr hamilton s delightful book , which you should read people , he writes , also clapped while the music was going on when chopin played his variations on l ci darem la mano with orchestra , the audience bestowed its showstopping approval after every variation as late as 1920 , a berlin audience was applauding ferruccio busoni in the middle of la campanella liszt , the composer of that piece , was observed in dignified old age , yelling bravos from the audience as anton rubinstein played s a minor rondo hans von b low boasted to his students that his performance in the firstmovement cadenza of beethoven s emperor concerto regularly brought down the house , no matter that the movement was n't over in condemning modern recitals as canned , without spontaneity , literal and deadened by solemnity , mr hamilton sometimes overstates the case in the best of circumstances silence during a good performance becomes something palpable , not just an absence of noise involved audiences can shout approval without making a sound in describing the hypocrisies of golden age pursuers and other nostalgia freaks , on the other hand , he has a point if music is to go back to original instruments and original performance practices , it has to acknowledge original audiences too elias canetti s 1960 book crowds and power offers the best metaphor for modern concerts the roman catholic mass worshipers accept instructions from an executive operating from a raised platform at the front they speak when spoken to and otherwise shut up mr hamilton attributes a lot of this recently acquired holiness to the recording age , but i think it has more to do with germanic art s taking itself deadly seriously every mozart sonata is like wagner s parsifal , and listeners should get down on their knees audience participation was taken for granted in the 1840s the pianist alexander dreyschock was criticized for playing so loud that it made it difficult for the ladies to talk , mr hamilton writes today s listeners , still eager to make themselves known , have been reduced to subversive acts in a fascistic society when they are not interested , they cough operagoers long to be the first to be heard as the curtain falls anticipating the final cadences in donizetti does n't make much difference in parsifal it is a disaster , and a frequent one concerts were different back then liszt could get away with the radical idea of one man , one recital , but musical events were usually variety shows in the manner of vaudeville the star pianist or violinist was just an occasionally recurring act in a parade of singers , orchestra players , quartets and trios when liszt did his solo acts , there was none of the marchon , marchoff stage ritual of today liszt greeted patrons at the door , mingled in the audience and schmoozed with friend and stranger alike whole recitals also took place between acts of an opera or movements of a symphony when chopin played his e minor piano concerto in warsaw in 1830 , other pieces were inserted between the first two movements perhaps the most celebrated such interruption was at the 1806 premiere of beethoven s violin concerto in vienna , where the soloist thrilled listeners by playing his violin upside down and on one string memorization was evidently as much prized in the 1800s as it is now , though people like chopin and beethoven thought that playing with scores increased accountability virtuosos like anton rubinstein learned by heart but frequently forgot what they had memorized i once heard arthur rubinstein become lost in ravel s valses nobles et sentimentales , simply diddling idly on the piano for a while before remembering what came next no one seemed to mind mistakes if liszt landed on a wrong note , he would treat it as a modulation , inventing a new passage on the spot the idea of werktreue , or honoring what the score says , was a weaker argument in the 19th century b low told pupils that the occasionally planted clinker showed audiences how hard the piece at hand was my favorite music criticism is from a german on brahms s playing his own b flat piano concerto brahms did not play the right notes , he wrote , but he played like a man who knew what the right notes were there are still flickers of audience involvement in concerts , but so brainwashed are we by prevailing decorum that they make us nervous once in havana i became troubled by two men in front of me talking excitedly during a performance of a liszt piano concerto until i realized they were arguing the interpretation blow by blow another time , late on a spanish evening many years ago , i heard a village band competition at the bullring in valencia the playing was astonishing , and as a particular performance gradually took hold of the audience , low hums of approval would grow into something approaching wordless roars it was the most profound concert experience of my life

murakami s higher art efforts do n't always muster raised by parents who drummed western art into him , mr murakami studied traditional nihonga painting , and attempted a career in animation , before deciding to become a contemporary artist since emerging in the 1990s mr murakami has often been seen as outwarholing warhol by giving back to popular culture , as well as borrowing from it and by excelling at branding not for nothing is this show titled murakami but the more interesting comparison may be with handson artistdesigners like louis comfort tiffany or william morris after all , mr murakami oversees a company , kaikai kiki \( kaikaikiki means something both elegant and bizarre \) , that produces his art and its spinoffs by now it employs around 100 artists , animators , writers and artisans and has an office in tokyo , two studios in tokyo suburbs and one in long island city , queens and of course he belongs to a long tradition of japanese artists who lavished equal artistry on painted screens , ceramics , calligraphy or lacquerware boxes which were in some ways the vuitton bags of their time mr murakami siphons motifs from disney and dal , strategies from pop art , and sexual fantasies from japan s anime \( animation \) and manga \( comics \) subcultures his cast of variously cute , erotic or grotesque creatures and intense decorative pilingson range across paintings , sculptures , animations and wallpaper , building at times to a hallucinatory intensity that has more than a touch of darkness one example is the riot of manically cheerful flowers created by the combination of wallpaper , paintings and one sculpture in a large gallery the blooms look like petalringed smiley faces , only better and crazier the ensemble fulfills almost too completely mr murakami s stated desire to make art that makes your mind go blank , that leaves you gaping at the opposite pole of such relentless innocence are two lifesize but hardly lifelike sculptures of animemanga derivation hiropon , a busty woman , and my lonesome cowboy , her wellendowed male consort both are mostly naked , with streams of bodily fluids spewing from various body parts like mr murakami s paintings of mushroomcloud skulls , these renditions of eve and adam have been interpreted as comments on a collective japanese psyche traumatized and infantilized by world war ii , the dropping of the atom bombs and the lengthy american occupation whatever they are sensationally sexy and sexist at the same time most of mr murakami s creatures recur in an array of toys , tshirts , pins and decals fabricated at kaikai kiki many of these are on display \( but not for sale \) one floor below the vuitton boutique the connecting staircase , covered with skullsandcamouflage wall paper overlaid with big mushroomcloud skulls , provides a vanitas moment to reflect on mortality but there s still time for worldly possessions nearly all the kaikai kiki items are on sale in the gift shop this show begins with work dating from 1991 , but it does n't gain traction until the late 1990s it defines mr murakami , now 46 , as a lateblooming talent with a steep learning curve interestingly , most of his best works were made after 2001 , the year he started working with vuitton the exhibition s spine is formed by the demonic mutations of the artist s signatory and most ubiquitous character , mr dob , the mickey mouse derivative that is something of a selfportrait \( the name is a condensed version of the japanese for why \? the eternal existential question \) splitting , multiplying , flashing jagged teeth and shapeshifting almost beyond recognition , mr dob appears here as an enormous inflatable , a sculpture menaced by colorful mushrooms , on flagstonelike floor covering and in way too many slick , brittle paintings luckily other experiences like the flower room and the vuitton boutique balance things out one is the enchanting 23foottall tongarikun \( or mr pointy \) , a spacealien , 18armed buddha on a lotus throne surrounded by four guardians that dominates the museum s lobby its sinuous designs and rich colors evoke a fusion of surrealism , art nouveau and japanese kimonos the label counters by pointing out that the palette and symbols are inspired by maya art and tibetan buddhist imagery even more spellbinding is a new animation dreamed up by mr murakami and his kaikai kiki cohort \( the credits take several minutes \) planting the seeds , an instant classic , stars kaikai and kiki , two spirit guides in footy pajamas who are probably descended from mr dob they travel the world in a living spacecraft that gives new meaning to the term mother ship extraordinarily beautiful , with a deeply japanese respect for nature , the tale suggests that there is no such thing as waste through a hilarious emphasis on manure or as the threeeyed kiki squeaks at the top of his her tiny lungs , poop \? \? ! ! and , finally , in the last two galleries of the exhibition , mr murakami s painting explodes with a new complexity of color and meaning , matching the intensity of the flower room , but without the mindblanking repetition the combination of scale , rich detail and brilliant color and compositional and narrative drama is riveting in tan tan bo \( 2001 \) mr dob is reincarnated in a kaleidoscope of color whose mixture of geometric and biomorphic forms is a kind of comic summation of modernist abstraction tan tan bo puking \( 2002 \) is a daliesque apocalypse mr dob in his death throes with globs of brilliant color spilling from his jagged teeth , and strange protrusions , at once foul and gorgeous , erupting all over his enormous head one culminates in a golden hand that meets another hand in a flash of light and in the lower right , the kiki stands among four shinto staffs dangling with sacred paper that signal the soul crossing to the afterlife in the show s final four paintings , all from the last two years , different japanese art forms , materials and styles create a great contrapuntal energy in 727727 , mr dob s snarling head bounces on an elegant unfurling wave , against layers of sanded colors that encompass the entire spectrum , and evoke ancient screens and warhol s oxidation paintings as well as atomic radiation two large portraits of daruma , the revered sixthcentury indian monk who introduced zen buddhism to china , mimic the calligraphic flair of ink painting \( writ very large \) but on surfaces of gold , silver and titanium leaf customary for screen painting the fourth painting introduces a new character , chibi kinoko , or little mushroom , a wan creature with some of the strangeness of the mushroomcloud skull and seen against a shiny hard surface of pale green squares that suggest both digitalization and lacquer one leaves this show feeling that mr murakami has found a new benign pandora s box the richness of traditional japanese art
washington when , the united states attorney in chicago , announced the arrest of the governor , , mr fitzgerald said he had acted to halt a political crime spree that included what he called an appalling effort to sell off the senate seat vacated by presidentelect barack obama but now some lawyers are beginning to suggest that the juiciest part of the case against mr blagojevich , the part involving the senate seat , may be less than airtight there is no evidence , at least none that has been disclosed , that the governor actually received anything of value and the senate appointment has yet to be made ever since the country s founding , prosecutors , defense lawyers and juries have been trying to define the difference between criminality and political dealmaking they have never established a clearcut line between the offensive and the illegal , and the hours of wiretapped conversations involving mr blagojevich , filled with crass , profane talk about benefiting from the senate vacancy , may fall into a legal gray area robert s bennett , one of washington s bestknown whitecollar criminal defense lawyers , said mr blagojevich faced nearly insurmountable legal problems in a case that includes a raft of corruption accusations unrelated to mr obama s senate seat but mr bennett said the case raised some potentially thorny issues about political corruption this town is full of people who call themselves ambassadors , and all they did was pay 200 , 000 or 300 , 000 to the republican or democratic party , said mr bennett , referring to a passage in the criminal complaint filed against the governor suggesting that mr blagojevich was interested in an ambassadorial appointment in return for the senate seat you have to wonder , how much of this guy s problem was his language , rather than what he really did \? in presenting his case , mr fitzgerald said mr blagojevich had crossed the line from dealmaking to criminality , citing an example in the complaint in which the governor discussed with an aide obtaining a 300 , 000ayear job from the service employees international union in return for naming a candidate to the seat we 're not trying to criminalize people making political horse trades on policies or that sort of thing , mr fitzgerald said but it is criminal when people are doing it for their personal enrichment and they 're doing it in a way that is , in this case , clearly criminal but politicians routinely receive political contributions in return for their decisions , whether they involve making appointments or taking a stand on legislation lawmakers vote in favor of bills and steer appropriations backed by their donors without fear that prosecutors will bug their offices and homes and while prosecutors have brought increasing numbers of political corruption cases in recent years , they have done so using laws that make it a crime for an official to deprive the public of honest services the cases are based on statutes that never define exactly what conduct might be illegal and do not require proof of a bribe or a quid pro quo to establish criminal wrongdoing what those statutes do require is evidence that an official at least tried to seek something of value in return for an official action in the case of mr blagojevich , it would be legal for the governor to accept a campaign contribution from someone he appointed to the senate seat what would create legal problems for him is if he was taperecorded specifically offering a seat in exchange for the contribution what would make the case even easier to prosecute is if he was recorded offering the seat in exchange for a personal favor , like cash , a job or a job for a family member indeed the government has claimed the wiretaps show that mr blagojevich told his aides that he wanted to offer the seat in exchange for contributions and for personal favors , including jobs for himself and his wife but talk is not enough any case will ultimately turn on the strength of the tapes , and whether the governor made it clear to any of the candidates for the senate seat that he would give it only in exchange for something of value several lawyers cautioned that the complaint presented last week was a snapshot of the evidence that mr fitzgerald had amassed so far , in an investigation that is continuing in moving to arrest mr blagojevich on dec 9 , mr fitzgerald acted without having presented his case before a grand jury he is now likely to use such a panel to obtain additional witness testimony exploring whether anyone , including anyone in the obama camp , had specific discussions with the governor s office about filling the vacancy mr fitzgerald s decision to bypass a grand jury initially could signal a belief on his part that he did not yet have a fully prosecutable case on his hand , though it appears to have been prompted at least in part by the publication in the chicago tribune on dec 5 of an article that tipped off mr blagojevich that investigators were listening in on his conversations mr fitzgerald has also said he had been worried that if he did not intervene , mr blagojevich might go ahead with some of his schemes , including appointing a successor to mr obama in the wiretaps cited in the complaint , mr blagojevich talked about what he said was an urgent need for political contributions and favors , but it was not clear whether he took concerted action to actually obtain anything in return for the seat several lawyers said mr fitzgerald might need more evidence to prosecute mr blagojevich over the issue it s a very difficult case for a number of reasons not the least is the nebulous nature of the charges and the inherently difficult issues when you 're talking about a person executing his first amendment right to promote a particular politician , said michael d monico , a former federal prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer in chicago merely thinking about something is not a crime , said mr monico , a lawyer for christopher kelly , a former blagojevich fundraiser who was indicted last year on tax charges just talking about something is not a crime you need another action for someone to commit a crime
as midnight struck on the final day of june , dozens of players spilled into the market , and the nets and the knicks began pondering a freeagent bonanza they only have to wait 24 more months to start spending about 150 players became free agents at 12 01 am tuesday , the official start of the s summer business season teams and players are now free to negotiate , although trades and signings cannot be completed until july 9 the nets and the knicks will be active , but with severe , selfimposed restraints both teams are trying to conserve salarycap room for 2010 and the greatest freeagent class in recent memory lebron james , dwyane wade , chris bosh and amare stoudemire could all be available so while the knicks need immediate help in nearly every area , the team president , donnie walsh , said he had no plans to empty the madison square garden checkbook this month i'm going to be frugal , walsh said friday walsh has been explicit about chasing a franchise player in 2010 rod thorn , the nets' president , has been more coy but the nets signaled their intentions when they traded richard jefferson to milwaukee last week , a move that significantly reduced their future payroll we 're trying to have a good team , but we 're also trying to be prudent with where we are , thorn said walsh has the more daunting task he has to unload at least one major contract , preferably zach randolph s , to have any shot at creating significant room under the salary cap he has been shopping randolph , eddy curry and jamal crawford , the three players with the biggest cap figures in 2010 but walsh also wants the knicks to become competitive soon to that end , he is expected to pursue a lowcost point guard in free agency one option could be the chicago bulls' chris duhon , who was linked to the knicks in a sporting news report monday his agent , kevin bradbury , confirmed that duhon a solid defender and 3point shooter was interested in the knicks and said he hoped to hear from walsh bradbury also said that coach mike d'antoni had expressed an interest in duhon before , when d'antoni was coaching the suns but there will be competition for duhon s services , and walsh may be hesitant to offer more than a twoyear deal that will be the challenge all summer the nets will not have to be quite so conservative but thorn will surely have 2010 in mind when he decides how much to spend on forward nenad krstic , who is a restricted free agent the nets can match any offer to krstic , and may let him test the market to determine his value this is shaping up as a humdrum signing season a handful of marquee players are on the market , but most , if not all , are expected to stay with their teams the best of the bunch are gilbert arenas of the washington wizards , andre iguodala of the philadelphia 76ers , josh smith of the atlanta hawks , elton brand and corey maggette of the clippers , emeka okafor of the charlotte bobcats , luol deng of the chicago bulls , baron davis of the golden state warriors and jos calder n of the toronto raptors davis , brand and maggette opted out of their contracts on monday those are all key players for their teams they could command starting salaries between 8 million and 15 million none will have much leverage , however only two teams , the 76ers and the memphis grizzlies , are guaranteed to have substantial salarycap room the clippers could join the mix if they lose maggette or brand so , barring major snags in negotiations , arenas will probably remain a wizard , iguodala a 76er and deng a bull with free agency , you never really know , the wizards' president , ernie grunfeld , said all you need is one team to go after a player but probably , this year you do n't have as many teams with significant salarycap room as in years past the wizards were taking no chances with their allstar core they signed antawn jamison to a contract extension \( reportedly for four years and 50 million \) on monday , hours before he would have become a free agent the wizards were preparing to offer arenas more than 100 million over six years , according to the washington post the 76ers are expected to resign iguodala , their best player , and will have about 115 million in cap room to buy him a new teammate they are reportedly pursuing smith , the hawks' highflying forward , and could also have interest in brand this could have been a memorable summer for nba free agency but a handful of toptier stars , recognizing the tight market , chose not to exercise optout clauses that group included miami s shawn marion and sacramento s ron artest the rules governing free agency will also stifle the market iguodala , smith , deng , okafor , calder n and the young center andris biedrins of golden state are restricted free agents , meaning their teams can match any offer , without respect to the salary cap that group also includes denver s j r smith , golden state s monta ellis , atlanta s josh childress , chicago s ben gordon and duhon , and the lakers' sasha vujacic the champion boston celtics are already facing their first potential defection james posey , an excellent defender and solid 3point shooter , opted out of his contract and became an unrestricted free agent most teams entered the market with only the socalled midlevel exception expected to be worth about 6 million to spend on free agents

for the first time in its 161year history , the chicago tribune is endorsing a democrat for president the newspaper , which has links to the republican party that date back to the founding of the gop , said friday that senator barack obama is the strongest choice to lead us through a perilous time and restore in us a common sense of national purpose with that startling departure , the tribune joined a growing list of large daily newspapers across the country that have stated a preference for the democratic nominee over senator john mccain , his republican rival a quick survey shows mr obama winning the backing of an overwhelming majority of dailies with circulations over 100 , 000 that have already made endorsements mr mccain has won the endorsements of the new york post and the boston herald , among others several of the newspapers that have endorsed mr obama cited his youth and freshness on the national scene , along with mr mccain s age , as factors in their decision not since john f kennedy has a presidential candidate so moved a young generation , wrote the san jose mercury news , while the st louis postdispatch noted that the 25year difference in the ages of mr mccain , 72 , and mr obama , 47 , is important largely because mr obama s election would represent a generational shift the washington post and the los angeles times also endorsed the democratic candidate this week , as did the spanishlanguage dailies la opinion in los angeles and el diario la prensa in new york but none of those statements of support was as surprising as that of the tribune , whose early leaders helped found the republican party and aided abraham lincoln in securing the republican nomination for president in 1860 in its endorsement , the chicago tribune noted that it was breaking with a long tradition but it justified the shift by citing what it called mr obama s honor , grace and civility under pressure and criticizing mr mccain s choice of alaska gov sarah palin as his running mate , which it described as a failure of judgment in which mr mccain put his campaign ahead of the country s needs we have tremendous confidence in his intellectual rigor , his moral compass and his ability to make sound , thoughtful , careful decisions , the newspaper said of mr obama he is ready mr obama , of course , represents the state of illinois and the city of chicago , the tribune s home turf but gov adlai stevenson , the democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956 , was also from illinois and failed to secure the paper s support when he ran against dwight d eisenhower , as did senator steven douglas , a democratic nominee in 1860 no one knows to what extent , if at all , voters are influenced in their decisions by the endorsements of their hometown newspapers but several of the dailies that have come out in favor of mr obama are in battleground states where the obama campaign is sure to trumpet their support as it pursues independent , undecided voters numerous other newspapers , including the new york times , have not yet stated a preference for either mr mccain or mr obama during the primary season , the times endorsed sen hillary rodham clinton as the democratic nominee and mr mccain as the republican candidate getting the backing of the chicago tribune is not the only first in the way of campaign endorsements that mr obama has scored this year esquire magazine is also backing him , the first time in that magazine s 75year history that it has declared a preference for a presidential candidate , and so are publications as different as the music monthly vibe and the trade publication internet retailer , which said he would provide a stable economy in which ecommerce can flourish

paradigm , the group formed 10 years ago by gus solomons jr with carmen delavallade and dudley williams , has always seemed like a good idea on paper but this company , created for and by older dancers , has n't always produced work equal to the talent in the troupe s latest program , presented on thursday at as part of the summerdanz series , paradigm began with a bang kay cummings s stayin' alive , set to the bee gees' disco hit of the same title mr solomons , valda setterfield and mr williams , wearing hospital gowns and pushing iv stands , took shaky sideway steps across the stage occasionally pointing a tired finger in the style of john travolta or flashing a manic grin , the dancers , notably the hilarious ms setterfield , sparkled like vaudeville stars as an introduction , stayin' alive was also a deviously clever way of addressing the age issue but the meat and one real success of the program came from jonah bokaer , a young choreographer whose exceptional player prayer , a trio for mr solomons , ms setterfield and ms delavallade , gave the cast and its collective history a timeless gloss moving within a landscape of cool , greengray lighting by burke wilmore , the dancers wore sculptural layers of purple by oana botezban as they froze their bodies into striking tableaus or weaved across the stage in simple formations , frequently appearing in shadowy silhouette , they seemed like slender reeds slowly swaying in a shallow pond the digital sound score , also by mr bokaer , incorporated interviews conducted with the dancers , who had mp3 players strapped to their arms their overlapping voices , in snippets revealing the path each took to become a dancer , were transmitted through six speakers such an environment brought the past to the present , assimilating modern technology while never disturbing the dance s crystalline beauty the rest of the program was n't as distinguished robert battle s stages featured two dances in one expressionistic gestures in the first half , a vigorous romp in the second with neither section providing lasting appeal three scenes from archy mehitabel , by mr solomons , who portrayed a cockroach \( with a bizarre brooklyncockney accent \) , while ms delavallade played an alley cat , was an uneven theatricalization of the popular newspaper columns of don marquis in the early 1900s and mr solomons s three of clubs three of hearts had little to recommend it beyond ms botezban s colorful cloaks and the presence of ms setterfield and keith sabado none of the choreographers grasped what mr bokaer demonstrated so instinctively in player prayer with the truest of dancers , theater comes from the inside
in a famous passage in the sixth book of the prelude \( 1805 , 1850 \) , william wordsworth recounts a walking journey in which he and a companion \( robert jones \) crossed the alps without having been aware that they had done so that is , they were already heading down when they believed they were still going up the big moment they had looked forward to occurred without their noticing what they had missed was the liminal experience of crossing a threshold , stepping across a line , passing from one state to another one minute they re thinking about getting somewhere and the next minute they discover they re already there they can hardly believe it and question the peasant who has informed them and all the answers which the man returned to our inquiries , in their sense and substance translated by the feelings which we had , ended in this that we had crossed the alps i thought about these lines when i was reading charles van doren s account in the july 28 issue of the new yorker of his brief experience of fame and longer experience of infamy following the revelation in 1959 that his brilliant and captivating performance on the tv show twentyone was fraudulent he had been given the answers before he was asked the questions it is one indication of how much things have changed that before writing this piece van doren had never commented on the affair nowadays someone who deceives the public and is found out is immediately able to make a career \( in books and on talk shows \) out of confession , selfanalysis , and contrition but van doren repeatedly refused requests for interviews , and declined invitations to be a consultant either on a wgbh documentary or on robert redford s brilliant movie quiz show only now does he speak out in an essay with the promising \( but artful \) title , all the answers but there are no answers , at least to the questions most readers would want to ask why did you do it \? what was going on in your mind \? what about the moral issues \? the moment of decision , the moment when it would seem that a university instructor might be thinking about plato or kant or recalling lines from great literary works \( this above all , to thine own self be true \) , seems not to have occurred , or to have occurred offstage when no one , even the person most concerned , was watching to be sure the moment is presented , or , rather , it is introduced and its consequences noted , but it itself never comes into focus van doren has a conversation with al freedman , the man who had approached him about being on the show , and , although nothing specific was said , he knew that the show was fixed he tells this to his future wife , who didn t say much , although it is clear that she didn t like any of it and then and then it s over before the next sentence is delivered , the alps had already been crossed my first appearance on twentyone was on november 28 , 1956 how did that happen \? van doren doesn t know i must have put the whole thing out of my mind , but a week after my conversation with freedman i suddenly found myself in the studio , with the red light glowing above the camera , totally unaware that i was being watched by millions it s as if he were sleepwalking or had been hypnotized one minute he s wondering what to do and the next thing he \( or the reader \) knows , he s done it he then lies about it but as he tells it , it seems that someone else is doing the lying , and he is just a spectator when the investigations into what became known as the quiz show scandals begin , he is interviewed by manhattan district attorney joseph stone the interview is long , difficult and uncomfortable and ends with stone saying to him , you can lie to me , but i m not going to let you lie to the grand jury he lets stone say that he lied he doesn t say it himself in fact , he resents the accusation i hated him for making me feel like a criminal he probably saw me as an arrogant liar not i was an arrogant liar , but he saw me as one the suggestion is that there is a disjunction between what stone saw and what he actually was but what he actually was what kind of person was doing these things and for what reasons is something we never quite find out because when he describes his behavior it is always in the context of some situation that screens it and casts a narrative haze over it immediately after telling the stone story , he wonders what would have happened if i had told the truth he gets another chance when he is to appear before a grand jury , but upon entering the room he sees that the foreman was a senior professor at columbia , a man i knew by sight he panics and lies again but he has a reason that makes the lie a response to a particular situation and not a revelation of character if i told him the truth , i would in effect be telling everyone in the university so i lied this was , of course folly , since i had to tell the story anyway to everyone , not just to him folly it may have been , but it was folly that makes a kind of sense given van doren s relationship to columbia university its community genteel , rarified , respectable defines his world , most especially in the figures of his famous father , poet and critic mark van doren , and uncle , historian and biographer carl van doren he would rather confess to a vast impersonal audience than humiliate himself before one of his father s senior colleagues who , on this occasion , is obviously a standin for his father the conversation he has with his father a year before the rumors of fraud become public is marked by the same combination of reticence and circumlocution \( in which everything is said , but nothing is said \) that marks the essay as a whole mark van doren begins by remarking that he has never asked his son about this whole experience but he suspects that all this fame is not good for charles , and he urges him to wipe the slate clean , start over hearing this , charles nudges into dangerous territory you think the slate is dirty \? i couldn t look at him his indirection is then matched by his father s \( this is like reading a henry james novel the truth of things is always entering sideways \) it s none of my business dirty or not and i don t know what dirty would be the fact is you re caught up in something you may not really want the son comments that was as direct as he got that day or , any other day \( dad and i never talked about the quiz shows \) the younger van doren got very direct in his testimony before the congressional investigating committee , but even as he admitted all , he withheld the crucial piece of information , for the very good reason that he probably didn t have it he rehearses the arguments freedman made to him it s just entertainment you will increase the public s respect for the life of the mind but he indicates that they really weren t really persuasive then why did he give in \? perhaps i wanted to believe him , he speculates , not exactly engaging in introspection , just indicating one place it might have gone the closest he gets to the bottom of it all is a sentence that once again has a hole at its center whenever i hesitated or expressed uneasiness at the course events were taking during my time on the program the same sort of discussion ensued , and foolishly and wrongly , i persuaded myself that it was all true how exactly did that selfpersuasion occur \? in his testimony van doren gets right up to the edge of that question and then draws back , in deference , he says , to his audience s sensibilities i will not bore this committee by describing the intense moral struggles that went on inside me i was sick at heart moral struggles names a territory that is not visited in the exposition , and sick at heart raises a question that is not answered if one is sick at heart at a prospective action , why take it \? we never know all we are given is the fact , prefaced by a sad , plaintive , yet yet the fact is that i unfortunately agreed , after some time , to his proposal oh how we want to know what was going on during that some time the rest is history a job with the encyclopedia britannica , the publishing of books both as a solo author and in collaboration with mortimer adler , living in rural connecticut , children and grandchildren , teaching shakespeare , and now writing a piece for the new yorker , the perfect venue for someone who grew up in an intellectual culture that made new york city the capital of the literary universe and connecticut its backyard in redford s movie , much is made of the fact that in the world of the van dorens and their academic friends , television was considered vulgar but i bet they all read the new yorker and knew many who wrote for it and perhaps wrote for it themselves or were named in its columns and i bet too that the same crowd \( or their children and grandchildren \) still read the new yorker , which means that van doren has found a way of going public and speaking only inhouse \( redford implies strongly that it was van doren s desire to show some accomplishment of his own to his father and his father s friends that explains his actions \) i don t intend this analysis as a criticism of van doren who has undergone and survived experiences most of us have been spared and few of us could have recovered from quite the reverse whatever temptation he succumbed to in 1956 , in 2008 he refuses the temptation to make an exemplary lesson out of what happened he does not cast himself as a victim , or as a reformed villain or a misunderstood hero , three narratives that are quite popular in these days of compulsive selfdiscovery now in his 80 s van doren still hasn t discovered himself \( do any of us \? \) , still hasn t been able to plumb the depths of his motivations for actions that remain unfathomable , even to him , especially to him the best thing about the essay is its refusal to claim selfknowledge while still desiring it he imagines someone asking , aren t you charles van doren \? and implying by the question knowledge of what being charles van doren means certainly it means that he is the person who did what charles van doren did the man who cheated on twentyone is still part of me but it also means more , although the bearer of the name is not sure what that more is that s my name , i say to myself , but i m not who you think i am or , at least i don t want to be it s that last bit at least i don t want to be that is so in keeping with an autobiographical writing that tells and hides all at the same time it is what makes the essay at once maddening because it tantalizes without finally delivering and affecting because you sense that the author is not playing a game or laboring to reclaim a lost honor , but trying , as best he can , to live out a life

how can a prostitute best put a nervous prospect at ease \? i should say up front that i was n't abused by a relative , i 've got no children to support , and i 've never been addicted to anything if that is not enough , add this so why do i do it \? well , i love sex , and i love money and i know you do n't believe i enjoy the sex , but i do that soliloquy , from the opening episode of showtime s new series secret diary of a call girl , tries to dismiss in one fell swoop many of the most virulent and frequent objections to prostitution , among them the oftenscarred nature of its practitioners and the addiction and exploitation that often fuel the business those words , spoken by belle , the central character in secret diary , are directed not at a client , however , but to viewers , as if in anticipation that even in this day of celebrity sex tapes and girls going wild , there is something about prostitution that gives an audience pause after attracting the highest ratings ever for an original series on itv2 in britain last year , secret diary of a call girl was imported by the paycable channel showtime without change , an unusual import for a mainstream american television channel the series is based on a similarly titled book that grew out of an anonymous blog written by a woman who called herself belle de jour a cross between a fake documentary and a light characterdriven comedy , the program tracks the life of belle , played by billie piper known by her friends and family as hannah , belle tries to navigate the line between her personal life and professional persona the program , which will make its debut monday night , is probably less sexually explicit than most rrated films and even some cable series , like hbo s tell me you love me arriving as it does just a few months after former gov eliot spitzer of new york put a spotlight on the world of highpriced escort services , the show tries to offer insight into just how a woman might navigate such an environment , what drives her there in the first place and how she maintains relationships with friends and family members but if the reaction here is similar to that in britain , the show is likely to draw strenuous objections from opponents who believe that the series , with its beautiful and empowered protagonist , glamorizes a business that victimizes the women who work in it supporters of secret diary , of course , dispute that i'm pretty sure there is n't anyone associated with this show who thinks this profession is empowering to women , said chris albrecht , the president of img global media , whose company produced the program in britain and who brought it to the united states ms piper , a british actress best known to american audiences for playing rose tyler in the bbc series doctor who , argues that as simple escapist entertainment the series should be able to focus on prostitution without being accused of glamorizing inhumanity when you think about 'the sopranos , ' that is a story about a man who goes around killing people , she said in a telephone interview from london , where the program s second season is being filmed you empathize with tony soprano because he has this family and this life at home but the idea that a woman can lie down on her back and be paid for it , that seems to cause so much more of an uproar that uproar tends to be fueled by the often grim statistics that accompany most academic studies of prostitution high rates of sexual abuse and drug abuse among women who become prostitutes , as well as frequent incidents of violence against sex workers none of those unpleasantries are present in the cheery tableau that characterizes secret diary , however here belle s biggest problem seems to be the jealousy of an exboyfriend who still harbors feelings for her after viewing excerpts of the show on showtime s web site , one feminist scholar said that the series seems to want to do for prostitution what hbo s big love does for polygamy presenting a sanitized version of controversial sexual behavior the scholar , laurie shrage , the incoming director of the women s studies center at florida international university , noted that in setting itself in the world of highpriced escorts who court wealthy businessmen and politicians as clients , the series portrays prostitution in its least controversial form i think most of the audience will understand that belle does n't represent the average prostitute , ms shrage said but i do n't see that this show is going to do anything positive either for the profession , given that belle is portrayed as selfabsorbed , selfish and materialistic the onscreen depiction of prostitution is not new of course the 1913 film traffic in souls won kudos for its examination of the white slave trade and more than a dozen academy awards or nominations have gone to actresses for their performances as prostitutes it is also unlikely to be the last of its kind darren star , the creator of the sex and the city television series , is now writing a script for an hbo pilot , diary of a manhattan call girl , based on the novel by tracy quan , herself a former manhattan prostitute with dozens of other books of a similar vein out there one is by a dotcom call girl , another by an ivy league call girl , with a coming memoir by a woman whom new york magazine called the city s no 1 escort a few more versions seem likely if showtime s effort succeeds the impression left by reading several of these books is that only happy hookers write memoirs ms quan , who says that she used her experiences as a prostitute starting at the age of 14 as the basis for her three callgirl novels , said that the dangers faced by highdollar escorts are more subtle than worrying about getting beat up by a pimp one of the things prostitutes are often most frightened of is being discovered or exposed losing our business or losing our looks which is not to say that the business is glamorous , she added your body is such an important part of the job that every minute of your waking life has to be spent thinking about your health , ms quan said i do n't think that s a glamorous position to be in itv has already commissioned two more seasons of eight episodes each of secret dairy , said andrew zein , an executive producer of the series some of those darker issues that british critics said were missing from the current season are likely to be addressed in the second season , he said without giving too much away , as one becomes older and wiser , the question naturally occurs 'am i doing the right thing \? , ' mr zein said ms piper added that it was at first difficult for her to understand that someone would enter into the world of prostitution without having some kind of a tragic past that feeling faded , however , as she talked with the real belle , who has gained widespread fame in britain yet still has not publicly identified herself i genuinely believe the character in no way is in an ideal situation , ms piper said that becomes more apparent toward the end of season 1 and into season 2 belle is seemingly in control and selective about what she does , yet she has to face some real moral dilemmas she ca n't tell anybody she loves anything about what she does she s on her own , and i think that becomes a massive problem photos billie piper , left , plays belle in secret

in an extraordinary act of rebellion , the oldest affiliate of international has filed suit to protest a new agreement that the nonprofit housing organization is imposing on its 1 , 600 local chapters the san antonio affiliate , which built the first ever habitat house , is seeking a court ruling that would allow it to continue to use the habitat name without signing the agreement , which it contends gives the international organization too much power over its assets and operations we have about 21 million in buildings and other tangible and intangible assets that we 've acquired over 31 years on our own , and this agreement gives them unilateral and total control over us , said rene diaz , chairman of the san antonio habitat s board and a professional mediator if we fall out of favor , they could come in and take over everything and we could n't do a thing about it chris clarke , a spokesman for habitat international , said it was not aware of the lawsuit until 4 pm tuesday having only received the complaint within the last couple of hours , mr clarke said , we cannot comment in detail about the allegations but are confident of our right of ownership and our right to protect the habitat for humanity name habitat international s general counsel and a member of its executive committee are scheduled to meet with the san antonio board on jan 22 san antonio is one of an unknown number of habitat affiliates that refused to sign the agreement by dec 31 , the deadline set by habitat international , as the national organization is known habitat affiliates in new orleans , birmingham and tulsa , as well as dozens of other smaller affiliates , have expressed concern about the agreement for months mr clarke said a majority of the affiliates had signed the agreement and many others had asked for extensions of the deadline he said he could not provide a precise tally because the organization is still opening mail that arrived over the holiday since the new year , habitat international has been contacting those affiliates who have not signed the agreement or filed for extension , making it clear they are no longer regarded as in good standing that means they are no longer eligible for programs habitat international has centralized , such as corporate giving programs from companies like whirlpool and dow chemical , which supply appliances and construction materials for houses the affiliates build the san antonio affiliate and habitat international had been wrangling over the agreement for more than a year , and last spring , larry gluth , habitat international s vice president for united states affiliate field operations , flew to san antonio and met with the entire board after that , we prepared a very extensive response at great cost with an attorney s help , mr diaz said unfortunately , none of our changes were addressed in a final draft that came to us sometime in late november habitat has been rocked by internal dissent ever since the board dismissed millard fuller , the founder , of the organization in 2005 over allegations that he had improperly touched a female subordinate , allegations the board itself said it could not substantiate mr fuller and his wife , linda , started the fuller center for housing , and at least two small habitat affiliates have become fuller centers several former employees of habitat affiliates have left to start fuller centers in their communities karen robison , who recently resigned as the executive director of the habitat affiliate in denton , tex , and has started a fuller center there , said she thought some affiliates might follow san antonio s example i think it s come to a time in the organization s evolution , ms robison said , when people who have made a commitment to the original values and mission have to decide whether this is still the ministry it started out as or whether it is just another lowincome housing program
most nights when anthony klecker , a former marine , finally slept , he found himself back on the battlefields of iraq he would awake in a panic , and struggle futilely to return to sleep days were scarcely better car alarms shattered his nerves flashbacks came unexpectedly , at the whiff of certain cleaning chemicals bar fights seemed unavoidable he nearly attacked a man for not washing his hands in the bathroom desperate for sleep and relief , mr klecker , 30 , drank heavily one morning , his parents found him in the driveway slumped over the wheel of his car , the door wide open , wipers scraping back and forth another time , they found him curled in a fetal position in his closet yet only after his drunken driving caused the death of a 16yearold cheerleader did mr klecker acknowledge the depth of his problem his eight months at war had profoundly damaged his psyche i was trying to be the tough marine i was trained to be not to talk about problems , not to cry , said mr klecker , who has since been diagnosed with severe posttraumatic stress disorder i imprisoned myself in my own mind mr klecker s case is part of a growing body of evidence that alcohol abuse is rising among veterans of combat in afghanistan and iraq , many of them trying to deaden the repercussions of war and disorientation of home while the numbers remain relatively small , experts say and studies indicate that the problem is particularly prevalent among those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder , as it was after vietnam studies indicate that illegal drug use , much less common than heavy drinking in the military , is up slightly , too increasingly , these troubled veterans are spilling into the criminal justice system a small fraction wind up in prison for homicides or other major crimes far more , though , are involved in drunken bar fights , reckless driving and alcoholfueled domestic violence whatever the particulars , their stories often spool out in unwitting victims , ruptured families , lost jobs and crushing debt with the rising awareness of the problem has come mounting concern about the access to treatment and whether enough combat veterans are receiving the help that is available to them having cut way back in the 1990s as the population of veterans declined , the veterans health administration says it is expanding its alcohol and drugabuse services but advocacy groups and independent experts including members of a pentagon mentalhealth task force that issued its report last year are concerned that much more needs to be done in may , the house and senate passed bills that would require the veterans agency to expand substanceabuse screening and treatment for all veterans the war is now and the problems are now , said richard a mccormick , a senior scholar for public health at case western reserve university in cleveland who served on the pentagon task force every day there is a cohort of men and women being discharged who need services not one or two or five years from now they need them now for activeduty service members , the military faces a shortage of substanceabuse providers on bases across the country , while its health insurance plan , tricare , makes it difficult for many reservists and their families to get treatment in the breach , a few states , including california , connecticut and minnesota , have passed laws or begun programs to encourage alternative sentences , often including treatment , for veterans with substanceabuse and mentalhealth problems in recent years , the military has worked to transform a culture that once indulged heavy drinking as part of its warrior ethos into one that discourages it and encourages service members to seek help the army takes alcohol and drug abuse very seriously and has tried for decades to deglamorize its use , said lt col george wright , an army spokesman with the urgency of this war , we continue to tackle the problem with education , prevention and treatment that is a tricky mission in time of war the problem in today s military is soldiers have to be warriors , killers , do war , but we do n't allow them any releases like we used to , said bryan lane , a former special forces sergeant who sustained a traumatic brain injury in iraq and has posttraumatic stress disorder , or ptsd you ca n't go out and drink , you ca n't get into a fight it s completely unrealistic the military , he said , is trying to create a contradiction a perfect warrior , and then a perfect gentleman fort drum , in the north country of new york just outside watertown , is home to the army s mostdeployed brigade the second brigade of the 10th mountain division late last year , several thousand soldiers returned after 15 months in iraq some had served three , even four , tours , and they quickly overwhelmed the base s mental health system a study by an advocacy group , veterans for america , found the demand for psychological help was so great , and the system so overburdened , that soldiers often waited a month to be seen many also did what generations of homecoming soldiers have done they salved their wounds in local bars with drinking offlimits in iraq , at least openly , they were that much more likely to binge , that much less able to tolerate it the base s commander , maj gen michael l oates , says that since his arrival in early 2007 , misconduct related to substance abuse has reached unacceptable levels , despite a toughened regimen of education , designateddriver programs and penalties the rate of illegal drug use is slightly up the rate of alcohol is more than slightly up , general oates said i'm not a teetotaler i'm not against people drinking i'm against misconduct by last march , he had seen enough he ordered the base s newspaper , the fort drum blizzard , to publish the names and photographs of all soldiers charged with drunken driving to date , at least 116 have appeared half were combat veterans who had returned in the last year , the general said , though others may have deployed earlier most returning soldiers readjust after a few months but the general estimated that at least 20 percent turned to heavy drinking or drugs typically the first signal that there is something wrong across the military , the precise dimensions of the problem are elusive , especially since the different branches largely keep their own statistics many studies do not distinguish between service members who have seen battle and those who have not what is more , behavior becomes far harder to track when service members leave the military even so , a variety of surveys , as well as anecdotal evidence and rising alarm in many military communities , indicate growing substance abuse among recent combat veterans of particular concern are members of the national guard and reserves , as well as recently discharged service members , who can lose their bearings outside the camaraderie and structure of the military in the army , which has the bulk of the troops in iraq and afghanistan , the pentagon s most recent survey of healthrelated behavior , conducted in 2005 but released last year , found that for the first time in more than 20 years , roughly a quarter of soldiers surveyed considered themselves regular heavy drinkers defined as having five or more drinks at least once a week the report called the increase to 245 percent in 2005 , from 172 percent in 1998 an issue of concern perhaps the best monitor of recent combat veterans' mental health is the pentagon s postdeployment survey reflecting concern about heavy drinking , the latest report , published last november , introduced a question about drinking habits of the 88 , 235 soldiers surveyed in 2005 and 2006 , three to six months after returning from war , 12 percent of activeduty troops and 15 percent of reservists acknowledged having problems with alcohol while drug use decreased substantially after 1980 , when the military cracked down , it has increased slightly in the army and the marines since 2002 , the behavioral survey said experts say that , in some cases , troubled combat veterans are more prone to use drugs after leaving the military in general , studies find that drinking is more prevalent in the military than in the civilian population the behavioral survey reported that heavy drinking among 18 to 25yearold men in the army and the marines was almost twice as common as among their civilian counterparts heavy drinking or drug use frequently figures in what law enforcement officials and commanders at military bases across the country say is a rising number of crimes and other examples of misconduct involving soldiers , marines and recent veterans alcohol and drug use starts a cascade of worse problems , said dr mccormick , the task force member , who recently retired as director of mental health for the state veterans affairs system in ohio it s like throwing gasoline on fire most cases involve lowlevel misconduct from 2005 to 2006 , for example , alcoholrelated incidents mostly drunken or reckless driving and disorderly conduct more than tripled at fort hood , tex , according to information released to the pentagon task force other statistics showed a similar pattern throughout the army , a task force member said the marines , filled with young men drawn by the corps' hardcharging image , have traditionally had the military s highest drinking rates while the behavior survey showed a slight decrease in heavy drinking after 2002 , it showed an increase in binge drinking the marines also reported a rise in alcoholrelated incidents sometimes , though , substance abuse becomes a factor in major crimes this year , a new york times examination of killings in this country by veterans of iraq and afghanistan found that drinking or drug use was frequently involved in the crimes last month , a soldier at fort bliss , outside el paso , was charged with killing a woman in a drunkendriving accident the third intoxicated soldier there accused of killing a civilian in six months , said the commander , maj gen harold b bromberg substance abuse frequently figures in suicides , which reached a high in the army last year alcohol or drugs were cited in 30 percent of those 115 cases , the pentagon reported running through many of these soldiers' lives is combat trauma or other mental scars of war research has shown that the likelihood of mental health problems rises with the intensity of combat exposure \( in a recent rand corporation study , one in five veterans of iraq and afghanistan reported symptoms of combat stress or major depression \) in turn , service members with such problems more often report heavy drinking or illicit drug use in part , this dynamic is rooted in the warrior code trained to be tough and ignore their fear , many combat veterans are reluctant to acknowledge psychic wounds or they worry that getting help will damage their careers and so , like mr klecker , they treat themselves with the liquor bottle or illegal drugs in the last decade , the military has rolled out a number of programs to deal with excessive drinking soldiers carry callacab cards one base hands out portable breathalyzers a new online campaign pokes fun at that guy , a military man who drinks too much and ends up embarrassing himself and in trouble yet many experts and veterans advocates , as well as some military and government officials , agree that treatment continues to lag behind awareness in terms of access , but also in the willingness to use what is there studies showing the prevalence of alcohol problems also consistently show how few of those problem drinkers receive treatment in the pentagon s postdeployment survey , for example , fewer than a 10th of those reporting alcohol problems had been referred for treatment only a small fraction received treatment within 90 days similarly , in the pentagon task force data from fort hood , only 41 percent of those involved in alcoholrelated incidents were referred to the alcohol program mental health experts call these results unsurprising just as many combat veterans selfmedicate by drinking to quiet their mental storms , so they are loathe to acknowledge their drinking problems and seek treatment military policy can also hold them back service members are increasingly encouraged to seek treatment , without fear of punishment even so , signing up automatically alerts a commander that certainty can stir fears of reprisal and discourage others , like chaplains or marital counselors , from referring troops for treatment the pentagon task force recommended changing this policy for soldiers who seek help early , before the drinking or drug use crosses into addiction it is a very difficult problem , said shelley m macdermid , a cochairwoman of the panel and director of the center for families at purdue university the likely result is that there are folks who want and need treatment who are not getting it , about whom commanders know nothing for users of hard drugs , treatment within the military is rare the military generally discharges them , arguing that they can no longer do their jobs , and refers them to veterans clinics however , some experts argue that the military should treat some who started using drugs after fighting in war at fort drum , general oates says he sometimes gives second chances to some soldiers who test positive the army has increased its substanceabuse budget from 38 million in 2004 to 51 million this year the marine corps says its budget is rising , too still , recruiting treatment professionals continues to be a challenge , said col elspeth c ritchie , a psychiatric consultant to the army surgeon general colonel ritchie said the army was recruiting overseas and at home for 330 jobs , and had filled slightly more than half in the veterans health system , the cutbacks of the 1990s left only a small network of programs for the most extreme addicts today , veterans service organizations say , the system still needs more modern programs offering intense outpatient treatment , detoxification and stabilization services some smaller clinics offer barebones treatment or none at all , they say , and veterans in rural areas are hardpressed to find help near home at the veterans agency , officials say they share congress s goal of expanding programs dr antonette zeiss , the deputy chief consultant for mental health , said the agency had rebuilt its programs in the last three years , adding that it had hired 510 counselors and has programs in 90 to 100 of its larger facilities , with 28 more to be added soon it is also trying to address what many experts say is a growing need programs for both substance abuse and combat stress that need was underscored by a new jersey study of 292 national guard members who had returned from iraq in the last year the researchers found that 37 percent had experienced problem drinking for those with posttraumatic stress disorder , the figure rose to 55 percent yet among those reporting both , 41 percent received mental health treatment but only 9 percent received help for substance abuse substance abuse , though , must often be treated first , experts say , since it is hard to treat someone for combat stress who is drinking or using drugs getting help can be difficult for many combat veterans who rely on the military s tricare health plan reservists and national guard members living far from veterans clinics or military bases , along with some retirees the pentagon task force found finding treatment programs that accept tricare often ends in frustration , and few residential rehabilitation programs have the accreditation required by the plan a small but growing number of state and local authorities are trying to bridge the gaps last january , a city court judge in buffalo , robert t russell , noticed a surge of recent veterans with substanceabuse and mentalhealth problems in the city s courtrooms he created the nation s first veterans court , where , instead of jail , veterans arrested for lowlevel crimes , mostly tied to alcohol or drugs , are enrolled in treatment among them is garry pettengill when mr pettengill , 25 , was medically discharged from the army in 2006 , he had been drinking heavily to cope with a back injury and insomnia back home with his wife and three children , he came further unglued he could not keep a job while his drinking abated , he said , he started smoking marijuana every day and then began selling it last february , he was arrested out on bail , he fantasized about jumping out windows or hanging himself a call to a suicide hot line sent him to a veterans hospital for nine days then he landed in veterans court he has been clean for five months i get punished , obviously , he said , but they want to make sure i do get a job and do n't sell drugs and get the substanceabuse treatment i need anthony klecker experienced the brutality of war early , enduring ambushes and firefights as one of the first marines to fight from kuwait to baghdad and on to tikrit what torments him most , though , is the uncertainty as the gunner on the rear humvee in a first marine division convoy , corporal klecker was charged with making sure that nothing no cars , no iraqis came too close in the distance , he saw a man in farmer s robes running toward his convoy and fired a warning suddenly , a white civilian van came hurtling up the road mr klecker fired another warning , then let loose several bursts of machinegun fire at the van and the man the van stopped mr klecker said he did not know if he had killed them though he assumed he did or if they were innocent iraqis still , he says i was proud i had a lot of adrenaline i did my job later , though , the incident no longer seemed so clearcut i started to feel a sense of shame , he said , shame about if i did the right thing or did n't before joining the marines , mr klecker drank and smoked marijuana , but not heavily , said his lawyer , brockton hunter he was once stopped for drinking and driving , but the charge was downgraded to careless driving because his bloodalcohol level was just over the limit after iraq , he shipped out to okinawa and did what many marines do there he drank a lot but it was not until he left the marines and returned home to suburban st paul that his panic attacks , nightmares and insomnia worsened so did his drinking he rarely spoke about the war , and only to other veterans soon he racked up arrests for drinking and fighting , and mr hunter persuaded him to go to the veterans affairs center for help as often happens , the experience did not take mr klecker says he was shuttled from one counselor to another trying to talk about iraq threw him into a panic he hit bottom on oct 28 , 2006 , when he drunkenly drove into a highway divider it dislodged , trapping another driver , deanna casey , 16 , of minneapolis , who was killed when a tractortrailer rammed her small car if i could switch my life with deanna s , i would in a heartbeat , mr klecker said i did n't ask for help , and i should have afterward , mr klecker received a full veterans disability rating for combat stress at mr klecker s trial for vehicular manslaughter , the judge recognized the war s role in his disintegration and accepted his lawyer s request for a special deal after a year in jail , mr klecker moved into an intensive inpatient program at the st cloud veterans facility to deal first with his drinking and then his combat stress deanna s mother , catherine casey , a minneapolis police officer , did not welcome the sentence there are a lot of young men and women who saw horrible things and have done terrible things and have to live with that , she remembered thinking i thought , suck it up , mr klecker' in time , though , she came to see him as a good kid who made bad choices in prison , she said , he would get worse counselors say mr klecker was a model patient but he hit a rough patch during the fourweek lull a result of scheduling conflicts between alcohol treatment and therapy for combat stress last november , still untreated for combat trauma , mr klecker twice got into heated arguments with fellow patients , a violation of the program s rules he was forced to leave the inpatient program and wait for an outpatient slot in february , the judge ruled that mr klecker could not serve his sentence at home and returned him to prison for 19 months
beijing a chinese passenger jet that departed friday morning from the heavily muslim region of xinjiang was forced to make an emergency landing after crew members apprehended at least two passengers who the authorities said intended to sabotage the airplane , the state news media reported sunday also on sunday , a senior chinese official said a police raid last january against a group in xinjiang , which had been suspected of planning terrorist acts , uncovered proof that the group was plotting an attack on the olympic games in beijing this summer terrorism is usually not a significant threat in china , where the authoritarian government takes an unflinching approach to maintaining social stability but chinese security officials are concerned that terrorism poses a serious risk as beijing prepares for the games the airplane episode came in the same week that a man armed with explosives hijacked a private bus filled with australian tour operators who were sightseeing in the city of xi'an a police sniper later killed the man , and few details have been released about him or his motives none of the hostages were wounded the authorities offered no evidence that the three events were related but on sunday , wang lequan , the communist party chief in xinjiang , took a hard stance , saying china would strike the three evil forces of terrorists , separatists and extremists we are prepared to strike them when the evil forces are planning their activities , mr wang said , according to xinhua , the country s staterun news agency xinjiang is a vast northwestern region that is home to 83 million uighurs , a turkic muslim group with linguistic and cultural ties to neighboring central asia tensions have simmered in the region because of cultural aspirations among some uighurs for an independent state in the past , china has blamed uighur separatists for terrorist activity human rights groups have accused china of overstating any terrorist threat as a pretext for cracking down on the uighurs in january , the chinese police attacked what the authorities said was a terrorist gang in urumqi , the capital of xinjiang two people were killed and 15 were arrested initially , few details were released about the raid on sunday , mr wang said investigators had found knives , axes and books about terrorism in the raid he said other materials suggested that the group had been planning an attack on the olympics , though no specifics were provided obviously , the gang had planned an attack targeting the olympics , mr wang told xinhua in an interview conducted during a meeting of the national people s congress , the country s communist partycontrolled legislature mr wang said the gang had ties to the east turkestan islamic movement , a separatist group designated a terrorist organization by the united states and the united nations the thwarted airplane attack was also reported sunday nur bekri , chairman of the xinjiang uighur autonomous region government , told the state media that some people were attempting to create an air disaster the event occurred on a china southern airlines flight that departed urumqi on friday morning at 10 35 , heading for beijing but the plane was diverted to the city of lanzhou after a disturbance on board the state media provided only a few details , noting that the attackers were stopped in time by the air police , and all the passengers and crew members are safe mr bekri suggested that more than one person had been involved but declined to provide specifics , telling xinhua that the authorities were investigating who the attackers are , where they are from and what s their background but we can be sure that this was a case intending to create an air crash , he said a china southern employee at the lanzhou airport confirmed that the airplane had been diverted there and that the episode had been handled by public security officers the diversion was initially described as necessary because of traffic control , the employee said one person with information about the episode said a uighur woman apparently smuggled three containers of gasoline onto the airplane the person said the uighur woman took the containers into the bathroom and was later apprehended by members of the flight crew that account seemed consistent with a posting friday on a chinese internet chat room the messages discussed a landing in lanzhou and said that it had been discovered in midflight that people had brought gasoline on board and that four uighurs had been led away after the plane landed the messages appeared to be a firsthand account by a passenger using a handheld device from the airport in lanzhou , but that could not be confirmed nor could the identity of the person sending the messages real bad luck , one of the messages said
orlando , fla senator was not in a cone of silence on saturday night while his rival , senator , was being interviewed at the saddleback church in california members of the mccain campaign staff , who flew here sunday from california , said mr mccain was in his motorcade on the way to the church as mr obama was being interviewed by the rev , the author of the bestselling book the purpose driven life the matter is of interest because mr mccain , who followed mr obama s hourlong appearance in the forum , was asked virtually the same questions as mr obama mr mccain s performance was well received , raising speculation among some viewers , especially supporters of mr obama , that he was not as isolated during the obama interview as mr warren implied nicolle wallace , a spokeswoman for mr mccain , said on sunday night that mr mccain had not heard the broadcast of the event while in his motorcade and heard none of the questions the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain , a former prisoner of war , cheated is outrageous , ms wallace said before an audience of more than 2 , 000 people at the church , the candidates answered questions about policy and social issues mr warren , the pastor of saddleback , had assured the audience while he was interviewing mr obama that we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence and that he could not hear the questions after mr obama s interview , he was joined briefly by mr mccain , and the candidates shook hands and embraced mr warren started by asking mr mccain , now , my first question was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now \? mr mccain deadpanned , i was trying to hear through the wall interviewed sunday on cnn , mr warren seemed surprised to learn that mr mccain was not in the building during the obama interview
updated it would seem that senator barack obama and his campaign staff traveled to several countries during his overseas tour without saying or doing something that would fall into the gaffe category but it appears to be what he didn t do meeting with wounded soldiers , as he had originally planned at landstuhl regional medical center in germany , that is continuing to reverberate after mr obama s trip senator john mccain s campaign has just released a new television spot that it says will be broadcast in key states about the canceled visit and now , he made time to go to the gym , but canceled a visit with wounded troops , an announcer says seems the pentagon wouldn t allow him to bring cameras john mccain is always there for our troops mr obama did visit wounded troops in iraq , without telling the press , and he has noted private visits to walter reed army medical center in washington mr obama and top aides have offered their reasons for canceling the trip several times the most recent comments center around retired air force gen scott gration , who is now a campaign aide and was traveling with mr obama throughout his tour according to nbc news , the pentagon told general gration that , as a member of the campaign , he did not have authorization to visit the troops today , in an interview with fox news channel s bill hemmer , mr obama said it was scheduled , we intended to go and we got wind that there was some concern that this might be perceived as political because we were using campaign resources and at that point , the last thing i wanted to do is to in anyway distract the terrific work that s being done in terms of treating our troops , by getting it fouled up by a bunch of politics the reaction from senator john mccain s campaign on the matter has been pretty consistent it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military , referring to an early statement from robert gibbs , mr obama s communication s director , that the candidate decided it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a us military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign but today , the mccain camp released a new , cutting statement from retired army liutenant col joe repaya , who , according to a biography from the campaign , served in vietnam and both iraq wars the most solemn duty of a commander in chief is to fulfill his responsibility to the men and women who serve this country in uniform barack obama had scheduled a visit with wounded american troops who have served with honor and distinction in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , but he broke that commitment , instead flitting from one european capital to the next several explanations were offered , none was convincing and each was at odds with the statements of american military leaders in germany and washington for a young man so apt at playing president , barack obama badly misjudged the important demands of the office he seeks visits with world leaders and speeches to cheering europeans shouldn t be a substitute for comforting injured american heroes the obama campaign shot back with a message from tommy vietor , a spokesman as senator obama said today , the last thing he wanted was to have injured soldiers get pulled into the backandforth of a political campaign that s why we imagine senator mccain would be surprised that his campaign released this wildly inappropriate accusation that politicizes the issue senator obama and senator mccain share the belief that we must do everything we can to honor and support our troops , which is why senator obama has met with our men and women in uniform in iraq and afghanistan this week and visited wounded soldiers at walter reed numerous times update the obama campaign points out that the footage that appears in mr mccain s ad when the announcer talks about mr obama going to the gym instead of visiting troops is actually mr obama playing basketball with soldiers in kuwait
baghdad when the electricity came on in the ramshackle district of sadr city , the soldiers from the second stryker cavalry regiment flicked on the television to watch tuesday s congressional hearings with gen  for a brief moment , washington politics intruded into a world in which automatic weapons fire , tank fire and explosives rock the streets but before general petraeus could complete his prepared statement , the power shut down again the fleeting reminder of the debate at home was followed by a blunt discussion of the larger aims of the american involvement here none of the soldiers clustered around the television favored a speedy reduction in american troops for soldiers defending a toehold in the most violent area of baghdad with often unsteady iraqi troops the idea of confronting wellarmed militias with fewer troops seemed almost unfathomable if we did start downgrading forces , it would hurt us more , said staff sgt william edwards , who was among the halfdozen troops watching the start of the proceedings we would have a lot less to fight all the militias but some from the unit first squadron , second platoon , bull company harbored doubts about the iraqi government s determination to take on the militias it has got to be done , said specialist nicholas dutkiewicz , 23 , from bristol , conn i do n't know if they are willing to carry it all the way through sgt derek arnold , 23 , from springfield , ore , said he was annoyed to learn in the opening statement of the senior democrat , senator carl levin of michigan , that the iraqi government was not spending all of its oil proceeds it ticked me off to hear how our tax money is going into this when they are just stockpiling the money , he said the platoon s sadr city engagement began about two weeks ago , when the platoon rushed to reclaim a checkpoint on the outskirts of the neighborhood that had been abandoned by iraqi troops who were menaced by shiite militia fighters soon after , it battled its way into sadr city as part of an american and iraqi campaign to control the areas that the militias have used as a launching pad to fire rockets at the green zone after killing dozens of militia fighters , the platoon 35 soldiers in all established a foothold in a southern swath of the neighborhood some piled into a dank , abandoned apartment building , which represents the forward line of allied forces in this part of sadr city , while others set up camp in the stryker vehicles outside existence for the american soldiers here is spartan , at best the threestory apartment building has no working shower and only one functional , but primitive , toilet the soldiers live on field rations and sleep on lumpy mats in crowded , dusty rooms we all smell the same , so you ca n't really tell , said staff sgt mark brasel , 26 , from tacoma , wash blankets have been strung over the windows to try to foil enemy snipers , while the platoon s own snipers and stryker vehicles outside try to monitor iraqis who live nearby there is intermittent and often heavy gunfire outside for now , the main fighting is being done by soldiers from the 11th iraqi army division it has been thrust into the lead as part of an effort to build up the iraqi army s capabilities and to avoid inflaming the population in an area that has long been a bastion of support for moktada alsadr , the antiamerican cleric who controls the mahdi army the iraqi soldiers have been struggling to advance to a main thoroughfare about half a mile to the north to solidify control over the area judging from the proximity of the gunfire , the iraqi effort seems to be having mixed results for the americans , holding the line has had its costs on tuesday morning , word reached the platoon over the tactical radio that two soldiers from a nearby unit were killed when an explosion rocked their position the fighting has also put its mark on the neighborhood on monday , an outdoor market burst into flames when a smoke grenade fired by the platoon went astray a crowd of iraqis came streaming to the site with buckets of water to try to prevent the fire from spreading a lone sadr city fire truck arrived after the flames were put out , its journey apparently delayed by the need to circumvent a bombfilled stretch of road still , one nearby sadr city resident , who spoke only after being assured that he would not be identified , said he hoped that the american soldiers would stay for a while before the american troops arrived , he said , militias had prowled the streets with impunity as if to ward off the mayhem outside , the soldiers have held to some military rituals on monday , soldiers crowded into a small room while three of their comrades were officially promoted testimonials to their dedication were presented by their superiors while the soldiers unabashedly professed their feeling for their fellow troopers i love you guys , said sergeant edwards , 26 , from jacksonville , fla , who was elevated from sergeant to staff sergeant the troops generally agreed with sergeant edwards , who said it would be foolish to withdraw american troops at this time but some also bemoaned the lack of progress on the iraqi side lt matthew apostol , 25 , from mililani , hawaii , and the platoon leader , summed up both concerns there should not be a quick timeline for reducing troops , he said that would not a good thing for right now but the iraqi government is pretty inept they are not meeting their end of the bargain the iraqi army is not getting the support it needs from its government they come and ask us for food , water and ammunition , basic things that soldiers need
senator john mccain good evening from the great city of new orleans tonight , we can say with confidence the primary season is over , and the general election campaign has begun i commend both senators obama and clinton for the long , hard race they have run senator obama has impressed many americans with his eloquence and his spirited campaign senator clinton has earned great respect for her tenacity and courage the media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of americans , and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received as the father of three daughters , i owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach i am proud to call her my friend pundits and party elders have declared that senator obama will be my opponent he will be a formidable one but i'm ready for the challenge , and determined to run this race in a way that does credit to our campaign and to the proud , decent and patriotic people i ask to lead the decision facing americans in this election could n't be more important to the future security and prosperity of american families this is , indeed , a change election no matter who wins this election , the direction of this country is going to change dramatically but , the choice is between the right change and the wrong change between going forward and going backward america has seen tough times before we 've always known how to get through them and we 've always believed our best days are ahead of us i believe that still but we must rise to the occasion , as we always have change what must be changed and make the future better than the past the right change recognizes that many of the policies and institutions of our government have failed they have failed to keep up with the challenges of our time because many of these policies were designed for the problems and opportunities of the mid to late 20th century , before the end of the cold war before the revolution in information technology and rise of the global economy the right kind of change will initiate widespread and innovative reforms in almost every area of government policy health care , energy , the environment , the tax code , our public schools , our transportation system , disaster relief , government spending and regulation , diplomacy , the military and intelligence services serious and farreaching reforms are needed in so many areas of government to meet our own challenges in our own time the irony is that americans have been experiencing a lot of change in their lives attributable to these historic events , and some of those changes have distressed many american families job loss , failing schools , prohibitively expensive health care , pensions at risk , entitlement programs approaching bankruptcy , rising gas and food prices , to name a few but your government often acts as if it is completely unaware of the changes and hardships in your lives and when government does take notice , often it only makes matters worse for too long , we have let history outrun our government s ability to keep up with it the right change will stop impeding americans from doing what they have always done overcome every obstacle to our progress , turn challenges into opportunities , and by our own industry , imagination and courage make a better country and a safer world than we inherited to keep our nation prosperous , strong and growing we have to rethink , reform and reinvent the way we educate our children train our workers deliver health care services support retirees fuel our transportation network stimulate research and development and harness new technologies to keep us safe we must rebuild the structure and mission of our military the capabilities of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies the reach and scope of our diplomacy the capacity of all branches of government to defend us we need to strengthen our alliances , and preserve our moral credibility we must also prepare , far better than we have , to respond quickly and effectively to a natural calamity when americans confront a catastrophe they have a right to expect basic competence from their government firemen and policemen should be able to communicate with each other in an emergency we should be able to deliver bottled water to dehydrated babies and rescue the infirm from a hospital with no electricity our disgraceful failure to do so here in new orleans exposed the incompetence of government at all levels to meet even its most basic responsibilities the wrong change looks not to the future but to the past for solutions that have failed us before and will surely fail us again i have a few years on my opponent , so i am surprised that a young man has bought in to so many failed ideas like others before him , he seems to think government is the answer to every problem that government should take our resources and make our decisions for us that type of change does n't trust americans to know what is right or what is in their own best interests it s the attitude of politicians who are sure of themselves but have little faith in the wisdom , decency and common sense of free people that attitude created the unresponsive bureaucracies of big government in the first place and that s not change we can believe in you will hear from my opponent s campaign in every speech , every interview , every press release that i'm running for president bush s third term you will hear every policy of the president described as the bushmccain policy why does senator obama believe it s so important to repeat that idea over and over again \? because he knows it s very difficult to get americans to believe something they know is false so he tries to drum it into your minds by constantly repeating it rather than debate honestly the very different directions he and i would take the country but the american people did n't get to know me yesterday , as they are just getting to know senator obama they know i have a long record of bipartisan problem solving they 've seen me put our country before any president before any party before any special interest before my own interest they might think me an imperfect servant of our country , which i surely am but i am her servant first , last and always i have worked with the president to keep our nation safe but he and i have not seen eye to eye on many issues we 've disagreed over the conduct of the war in iraq and the treatment of detainees over out of control government spending and budget gimmicks over energy policy and climate change over defense spending that favored defense contractors over the public good i disagreed strongly with the bush administration s mismanagement of the war in iraq i called for the change in strategy that is now , at last , succeeding where the previous strategy had failed miserably i was criticized for doing so by republicans i was criticized by democrats i was criticized by the press but i do n't answer to them i answer to you and i would be ashamed to admit i knew what had to be done in iraq to spare us from a defeat that would endanger us for years , but i kept quiet because it was too politically hard for me to do no ambition is more important to me than the security of the country i have defended all my adult life senator obama opposed the new strategy , and , after promising not to , voted to deny funds to the soldiers who have done a brilliant and brave job of carrying it out yet in the last year we have seen the success of that plan as violence has fallen to a four year low sunni insurgents have joined us in the fight against al qaeda the iraqi army has taken the lead in places once lost to sunni and shia extremists and the iraqi government has begun to make progress toward political reconciliation none of this progress would have happened had we not changed course over a year ago and all of this progress would be lost if senator obama had his way and began to withdraw our forces from iraq without concern for conditions on the ground and the advice of commanders in the field americans ought to be concerned about the judgment of a presidential candidate who says he s ready to talk , in person and without conditions , with tyrants from havana to pyongyang , but has n't traveled to iraq to meet with general petraeus , and see for himself the progress he threatens to reverse i know americans are tired of this war i do n't oppose a reckless withdrawal from iraq because i'm indifferent to the suffering war inflicts on too many american families i hate war and i know very personally how terrible its costs are but i know , too , that the course senator obama advocates could draw us into a wider war with even greater sacrifices put peace further out of reach , and americans back in harm s way i take america s economic security as seriously as i do her physical security for eight years the federal government has been on a spending spree that added trillions to the national debt it spends more and more of your money on programs that have failed again and again to keep up with the changes confronting american families extravagant spending on things that are not the business of government indebts us to other nations fuels inflation raises interest rates and encourages irresponsibility i have opposed wasteful spending by both parties and the bush administration senator obama has supported it and proposed more of his own i want to freeze discretionary spending until we have completed top to bottom reviews of all federal programs to weed out failing ones senator obama opposes that reform i opposed subsidies that favor big business over small farmers and tariffs on imported products that have greatly increased the cost of food senator obama supports these billions of dollars in corporate subsidies and the tariffs that have led to rising grocery bills for american families that s not change we can believe in no problem is more urgent today than america s dependence on foreign oil it threatens our security , our economy and our environment the next president must be willing to break completely with the energy policies not just of the bush administration , but the administrations that preceded his , and lead a great national campaign to put us on a course to energy independence we must unleash the creativity and genius of americans , and encourage industries to pursue alternative , nonpolluting and renewable energy sources , where demand will never exceed supply senator obama voted for the same policies that created the problem in fact , he voted for the energy bill promoted by president bush and vice president cheney , which gave even more breaks to the oil industry i opposed it because i know we wo n't achieve energy independence by repeating the mistakes of the last half century that s not change we can believe in with forward thinking democrats and republicans , i proposed a climate change policy that would greatly reduce our dependence on oil our approach was opposed by president bush , and by leading democrats , and it was defeated by opposition from special interests that favor republicans and those that favor democrats senator obama might criticize special interests that give more money to republicans but you wo n't often see him take on those that favor him if america is going to achieve energy independence , we need a president with a record of putting the nation s interests before the special interests of either party i have that record senator obama does not senator obama proposes to keep spending money on programs that make our problems worse and create new ones that are modeled on big government programs that created much of the fiscal mess we are in he plans to pay for these increases by raising taxes on seniors , parents , small business owners and every american with even a modest investment in the market he does n't trust us to make decisions for ourselves and wants the government to make them for us and that s not change we can believe in senator obama thinks we can improve health care by driving americans into a new system of government orders , regulations and mandates i believe we can make health care more available , affordable and responsive to patients by breaking from inflationary practices , insurance regulations , and tax policies that were designed generations ago , and by giving families more choices over their care his plan represents the old ways of government mine trusts in the common sense of the american people senator obama pretends we can address the loss of manufacturing jobs by repealing trade agreements and refusing to sign new ones that we can build a stronger economy by limiting access to our markets and giving up access to foreign markets the global economy exists and is not going away we either compete in it or we lose more jobs , more businesses , more dreams we lose the future he s an intelligent man , and he must know how foolish it is to think americans can remain prosperous without opening new markets to our goods and services but he feels he must defer to the special interests that support him that s not change we can believe in lowering trade barriers to american goods and services creates more and better jobs keeps inflation under control keeps interest rates low and makes more goods affordable to more americans we wo n't compete successfully by using old technology to produce old goods we 'll succeed by knowing what to produce and inventing new technologies to produce it we are not people who believe only in the survival of the fittest work in america is more than a paycheck it a source of pride , selfreliance and identity but making empty promises to bring back lost jobs gives nothing to the unemployed worker except false hope that s not change we can believe in reforming from top to bottom unemployment insurance and retraining programs that were designed for the 1950s , making use of our community colleges to train people for new opportunities will help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a job that wo n't go away my friends , we 're not a country that would rather go back than forward we 're the world s leader , and leaders do n't hide from history they make history but if we 're going to lead , we have to reform a government that has lost its ability to help us do so the solution to our problems is n't to reach back to the 1960s and 70s for answers in just a few years in office , senator obama has accumulated the most liberal voting record in the senate but the old , tired , big government policies he seeks to dust off and call new wo n't work in a world that has changed dramatically since they were last tried and failed that s not change we can believe in the sweeping reforms of government we need wo n't occur unless we change the political habits of washington that have locked us in an endless cycle of bickering and stalemate washington is consumed by a hyperpartisanship that treats every serious issue as an opportunity to trade insults impugn each other s motives and fight about the next election this is the game washington plays both parties play it , as do the special interests that support each side the american people know it s not on the level for all the problems we face , what frustrates them most about washington is they do n't think we 're capable of serving the public interest before our personal ambitions that we fight for ourselves and not for them they are sick of the politics of selfishness , stalemate and delay , and they have every right to be we have to change not only government policies that have failed them , but the political culture that produced them both senator obama and i promise we will end washington s stagnant , unproductive partisanship but one of us has a record of working to do that and one of us does n't americans have seen me put aside partisan and personal interests to move this country forward they have n't seen senator obama do the same for all his fine words and all his promise , he has never taken the hard but right course of risking his own interests for yours of standing against the partisan rancor on his side to stand up for our country he is an impressive man , who makes a great first impression but he has n't been willing to make the tough calls to challenge his party to risk criticism from his supporters to bring real change to washington i have when members of my party refused to compromise not on principle but for partisanship , i have sought to do so when i fought corruption it did n't matter to me if the culprits were democrats or republicans i exposed it and let the chips fall where they may when i worked on campaign finance and ethics reform , i did so with democrats and republicans , even though we were criticized by other members of our parties , who preferred to keep things as they were i have never refused to work with democrats simply for the sake of partisanship i 've always known we belong to different parties , not different countries we are americans before we are anything else i do n't seek the presidency on the presumption i'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need i seek the office with the humility of a man who cannot forget my country saved me i 'll reach out my hand to anyone , republican or democrat , who will help me change what needs to be changed fix what needs to be fixed and give this country a government as capable and good as the people it is supposed to serve there is a time to campaign , and a time to govern if i'm elected president , the era of the permanent campaign of the last sixteen years will end the era of reform and problem solving will begin from my first day in office , i 'll work with anyone to make america safe , prosperous and proud and i wo n't care who gets the credit as long as america gets the benefit i have seen republicans and democrats achieve great things together when the stakes were high and it mattered most , i 've seen them work together in common purpose , as we did in the weeks after september 11th this kind of cooperation has made all the difference at crucial turns in our history it has given us hope in difficult times it has moved america forward and that , my friends , is the kind of change we need right now thank you
jerusalem one recent autumn evening , under a full moon , a monument to tolerance was unveiled on a ridge high above this revered and contested city , sacred to muslims , christians and jews a soaring bronze column split down the middle , with a spindly , gilded olive tree reaching up through the chasm , it seemed to encapsulate both the promise and the fragility of peace in a city increasingly on edge the monument , the gift of a polish billionaire , was erected on the invisible seam between one of the arab neighborhoods of east jerusalem and the predominantly jewish west at the ceremony , there were ethereal moments , suggestive of a greater harmony , as the strains of an orchestra mingled with the muslim call to prayer from countless minarets but this has also been a site of tremendous discord , a tangible reminder of how fractured the city really is down the slope lies jebel mukaber , a neighborhood of east jerusalem that israel captured from the jordanians in 1967 last march , a gunman set out from here and headed to the mercaz harav jewish seminary in the west he sprayed the mostly teenage students there with automatic weapon fire , killing eight before being shot dead himself it was the worst act of terrorism perpetrated in the city in four years the road in front of the monument was the scene of angry demonstrations then by jewish religious nationalists , who demanded the demolition of the gunman s family home in the months since , two palestinians driving large construction vehicles and a third behind the wheel of a bmw have rammed vehicles and pedestrians in west jerusalem , killing three israelis and wounding scores , deliberately , according to the police all the drivers , who were killed on the spot , were residents of east jerusalem , including jebel mukaber none were known to have had any strong political affiliations we live in fear , said an israeli woman , mazal tzabah , 64 , at a bus stop in armon hanatziv , the jewish neighborhood bordering jebel mukaber we do n't know who is good from bad about a quarter of a million palestinians , mostly muslim , live in the generally poorer and less developed arab neighborhoods of east jerusalem , making up a third of the city s population almost 200 , 000 jews live alongside them in a patchwork of new neighborhoods , like armon hanatziv , that have been built over the 1967 boundaries on territory the palestinians demand as the capital of their future state adding to the m lange , a number of jewish housing projects have sprung up like minisettlements in existing arab neighborhoods , including nof zion , a luxury apartment complex that is being marketed to religious jews and that sits at the entrance of jebel mukaber meanwhile , an increasing number of arab families are quietly moving into jewish areas on both sides of the 1967 line the police report a sharp increase in the number of east jerusalem residents arrested for involvement in violence or the planning of attacks in the past year while the city has experienced worse violence , like the deadly bus and cafe bombings of previous years , most of those were carried out by palestinians who came in from the west bank since israel considers all of jerusalem as its united , sovereign capital , there are no permanent barriers in the heart of the city its palestinian residents , unlike west bankers , have free access to all parts in this tense arrangement , tolerance is often tested when sectarian rioting broke out on oct 8 between jews and arabs in the mixed city of acre in northern israel , the police immediately went on high alert in east jerusalem for fear the violence could spread many jewish residents say they live in trepidation arab residents charge that rather than trying to find a political solution for the city , israel is trying to judaize the eastern part and squeeze the palestinians out meaningful social interaction is rare but even amid the rising antagonism , some are trying to reach across the psychological divide on sept 21 , young jewish and palestinian musicians came together for a joint rock concert sponsored by the united states consulate at the historic ymca building on king david street the site of one of the construction vehicle attacks in july under the slogan the mic is more powerful than the gun one of the performers , muhammad mughrabi , 21 , a rapper from the shuafat refugee camp in east jerusalem , says his friends there think it strange that he appears with israelis until i was 15 , all the israelis i met were soldiers , and i was very afraid , he said there are other examples of coexistence groups of israeli and palestinian women meet to discuss weight issues , brought together by an americanisraeli filmmaker who founded the project in 2006 , making a documentary called a slim peace ir amim , an israeli group that advocates an equitable political solution for jerusalem , is offering tours of east jerusalem to show israelis what life looks like on the other side beyond that , the interreligious coordinating council in israel has been organizing modest peopletopeople exchanges between east and west jerusalem for years jerusalem is a very weird city , said ron kronish , the council s director life goes on , but the amount of separate living is staggering he added , the question is how do real people live amidst conflict , and how can you best mitigate it , meaning having a little less hatred yet the tensions persist the night after the ymca concert , which ended with a warm if chaotic improvisation of bob marley s no more trouble , a 19yearold from jebel mukaber took his brother s bmw and rammed it into a group of offduty soldiers and civilians , wounding several , outside the old city at a point where the east meets west mourners who gathered at his spacious family home were convinced that the youth , an inexperienced driver with no license , was involved in a simple traffic accident and was needlessly killed by one of the soldiers all he cared about , as far as i know , was to have a nice car and listen to music , said omar baidun , 45 , a businessman and family friend yet there were no doubts about the driver s intentions in the jewish neighborhood of armon hanatziv dalia ben shitreet , 47 , an israeli hairdresser who lives on the outer rim of the neighborhood , only a street away from jebel mukaber , said that she was for coexistence and that some of her clients and occupants of her own apartment building were muslim arabs but she added that she was afraid to walk out at night that jebel mukaber was hostile and should be razed to its foundations though i am sorry and ashamed to say it
celebrity and politics mingle wednesday night as the three presidential candidates appear in taped segments on a special charity edition of the country s top tv program , american idol no word on whether they ll be singing \( probably not , we guess \) , but barack obama s already said that his daughters , malia and sasha , are big fans of the show adding to the star factor , singer elton john will perform at a highdollar fundraiser for hillary rodham clinton in new york could the double dose of pop culture be mrs clinton s way of reaching out to younger voters traditionally one of mr obama s most loyal groups \? maybe in pittsburgh , though , she already has the backing of the city s top young person , 28yearold mayor luke ravenstahl , writes the washington post at 28 , the youngest bigcity mayor in modern us history has become one of clinton s key backers in pennsylvania , her top surrogate in its secondlargest city and an effective rejoinder to the idea that sen barack obama , her rival for the democratic presidential nomination , has a lock on young voters in the state as far as ol washington glamor goes , president bush will meet with democratic congressional leaders nancy pelosi and harry reid on wednesday the top congressional democrats are expected to press the president on a couple of issues often pushed by sens clinton and obama on the campaign trail the housing crisis , infrastructure rebulding and alternative energy tuesday , however , was all about iraq mrs clinton , mr obama and john mccain questioned the top military officer in iraq , gen david h petraeus , and ryan c crocker , the american ambassador there , about the war during senate committee meetings elisabeth bumiller of the new york times remarks that their tempered performances seemed to reflect the political risks of appearing too easy or tough on the guests for the most part , the daylong hearings were a fugue of caution as the three struck somber , respectful stances with general petraeus in his appearances before the senate armed services and foreign relations committees alongside ryan c crocker , the american ambassador to baghdad although the candidates repeated their main arguments mr mccain said there was significant progress in iraq mrs clinton said there was not mr obama called the war a massive strategic blunder none used the occasion to grandstand mr mccain , who has been under fire from democrats for his unwavering support of the war , asked a series of skeptical questions , while mrs clinton and mr obama , whose calls for troop withdrawals have been criticized by republicans as na ve , crossexamined general petraeus in academic , lawyerly fashion elizabeth edwards , wife of former presidential candidate john edwards , told robin roberts of good morning america that she thinks mrs clinton s health care proposal is more inclusive than mr obama s mrs edwards has not endorsed a candidate neither has her husband you need that universality in order to get the cost savings i just have more confidence in sen clinton s policy than sen obama s on this particular issue , she said the alliance for american manufacturing , a nonprofit trade association , is running fullpage newspaper ads in pennsylvania designed to get candidates to take a harder stance on trade , according to the wall street journal the ads are intended to move the trade discussion beyond the north american free trade agreement or the prospective trade agreement with colombia , which have dominated the news , said scott paul , the group s executive director china is a bigger issue we felt there needed to be a public education the ads , which the group plans to run through the april 22 pennsylvania primary , cite the loss of 207 , 000 manufacturing jobs in the state since 2000 , linking 78 , 000 to trade with china , and concludes , china cheats pennsylvania loses the group plans to run similar ads ahead of the indiana primary on may 6 mark penn was dismissed from the clinton campaign at least in part for his private ties to a colombian free trade agreement but the journal says mrs clinton has another procolombia strategist on her team her husband the clinton campaign spokesman said mr clinton has been supporting trade preferences for colombia since 2000 like other married couples who disagree on issues from time to time , she disagrees with her husband on this issue , he said this kind of inconsistency adds to the politico s argument that mrs clinton s campaign is a model of bad management  the big fish in the gop pond are slowly swimming to mr mccain s side , another story in the wall street journal says , but his fundraising figures are still well below those of the democrats , underscoring the arizonan s larger problems motivating the republican base  nonetheless , the mccain campaign said it is actively recruiting donors every day the idea that there is an extensive network of republican donors who give to whatever republican happens to be on the top of the ticket is just false , said campaign spokeswoman jill hazelbaker every campaign has to go out and actively recruit their donors bush donors giving for the first time in the 2008 presidential election represent about 9 of sen mccain s total receipts in the first two months of the year secretary of state condoleezza rice still is really , truly , not

indianapolis when senator barack obama awoke on thursday morning in a downtown hotel here , a new television commercial from senator john mccain was on the air just in time for mr obama s latest trip to indiana the ad , titled sweat equity , stood out in the flood of political commercials that are running on television stations in indianapolis and across the country in the course of a few hours , the ad ran multiple times across multiple stations , crisply delivering the mccain campaign s assertion that mr obama would redistribute wealth in america the ad opens with an image of what else \? mr obama talking to joe wurzelbacher outside toledo i think when you spread the wealth around , it s good for everybody , mr obama says , speaking to the man who america now knows as joe the plumber  but the ad isn t focused on mr wurzelbacher , which is perhaps why it seemed sharp and fresh he is featured only briefly , before three women come onto the screen and each say directly to the camera , i m joe the plumber then , three men come into view , with the final one saying obama wants my sweat to pay for his trillion dollars in new spending \? while watching the ad play here during commercial breaks in the local news , it was striking there was no ominous music , no menacing words from an announcer and none of the scary images that have come to dominate many of the political ads this year in the final days of the presidential race , against a torrent of dismal national polls for the republican ticket , this argument could be one of mr mccain s most effective in red states like indiana that mr obama is aggressively trying to win while mr obama has overwhelmed his republican rival with spending on television ads , mr obama did not have any commercials airing at the same time to refute the charge at least on morning television here , he was seen in an elementary school classroom , talking about his education plans so how does mr obama respond to the assertion that he would redistribute wealth \? at a press conference in virginia on wednesday , he was asked whether spread the wealth was an accurate description of his economic vision and if he believed that he had created an opening for republicans \? to those questions , he offered a 750word answer that stretched on for several minutes i don t think i created an opening , mr obama said look , they have been trying to throw whatever they can up against the wall to see what sticks and this is their latest version then , he dismissed the republican criticism that his tax proposals could be characterized as socialism , but he said that his plans involved spreading around opportunity so wealthy americans paid more yes , mr obama said it means that people , like myself , who make a lot more than 250 , 000 a year pay a little bit more in order to make sure that the waitress who is surviving on minimum wage and tips still can keep a roof over her head and save enough for her kid to go to college mr obama said he would reverse the tax cuts for the wealthiest slice of americans that were passed during the bush administration he noted that mr mccain , too , initially opposed the tax cuts eight years ago was john mccain a socialist back in 2000 \? mr obama said it s not a very plausible argument that he s making right now , and i think it s an indication that they have run out of ideas even though mr obama said the argument was not plausible , if he was watching television at the conrad hotel here on thursday morning , did he find it effective \? to that question , we don t have an answer , but he do know that mr obama dashed off to a supporter s home here to tape a new batch of television advertisements perhaps one of them will be a response to sweat equity , which could be one of the most notable mccain ads of the season
former vice president al gore used a recent speech to call for weaning the united states from coal by 2018  on monday , senator barack obama proposed weaning the country from middle eastern and venezuelan oil in roughly the same time span feeling rising pressure in the campaign over high gas prices \( and the looming specter of extraordinary home heating costs this fall \) , he shifted his stance to considering some new offshore drilling if it was part of a comprehensive energy agreement including big investments and incentives for nonpolluting energy technologies he also wants to drill in a different part of alaska s north slope than the national wildlife refuge known as anwr , but one that also is a battleground for some environmental groups but mr obama s prime focus was a broad and sustained push for new energy technologies that could keep the country moving while sharply cutting petroleum use and carbon dioxide emissions getting there given the hurdles in congress , gaps in technology , and inertia built into centuryold transportation and energy systems will be a monumental task , but mr obama insisted he can do the job \( his energy plan is online as a pdf file \)

of his more recent energy and climate speech , delivered in houston on june 17 \( transcript of speech  mccain energy policy \) the speech transcript is below and i ve begun annotating as before , i

the ed sullivan show as a kid \( yes , i m over 50 \) senator barack obama s speech on energy aug 4 , lansing , michigan \( provided by cq transcriptions , inc \) we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges greater than any we ve seen in generations right now , our brave men and women in uniform are fighting two different wars while terrorists plot their next attack our changing climate is placing our planet in peril our economy is in turmoil and our families are struggling with rising costs and falling incomes with lost jobs and lost homes and lost faith in the american dream and for too long , our leaders in washington have been unwilling or unable to do anything about it that is why this election could be the most important of our lifetime when it comes to our economy , our security , and the very future of our planet , the choices we make in november and over the next few years will shape the next decade , if not the century and central to all of these major challenges is the question of what we will do about our addiction to foreign oil  andy revkin in essence , each candidate , and mr gore , has recognized that humancaused climate change , on its own , is unlikely to capture americans attention and must be bundled in a threepronged package , with energy security and national security mr gore s mantra , like that of , is ending coal burning in a hurry in making oil his prime focus , mr obama has chosen a path that embraced enthusiastically  without a doubt , this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet it s also a threat that goes to the very heart of who we are as a nation , and who we will be will we be the generation that leaves our children a planet in decline , or a world that is clean , and safe , and thriving \? will we allow ourselves to be held hostage to the whims of tyrants and dictators who control the world s oil wells \? or will we control our own energy and our own destiny \? will america watch as the clean energy jobs and industries of the future flourish in countries like spain , japan , or germany \? or will we create them here , in the greatest country on earth , with the most talented , productive workers in the world \? as americans , we know the answers to these questions we know that we cannot sustain a future powered by a fuel that is rapidly disappearing not when we purchase 700 million worth of oil every single day from some the world s most unstable and hostile nations middle eastern regimes that will control nearly all of the world s oil by 2030 not when the rapid growth of countries like china and india mean that we re consuming more of this dwindling resource faster than we ever imagined we know that we can t sustain this kind of future but we also know that we ve been talking about this issue for decades we ve heard promises about energy independence from every single president since richard nixon we ve heard talk about curbing the use of fossil fuels in state of the union addresses since the oil embargo of 1973 back then , we imported about a third of our oil now , we import more than half back then , global warming was the theory of a few scientists now , it is a fact that is melting our glaciers and setting off dangerous weather patterns as we speak then , the technology and innovation to create new sources of clean , affordable , renewable energy was a generation away today , you can find it in the research labs of this university and in the design centers of this state s legendary auto industry it s in the chemistry labs that are laying the building blocks for cheaper , more efficient solar panels , and it s in the reborn factories that are churning out more wind turbines every day all across this country despite all this , here we are , in another election , still talking about our oil addiction still more dependent than ever why \? you won t hear me say this too often , but i couldn t agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago he said , our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making , and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think longterm about the future of the country what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years , he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time , he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis , it s important to remember that he s been a part of that failure now , after years of inaction , and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices , the only energy proposal he s really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan , and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the longterm challenge of energy independence  andy revkin congress will probably remain the biggest hurdle for the energy policies of either mr mccain or mr obama experts say the deeply embedded nature of hidden and notsohidden subsidies for the fuels of convenience , coal and oil , was built by both democrats and republicans touches on this hard reality in a video interview from last year  george bush s own energy department has said that if we opened up new areas to drilling today , we wouldn t see a single drop of oil for seven years seven years and senator mccain knows that , which is why he admitted that his plan would only provide psychological relief to consumers he also knows that if we opened up and drilled on every single square inch of our land and our shores , we would still find only three percent of the world s oil reserves three percent for a country that uses 25 percent of the world s oil even texas oilman boone pickens , who s calling for major new investments in alternative energy , has said , this is one emergency we can t drill our way out of now , increased domestic oil exploration certainly has its place as we make our economy more fuelefficient and transition to other , renewable , americanmade sources of energy but it is not the solution it is a political answer of the sort washington has given us for three decades there are genuine ways in which we can provide some shortterm relief from high gas prices relief to the mother who s cutting down on groceries because of gas prices , or the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job and can t even afford to drive around and look for a new one i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a 1 , 000 energy rebate , and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now  i also believe that in the shortterm , as we transition to renewable energy , we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but haven t touched and if they don t , we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will we should invest in the technology that can help us recover more from existing oil fields , and speed up the process of recovering oil and gas resources in shale formations in montana and north dakota texas and arkansas and in parts of the west and central gulf of mexico we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude , which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks over the next five years , we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline , delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process   andy revkin environmentalists have nearly all sided with mr obama as a candidate , but could well turn on him should he press some of the choices he outlines here the national petroleum reserve , on the opposite end of the north slope from the arctic national wildlife refuge , despite having a name that sounds more like a tank farm and while expanded use of natural gas can provided a valuable bridge toward nonpolluting energy choices , according to many experts , those darned , backyard by backyard , particularly in crowded regions of the country someone recently told me that if you love wind power , you have to at least like transmission lines the same goes for natural gas can a president exert sufficient leadership to create the infrastructure necessary for an energy transformation \? we ll see  but the truth is , none of these steps will come close to seriously reducing our energy dependence in the longterm we simply cannot pretend , as senator mccain does , that we can drill our way out of this problem we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions we have to make a serious , nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away last week , washington finally made some progress on this a group of democrat and republican senators sat down and came up with a compromise on energy that includes many of the proposals i ve worked on as a senator and many of the steps i ve been calling for on this campaign it s a plan that would invest in renewable fuels and batteries for fuelefficient cars , help automakers retool , and make a real investment in renewable sources of energy like all compromises , this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling , and while i still don t believe that s a particularly meaningful shortterm or longterm solution , i am willing to consider it if it s necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and yet , while the compromise is a good first step and a good faith effort , i believe that we must go even further , and here s why breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly , and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration , it will likely require us to defer some other priorities  it is also a transformation that will require more than just a few government programs energy independence will require an allhandsondeck effort from america effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs from businesses and from every american citizen factories will have to retool and redesign businesses will need to find ways to emit less carbon dioxide all of us will need to buy more of the fuelefficient cars built by this state , and find new ways to improve efficiency and save energy in our own homes and businesses  this will not be easy and it will not happen overnight and if anyone tries to tell you otherwise , they are either fooling themselves or trying to fool you but i know we can do this we can do this because we are americans we do the improbable we beat great odds we rally together to meet whatever challenge stands in our way that s what we ve always done and it s what we must do now for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , we must end the age of oil in our time creating a new energy economy isn t just a challenge to meet , it s an opportunity to seize an opportunity that will create new businesses , new industries , and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that can t be outsourced good , union jobs for a state that has lost so many and struggled so much in recent years , this is an opportunity to rebuild and revive your economy as your wonderful governor has said , any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming , just think jobs for michigan' you are seeing the potential already already , there are 50 , 000 jobs in your clean energy sector and 300 companies but now is the time to accelerate that growth , both here and across the nation  andy revkin there s been a nonstop chorus of talk lately about the job boom that will come with an energy makeover what is a green job , anyway \? the columbia journalism review recently published a useful piece examining the reality , of course , is that a transformation of this sort comes with costs as well as opportunities \( pdf alert \) reflects this , as does his line above saying this will be costly  if i am president , i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single , overarching goal in ten years , we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela to do this , we will invest 150 billion over the next ten years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates five million new american jobs there are three major steps i will take to achieve this goal steps that will yield real results by the end of my first term in office first , we will help states like michigan build the fuelefficient cars we need , and we will get one million 150 milepergallon plugin hybrids on our roads within six years   andy revkin of course , moving some of the car fleet to electricity is simply transferring from oil to coal , which still provides half of the country s electricity , unless there is a dramatic shift in the generation mix , as well mr obama has a plan to build five power plants burning coal but capturing emissions \( see below \) to help limit the greenhouse impact from electrical generation but few energy experts put much hope in at the billiontonayear scale , which would be necessary for the atmosphere to take note  i know how much the auto industry and the auto workers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so but i also know where i want the fuelefficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan , not in china , but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan we can do this when i arrived in washington , i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise the mileage standards in our cars for the first time in 30 years a plan that won support from democrats and republicans who had never supported raising fuel standards before i also led the bipartisan effort to invest in the technology necessary to build plugin hybrid cars as president , i will accelerate those efforts to meet our urgent need with technology we have on the shelf today , we will raise our fuel mileage standards four percent every year we ll invest more in the research and development of those plugin hybrids , specifically focusing on the battery technology we ll leverage private sector funding to bring these cars directly to american consumers , and we ll give consumers a 7 , 000 tax credit to buy these vehicles but most importantly , i ll provide 4 billion in loans and tax credits to american auto plants and manufacturers so that they can retool their factories and build these cars that s how we ll not only protect our auto industry and our auto workers , but help them thrive in a 21st century economy  andy revkin a better car battery , and new at large scale , are keys to moving away from conventional energy sources , many experts say as a spur to get innovators focused on new battery technologies a prize worked for england in pursuit of a reliable way to , so  what s more , these efforts will lead to an explosion of innovation here in michigan at the turn of the 20th century , there were literally hundreds of car companies offering a wide choice of steam vehicles and gas engines i believe we are entering a similar era of expanding consumer choices , from higher mileage cars , to new electric entrants like gm s volt , to flex fuel cars and trucks powered by biofuels and driven by michigan innovation the second step i ll take is to require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now to meet these goals , we will invest more in the clean technology research and development that s occurring in labs and research facilities all across the country and right here at msu , where you re working with farm owners to develop this state s wind potential and developing nanotechnology that will make solar cells cheaper i ll also extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power , solar power , and geothermal energy it was because of this credit that wind power grew 45 percent last year , the largest growth in history experts have said that michigan has the second best potential for wind generation and production in the entire country and as the world s largest producer of the material that makes solar panels work , this tax credit would also help states like michigan grow solar industries that are already creating hundreds of new jobs we ll also invest federal resources , including tax incentives and government contracts , into developing next generation biofuels by 2022 , i will make it a goal to have 6 billion gallons of our fuel come from sustainable , affordable biofuels and we ll make sure that we have the infrastructure to deliver that fuel in place here in michigan , you re actually a step ahead of the game with your firstever commercial cellulosic ethanol plant , which will lead the way by turning wood into cleanburning fuel it s estimated that each new advanced biofuels plant can add up to 120 jobs , expand a local town s tax base by 70 million per year , and boost local household income by 67 million annually in addition , we ll find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste and we ll invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal , america s most abundant energy source , with the goal of creating five firstofakind coalfired demonstration plants with carbon capture and sequestration   andy revkin here , mr obama faces the hard reality that coal is not going away , and he like coal companies , many environmental groups , and almost all politicians embraces the prospect of , too by capturing the co2 and pumping it into the earth building five largescale demonstration plants is a step in the direction outlined in the report from the massachusetts institute of technology but some energy experts say it s a pipe dream to think this can ever happen at the billiontonayear scale that would be needed for it to be meaningful in the climate equation  of course , too often , the problem is that all of this new energy technology never makes it out of the lab and onto the market because there s too much risk and too much cost involved in starting commercialscale clean energy businesses so we will remove some of this cost and this risk by directing billions in loans and capital to entrepreneurs who are willing to create clean energy businesses and clean energy jobs right here in america as we develop new sources of energy and electricity , we will also need to modernize our national utility grid so that it s accommodating to new sources of power , more efficient , and more reliable that s an investment that will also create hundreds of thousands of jobs , and one that i will make as president  finally , the third step i will take is to call on businesses , government , and the american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade this is by far the fastest , easiest , and cheapest way to reduce our energy consumption and it will save us 130 billion on our energy bills since dupont implemented an energy efficiency program in 1990 , the company has significantly reduced its pollution and cut its energy bills by 3 billion the state of california has implemented such a successful efficiency strategy that while electricity consumption grew 60 in this country over the last three decades , it didn t grow at all in california there is no reason america can t do the same thing we will set a goal of making our new buildings 50 percent more efficient over the next four years and we ll follow the lead of california and change the way utilities make money so that their profits aren t tied to how much energy we use , but how much energy we save in just ten years , these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east along with the capandtrade program i ve proposed , we will reduce our dangerous carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050 and slow the warming of our planet and we will create five million new jobs in the process if these sound like faroff goals , just think about what we can do in the next few years one million plugin hybrid cars on the road doubling our energy from clean , renewable sources like wind power or solar power and 2 billion gallons of affordable biofuels new buildings that 50 percent more energy efficient so there is a real choice in this election a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet senator mccain would not take the steps or achieve the goals that i outlined today his plan invests very little in renewable sources of energy and he s opposed helping the auto industry retool like george bush and dick cheney before him , he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems , and like them , he s found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact , he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month , most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling in a room full of cheering oil executives his initial reaction to the bipartisan energy compromise was to reject it because it took away tax breaks for oil companies and even though he doesn t want to spend much on renewable energy , he s actually proposed giving 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 12 billion to exxonmobil this is a corporation that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that , last quarter , made 1 , 500 every second that s more than 300 , 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas that s costing you more than 4agallon and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money , he wants to give them more so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain , and if he wins , they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy well that s not the future i see for america i will not pretend the goals i laid out today aren t ambitious they are i will not pretend we can achieve them without cost , or without sacrifice , or without the contribution of almost every american citizen but i will say that these goals are possible and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the 21st century i want you all to think for a minute about the next four years , and even the next 10 years we can continue down the path we ve been traveling we can keep making small , piecemeal investments in renewable energy and keep sending billions of our hardearned dollars to oil company executives and middle eastern dictators we can watch helplessly as the price of gas rises and falls because of some foreign crisis we have no control over , and uncover every single barrel of oil buried beneath this country only to realize that we don t have enough for a few years , let alone a century we can watch other countries create the industries and the jobs that will fuel our future , and leave our children a planet that grows more dangerous and unlivable by the day or we can choose another future we can decide that we will face the realities of the 21st century by building a 21st century economy in just a few years , we can watch cars that run on a plugin battery come off the same assembly lines that once produced the first ford and the first chrysler we can see shuttered factories open their doors to manufacturers that sell wind turbines and solar panels that will power our homes and our businesses we can watch as millions of new jobs with good pay and good benefits are created for american workers , and we can take pride as the technologies , and discoveries , and industries of the future flourish in the united states of america we can lead the world , secure our nation , and meet our moral obligations to future generations this is the choice that we face in the months ahead this is the challenge we must meet this is the opportunity we must seize and this may be our last chance to seize it and if it seems too difficult or improbable , i ask you to think about the struggles and the challenges that past generations have overcome think about how world war ii forced us to transform a peacetime economy still climbing out of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents and when president roosevelt s advisers informed him that his goals for wartime production were impossible to meet , he waved them off and said believe me , the production people can do it if they really try and they did think about when the scientists and engineers told john f kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon , he told them they would find a way and we found one remember how we trained a generation for a new , industrial economy by building a nationwide system of public high schools how we laid down railroad tracks and highways across an entire continent how we pushed the boundaries of science and technology to unlock the very building blocks of human life i ask you to draw hope from the improbable progress this nation has made and look to the future with confidence that we too can meet the great test of our time i ask you to join me , in november and in the years to come , to ensure that we will not only control our own energy , but once again control our own destiny , and forge a new and better future for the country that we love thank you
last week , misty upham was working at a caf and laundromat in culver city , calif , making sandwiches and folding clothes into smooth , square bundles on tuesday , she was walking the red carpet at the gotham independent film awards in new york , standing next to sir ben kingsley in a cascade of camera flashes , and chatting with the press about her role in frozen river , the best feature winner that night that performance , her first major role in a film \( she was in skins , 2002 \) , earned a best supporting female nod at the independent spirit award nominations the same day it has been a surreal month for ms upham , 26 reached via cell phone in brooklyn thursday night , she said the mix of hollywood glitz , a lowkey day job and visits to her family home on a black foot indian reservation in montana has made her head spin i stop sometimes and look at the palm trees and the ocean and beverly hills i have to remind myself what a dream come true this is , she said ms upham noted that she is the first native american actress to be nominated for a spirit award , and an anomaly as a native woman cast in a film that didn t involve moccasins and feathers i responded to that in this role , she said when i looked at the script , my character wasn t an alcoholic , she wasn t 16 and pregnant , wasn t being domestically abused by her husband it was different than the rez stories i was getting she has spent much of her life living on a reservation , in the modest home her grandmother built 40 years ago , surrounded by houses insulated with trash bags it s your typical , poverty stricken , ugly piece of land with no grass or trees there most of her family has never left the reservation , she added , let alone the state of montana but when she was 13 , she , her mother and siblings joined her father in seattle , where taught music at an elementary school there she joined a summer theater group for native american urban youth , and was hooked that s where i discovered the love of acting , she said i was always acting growing up , pretending to be other people this was a way to do it where people wouldn t think you were strange she trained in stage fighting , voice and movement , and began writing her own work five years later , she traveled with another troupe throughout the northwestern us , performing a one woman show that she wrote that role earned her the attention of the los angeles casting director rene haynes , who pitched her for skins , in which she played a victim of domestic violence since then , ms upham appeared in one other film , expiration date \( 2006 \) , and has played characters in television miniseries on pbs and the bbc on thanksgiving , ms upham was back in montana , at her aunt s home , surrounded by her parents , siblings , cousins , uncles and grandparents her family members marveled at the invitation she had received for the noir film festival in turin , italy each of them passed it around and read the entire thing , she said they were just in awe of it , because none of them will ever get to go to italy probably in their whole lives it has been a year of firsts in rapid succession for ms upham the first time living alone , balancing a checkbook , riding in a cab , seeing new york city and , on friday , flying to italy she plans to go all out and ski for the first time as well \( in the alps , no less \) i ve had to learn a lot of things , she said i ve discovered that i m extremely sheltered in an embarrassing way , so it s been kind of scary at times
when the pianist marcus roberts recorded deep in the shed , his second album , at the close of the 1980s , he was best known as a sideman with wynton marsalis in some ways the album seemed a natural outgrowth of the marsalis credo it was an earnest and selfconscious meditation on the blues , composed and loosely organized in suite form implicit in the music was an assertion that the blues is serious business , better understood as a feeling than as a form and though he was trafficking in traditions , mr roberts , then in his late 20s , made the argument feel contemporary as well as personal \( he had learned a lot from mr marsalis , who appeared pseudonymously on the album \) these days deep in the shed , originally released on rca , is out of print and unavailable on itunes or

qiandao lake , china when igor grinko , a former soviet coach with an impressive r sum , agreed to take over the chinese rowing team four years ago , olympic officials outlined their expectations with a simple equation one gold equals 1 , 000 silvers silver \? it means nothing here you might as well finish last , grinko said coaches like me come , help them win gold medals , or we are fired in anticipation of china s debut as an olympic host , officials here have seized the opportunity to prove their country is a world power in sports rowing is at the heart of china s plan to capture , for the first time , more gold medals than any other nation at the olympic games grinko , 62 , called it a priority for the chinese to focus on sports like rowing that offer many gold medals , unlike basketball and soccer the summer games in beijing include 14 rowing events 14 chances to for china to win gold and prove itself on home soil china has spent millions perhaps billions on personnel and infrastructure to accelerate growth in medalrich sports in which it has had little success about 20 prominent foreigners , including grinko , have been hired to coach national teams in various sports , and more are coaching in provinces that feed those teams they are doing some crazy things to win gold medals , and they believe they will win many , said grinko , who was also a united states national team coach from 1991 to 2000 us \? russia \? some other countries \? no problem to beat them this is their thinking grinko , a grayhaired , steelblueeyed master of corny jokes that fall flat with the chinese , is known for his brutal training regimen his favorite word is suffer , he said with a goofy laugh in the nine years before grinko joined the united states team , his soviet rowers won 14 olympic and world championship medals , including eight gold here , he is the uncompromising leader of the magnificent 10 million governmentfinanced athletic complex on the banks of what is called thousand island lake this spring , the new york times was granted rare access to this training ground , including its 11story main building , which rises from orange groves surrounded by mountains about 250 miles southwest of shanghai china has won four medals in rowing , none gold , since its first olympics in 1932 but suddenly , in a sport unfamiliar to most chinese , the rowers have become a team to beat at the beijing games china has qualified more boats than all but 4 of the 57 countries on the olympic rowing roster so far since 2006 , chinese rowers have won 18 gold medals at world championships and world cup events , more than double the number of victories in the previous three years at a world cup regatta last year in amsterdam , china stunned some leading teams by taking home 10 medals it won five golds in the 14 events contested in the olympics some rivals say they became suspicious because the rowers had improved so fast , and because over the last 20 years , chinese athletes had been snared in widespread doping scandals after amsterdam , grinko s cellphone began ringing your team must be doping , grinko recalled former rowing colleagues telling him what kind of drugs are they on \? mike teti , the coach of the united states men s rowing team , said , we know they are cheating , but there s nothing we can do about it but cui dalin , the vice minister of the general administration of sport of china , insisted that the host team would be clean , very clean eight years ago , as china was vying to win its bid for the olympics , officials like cui began a governmentfinanced effort called the 119 project its purpose was to improve performances in the medalheavy sports track and field , swimming , rowing , canoe kayak and sailing in which the chinese have been weak the plan was named after the 119 gold medals awarded in those sports at that time other nations' olympic committees also attempt to win medals by allocating extra resources to certain sports but none have been as elaborate , well financed and daunting as china s plan no secrets , no mysteries going on here , grinko said in a heavy russian accent they 're just doing this like the east germans did in the 1970s and '80s china has never come close to winning the overall medal count at the summer games , a crown the united states has worn since 1996 in 2004 , the united states had 102 medals , followed by russia with 92 and china with 63 gold told a different story china was second with 32 , four behind the united states that slim margin has been the catalyst for this push toward gold , chinese officials said many officials on the olympic committee and sports federations spoke anonymously because they had not received approval to comment with a population of 13 billion about four times larger than that of the united states china has a pool of thousands with the coordination , endurance and power needed for rowing before the 119 project , about 380 fulltime rowers trained with government support today , about 1 , 200 do liu aijie , the vice president of the water sports administration , called it a must for china to win its first olympic gold medal in rowing at home i would be shocked if they did n't win at least a few gold medals , said ed hewitt , a former united states national team rower who runs the web site but eight years is not enough time to build a dominating program , he said even a few golds would be monumental the top performers in rowing in the 2004 games were romania with three golds and germany with two the united states won one rowing gold since then , the united states olympic committee s strategy has been to focus on sports in which americans have had some success , like fencing , triathlon , archery and some disciplines in shooting and rowing , said steve roush , the chief of sport performance for the committee the usoc , which spends about 130 million annually to support its athletes , also earmarked money for bmx racing and track cycling roush still worries he visited chinese sports schools , where children take their first steps to becoming gold medalists he has seen china s resolve the usoc also focuses on sports with many medal opportunities , but roush is aware that china s teams will be powerful in beijing it s frightening to think about what they might do , he said with a glass of red wine in hand , igor grinko stood on a balcony outside his room , high above this sprawling , clear lake he marveled at what the chinese had built gigantic olympic rings are affixed to a dock here , a reminder of what is at stake the complex is home to 70 rowers and about 10 coaches , more than 100 boats , a cafeteria , a medical clinic and a lab there is spotty internet service and no television cellphones are the lifeline to faraway families and friends i would like to put photos on the walls , but it is forbidden , said gao yulan , an olympic favorite in the women s pair when i was young , this was a very difficult life , but you learn to adjust everybody has to work this is just my job gao , 25 , is a typical rower here , taller than 6 feet , longlimbed and lean she began training full time when she was 13 , leaving her parents , who are vegetable farmers in jiangxi province , to become a javelin thrower at 17 , she was moved to rowing , just as beijing was awarded the games through an interpreter , gao said she dreamed of becoming a fashion designer wearing highheeled boots with hot pants and a spaghettistrapped top asked about her motivation to train , gao bit her lip for fame , reputation and honor \? she said as the interpreter spoke , gao glanced at grinko , who nodded in approval grinko said she would be a farmer if not for rowing like the others , gao wakes before dawn for 6 30 practice , then breakfast at lunch and dinner , she takes an aluminum cafeteria tray and scoops food from a buffet of dishes like chicken feet , tofu with cabbage , and porkfilled sticky buns no drinks not even water two more practices are followed by naps , when the building falls silent the day ends with lights out at 10 pm while coaching american rowers , grinko won only an olympic silver in 1996 and a world championship bronze in 1993 but for 33 years as a rower and coach he was a good fit in the soviet system , as he is in this authoritarian system here , athletes follow orders without question , he said grinko said he had everything he needed , including doctors , massage therapists and biochemists to analyze the rowers' blood weekly for factors like testosterone and hemoglobin levels , which rise and fall with training those results monitor effort , and help determine the effectiveness of workouts because his living expenses are covered , grinko said , his 90 , 000 annual salary , after taxes , comes out to much more than he earned in the united states in 2000 , his final year with us rowing , he made 72 , 300 before taxes , according to government records hartmut buschbacher , a former national team rowing coach for east germany and the united states who now works in shandong province , said china could hire better coaches , buy better boats and prepare athletes the united states government , which gives no money directly to the usoc , does not support its olympians the way it should , buschbacher said if you are surprised at how good the chinese have gotten , then i think you should come here and watch them train and see this place , he said at the complex if you think this is not going to lead to performance , then i'm sorry , you are stupid you are kidding yourself american rowers and coaches said it was hard to ignore the recent chinese surge they 've come out of nowhere and keep getting better , said megan dirkmaat of the united states team tom terhaar , the american women s coach , said they are like robots with all the resources they could ever ask for does that scare me \? sure it does the american and chinese programs are drastically different in this olympic year , about 60 united states rowers receive monthly stipends of 1 , 200 from the usoc last winter , they trained together for about four months , all expenses paid , but for the most part , they pay their own way some , like matt muffelman , work part time he is an associate at the home depot in ewing , nj , where he answers gardening questions like , are those mums squirrelproof \? and where is the mulch \? in nonolympic years , most united states rowers work full time or attend school , often following training schedules prepared by coaches who live elsewhere some stop rowing bryan volpenhein won a gold medal in the men s eight at the 2004 olympics , then moved to seattle for culinary school , preparing for what he called real life now 31 , he returned last spring to the national team s base in princeton , nj , where it rents boathouse spacesome rowers live communally , but volpenhein housesits for a professor for meals , they fend for themselves fritz hagerman , an exercise physiologist for the americans , conducts tests on the rowers twice a year we 're not deprived in any way , but , no , we 're not china , he said i find what they do invasive , and our rowers would , too so far , our results show we are ahead of them zhou qinian , a chinese coach , bristled when asked to compare his system with the americans' after one practice , zhou shouted , the americans train harder ! he refused interviews grinko told the reporter zhou thinks you are a spy for the american team he said you were here to steal our secrets when grinko arrived here in 2004 , the practices were monotonous and unproductive he called the rowers more like soldiers than athletes and slow , like elephants , but strong the coaching was primitive and punitive grinko recalled seeing a coach kick a woman in the leg for not training hard enough the first thing i told them was , do n't touch my rowers ever again , ' he said he soon became an integral player in their selfcontained world even on holidays , rowers remain with their surrogate family some hail from provinces like liaoning , 1 , 700 miles northeast , or guangdong , 500 miles southwest it is too far and too costly even for zheng chuanqi , the son of peasant wheat farmers , to go home to neighboring anhui province , seven hours away by bus it is lonely and sad sometimes after so many years of training away from your family , said zheng , his muscles chiseled by nine years of rowing zheng wanted to quit three years ago , but grinko coaxed him to stay by saying olympic gold would bring scholarship offers from american universities it s the fatigue that accumulates , zheng , 24 , said not physically , but mentally it s very difficult to keep going as zheng s thickly calloused hands carried his boat to the dock , his head drooped and his shoulders slumped he and his teammates , who are generally ages 20 to 26 , had been rowing full time , seven days a week , for an average of seven years this grueling sport engages every muscle a hard practice means pain legs burning , arms numb , lungs afire grinko now gives them sundays off he knew they would have great potential coaches use tests to determine how tall , strong and fast children will be , then place them in appropriate sports many athletes who failed in other endurance sports ended up in rowing whether they liked it or not when they said i should try it , i said , rowing , what is that \? ' said li tong , 19 , a former triathlete from beijing whose twin sister also rows their mother is a retired basketball player , and their father is a retired soldier rowing is simple to learn , not so difficult like gymnastics , grinko said he teaches better technique and improved efficiency motivating athletes is harder this is their work , and they have no choice but to stay , he said this is not their passion it is just a business convincing his rowers that olympic triumph would bring honor to their country was a challenge until officials sweetened the reward historically , no sporting event was more important in china than the national games , which pit teams from the 23 provinces against one another every four years in the year after the summer olympics the national games carry unparalleled glory , honor and financial gain a gold medal can lead to a car , a furnished apartment and elevated social status for athletes and their families one rower in fujian province , wang shujuan , a 1993 world champion , came out of retirement and left her 5yearold daughter behind to try for a national games medal my province has lots of world champions , but not that many national games champions , wang , 37 , said that means a lot more at the fujian water sports center , the provincial coach sean hall , a former american olympian , said that mentality was the major obstacle to the chinese quest to win more olympic gold the biggest problem with a rower going to train with the national team was that they did n't get extra money for it , hall said the provinces paid their salaries and had all the money so why would the rowers want to leave the province and risk losing their jobs \? one fujian official said some provinces award each national games champion a 43 , 000 bonus , about 25 times an average factory worker s annual salary a fujian rower s monthly allowance ranges from 1 , 430 for former national games gold medalists to as little as 143 gold medalists at the athens olympics received about 29 , 000 from the government , officials said provinces used to go out of their way to keep their rowers from being promoted to the national team , grinko said , sometimes faking injuries like serious head problems chinese officials had to convince province leaders that success in the olympics would benefit them , too so they devised an award system whereby every olympic gold medalist at the 2004 athens games would get an extra gold at the next year s national games for beijing , two extra national golds will be awarded to the athlete s province for every olympic gold won hall said the provinces were finally coming around in america , the athletes are n't automatons , saying , we want money , we want money , ' he said but you can kind of understand it here , it falls on a kid s shoulders to support the parents when the parents are dirt poor , hungry , working on a farm or in a factory , can you imagine what the pressure is like to do well \? a series of doping scandals scarred the chinese sports system more than 30 swimmers failed drug tests at international events in the 1990s china kept seven rowers , including the current olympian zhang xiuyun , home from the 2000 sydney games after their blood tests indicated use of the blood booster epo , officials said they would have tested positive at the olympics it is still a sore point at the olympic committee headquarters in beijing , cui , the vice minister , said the government had since worked to eradicate doping in 2004 , china passed an antidoping law and later increased testing of athletes who would benefit most from performanceenhancing drugs china is not actually the first country that used drugs , cui said it has come from western countries sports programs will be held accountable , cui said if two or more athletes in a sport fail drug tests , that sport will be eliminated from next year s national games grinko said he had been warned that anyone involved in doping would be sent to prison his rowers say they are clean but others wonder about the past pan yuenan , a former rower who translates for hall , said she and her fujian teammates were given intravenous drugs before the 2005 national games the label on the iv bag said it would build muscle fiber , that it would make our muscles longer , pan said we asked the doctor to tell us more about it , but he did not , she added in english i trusted him another rower , sun cui , said the iv was to relax muscles hall recalled officials saying , only glucose , nothing more last spring , chinese officials barred several rowers from a world cup event because of abnormal blood tests grinko blamed the province teams and subsequently stopped his rowers from receiving packages from them but nothing , he said , will stop his team from victory in beijing china has qualified for 9 of the 14 olympic rowing events so far the final qualifying regatta is this month in poland i am told china must show a good face at the olympics , grinko said no doping , just gold medals
errol morris addresses reader responses to his recent post , including discussions about ansel adams , rene magritte and wile e coyote , and a recent interview clip of ron reagan from his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend ellison along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists edgar allan poe , the domain of arnheim reply to , that the perceived reliability of the source plays a primary role in whether we accept something as true 30 august 12th , 2008 11 34 am mr morris , it seems you haven t said anything about the perceived reliability of the source as a primary cause of most people believing in images photos that are pushing a false impression could this be a significant factor in this kind of propaganda \? gene beery an important point the perceived reliability of the source is a significant factor whether it is an individual , a document or a photograph of course , the more important question is why we believe something to be reliable often it comes down to something as simple as trust the trustworthiness of source consider colin powell we trusted him but why \? not just because of his titles secretary of state , exchairman of the joint chiefs we trusted him , the man , the actual man himself many people considered him to be the most trusted member of the bush administration when he presented the evidence for wmd s at the united nations , we trusted the reliability of his evidence because we trusted him  1  often we believe something because someone we trust has seen something or has studied the evidence or has talked to various experts the photographs are grainy and hard to read , but someone has put captions on them , and he is presenting those captions , presumably so we can understand what we re looking at we trust powell , so we accept the truthfulness of the captions , and we accept the truthfulness of the evidence \( visual and otherwise \) that he presents in effect , we believe we have been given proof of something for example , the presence of wmd s when we have been given proof of nothing  trust and faith 2  here are the results of a gallup poll conducted the day before powell s un presentation the poll shows that we trusted colin powell certainly more than george w bush 3 but what is this thing called trust \? is it something that we can depend on \? can we trust trust \? the saddest thing of all is that without trust , civilization would be impossible we can t possibly ever know everything through firsthand experience we can t check everything nor hold everything up to scrutiny we have to depend on others for information in some cases , the dependence on others is not critical in others , it is of crucial importance eventually , the truth about wmd s bobbed up onto the surface of reality , but it was the high esteem in which powell was held the 63 percent trust recorded in the gallup poll that led people to unquestioningly accept the truth of what he was saying without additional information i went to the oxford english dictionary and looked up trust i found a quote from shakespeare s a winter s tale 1 a confidence in or reliance on some quality or attribute of a person or thing , or the truth of a statement const in \( of , on , upon , to , unto \) 1611 shakes wint t iv iv 607 ha , ha , what a foole honestie is ! and trust \( his sworne brother \) a very simple gentleman and then a quote from james howell s letters much to my surprise , eyewitness evidence and trust pop up once again , as if they are siamese twins 2 b take on or upon trust \( receive , take up in trust , take up upon trust \) , to accept or give credit to without investigation or evidence 4  c1645 howell lett \( 1650 \) i 67 eyewitnesses of those things which others receive but in trust to christopher jones , esq , at gray sinn from naples honoured father , i must still style you so , since i was adopted your son by so good a mother as oxford believe it , sir , that one year well employed abroad by one of mature judgment \( which you know i want very much \) advantageth more in point of useful and solid knowledge than three in any of our universities you know running waters are the purest , so they that traverse the world up and down have the clearest understanding , whereunto they must yield an intuitive consent , and a kind of implicit faith it s the oed second definition of trust \( 2 b \) that is relevant here to accept something without investigation or evidence howell contrasts lifeexperience and academic scholarship one year \( employed abroad \) vs three \( in any of our universities \) 5 this is followed by an analogy with observation and trust \( is one eyewitness observation worth three times as much as something learned in trust \? \) if we are not faithful eyewitnesses to something , then we must receive it in trust and a kind of implicit faith he is disparaging academic knowledge \( the passage in howell reminds me of chapter one of descartes discourse on the method , published in 1637 , and indeed descartes may have influenced howell \) howell s letters appeared in 1645 powell spoke to the un general assembly in 2003 , more than 350 years later but similar sentiments are at work as in the 17th century , we give particular credence to evidence provided by people we trust the gallup poll tells us that we trusted powell , but in addition powell supplied captioned photographs as evidence  we can agree that the photographic evidence was only part of colin powell s un argument , but it still plays a significant role it certainly could be argued that the results of the gallup poll were such that all the administration needed to sell its policies was colin powell s appearance nothing more notwithstanding , the appeal to experts and the use of photographs gave his presentation added heft it added what appeared to be real evidence but why do we trust photographs \? my guess is photography is trusted because vision is trusted when we look at something in a photograph even a grainy photograph that has been captioned we forget we are looking at a photograph , and imagine we are looking at the thing itself 6  but why do we trust our eyes \? reply to , the claim that maybe bigfoot took a photo of himself 31 august 12th , 2008 11 50 am am i the only one who sees big foot in that photo \? maybe big foot came out of the northwest forests and took a photo of himself he could do that now , you know , what with modern technology and all posted by iris why is the advent of modern technology relevant here \? all bigfoot needs is a cablerelease for his camera shutter here are two photographs of erich salomon , the father of candid photography in the first photograph , he is holding a cablerelease attached to his beloved ermanox 8 the picture has been taken by someone else , but in the second photograph , he is triggering the camera shutter with a cable release it is a selfportrait \( 1935 \) of the photographer standing next to his son , otto salomon , at the savoy in london is this photograph the first selfportrait accomplished with a cable release \? \( bigfoot might have been familiar with salomon s selfportrait \) reply to , the claim that ansel adams retouched his work often , and that the rules are different for artists 112 august 18th , 2008 7 49 pm i am a photojournalist and art photographer ansel adams retouched his work often one example that he mentions in his autobiography is the photo called winter sunrise , lone pine , ca but he was an artist , and the rules are different for artists posted by bernard here is adams s account that appears in his examples the making of 40 photographs 9  i set up my camera on my car platform at what i felt was the best location , overlooking a pasture it was very cold perhaps near zero and i waited shivering , for a shaft of sunlight to flow over the distant trees a horse grazing in the frosty pasture stood facing away from me with exasperation , stolid persistence i made several exposures of moments of light and shadow , but the horse was uncooperative , resembling a distant stump i observed the final shaft of light approaching at the last moment the horse turned to show its profile , and i made the exposure within a minute the entire area was flooded with sunlight and the natural chiaroscuro was gone i used my 8 10 ansco view camera with the 23inch component of my cooke series xv lens with a wratten no 15 \( g \) filter the film was isopan , developed in kodak d23 the negative is rather complex to print it is a problem of agreeable balance between the brilliant snow on the peaks and the dark shadowed hills the enterprising youth of the lone pine high school had climbed the rocky slopes of the alabama hills and whitewashed a huge white l p the letters l and p for the world to see it is a hideous and insulting scar on one of the great vistas of our land , and shows in every photograph made of the area i ruthlessly removed what i could of the l p from the negative \( in the lefthand hill \) , and have always spotted out any remaining trace in the print i have been criticized by some for doing this , but i am not enough of a purist to perpetuate the scar and thereby destroy for me , at least the extraordinary beauty and perfection of the scene adams tells us what was planned , what was orchestrated and what was inadvertent first , adams waited for exactly the right moment , the foreground hill was not completely in shadows , the despised l p the letters was still clearly visible , and the horse was faced away from the camera and wouldn t budge in effect , his camera was fixed on the horse s ass he could only hope that the horse would turn at the right moment and present itself in profile today , by its own strictures the national geographic would refuse to publish this photograph one of the greatest in the history of american photography 10 it has been faked , altered , tampered with but is it not a spectacular image \? 11  i heard about the l p from dennis purcell , who had worked making prints for adams one of his jobs was to remove the l p from the prints \( the negative was not altered until the 70 s \) made from the winter sunrise negative and so he had firsthand knowledge of the l p and the techniques used to remove it dennis purcell the sunlight struck the horse at exactly the right moment that didn t always happen one of the ways that ansel got all of those amazing light effects and cloud effects is that he just haunted the places tourists would never get it because they only go once , and he went many , many times i don t remember the exact details of the taking of the picture but for him it was spoiled by the townspeople they had put the initials of their town l p up on the mountainside in huge , white stones he considered it a flaw and so it was spottedout by people including me working with spottone and a tiny brush , dabbing gently to make it disappear it is very difficult because it is so large it is the largest \( by far \) thing that was ever spottedout of one of his pictures of course , every photograph has dust specks , so you always spot those there are no unretouched negatives because of dust getting in the system you have white specks and you touch them out every picture is spotted when i was there in 1962 he was working with polaroid type 55 negative film that was just in its infancy often there were 10 , 000 specks to be removed errol morris good lord ! dennis purcell everything had to be spotted in some sense , the l p is part of the image but it is outside the image as one wants it if almost every print has specks that have to be spotted , when is it ok to spot something out \? is a dustspot ok , but not the l p \? and furthermore , what does it mean to say the l p is outside the image , as one wants it \? clearly , it was outside the image , as ansel adams wanted it , but i found myself starting to like it em dennis purcell it is very hard to spot accurately , and i can see it in reproduced images of this photograph because i know where to look and once you see it , it s unmistakable you can t stop seeing it you can t really make it disappear people who think that photographs were not retouched and are therefore more pure that s just not right it would take a good halfhour to remove the l p , and then because of the gloss of the spottone , you never really got it out of there if you looked at in the right light you could see something there it was not possible to do a perfect job errol morris and this is on prints not on the negative \? dennis purcell on the prints on the negative the white stones are dark , so how do you get that out of there \? to remove silver from a negative , mechanically , is very difficult there is a process called etching you use a very sharp exacto knife and rub it perpendicular to the surface if you do it very , very carefully you can actually shave down the layer of silver 12  13   hermon joyner , on the blog focus on photography , writes , ansel made the image and spent a number of years dealing with it after the fact in his words , i ruthlessly removed what i could of the l p from the negative \( in the lefthand hill \) , and have always spotted out any remaining trace in the print when i took a workshop from john sexton in 1987 , he related the story that ansel gave him the job of scraping the l p out of the 8by10 negative with a scalpel , when john was ansel s assistant in the 70 s on the face of things , this account isn t all that different from what digital photographers do every day , cloning out offensive elements from their images to make them a better representative of what they saw and felt and it s a good way to control things beyond your control when you shoot the l p was ruthlessly removed from the negative to use adams s phrase and the positive prints no longer have to be corrected but is there still something that shows up on the positive prints some shadow , something that suggests that the negative was altered 14 \? commenter 112 writes that ansel adams was an artist , and the rules are different for artists that ansel adams had a perfect right to alter the negative it s his negative , isn t it \? but wait a second \? what rules are these \? and how are they different \? is 112 claiming that ansel adams is an artist and that artists can do whatever they want \? the exacto knife is ok for an artist but not ok for a photojournalist well then , who is an artist \? and under what circumstances \? in 1943 through 1944 ansel adams was working as a photojournalist creating images for his book manzanar , on the japaneseamerican internment camp just outside of lone pine winter sunrise was taken during that period is he a photojournalist one day and an artist the next \? this hour but not that hour \? one minute but not another \? ultimately , it depends on how the photograph is going to be perceived , where it is going to appear and who is going to look at it , whether it is to be used for evidence , and evidence of what  15  adams was trying to create a more perfect landscape other artists have argued that natural landscapes are imperfect and can be improved it is the theme of poe s story the domain of arnheim 16  no such combination of scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce no such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of claude 17 in the most enchanting of natural landscapes there will always be found a defect or an excess many excesses and defects while the component parts may defy , individually , the highest skill of the artist , the arrangement of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short , no position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth , from which an artistical eye , looking steadily , will not find matter of offence in what is termed the composition of the landscape and yet how unintelligible is this ! in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the colours of the tulip , or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley \? who shall presume \? none other than ellison , the protagonist of the story , who uses his immense inheritance to create the perfect landscape this story is omitted in most scholarly discussions of poe s work , but it may be his greatest story poe himself held it in high esteem he wrote , the domain of arnheim expresses much of my soul and yet , what is the perfect landscape that he imagines \? or is there such a thing \? could nature which is not god , nor an emanation from god , but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god the narrator 18 asks , what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may be really such , as respects only the moral or human point of view each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in the picture , if we can suppose this picture viewed at large in mass from some point distant from the earth s surface , although not beyond the limits of its atmosphere it is easily understood that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail , may at the same time injure a general or more distantly observed effect there may be a class of beings , human once , but now invisible to humanity , to whom , from afar , our disorder may seem order our unpicturesqueness picturesque , in a word , the earthangels , for whose scrutiny more especially than our own , and for whose death refined appreciation of the beautiful , may have been set in array by god the wide landscapegardens of the hemispheres there is something endlessly puzzling about his imagery is the narrator describing something beautiful or horrific 19 \? is this seemingly oneway trip down a river an excursion into paradise or into hell \? is the narrator mad , delusional or hopelessly imprisoned in ellison s odd vision \? is ellison s vision of heaven more terrible than what we might presume to be a vision of hell 20 \? this is the terrible ambiguity of the story that i find endlessly compelling it also brings us back to the vexing question of ansel adams s despised alphabet letters the hideous l and the insulting p dennis purcell says that it was unwanted and so , the removal of the l p is a restoration of the landscape to a more primitive and more pristine state the landscape before the advent of man \( the controversy over the l p also recalls fenton s cannonballs was fenton trying to create a more perfect landscape by arranging the cannonballs \? or to restore the scene to something that he had witnessed in the past \? \) what about the earthangels \? they see things differently from us a stain , a dent or a blemish for one observer may be the fulfillment of some divine edict of perfection for another there may be a class of beings , human once , but not invisible to humanity , to whom , from afar , our disorder may seem order poe s story clearly influenced magritte he made it the subject of several of his paintings and gouaches 21 and created at least nine separate works named the domain of arnheim \( five of them are reproduced below \) 22  i should refrain from any attempt to explain magritte s work isn t the essence of his art an attempt to confound , to create ambiguity without resolution \? much like poe has the granite bird been carved into the ridge \? \( by ellison \? \) are the nest and egg real \? isn t it all just paint on canvas \? 23  a previous version of the domain of arnheim \( yet another painting \) suggests that the landscape has been painted on glass the glass mimicking the scene behind once again , isn t it all just canvas \? the window , no different from the painting \? is there something ultimately imperfect in every attempt to depict reality \? is this the chimera of the perfectionists \? 24  reply to , the claim that my time would have been better spent analyzing the slim pickens job riding the bomb to tehran 114 august 19th , 2008 1 08 am trust me waaaaaaaay too much thought was put into analyzing our coyote picture we were having fun , and trying to make people laugh it seemed to have that effect with most people i personally think that more analysis could be put into the slim pickens job riding the bomb to tehran however , i m flattered our quick work was discussed \) posted by gopyouth gopyouth writes , too much thought has been put into analyzing our coyote picture i had written about the photoshop artist s intentions , but i had no idea about the real intentions of the photoshop artist who created the coyote picture \( haven t i written extensively on this very subject \? that artistic intentions are never displayed in just an image itself \? had i failed to pay attention to what i had already written \? \) 25  clearly , wile e coyote is a metaphor but a metaphor for what \? had i missed the point \? i saw wile e coyote huddled under an orange umbrella a totally ineffective antiballistic shield and assumed that the image was a warning to us about the danger of going to war with iran also , i was curious about gopyouth who is gopyouth \? what did he think the image meant \? and i was curious about the slim pickens image gopyouth , am i just not with it \? who is the person in the lower left hand corner of your slim pickens photomontage \? thanks errol morris  mr morris , thank you for the response to my comment regarding your photography used as weapons discussion your email originally went to my spam folder , so i did not spot it until today i should first apologize for being a bit on the rude side when i made the comment the point i was trying to make was that we were poking fun at the doctored photo of the iranian missiles being launched not a lot of thought went into making them i just wanted to make something funny , outrageous , and quite obvious that it was altered most of the time spent was looking for right photo google was helpful in locating the right star wars and wile e coyote photos i ll be the first to admit that i did not spot the cloned plumes until it was pointed out by the bloggers at little green footballs it wasn t obvious to me , but i wanted to make mine quite obvious i think colorado doug and i met that requirement we weren t specifically working together , but playing off each other s product regarding your discussion , i understand and appreciate what you were discussing i was just very surprised to find a joke image included in a discussion of images meant to portray a deeper message the person who doctored the missile launches was purposefully being deceitful that wasn t the case with us we just like poking fun at the people doctoring and the editors who let the pictures get published we don t even try to be in the same league as adnan hajj or wissam alokaili , although i believe ap reuters afp need to do a much better job in spotting the propaganda 26 some of the photos passing off as real are an insult to anybody who pays attention \( ie , the toy soldier hostage , or any of adnan hajj s photos \) the more it goes on , the quicker people will jump to the conclusion that the editors are knowingly letting the fake photos go to print you asked a question about the slim pickens photo colorado doug cranked that one out , but the person in the bottom right corner is a blend of peter sellers as inspector clouseau \( uniform and hair \) , and mahmoud ahmadinejad as himself \( face \) it was an attempt to get a character from dr strangelove in the picture i think the clouseau picture was a better fit gopyouth ok i was surprised to learn that the man in the left hand corner of the photograph was a composite of ahmadinejad and inspector clouseau \( my guess is that this is the only image in which ahmadinejad , inspector clouseau and slim pickens appear together \) the image struck me a bizarre , and so i arranged to talk to gopyouth directly here was an unparalleled opportunity i discuss ansel adams , edgar allan poe and rene magritte what were they trying to say \? here , i could actually talk to the photoshop artists who created these images gopyouth these were actually done on a blog called free republic 27 as soon as little green footballs pointed out that the plumes had been cloned , that s when someone on free republic posted the article the first image i did , i just cloned all the missiles and had 50someodd missiles shooting off and it kind of took off from there , and everybody started putting his or her own spin on it and this other guy , colorado doug , flipped the missiles and had them coming back down and that s when i got the search on line and finally got a picture of wile e coyote , did a cut and paste and put him in there i ll stand by my statement that there was not a whole lot of thought put into it 28  errol morris i guess the interpretation that i had put on it was just simply wrong or was different from what you intended it to be \? gopyouth it was intended to be a complete joke it is what would probably happen if iran launched four or five missiles towards israel more or less all hell would rain down on tehran from us now , the picture itself wile e coyote holding the umbrella clearly , the umbrella is not going to be sufficient to protect him from all of that you have to try to get into their mind of why they would do this people say they won t ever attack israel because they know they re going to get wiped off the face of the earth i think it s very hard in my opinion to have logical discussion with somebody who is already bent on destroying israel could we have gone and sat down with hitler or stalin or lenin or mao and said , hey , maybe you shouldn t kill 20 million people \? they would have told us to go pound sand and they re going to do it anyway errol morris one thing i can never understand is why wile e coyote keeps hiring the acme corporation they have failed him repeatedly it seems he should try a different vendor gopyouth i guess you could call it blind trust it will get you into trouble sometimes gopyouth insisted that it was a complete joke but still , joke or no joke , i was confused was it in criticism or in praise of our current foreign policy \? it all hinged on wile e coyote he is a metaphor but a metaphor for what \? plus , i was still very much interested in the slim pickensinspector clouseauahmadinejad image matthew gilbert \( gopyouth \) kindly offered to put me in touch with doug hutchinson \( colorado doug \) , the creator of the image colorado doug the initial motivation was to satirize iran s poor job of photoshopping it started earlier with the conflict in lebanon i don t recall the players , but the photoshopping that was going on at that time was being widely circulated by reuters my photoshopping on free republic started at that point , just satirizing their work errol morris their work was pretty bad colorado doug it was you made an excellent point in your article photography as a weapon , however , that this has been done for years , decades , maybe centuries , in one way or another errol morris well , people try to deceive other people it s part of human nature colorado doug it s propaganda that s always been there errol morris but this seemed like a particularly outrageous example of propaganda colorado doug on our side or their side \? errol morris on iran s side colorado doug okay i agree but desperation calls for outrageous attempts at propaganda and i think they are desperate with all the claims that have been coming from iran every week they had some new superduperdeluxe something or another that was better than anything the world had ever seen it was getting a little ludicrous the claims were so outrageous , constantly and then when they backed it up with a fake photoshop version of one of their claims , it had to be pounced on errol morris and there is your feeling that the major media just bought into it hook , line , and sinker colorado doug exactly that s my biggest frustration what really kind of got me going was that they didn t vet this stuff better if it fits their agenda ideologically , they re happy to just go ahead and run with it , regardless , even if it s an obvious fake at least that s the way it appeared to me we re all interested in truth in the media , or at least the closest thing we can get to truth that is kind of what started it , both frustration and just , i suppose , an opportunity to poke a little fun at iran , as well instead of many , many missiles , i substituted slim pickens on the hbomb and then that morphed into the peter sellers in the foreground , looking all blown up with what shisname s face errol morris ahmadinejad colorado doug thank you , replacing peter sellers errol morris now , why those two \? well , ahmadinejad , yes colorado doug peter sellers is a comic buffoon or at least plays a comic buffoon in his inspector clouseau character slim pickens was just a classic image with a large bomb that s why he got inserted errol morris i looked at the image with wile e coyote and the orange umbrella and i asked myself what is this image saying \? i assumed it was saying that wile e coyote is all of us  colorado doug yeah i think it was intended just more like , oh crap errol morris so , wile e coyote is supposed to be iran  colorado doug exactly exactly and by the same token , slim pickens is america willing to do something to stop iran  now , i think i ve got it straight wile e coyote iran slim pickens america the photoshopped images had been created by political conservatives gopyouth was gop youth and the images were ridiculing iran , and the very idea of iranian military power \? how dare they \? who do they think they are \? what do they think they re doing \? i mention this not because i was surprised at how gopyouth s political views influenced these images , but because i was surprised at how my own political views influenced how i interpreted them 29  in his post \( 114 \) to the times , gopyouth had asked me for an analysis of the slim pickensahmadinejadclouseau image here goes stanley kubrick in dr strangelove created a reductio ad absurdum for nuclear war in our efforts to guard against the possibility of nuclear war , we guarantee its inevitability slim pickens in the movie is an example of american nuclear insanity we take the ruskies out , but we destroy the world but wait just one second what is the benefit of nuclear war if it destroys everything that is , unless the desired end is the end of everything \? i have always supposed \( like kubrick \) that nuclear war is not a means to an end but a means to the end  it remains to be seen whether dr strangelove is a work of fiction or a prescient documentary reply to , the claim that i use the word confabulate but it should be conflate 116 august 27th , 2008 10 53 pm the article uses the word confabulate but it should be conflate confabulate means to converse informally or chat there is also a very specialized meaning in psychiatry , the replacement of a gap in a person s memory by a falsification that she or he believes to be true definition from the random house unabridged dictionary , 2nd edition posted by frances c i wrote , i was confused i had confabulated the experience of seeing something in a movie with real life supposedly , ronald reagan often made this mistake , but how can you really remember which experiences were firsthand , which were seen in a movie \? or appeared on television or in a magazine \? you are absolutely right i was confused i conflated conflate with confabulate shortly after , writing this essay , i had the opportunity to interview ron reagan for stand up 2 cancer , a special produced by laura ziskin for network television 30 i asked him about the worst political argument he had with his father he couldn t remember any specific political argument , but he told me a story about a television special they were watching when he was a little boy the special was on polar bears , and it included footage of the shooting of a polar bear ron reagan was upset how could they shoot a polar bear \? his father supposedly investigated and determined that the polar bear had not really been shot it had merely been anesthetized with a tranquilizer dart ron reagan was still upset it wasn t that he was upset that that polar bear had been shot he was upset that we live in a world where any polar bear can be shot was his father s answer a strategy that a grownup uses with kids in order to keep them quiet and to stop them from asking further questions \? don t worry it isn t as bad as you think it is and even if it is , you don t need to know about it had his father used a metaphorical tranquilizer dart on his son seemingly innocuous like the tranquilizer dart supposedly used by the filmmakers on the polar bear \? the dart that anesthetizes us to some unpleasant underlying reality trust me , the polar bears are doing just fine \( could this be the central metaphor of the reagan administration \? \) or is it possible that his father may have confabulated a story about what he and his son were watching or about polar bears in general or am i just horribly confused \? appendix to the reply to 112 i should leave well enough alone , but the issue of perfection \( or , if you prefer , the chimera of the perfectionists \) continues to haunt me evidently , magritte , too , was haunted by poe s dream of the perfect landscape 31  allow me to add one more character to the chimera of the perfectionists the evolutionary biologist gordon orians orians was studying how blackbirds choose where to live when he noticed that humans also select their habitat according to specific criteria , like the presence of water , large trees , open space , and distant views criteria evoking the savanna where humans evolved moreover , when orians asked test subjects to rate landscape paintings , they tended to prefer the ones that met those criteria a john constable landscape like dedham vale appeals to us , orians argued , at least partly because it gives the viewer clues to finding resources and avoiding danger looking at it is an unconscious exercise in habitat selection could i live here \? is it safe to explore \? should i turn and run \? 32  what is it about the constable painting that makes me extremely nervous \? this is the perfect landscape \? what are those three questions again could i live here \? is it safe to explore \? should i turn and run \? the answers are no why would you want to \? and yes it all comes down to trust , and i m not buying into it acknowledgments once again i would like to thank charles silver for many ideas and suggestions ann petrone and julie fischer provided extraordinary research dennis purcell offered his altered version \( of the already altered \) winter sunrise and of course , this essay could not be written without the various responders , in particular matthew gilbert \( gop youth \) and doug hutchinson \( colorado doug \) , who contributed to this discussion footnotes 1 julie fischer , one of my researchers , noted the difference between the two statements we trust his evidence versus we trust him so we trust the evidence he presents we do not just trust his testimony about the evidence , we re trusting what s presented because it s his evidence the change in the language from the evidence to his evidence is significant if it was powell talking about the evidence we might have to examine it ourselves or ask any number of questions , for example , how the evidence got to the un from the cia from satellites over iraq \? but when it s his evidence the history of those photos and documents , etc , begins and ends with colin powell further examination is moot 2 we take things on faith because we trust someone but is everything we believe based on trust and faith \? 3 note the poll addresses only the question whom do you trust \? not the more important question whom should you trust \? 4 ironically , it is often claimed that howell s letters are themselves inauthentic that is , it is claimed that the authenticity of the letters should not be taken on trust verona hirst in the mla , vol 54 , no 4 \( 558561 \) writes , as early as 1691 , anthony a wood aimed cold and faintly acid water at howell s letters many of the said letters were never written before the author of them pretends they were , only feigned \( no time being kept with their dates \) and purposely published to gain money to relieve his necessities and in a review \( 1893 \) by gw warner of an edition \( 1892 \) of howell s letters by joseph jacobs both jacobs and warner question howell s truthfulness and dependability warner in the english historical review , vol 8 , no 29 \( 156161 \) writes , the evidence of cooking , therefore , is incontestable the difficulty is defining its extent evidently , the evidence provided in the letters , also has to be taken on trust 5 i wonder if the 1 vs 3 equation still holds 6 it may be thought that we are too sophisticated to conflate a photograph with the thing that is photographed , but andre bazin , the french philosopher of film , has written , only a photographic lens can give us the kind of image of the object that is capable of satisfying the deep need man has to substitute for it something more than a mere approximation the photographic image is the object itself , the object freed from the conditions of time and space that govern it no matter how fuzzy , distorted , or discolored , no matter how lacking in documentary value the image may be , it shares , by virtue of the very process of its becoming , the being of the model of which it is the reproduction it is the model my emphasis andrew bazin ontology of the photograph \( 1967 \) in alan trachtenberg \( ed \) classic essays on photography new haven , cn lee s island books , 237245 7 i assume that iris is referring to bigfoot and not to something with a big foot , named big foot 8 salomon and his ermanox are discussed in cartesian blogging , part one 9 it is interesting that ansel adams makes no attempt to hide the fact that winter sunrise had been altered he reveals that the photograph was altered and then provides the reasons why the image reproduced here with the letters l p hidden is from adams , examples the making of 40 photographs 10 in february 1982 , national geographic put a manipulated photo on its cover of the pyramids of giza after its discovery , tom kennedy , who later became the director of photography \( 19871997 \) stated , we no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect we regarded that afterwards as a mistake , and we wouldn t repeat that mistake today , personal interview with carla hotvedt , march 22 , 1990 , as reprinted in photojournalism an ethical approach , by paul martin lester , 1999 1 but exactly what constitutes fakery \? adams never tried to deceive people about the l p he openly admits to the alteration he writes about it and yet , the photograph , for example , could give a misleading impression it could have been introduced as evidence in a trial to determine whether the landscape around lone pine had been defaced by a group of local vandals the presence of the l p would then provide evidence of vandalism , and its removal from the print or the negative would be an attempt to cover up a crime don t we need to know how the photograph is going to be used \? what questions are going to be asked about it \? and how can we ever know \? one photograph can be used towards many different ends 12 now that the original negative has been irrevocably altered , there can be no more chemical prints with the l p retouched or unretouched do some uncorrected prints still exist with the l p , and if so , could they be incredibly valuable , a rarity like the inverted jenny , the most valuable of all postage stamps \? i don t think so value , here , is not just based on rarity the inverted jenny was a printing error an inadvertence on the other hand , winter sunrise was altered under the supervision of the artist 13 the image with the l p was scanned from an ansel adams calendar and was processed in photoshop by dennis purcell another somewhat unsuccessful attempt to cover the l p can be seen in a version printed in american earth the second image is a photoshop entropyfunction transform based on that image 14 ansel adams and the lone pine photograph , from the blog focus on photography 15 there is this idea that rules will save us if we impose rules on how photographs are taken and how they are printed , then we can trust them hogwash it s like whackamole you solve one problem and another pops up you create a rule against photoshop manipulation , and then it turns out the scene is staged to create a misleading impression but what if the scene been staged unwittingly , and the photographer isn t even aware of that he or someone else has staged it \? or the caption is misleading \? or we look at the photograph incorrectly \? we think it s one thing and it really is something else altogether is it a rabbit or a duck \? photographs taken with or without rules cannot provide a solution to the question of whether we should trust them rules provide no guarantee 16 it first appeared in 1842 as the landscape garden , and then with minor changes as the domain of arnheim in 1847 17 the narrator is presumably referring to the paintings of claude lorrain is ellison s dream landscape a realization of lorrain or a prefiguration of , say , disneyland \? 18 the firstperson in poe is always interesting but who is this person \? poe or someone else \? 19 does this go beyond poe s intentions \? namely , is this an expression of poe s idea that point of view changes our very idea of perfection , as well as what we perceive \? 20 in an essay , photography as a weapon , i wrote about hyperbolic contrarians poe was in all likelihood one of them in the black cat , he writes about the spirit of perverseness the capitalization is his i am not more sure that my soul lives , than i am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart one of the indivisible primary faculties , or sentiments , which give direction to the character of man who has not , a hundred times , found himself committing a vile or a silly action , for no other reason than because he knows he should not \? in poe s last story , the lighthouse , he provides a clue as to how perverse he might really be set up a story in excruciating detail , and then totally undermine it the story is unfinished it consists of four handwritten pages the handwriting is meticulous indeed , beautiful often punctuated by extended ellipses and the last sentence undermines all that has preceded it page 4 in it during the fiercest hurricane that ever raged and yet i have heard seamen say occasionally , with a wind at southwest , the sea has been known to run higher here than any where with the single exception of the western opening of the straits of magellan no mere sea , though , could accomplish anything with this solid ironriveted wall which , at 50 feet from highwater mark , is four feet thick , if one inch the basis on which the structure rests seems to me to be chalk poe makes every effort to inform the reader the lighthouse is battered by the most ferocious waves the sea has been known to run higher here than anywhere yet it is impregnable nothing could possibly damage it no mere sea , though , could accomplish anything with this sold ironrusted wall and then the last sentence the basis on which the structure rests seems to me to be chalk chalk \? and the very , very end a simple , stark date with a line drawn under it is the story unfinished \? or is that the real end the extended ellipses \? the story is heading off to nowhere could there be a more fitting epitaph metaphor for a writing career \? particularly the career of poe \? the belknap press edition of the poe s work includes photographs of the manuscript itself it is in the houghton library at harvard well , part of it is one leaf page 1 and the reverse which is page 2 is at the new york public library , the rest is at harvard , including the page reproduced below not only was the lighthouse far from impregnable , but the manuscript was divided up and the chalk \? is it a metaphor for the foundations of knowledge , of life , of everything \? does everything rest on trust the chalk of human existence \? 21 i loved both the story and the painting independently for years , i never connected the two , even though they have the same name , until one day i was visiting a magritte exhibition at the la county museum , looking at the magritte , and the poe story suddenly leapt to mind 22 magritte also used the granite eagle on the mountain ridge in others works , that is , images not named the domain of arnheim this image title pairing is first seen in 1938 , though there are two from that year and it s not certain which one was the first version the image of the mountain shaped like an eagle predates the domain of arnheim images , first appearing in le precurseur \( 1936 \) the catalogue raisonn says , the mountain may well have been based upon the upper twothirds of a color reproduction of a photograph found among magritte s papers , something he certainly handled , as it bears a drawing by him on the verso the domain of arnheim series 1938 le domaine d arnheim , gouache on paper 30 x 38 whereabouts unknown 1938 le domaine d arnheim , oil on canvas 1944 le domaine d arnheim , gouache on paper 33 x 46 caroline pigozzi 1947 le domaine d arnheim , gouache on paper 371 x 462 private collection , uk 1948 le domaine d arnheim , gouache on paper 34 x 36 private collection 1949 le domaine d arnheim , oil on canvas 100 x 81 private collection 1962 le domaine d arnheim , oil on canvas 146 x 114 mus es royaux des beauxarts de belgique , brussels 1962 le domaine d arnheim , gouache on paper 35 x 27 private collection 1962 le domaine d arnheim , gouache on paper , 25 x 192 eleanor cramer hodes the series has a mr potatoheadlike quality , as if we dial up a series of elements and then combine and recombine them endlessly the granite eagle the eggs the wall 23 magritte preferred \( again , like poe \) to undermine his own images or at least to provide an ironic commentary on them consider this selfportrait , a photograph that he took of himself posed with brush and easel in front of one of his paintings a painting of himself working with a brush and easel but it is not a painting of magritte working on a painting magritte is in the painting painting part of the image is he thinking about the woman or the painting or both \? 24 ann petrone , my longstanding researcher , had been given the onerous task of tracking down all the versions of magritte s the domain of arnheim recently , she suggested that perhaps magritte , growing tired of his granite eagle , threw an egg at the window in a failed attempt to rid himself of it 25 heartfield s photomontage challenged the idea that another world war would benefit anybody his intentions so that there was little doubt were reflected in the extensive commentary that accompanied many of the pictures of course , the commentary is very similar to a caption it can interpret the image for us 26 adnan hajj et al are references to fauxtography incidents preceding the iranian missile fauxtograph these are references to other posts by charles johnson on little green footballs i plan to discuss them in a forthcoming essay for the times 27 www freerepublic com 28 of course , there is the very real possibility that the iranian news agency \( sepah \) that released the fauxtograph didn t put very much thought into it either 29 we interpret things differently the problem of the meaning of wile e coyote recalls poe s earthangels , who have different ideas about the perfect landscape they see things differently , and \( as i do \) may prefer the unretouched ansel adams photograph to the real ansel adams photograph maybe they like the l p 30 ron reagan is sometimes referred to as ronald reagan , jr , but that is not his name his father is ronald wilson reagan and his son is ronald prescott reagan he and his father have different middle names , and he prefers to be called ron reagan 31 or magritte was haunted by his own dream of poe s dream 32 this account was provided by richard conniff in discover , beauty is not just in the eye of the beholder , it s embedded in our genes

in a statement released today , senator hillary rodham clinton s campaign announced that yes , she would be attending the irish american presidential forum this year the what \? the irish american presidential forum was first organized by a bronx lawyer and democratic assemblyman named john c dearie in 1980 as a way to encourage american presidential candidates to talk about the fragile peace process in northern ireland according to the irish echo , a weekly newspaper published in the united states and aimed at irish americans , the forum has been held in every election year except 2004 past attendees include al gore \( 1988 , 1996 , 2000 \) , michael dukakis \( 1988 \) , jerry brown \( 1992 \) and bill clinton \( 1992 \) given the hectic campaign schedule this year , the organizers are not expecting to get all the candidates in the same room at the same time a spokesman for senator barack obama , mrs clinton s democratic rival , said the campaign was not sure of the schedule we re offering a flexible forum schedule , mr dearie told the irish echo senator clinton , in a statement , said that she was excited to participate in this important forum i have worked on issues important to the irishamerican community for many years and look forward to discussing my plans as president senator clinton went on to encourage senator obama and senator mccain to accept the invitation to the forum as well it was not the first time that irish issues had emerged tuesday on the campaign trail \( yes , st patrick s day is coming up \) earlier in the day , the campaigns had sparred over northern ireland specifically , mrs clinton s claims that she had aided the peace process , part of a broader argument she has been making that she is more experienced than mr obama but the obama campaign was having none of it it circulated a memo from greg craig , a former adviser in president clinton s administration , refuting many of mrs clinton s claims about her involvement in rwanda , kosovo , china and northern ireland in one of the sharper references , the memo quotes brian feeney , an irish author and former politician , on mrs clinton s role in the northern ireland peace process , saying the road to peace was carefully documented , and she wasn t on it meanwhile , senator john mccain , who is the presumptive republican nominee , was also invited by mrs clinton to join in the forum , but his campaign did not respond to inquiries about his attendance

norman , okla he arrived here for what seemed like it could be a big moment mayor , eyeing a thirdparty presidential bid , joined republican and democratic elders at a forum to denounce the extreme partisanship of washington and plot how to influence the campaign but even as the mayor gathered on monday with the seasoned washington hands on the campus of the university of oklahoma , the surging presidential campaign of senator seemed to steal energy from the event and set off worry elsewhere among mr bloomberg s supporters mr obama has stressed that he wants to move beyond gridlocked politics and usher in an era of national unity a key organizer of the effort to draft mr bloomberg for a presidential run acknowledged in an interview on monday that that mr obama s rise could be problematic obama is trying to reach out to independent voters , and that clearly would be the constituency that mike bloomberg would go after , said andrew macrae , who heads the washington chapter of an obama victory does not make it impossible , but it certainly makes it more difficult the event was organized by former senator sam nunn , democrat of georgia , with former senator david l boren , democrat of oklahoma in the days leading up the event here , just outside oklahoma city , mr boren suggested that he would encourage mr bloomberg to run if the major party nominees failed to heed the call for bipartisanship but several leading participants took pains to say that they had no intention of abandoning their own parties in the election some even cast mr obama s success as evidence that the nation was yearning for the type of leadership they were offering i believe he is demonstrating , in the support he is getting , that the american people share this concern about excessive partisanship , said bob graham , a democratic former senator from florida , who said he would support a democrat for president gary hart , a democrat from colorado who also served in the senate , said he intended to endorse one of the democratic presidential candidates in the next 48 hours , though he declined to identify the candidate i am a democrat , and i will endorse a democratic president , he said there are no independent candidates i wo n't endorse a republican the forum attracted students , faculty members and some who said they were intrigued by a third party approach still , they were also taking notice of the momentum mr obama has been gaining since his victory in the iowa caucuses last week i wonder about all this , said tobi padwick , 36 , who drove to the event from texas mr padwick said he believed the eventual nominees would be mr obama and senator john mccain , and that sort of steals a lot of thunder , since they 're the two more moderate candidates despite public denials that he plans to run , aides close to mr bloomberg have been laying the groundwork for a candidacy , should he declare one mr bloomberg kept a low profile at the forum in response to a question during the panel discussion about the iowa caucuses , mr bloomberg did not talk about mr obama or the republican winner , mike huckabee , the former governor of arkansas , but said that perhaps the discussion the group was looking for had already begun i hope that all the candidates say to themselves that the public is tired of the partisanship and the special interests , and if i'm going to get elected , i 've got to stand up and say what i believe , face the big issues , hold myself accountable , and maybe you are seeing that as he usually has in recent weeks , mr bloomberg played down the notion that he would be a candidate himself , saying during the forum that the goal he shared with others at the conference was to be a catalyst for a discussion of the nation s problems but even mr bloomberg s effort to influence the debate in the presidential campaign has hit challenges the mayor recently paid out of his own pocket for ads in iowa and new hampshire newspapers demanding , on behalf of mayors concerned about gun violence , that candidates complete a questionnaire detailing their positions on gun issues the candidates were given until jan 2 to respond , but none of the campaigns complied , and mr bloomberg and his colleagues have now pushed back the deadline people close to the mayor say that he will probably decide in march whether he will run , assuming that democrats and republicans have settled on their presumptive nominees his aides have been researching the cumbersome process for starting an independent campaign , and a crucial date is march 5 , when thirdparty candidates can begin circulating petitions to get a spot on the ballot in texas mr bloomberg would have to decide , among other things , whether there was an opening for a selfstyled progressive centrist like him aides have said that he would be prepared to spend 1 billion other participants at the forum included john danforth , a republican former senator from missouri senator chuck hagel , republican from nebraska william cohen , former secretary of defense and christie whitman , former governor of new jersey and a republican like other participants , mrs whitman has been seeking to distance herself from any thirdparty bid by mr bloomberg in a recent blog post on the web site of the republican leadership council , a centrist group of which she is cochairwoman , mrs whitman wrote , while other attendees may assert their personal interest in a third party , i am a republican and will remain one asked monday whether she would support an independent presidential bid by mr bloomberg or anyone else , mrs whitman echoed those comments , saying , i'm focused on the republican leadership council

tattoo you to the editor never have i finished an outright rave and a frontpage one at that less convinced of a novel s merits than i was at the end of liesl schillinger s review of charles bock s beautiful children \( feb 3 \) it is only the latest example in a worrisome trend of slathering praise upon the prose of a certain genus of writer marisha pessl comes to mind who operates in a constant , hysterical pitch , at the expense of precision , lucidity and memorable elegance schillinger approvingly quotes a sentence of bock s electricity lit up ponyboy s skeletal structure as if it were a pinball machine on a multiball extravaganza , and the mingling odors of brimstone and sulfur and sweat and burning skin filled ponyboy s nostrils this describes , we are told , the administration of ponyboy s newest tattoo it is easy to see why , in the current literary climate , this sentence attracts admiration it loudly conflates the human body and the book s setting , las vegas it declares the obsolescence of the comma as it pounds out a list of nouns its zeal for gaudy metaphor nearly splits it at the seams and it turns up the biblical volume with the sinister brimstone but the sentence suffers from several conspicuous flaws for one , it lurks at the edge of tenability when it describes the electricity illuminating ponyboy s skeletal structure it then attempts to shoehorn in the metaphor of a pinball machine , whose vividness further divorces the sentence s central idea from a credible reality , and then finally , in order , i imagine , to deploy four nouns rather than three , it falls irritatingly into redundancy brimstone and sulfur , as a quick trip to the dictionary will confirm , are synonyms this is only one sentence of many \( bock s novel clocks in at 417 pages \) but it is telling that schillinger chooses to cite it her admiration for this particular species of sentence is symptomatic of what american critics have lately been letting pass as good prose , just as her admiration for the novel as a whole represents a troubling tendency to confuse page count with ambition and rambling , undercooked writing with originality a day after reading that sentence , and many others that have been similarly praised in recent years , one is left not with a cogent , gripping image , but only the residual odor of sulfur and brimstone , and a wish for more writing that , like ian mcewan s , lodges firmly , even painfully in the mind it is difficult to forget a sentence like this , from atonement the world , the social world , was unbearably complicated , with two billion voices , and everyone s thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone s claim on life as intense , and everyone thinking they were unique , when no one

riverton , wyo at 69 , her eyes soft and creased with age , alvena oldman remembers how the teachers at st stephens boarding school on the wind river reservation would strike students with rulers if they dared to talk in their native arapaho language we were afraid to speak it , she said we knew we would be punished more than a halfcentury later , only about 200 arapaho speakers are still alive , and tribal leaders at wind river , wyoming s only indian reservation , fear their language will not survive as part of an intensifying effort to save that language , this tribe of 8 , 791 , known as the northern arapaho , recently opened a new school where students will be taught in arapaho elders and educators say they hope it will create a new generation of native speakers this is a race against the clock , and we 're in the 59th minute of the last hour , said a national indian education association board member , ryan wilson , whom the tribe hired as a consultant to help get the school off the ground like other tribes , the northern arapaho have suffered from the legacy of indian boarding institutions , established by the federal government in the late 1800s to americanize native american children it was at such schools that teachers instilled the kill the indian , save the man philosophy , young boys had their traditional braids shorn , and students were forbidden to speak tribal languages the discipline of those days was drummed into an entire generation of northern arapaho , and most tribal members never passed down the language of all the remaining fluent speakers , none are younger than 55 that is what tribal leaders hope to change about 22 children from prekindergarten through first grade started classes at the school a rectangular onestory structure with a fresh coat of white paint and the words hinono' eitiino' oowu' \( translation arapaho language lodge \) written across its siding here , set against an endless stretch of windswept plains and tufts of cottonwoods , instructors are using a curriculum based on one used at the wyoming indian elementary school to teach students exclusively in arapaho all costs related to the school , which has an operating budget of 340 , 000 a year , are paid for by the tribe and private donors administrators plan to add a grade each year until it comprises prekindergarten through 12thgrade classes this environment is a complete reversal of what occurs too often in schools , where a child is ridiculed or reprimanded for speaking one s heritage language , said in e y slaughter , executive director of the indigenous language institute , a group in santa fe , nm , that works with tribes on native languages i want my son to talk nothing but arapaho to me and my grandparents , said kayla howling buffalo , who enrolled her 4yearold son , rylee , in the school ms howling buffalo , 25 , said she , too , had been inspired to take arapaho classes because her grandmother no longer has anyone to speak with and fears she is losing her first language such sentiments are not uncommon on the reservation and have become more pronounced in the five years since helen cedar tree , at 96 the oldest living northern arapaho , made an impassioned plea to the tribe s council of elders she said look at all of you guys talking english , and you know your own language it s like the white man has conquered us , ' said gerald redman sr , the chairman of the council of elders it was a wakeup call a group of arapaho families had sent their children to a prekindergarten language program for years , but it was not enough heeding ms cedar tree s words , the tribe began using arapaho dictionaries , night classes , cds made by the tribe , and anything they could find to help resuscitate the language in the end , we knew in our hearts that immersion was the only way we were going to turn this around , said mr wilson , a member of the oglala lakota tribe he was referring not just to the potential for the arapaho language s extinction but to a host of other problems that have long plagued the vast reservation , which the tribe shares with the eastern shoshone languageimmersion schools offer an environment that goes beyond teaching the language , ms slaughter said it provides a safe place where a child s roots are nurtured , its culture honored , and its being valued according to tribal statistics and the united states attorney s office in wyoming , 78 percent of household heads on the reservation are unemployed , the student dropout rate is 52 percent and crime has been rising most recently , in june , three teenage girls were found dead in a lowincome housing complex the fbi has not yet released autopsy results , but many tribal members think drugs or alcohol were involved the deaths left the reservation reeling officials here hope that the school will herald a positive change , just as programs elsewhere have helped native youth become conversational in their tribal languages , enhancing cultural pride and participation in the process a groundswell of language revitalization efforts has led to successful indian immersion schools in montana and new york studies show that language fluency among young indians is tied to overall academic achievement , and experts say such learning can have other positive effects language seems to be a healing force for native american communities , said ellen lutz , executive director of cultural survival , a group based in cambridge , mass , that is working with the northern arapaho at a recent ceremony to celebrate the school s opening , held in an old tribal meeting hall , three young girls sang shyly in arapaho behind them , a row of elders sat quietly , their faces wizened and stoic , legs shuffling rhythmically as familiar words carried through the building they are the ones who whispered it on the playground when nobody was looking , mr wilson said , referring to the elders if we lose that language , we lose who we are

the threats started about a year ago , telling haroon bacha to stop singing or else there were letters , there were phone calls , there were , mr bacha said , sitting upright on a floor in brooklyn , surrounded by smoke from pakistani cigarettes they used to come very frequently back home , just telling me to stop music , or else i would be killed and my family would be he trailed off , tears welling in his eyes mr bacha , 36 , is a pashtun , the muslim ethnic group of the mountainous northwest of and southeast afghanistan , and at home he is a star , with dozens of albums , slick videos and regular television appearances in a sweet high baritone , he sings of peace , tolerance and resistance to war those liberal themes have endeared him to his warweary pashtun fans , he says , but made him a target of the local , which has been waging an escalating campaign against music and popular culture , calling it unislamic two months ago mr bacha escaped from his home near peshawar , in pakistan , and came to new york , leaving behind his wife , two young children and an extended family if he goes back , he said , he will be killed with a sharply reduced audience in the united states , mr bacha faces an uncertain career , but on saturday he sang at a small but lively benefit concert in queens , organized by the pashtun immigrants who have adopted him and held at an unlikely place the forest hills jewish center anybody who is hated by the taliban is starting out with a check in my column , said rabbi gerald c skolnik , the leader of the center , a conservative synagogue rabbi skolnik said that an initial phone call from one of the organizers had raised a red flag , but that after the groups were vetted to make sure none of the money raised would go to terrorist groups , he was happy to rent the space in the northwest frontier province of pakistan , the taliban has intimidated musicians and record store proprietors recently dozens of music shops have been bombed , reportedly by protaliban militants cultural activities are badly affected by what s going on in the region , said hasan khan , news director of the islamabadbased television channel khyber news , in a recent phone interview we have lost everything we have lost music , we have lost local games , we have lost children playing in the street it is almost impossible to visualize what is happening there the softspoken mr bacha , who has striking green eyes and short brown curls , is a slightly unusual figure as a pashtun star he has a university education and , unlike most pashtun singers , he does not come from a family of musicians he said he saw his role as helping to lead a broad cultural resistance to islamic fundamentalism these people are bringing pashtuns a very bad name , said mr bacha , at one of the apartments in brooklyn where he has been a guest the reason i did n't succumb to these threats is that i should work for my people , for pashto as a language and rich tradition i need to promote it and show to the world that we are not like these people before the concert , held in the jewish center s mirrorlined basement ballroom , mr bacha led evening prayers , facing mecca in the small lobby and once the audience of 300 or so had taken its seats the event was far from sold out mr bacha began performing , accompanied by two musicians and pumping a harmonium as he sang in the first songs of the night he declared his love for the pashtuns' land and traditional lifestyle our mud houses are like palaces to us but soon his lyrics , which are drawn from old and new pashto poetry , turned to topical struggles this is not my gun this is not our war , he sang , they are bringing it to us the small crowd roared and clapped along , as men danced and threw money on the stage , in a sign of praise and approval we are a peaceloving nation , said reyaz nadi , 44 , a long island architect originally from kabul , the afghan capital unfortunately there s always a war from the outside , going back to alexander the great america is only the latest one there is a historical precedent for the taliban s cultural clampdown after taking power in afghanistan in the 1990s , it banned public performances of most forms of music some religious chants were permitted and symbolically hanged musical instruments in effigy many musicians went into exile in pakistan , but since the american invasion of afghanistan and establishment of a new government there , most have returned , said john baily , an ethnomusicologist and afghanistan specialist at goldsmiths , university of london professor baily said it was not clear whether the same pattern was unfolding in pakistan this is a very musical country with a huge range of different music , he said it s not that easy just to ban music but they 're doing what they can mr bacha said he was not hopeful about his homeland s future if it continues like this , and these fanatics get power , our social fabric , our institutions everything will be destroyed , he said i do n't know what these elements want to have in their lives , what their world would be like in the way of many musicians who come to new york who were accustomed to be big fish in smaller musical ponds , mr bacha is adjusting to diminished prospects last week in new jersey , for example , he played a wedding , something that his associates say he would never have done back home on saturday he will play at st michael s rectory in bedford , mass , and on oct 24 he will perform again in new york , at the adria hotel in bayside , queens wherever i

it is a bit extreme to say the nhl in a court filing on thursday is trying to throw the rangers out of the league what the league wants to do is reaffirm its right to throw the rangers out of the league this is the latest turn in a lawsuit filed by madison square garden last fall , alleging the nhl violated antitrust laws by incorporating all 30 team web sites under league control the garden failed to secure an injunction and seems to be in shaky territory because a \) every other professional league operates their web sites collectively and b \) nhl owners voted overwhelmingly to approve the idea but the garden wanted its day in court and now the pushback from the nhl came on thursday the nhl filed a countersuit , claiming that the garden s lawsuit violates the league constitution and it should be able to discipline the team under the rules of that constitution that means , with a threequarters vote of team owners , the league can fine the franchise , suspend its membership or force the owners to sell the team the odds of things coming to that are slim to none more likely , the league wants to flex its muscles and keep the dolan family from throwing legal fits in the future a league struggling to regain its place on the majorsports map is not going to yank the franchise of an original six team , not to mention one in the largest city in the country with one of its most loyal fan bases but that does not mean the two sides are not willing to drag each other through the mud so consider thursday s events one big mud puddle
the 145 billion economic stimulus package that president bush is encouraging congress to pass , with its tax refunds for individuals and tax cuts for business investments , may help relieve some of the symptoms of the country s current financial trouble , but it does not address the most important economic problem we face the health of the american and indeed the global economy depends on having a financial system that is able to extend credit to businesses and consumers the losses that have been incurred as a result of the excesses in subprime mortgage lending will take years to work their way through the worldwide financial system , as dozens of banks act to replenish their lost capital by issuing more common stock in the public markets and trading other equity securities to sovereign wealth funds until the banks rebuild their capital , they will not have the wherewithal to lend money and support economic growth if banks of all sizes could regain their capital immediately and easily , it would be a tremendous benefit to the american economy the federal government could make this happen by entering into an arrangement with american banks that hold subprime mortgages , in which homeowners typically pay a low interest rate for two or three years then face much higher payments here s how it would work the government would guarantee the principal of the mortgages for 15 years and in exchange the banks would agree to leave their teaser interest rates on those loans in effect for the entire 15 years this would instantly give the lending banks new capital as these mortgages would be guaranteed by the treasury , they would suddenly be assessed , on bank balance sheets , at their original value and a significant amount of the banks' lost capital would be restored plus , the banks would receive , from most of the homeowners with subprime mortgages , up to 15 years of teaserrate payments by solving the bank capital crisis immediately , this strategy would ensure that fewer families would lose their homes , that fewer neighborhoods would deteriorate because of abandoned housing and that , as a consequence , there would be less downward pressure on local real estate prices and property tax revenues also important would be the impact on consumer confidence just as rising real estate prices had a positive effect on american consumers , declining real estate prices continue to undermine their confidence anything that helps slow the price decline by reducing the supply of housing for sale will be good for our economy under this arrangement , american banks would have an incentive to buy back the subprime debt now being held by foreign banks and other financial institutions american banks could buy the securities at a discount to face value \( reflecting the continued low teaser rates \) and then , thanks to the government guarantee , hold them as capital assessed at their full value that , in turn , would allow the other financial institutions to reinvest in other sectors of our economy i propose this idea not because it would benefit our bank we own none of this troubled debt and , in recent years , have had insignificant losses from real estate lending but only out of concern for the health of the global financial system this plan is a way to use our nation s strength , and not current tax dollars , to keep people in their homes and give banks the ability to resume lending it requires only that we believe in the future of the american economy and the value of american homes 15 years from now i do , and this is a belief our government should share
